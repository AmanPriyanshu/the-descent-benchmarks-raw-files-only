[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello, and welcome to this evening's episode of Critical Role! We'll be with you in just a second. Unfortunately we're down a Travis Willingham tonight, but in Grog's stead we have the rest of the party venturing forth into the Emberhold after just recently discovering Lady Kima. We shall see what happens very shortly, but in the meantime, let's go ahead and give you guys some character backstory. [dramatic music]
Ashley: Pike grew up on the outskirts of town, near the Bramblewood. Her ancestors were a family of deep gnomes with quite an unfavorable reputation. Thievery, destruction, and trickery left them with the curse of the last name Trickfoot. Sarenrae, the goddess of healing and redemption, had other plans for Pike's great-great-grandfather Wilhand, who left his family at a young age after a dream, a dream that changed the course of the Trickfoot family. Wilhand devoted his life to Sarenrae, and pledged from then on that him and his family would live a life of service and devotion. As a child, Pike seemed to have an affinity to heal. Whether it was animals, people, or even flowers, she felt she had a purpose in making things whole that had once been broken. She studied and learned the ways to heal through divine magic. She lived a peaceful life, quiet and simple, until one day Wilhand was captured and almost killed by a group of goliath barbarians. One of the goliaths took a stand against the murder of the innocent gnome, and he himself was beaten, bloodied, and left for dead, abandoned by his herd. Wilhand went to Pike for help. She prayed and healed this barbarian as best she could, bringing him back to life. When he awoke, she discovered his name was Grog Strongjaw. After that, they were the best of friends, a rather unlikely pair. Little did she know that in a few years' time Grog would soon return the favor and bring her back from the clutches of death. (roaring, crunch) After being killed in battle, Pike felt angry. She wanted to be stronger so that it would never happen again. She spent four months at sea, training with the men and women aboard a ship called the Broken Howl. Gripping her holy symbol in one hand, and her morningstar in the other, this time, Pike is ready.
Travis: Right, listen up! If you have ale, then you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw. A goliath of towering height and size, this barbarian has an appetite for the two great loves in his life: combat, women, and ale. Wait... Easily the brains of the group, Grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes, colors, and shiny things. Also ale. In his early years, armed with his two-handed great axe, Grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst the ranks of his family's wandering herd. But after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly gnome in the woods, he objected to the killing of such an innocent life. A creature of impulse, Grog felt only pity for this terrified little thing. His disobedience cost him dearly. Beaten bloody and banished by the herd leader, his uncle Kevdak, Grog was abandoned and left to die. Exiled from his herd, it was then that the relative of the very gnome he fought to save, saved him. It was the kindness of a gnome cleric named Pike that healed Grog, bringing him back from death's edge. And they have remained close friends ever since. Most nights, Grog can be found challenging entire taverns to wrestling matches! Or accompanying Scanlan to the nearest house where you pay for lady favors. Also ale.
Marisha: A first impression of Keyleth would leave you with little information on the half-elven druid. You might even think that her social awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is kind of sweet. Of course, it would be unwise to underestimate her based on first impressions. Under that unintimidating petite frame is a vicious beast waiting to be unleashed, whose natural powers have made even the fiercest of champions pee their pants. Literally. (laughs) Born to the Air tribe of the Ashari people, Keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and the elemental magics. It is her people's inherent duty to protect the delicate areas in Tal'Dorei, where the four elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm. Since she was a little girl, she had quite a knack for air manipulation and beast-shaping abilities. Well, if you consider kittens and flying squirrels to be little beasts. Which, I do. Anyways, it wasn't long before the headmaster of the tribe, her father, Korren, realized her true prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster. Just like that, her jovial childhood was stripped and replaced with endless spell memorization, teachings from ancient traditions, and exceedingly high expectations. Every druid leader to be must embark on a journey to seek out the sister tribes in order to introduce and establish respect amongst the fellow headmasters. They call this the Aramente, or Noble Odyssey. When her father felt she was ready, he set her on the path to truly discovering herself, not knowing when, or if she will ever return. As she hiked down the mountain towards Stillben, she meditated on the task ahead. Part of the Aramente is proving yourself a strong warrior, a valiant protector, and a wise and compassionate leader. With this knowledge, one thought plays in repeat in her mind: is she even worthy?
Taliesin: Percy was the third of seven children, born to a noble family who lived far to the north, in the ancient castle of Whitestone. With so many siblings to share the burdens of lordship, Percy turned his attentions to the sciences, engineering and naturalism. One day, a mysterious couple, named Lord and Lady Briarwood, came to court. During a feast held in their honor, the Briarwoods violently took control of the castle, killing or imprisoning everyone who would stand in their way. Percy awoke chained in the dungeon, only to be freed by his younger sister. Together they fled, chased by the Briarwoods' men. As they ran, Percy's sister took several arrows to the chest and fell. Percy kept running, eventually jumping into a freezing river and floating unconscious to freedom. He did not remember waking up on a fishing boat. He barely remembered the next two years, as he slowly made his way as far south as possible. Then, one night, Percy had a dream. A roaring cloud of smoke offered him vengeance against those who destroyed his family. When he awoke, Percy began to design his first gun. (gunshot)
Sam: Oh, you haven't heard of Scanlan Shorthalt? Well, gird your loins, ladies, because he has his eye on you. A talented musician, master of disguise, and dashingly handsome in his own mind, Scanlan sings songs almost as much as he sings his own praises. Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used his endless charm and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and support his single mother. One day he was discovered by a half-orc promoter, and joined Dr. Dranzel's Spectacular Traveling Troupe where he learned the ways of the world, and honed his skills as a bard extraordinaire. A loner much of his life, Scanlan has never quite come to terms with the violent death of his mother at the hands of a goblin invasion. While his years on the road provided many, shall we say, educational experiences with the opposite sex, deep down Scanlan yearns for the one thing he's never known: the true love of a fellow gnome. Still, Scanlan considers himself a lover first, performer second, and fighter distant third. On the battlefield, he'll support his allies, but rarely draws blood unless it's to protect fellow gnome, Pike. Count on Scanlan for a hearty laugh, a rollicking song, and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts and makes the females swoon.
Orion: Greetings and salutations. I am Tiberius Stormwind. I hail from a town called Ty'rex, located in the heart of Draconia, born from a politically respected family. At the age of 15, I succeeded in passing the Sorcerer's Rite, showing prodigy-like control of my magic. The judges and the Draconian High Council were amazed at how powerful my spells were for how long I had been training. At 20 years old, I was the youngest appointed member of the Magic Guild in Draconian history. For the next few years, I almost went mad from the malaise of being a guild member, as it's rather boring. However, one day I happened upon a chamber, unused for quite some time. In the room were stacks of books and maps of the surrounding cities and areas around the known world. For months I would frequent the chamber, and learned of artifacts from legend. After a long period of research, I made a list of artifacts that caught my eye. I brought these findings to the high council and was told that all of the information in the chamber I had stumbled upon was either believed to be fiction, or unsolvable mysteries, and hence were lost forever. I found those answers to be unacceptable. A year later I devised a ruse and managed to convince the city council to lend support in me leaving Draconia on a mission of peace and diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms, going from town to town and making friends and allies, in and for the name of Draconia. Being a red dragonborn, I had quite the task on my hands in that respect, but it was exactly what I needed, so I could explore the world and find these artifacts, as I felt the truth was out there. Some may describe me as buffoonish, but I say poppycock to all that. I am much sharper than most give me credit for. I just don't pay attention to things sometimes. I've also been known to be rather cunning, loyal, happy-go-lucky, and well, dangerous. I can't help but show my true scales every now and then. But overall, I think I'm quite friendly for a dragonborn.
Liam: Never entirely welcome in the company of elves or men, Vax'ildan learned at a young age to skip past formality, preferring instead to invite himself in your door. Along with twin sister Vex'ahlia, Vax was born by a chance encounter between elven royalty and human peasantry. Raised by their mother in their early years, the twins were eventually sent off to their father in the elven capital of Syngorn, but their cool reception among the elves there never warmed, and their time in the capital didn't last. The siblings stole away one autumn night and set out on the open road. After a few years of wandering, they eventually decided to return to their mother, and journeyed back to the lands of their youth. But instead of finding their childhood home, they returned to a pile of rubble. Their mother was gone, their home burned to ash. Pressing the townspeople for answers, they learned of the day the dragon came. With their ties all severed, Vax'ildan and his sister set out to find their fortune together in Tal'Dorei. An outsider since birth, Vax quickly learned to solve life's challenges in his own particular way, often by sidestepping them entirely. And when his knack for circumventing adversity isn't enough, the way of blades the elves schooled him in more than makes up the difference.
Laura: Like so many half-elves, Vex'ahlia has spent most of her life suffering the cool reception of a people who don't fully accept her. Born of a human mother and an elven father who only later in life took an interest in their existence, Vex'ahlia and her twin brother Vax'ildan quickly realized the only people they could truly rely on in this world were each other. It was at the age of ten when the two were taken from their mother, and brought to live in Syngorn, the isolated elven city for which their father was an ambassador. He quietly took them in, but always kept an icy distance, and after too many years of disdainful looks, the pair decided to leave his indifference behind, and set out on their own. Vax took to the cities, stealing small trinkets and learning the ways of the thief, while Vex kept to the woods. She preferred the isolation. Always the keen observer, she learned to hunt and to track, to spy and to shoot. And through a series of fateful events, earned herself a companion in the form of a bear, her own stolen Trinket, to fight alongside her and protect her fiercely. Also, he is adorable, and gives expert massages. [dramatic music]
Matt: Hello everyone, and welcome back to the next episode of Critical Role. We unfortunately are down one Grog this evening, as I mentioned before.
All: (distressed noises)
Matt: We are missing him terribly. We'll see what terrors will transpire in his absence. However, though! We do have some fun things to announce real fast: first off, we're still giving away promo kits for every 50 subscribers we get, so we'll be having those randomly drawn from everyone in the chat room every time 50 subscribers are joined to the channel, I guess you would say. Also, every ten subscribers we're giving away Steam keys for different games, so also cool giveaways, which is kind of fun. I want to take a moment also to mention our... charity, there, that's the word I was looking for, it's been a long day. (laughter)
Matt: Our charity, 826LA, which we're putting up links in the chat room for you guys if you're able to donate. It's a fantastic program that tutors children, helps with creative writing and general literacy skills. It's a wonderful program, you can look it up at 826LA, you should Google it, find the website, it has all the information you need. It's a really great charity and we're still pushing that through our show every week, so thank you for all who have donated, and if you have the opportunity to, I highly recommend it. Also! I wanted to let you guys know we have-- Marisha wants to mention a cool sponsor tonight or at least a promotional push we're pushing.
Marisha: Yes! Yes! Friends of the show, Espionage Cosmetics, hooked us all up with some awesome nerdy manicures. We'll tweet pictures of our nails, so yes, we're all wearing awesome nails and we're going to be doing a giveaway from Espionage. Their tabletop bath bombs, which are awesome d20s--
Matt: d10s, technically.
Marisha: Oh, d10s-- No, there's a d20! There's a d10 and there's a percentile die!
Matt: No, you're right! I saw the wrong side of it, my apologies. Forget I said anything.
Marisha: So yes, and we'll probably also go ahead and throw in a Critical Role signed picture as well with this. What you have to do is tweet @EspionageMakeup, is their twitter, @EspionageMakeup and #CriticalRole, and tell them what your favorite character is from Critical Role and who your favorite nail wraps are today and then we'll pick at half-time a winner.
Matt: Indeed. So fantastic. I may have some more stuff down the road we'll be able to talk about but in the meantime, let's go ahead and get everyone caught up to speed with what has transpired recently on Critical Role. So the party, to give you a quick overview for those who have just joined us, they were given a mission to seek out a female halfling paladin named Lady Kima of Vord, who had been missing, going on a vision quest, apparently seeking some deep, dark evil that had begun to simmer and grow beneath the dwarven city of Kraghammer. The party managed to make their way to the city, delve deep within its caverns to discover an entire series of caves, and what eventually led to the Underdark itself. A subterranean landscape of terror and darkness. After a series of battles with some duergar, which are kinda ashy-skinned evil dwarven offshoot people, characters, and a few brushes with some illithids or mind flayer creatures, they managed to befriend one, or I should say, ally with one named Clarota. Who has been traveling with them, who has apparently been kicked away from his society and wishes reentry to save them from the kind of ominous presence of this unseen, barely spoken entity called K'vorn. K'varn. (laughter)
Matt: Long day. Long day. So upon traveling deep into the recesses--
Sam: Don't worry Matt, you just have to talk for three straight hours.
Matt: (laughs) I know. I know. (laughter)
Marisha: Your day is just getting started.
Matt: I know. But yes, so they have now, after a series of battles, found their way into the magma-covered, kind of obsidian jagged caverns where the Emberhold, the duergar fortress currently resides, where they believe Lady Kima was. Upon finding a way in, unfortunately announcing their presence to the fortress itself, they managed to find Lady Kima in a torture chamber beneath Emberhold, save her, slay her oppressor, and now they have, after a tenuous alliance was made-- as Lady Kima and their mind-flayer friend Clarota are very much at odds-- a very tenuous alliance was forged. And they now journey back up to the main basement floor, or main base floor of the Emberhold proper. And that's where we left off last time. So, hope you can absorb all that, guys. (laughs)
Sam: We are inside this fortress.
Matt: Correct.
Sam: We are moving towards the armory. We're trying to find the armory or something, is that right?
Matt: You're trying to find, essentially-- Lady Kima has mentioned she wants to find the rest of her equipment that she says is either in an armory, or she mentioned a vault. And also she knows-- she mentioned something about vengeance to those who run the keep. So she stormed up.
Laura: We're following her, right?
Matt: You've followed her back into the base floor of the Emberhold itself. You all currently are now back kinda where you started after you snuck into the side passage of the Emberhold.
Laura: And she said she would lead the way to the vault?
Sam: Can we be quiet for a second and see if there's any footsteps around us or guards marching around? Are we in immediate peril or do we have a second?
Matt: Certainly. Everyone go ahead and make an immediate perception roll.
Sam: Okay.
Laura: So fast!
Marisha: Website went live, if you want to announce that now or later.
Matt: Later. Two?
Laura: No, 22! (laughs)
Liam: 28.
Ashley: 13.
Taliesin: 24.
Orion: Fail.
Sam: Ten. (laughs)
Matt: That's a fail! All right, so-- You've got to be ready!
Marisha: 27!
Matt: Okay. (laughter)
Sam: I'm sure he'll give you half of that.
Matt: Nearly at the ready. All right, so as you all take a moment and kind of steel yourselves, your ears perk up and you can hear what sounds like echoes of distant footsteps down hallways, far out of sight. You hear some movement across the stone ceiling above you that eventually comes to a stop. And you wait for about a minute, and the entire place is now in a very eerie silence.
Liam: They know we're here, still.
Laura: But they don't know where we are.
Liam: No.
Orion: Maybe they went to sleep?
Taliesin: Lady Kima, do you remember where the vault is? Do you remember how we can get back there?
Matt: Kima turns to you, her eyes still peering back, and she's creeping towards the edge of the hallway. She looks back at you, briefly, and says, "I've only seen half of this stronghold before they captured me. As far as I know, probably somewhere on the second floor."
Laura: What floor are we on now?
Matt: "The ground floor."
Liam: The ground floor.
Laura: Right, cool.
Ashley: So it's just one up? (laughter)
Matt: "Apparently."
Liam: Were there stairs-- When we went down that set of stairs there, was there also stairs going up right there, or stairs going up?
Matt: There were stairs-- Right there? No. There were stairs going up in the first room you entered.
Laura: Oh, right! So we could go back in the little storage room.
Liam: We could.
Laura: And go up.
Liam: We should just spend the next three hours in the storage room.
Laura: Let's go in the storage room and go up.
Liam: Lady Kima, allow me to take a peek around the corner, see what's going on. So I'm gonna go stealth.
Matt: Okay, go ahead and roll stealth.
Liam: And inch past her. That's good. 29.
Matt: 29? All right. She begrudgingly steps back. You can see there's that eagerness to get in some sort of a fray or to feel somebody else bash along the side of this greatsword that she borrowed from you guys. She lets you pass. You creep up along the edge. As you do, you see-- back here there is, in the middle of this hallway, a series of doorways, and what looks to be a large room in the center of the chamber where two duergar currently stand.
Liam: I turn back to the group.
Taliesin: (whispers) How about the other way?
Sam: Why don't we just kill them?
Liam: Isn't that a corner-- a dead-on corner right there?
Matt: This is another hallway.
Liam: Another hallway.
Sam: Let's go kill the duergar.
Laura: How dark is it in here? Is it like--
Matt: No. It's pretty dark in here. Like, with low light vision, you're able to see maybe a good 30 to 40 feet ahead of you. There are a few of those red crystal clusters that give off a little bit of light, incrementally, but duergar themselves, you've gotten to the point where you see they like it very, very dark. They actually aren't needing light. This is more of a courtesy to guests they may have.
Laura: So potentially, brother, we could take them both out if you throw your knife and I do an arrow.
Orion: Wait, didn't we see further past that, 'cause that's where Grog did the-- (crushing noise)
Sam: No, this is the area that we haven't been in yet.
Liam: I just put up a hand, and then slip around this direction and slip down this second hallway that you revealed.
Matt: All right. As you step past, you do see, this room here is a little ajar; the inside looks to be a storage room. There's just a series of boxes, barrels, and various--
Laura: (gasps) Maybe you can put yourself in a box and walk around.
Marisha: (gasps) Yes! Metal Gear Solid it!
Liam: I continue to creep away from my sister, specifically.
Matt: All right, you glare down the side of this hallway. It leads to two other smaller rooms down the way, with a split towards the back end. There does not appear to be anybody visible in that hall.
Liam: All right, I got this, I'm going to keep going.
Sam: Wait, what about us!?
Laura: Why are you doing this?
Matt: All right, so you go past this way.
Sam: Jesus. Two duergar, we can take them out in a second!
Matt: Now this hallway, there appears to be an opening to this room, no doorway.
Laura: Everybody wait while my brother goes on a field trip.
Matt: And this additional room, you do not currently see an entrance.
Liam: An opening that's not a doorway? Or--
Matt: I mean, there isn't a door in the way, it's just an opening.
Liam: The door is open. All right, so I'm going to press against the wall, up to the edge, wait for five seconds, see if I can hear anything, and then if not, curve around and peek in.
Matt: Perception roll.
Liam: 20.
Matt: 20. You take a moment and listen. You hear what sounds like a light crackling of some sort of a fire? And the occasional dull ring of metal being hit against metal.
Sam: What was it? Metal against metal?
Liam: Okay, I'm going to get low to the ground, and peek in the door.
Matt: All right. Peeking through, you do see, indeed, it is some sort of a smithy, with two kilns, or two anvils, set up, a work table in the center, and there is one lone duergar that, apparently, in the middle of his work, has not been paying attention to any of the ruckus going on around, and is just in the middle of hitting some sort of long, thick piece of black iron, and it's just, (ting ting), sweat dripping down the front of his brow, the room itself is-- even against the corner of the doorway, you can tell the temperature is a lot warmer on the inside.
Liam: And his back is to me, currently?
Matt: It's kinda to the side to you. He's currently looking-- working out the anvil, banging down.
Liam: So this way?
Matt: Yes.
Liam: Oh, but I see the door on the other side, so I take the earring--
Sam: Oh, why don't you just keep going forever?
Liam: -- take the earring and I whisper to my sister, (whispers) follow along.
Laura: Oh. I've been invited on the field trip, guys!
Sam: Just you?
Laura: Just me!
Sam: Come on!
Laura: Who else can stealth?
Marisha: I'm a stealthy panther right now.
Laura: Do you wanna be something and pop in my pocket? (laughs) That sounded wrong.
Matt: You haven't had a short rest yet, and you do--
Marisha: (clears throat) I was gonna say, I'm still a cat form. But I can accompany you.
Laura: I should not go with you, I can't stealth for shit right now. (laughter)
Laura: I rolled a seven.
Liam: (whispers) Send Scanlan up.
Laura: (whispers) Scanlan.
Sam: Huh, what?
Laura: My brother's calling for you.
Matt: You feel the oppressive force of Clarota's voice in your heads simultaneously say, "I can also accompany."
Ashley: Good plan. Good plan, Clarota.
Sam: All right. I'll step ahead and go invisible.
Matt: All right, so mark off your next Invisibility spell. As you vanish, Clarota also kind of waves his hand for a moment, and his image disappears the same way Scanlan's did.
Sam: Ooh! He does that too?
Matt: Apparently.
Laura: What did he do?
Sam: He went invisible! (sings) We're walking down a hall, nobody's watching us. (laughter)
Matt: As you're humming to yourself--
Sam: Oh no!
Matt: You make your way down and eventually towards the back of where Vax is pressed against the--
Liam: I can feel Scanlan's flute pressing into my buttocks.
Sam: That's not my flute! (laughter)
Liam: So I turn to them, and then I start-- I pass the door.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: I'm gonna go around the corner to that other door.
Matt: All right.
Liam: And now I'm going to stab the duergar in the neck.
Matt: All right! Go ahead and roll for an attack!
Liam: Natural 20, natural 20! (cheering)
Matt: That's how you start the game.
Marisha: It's a good day! I feel like it's gonna be a good day.
Matt: All righty. So go ahead and roll damage. This is a sneak attack, as he didn't-- it was not aware you were there.
Liam: I'll use my keen dagger, I think. Four plus seven is-- This is a pencil, right? Okay, 11. Where-- how do you make it work? 11.
Matt: All right.
Liam: Eight, 13--
Sam: Get him in the neck so he can't yell.
Liam: Ooh. 66.
Matt: You don't multiply the modifier. The modifier goes on at the end. So it's the dice roll plus your sneak attack, multiplied by two, and then the dex modifier at the end.
Marisha: That's a lot!
Liam: Okay.
Matt: Plus seven, I think, right at the end.
Liam: Yeah, that's right. So it's the damage plus the sneak attack, double that--
Matt: And then add the plus seven at the end.
Laura: That's 28 times two plus seven.
Liam: 26.
Matt: Splitting hairs here! That's enough. So.
Liam: One plus two plus two plus one.
Matt: So you hear this, 'Tink! Tink! Tink!' (pause) That's it. Without even a guttural noise, the dagger buries itself in the base of his skull. You see him just (grunts) and slump down to the ground.
Liam: I catch the hammer and I start going 'Tink! Tink! Tink!' And wave the two invisible beings into the room.
Ashley: Hey! What happened in there?
Sam: We're here! We're ready to fight. What do you need us to do?
Matt: Kima at this point-- You can see her hand kind of tensing around the sword as she looks back at Grog, whose hands are also wringing his greataxe. "I want to kill something!" She kind of backs off to the side and sees the other duergar that are there.
Ashley: (Grog voice) I want to rage!
Matt: And she's going to go ahead and run around.
Liam: Don't waste my natural 20, Kima. Come on!
Laura: Man, you can't control Kima!
Marisha: This is why we don't have AI in the party, guys. You can't control the AI.
Matt: You know you guys are telling a very, very angry woman right now to be patient. Doesn't seem to make a ruckus.
Laura: Can I sneak up to the corner at least, so I can be ready to attack those two bastards?
Matt: Over to here? All righty. Trinket, who hasn't seen you in a while, is sticking to your back.
Laura: I sit there and I kind of pet him as I look around the corner.
Matt: Okay. Trinket is enjoying the petting. All right, so that duergar's down, the current armory section appears to be completely open and at your disposal. There are a series of partially made weapons kind of scattered in a pile. There are some ingots, and even some raw iron material in the far corner. Other than that, it just looks like your general smithing workshop.
Sam: Is Kima with us now?
Matt: Kima is currently looking around this section with you guys.
Sam: Kima, do you see any of your equipment here that you wanted?
Matt: She glances around, goes and move some of the piles by, turning over the room as quietly as she can-- not as quietly as you'd like-- but quiet enough. "No. Nothing's here."
Sam: Can't you just take one of these things and call it a day? (laughter)
Matt: She glares in the direction of your voice.
Sam: I'm invisible, I--
Matt: "This will do me just fine for now!"
Sam: Oh!
Matt: "Right. Let's keep looking." She leaves the room. She starts heading down this way--
Liam: All right, I'm following after her, tiptoeing after her.
Laura: We should go after her. 'Cause we're all gonna split up.
Liam: Yeah, I speak into my earring and say zubba zubba zubba zubba.
Laura: Let's all go in that back way and see if we can stealth around.
Matt: Okay. For everyone else, stealth check.
Taliesin: Oh boy.
Ashley: Here we go!
Orion: Yes! Natural 20!
Matt: Disadvantage on you, Pike, because of your heavy armor.
Ashley: So that means I roll twice?
Matt: Roll twice, take the lower.
Ashley: I take the lower one.
Orion: Now as that happens, I want to cast Mage Hand and I want to cast Light on it, and I want to slowly have it drift down there.
Matt: They're both concentration spells. You can have one or the other.
Orion: Dagnabbit.
Matt: Mage Hand isn't an actual object, unfortunately.
Orion: Dagnabbit. Okay, fine. Instead I cast Prestidigitation and I make a little glowy orb, and it's a little flickery, and I cast-- I think I can maybe try, what, 15 feet?
Matt: Okay. And where are you casting it? Just in the middle of this hallway here?
Orion: No. To my left.
Matt: Here?
Sam: He wants to see in the dark place.
Orion: I wanna see in the dark place.
Matt: There is no entrance to this room currently from what you can see. It's just a wall. There is a door on the opposite side.
Sam: Now it's a well-lit wall.
Orion: Hm. All right, well, I follow after the bear. (laughter)
Matt: All right, so what was your stealth roll?
Laura: Oh, it was 17.
Matt: 17. Roll for Trinket.
Laura: Oh gosh.
Sam: (bear noises)
Laura: I thought he just got what I got. Crap.
Sam: Not good.
Laura: What do I add to it?
Sam: Nothing.
Matt: Add his dex modifier. Trinket's dex modifier.
Laura: Okay, hold on. Hold on. Oh, good.
Liam: 11.
Laura: 11.
Matt: All right, as you guys are making your way down the hallway, slowly--
Laura: I kinda clamp my hand over his mouth and tell him to shush.
Matt: You guys make your way down here. One of the duergar glances over--
Sam: Oh boy.
Matt: -- utters something to the friend at his side and he goes--
Liam: I heard the bear and I start sliding my back down along the wall.
Laura: Oh crap. I turn around and notch my arrow for them.
Matt: Okay, Trinket moves past
Taliesin: I walk up to the very, very edge of the hallway.
Liam: And I'm stabbing! Stabbing, stabbing! Stabbing.
Orion: Matthew, behind the bear.
Matt: You move behind the bear?
Orion: Yes.
Matt: You are right there and they both see you
Orion: No, no, the other bear. I mean, the other side of the bear.
Matt: As you're walking behind Trinket, all this transpires simultaneously. Right. And they saw the bear and then saw something move behind it. Their attention was got. They see you and they start walking towards--
Liam: Stabbing duergars, stabbing duergars.
Matt: However, as they pass there, you get one shot at this guy as he passes past you. Go ahead and make your attack.
Orion: I wave at them.
Matt: Okay. (laughs) Tiberius waves at them.
Marisha: I go ahead and move up next to Percy.
Orion: Hello. I don't think they're our friends.
Matt: Unfortunately, the space is a little limited for your size. You have to wait for the rest of them to let you by.
Marisha: Oh, but Grog's behind me. He's not here, right? Where's Grog?
Matt: You're a big cat right now.
Marisha: I'm a big kitty.
Liam: I rolled a 15.
Matt: 15? 15 does barely hit.
Liam: Okay, so same keen dagger.
Matt: As you go ahead, move around the corner and fire. Two arrows?
Laura: 17.
Matt: All right. Second one? Same guy or different targets?
Laura: Same target. He's right in front. That one hits too, that's 19.
Matt: Both hit, go ahead and roll damage on both.
Liam: 32 for me.
Matt: Okay. So as you watch them both walk past you, one of them continues past with his hammer out, rushing towards whatever he sees moving at the end of the hallway, probably Tiberius after Trinket. The next one that comes past you, you reach around and just take your dagger and swing it across the back of his neck area. You manage to sever the base of the spine and he just crumples into a pile in front of you. The other one-- Damage?
Laura: 22 with the two arrows. Nine and 13.
Matt: Both arrows impact his chest. The duergar steps back for a second, surprised by the moment, looks really furious and begins to step forward, his size enlarging.
Taliesin: I knock him right in the face with the butt of my gun as he rounds the corner.
Matt: All right. Go ahead and make a stealth check to see whether or not he sees you.
Taliesin: I can't use my previous stealth roll?
Matt: Not for this point. This is an active combat.
Taliesin: Damn it. Eight.
Matt: Okay. So you still get the attack, but you don't have advantage, 'cause he's aware you're there. As he's running past you, he glances and sees you in the corner of his eye and is preparing for the blows. Go ahead and roll your attack.
Taliesin: What do I add to this, by the way? I've never done a physical attack.
Matt: You're hitting it with the blunt. Go ahead and roll a d20 and add your strength modifier and four.
Taliesin: All right. Natural 20! (cheering)
Marisha: Look, it's flashing!
Taliesin: It flashes if I hit a natural 20.
Matt: All right, so go ahead and roll damage. It is a 1d4 plus your strength modifier.
Taliesin: So that would be 2d4 plus my strength modifier, because it's a natural 20.
Matt: Correct, yes.
Taliesin: That's six points of damage.
Matt: Well, it's five on there, right?
Taliesin: My strength modifier is one.
Matt: Okay, so that's five times two is ten plus one. 11 points of damage.
Taliesin: 11 points of damage.
Matt: Which will do it. As the duergar sees you, is rushing past with his hammer, about to fall back and swing at you, you rush out from behind the corner with the blunt end of your weapon and just whack him in the side of the temple.
Sam: Girly scream.
Orion: What was that?
Taliesin: (whispers) We're good, we're good.
Matt: Unconscious on the ground. Alive but unconscious.
Ashley: He's not dead? Can I-- so he's at a disadvantage, basically?
Matt: He's incapacitated.
Ashley: So can I go up to him and slit his throat with my mace of disruption? To make sure he's dead?
Matt: If you'd like to?
Ashley: Yes, I want to.
Matt: Okay.
Ashley: Is that really bad, though?
Matt: Pike walks up and grabs the back of the duergar's hair, holds it back and using the jagged edge of her mace of disruption, tears open the throat of the duergar, which then spills all this blackish ichor across the ground.
Liam: She went renegade, folks. She's gone renegade.
Ashley: I just wanted to make sure he didn't come after us.
Matt: Grog looks impressed but also slightly worried as the man who grew up alongside you. All right, so that happened.
Liam: And then she says, okay, I'm gonna dismember the body. Hold on. (laughter)
Laura: Torture weapons.
Sam: Because I'm invisible in the thing with Lady Kima, I get up on a stool to see if I can catch some cleavage. (laughter)
Sam: Just peek over, peek in.
Matt: The leather armor that she wore is a full torso-covering leather armor piece, I apologize.
Sam: (sighs) I give up.
Matt: Sorry, Scanlan. She is-- Yeah, which by the way, I mean, it's not just so much the fact that Pike did it, it's the fact that Pike did it by running a jagged, blade-edged mace across someone's throat. It was less of a slice and more of a--
Ashley: Is Sarenrae gonna get really mad at me?
Matt: We'll see.
Ashley: They're really bad! If they're really bad guys, they were super bad. The duergar are so bad. She'd probably be happy--
Orion: Right, Pike, but man, that was rough.
Matt: We'll find out.
Taliesin: He had a little duergar back at home.
Matt: So, given this case, now the rest of the party is able to move forward. This hallway now, you can only see about that far down with the current light source. You can see Kima is now moving across--
Sam: Aw, she's just going?
Laura: Go listen-- aw, she's still going that direction?
Liam: All right. I'm tiptoe-jogging behind Kima.
Marisha: Can we do something to slow her down?
Sam: I can stop her if you want?
Marisha: Well, I mean, can we-- I mean, we don't wanna stop her I just wanna be like, hey, slow, girl.
Laura: She's-- you know what? I bet she's pretty noisy too!
Matt: She's wearing leather armor, she's not very noisy right now.
Liam: I carefully place a hand on Kima's shoulder, and do a little, sort of, curtsy motion. Allow me, I can--
Matt: Okay, as you do so she kinda stops and looks back over her shoulder and gives a begrudging nod. But you can see she's-- there's shaking, her hand holding the greatsword is currently shaking with rage.
Liam: I say-- (silent) Two words, three syllables. (laughter)
Matt: All right, so. Coasting down this hallway. It leads down to an open doorway and a closed doorway immediately to your right. And then the room to-- actually, the doorway's to your left, and to the right you see another wall to another room that you don't have a doorway currently available.
Liam: There's a door to my left and a door straight ahead, right?
Matt: Correct.
Liam: Okay, I inch up to the closed door on the left and place my ear to the door and listen.
Matt: Okay, go ahead and make a perception check.
Liam: Yeah, natural 20.
Marisha: What?!
Ashley: Come on!
Sam: Yeah. It's gonna be one of those nights.
Laura: I need that one! Oh my goodness.
Taliesin: Don't. Jinx it.
Matt: I'm gon' kill all you.
Laura: No! (laughter)
Matt: You put your ear to the side, and you hear nothing.
Liam: Okay. Do I sense any kind of-- I'm checking for traps on the door.
Matt: Okay. Yup.
Liam: Trap's perception, right? 26.
Matt: So the door itself does not appear to be trapped. It does appear to be locked, though.
Liam: All right, well, I pull out my picks. And I get a three on that, so--
Matt: That's okay. It's a really, really, really crappy lock.
Laura: Oh!
Matt: You notice that the door itself, it has a locking mechanism on it. It was kinda half-locked, and as you push, it opens up, into a commode.
Liam: Aw, yes!
Matt: There's nobody in there. It is a room with what looks almost like a bench, with a series of holes cut into the bench. It's a communal--
Liam: Well, I'm tempted to close the door for a moment, but I will press on instead.
Sam: Check for loot! (laughter)
Laura: Gross!
Liam: All right, so I'm going to inch towards that open door ahead of me, see what's around the corner.
Sam: I'm gonna follow-- I'm gonna inch up behind him as well. I'm still invisible, right? How long does that last?
Matt: Okay. It's concentration for quite some time, I believe.
Marisha: Actually--
Taliesin: Really quickly-- Oh, do you want to go first?
Marisha: No, you go.
Taliesin: Does anyone want to hide these bodies that we've just scattered about--
Laura: Yeah, that would be good!
Marisha: Inside the loo.
Taliesin: It's a perfect place for them to be interred.
Liam: So, Pike, hold still, please.
Ashley: I'm not moving!
Sam: Pike, eviscerate the bodies!
Marisha: Here, I'm gonna-- I'll walk over, in tiger form, and I just grab one by the scruff and start dragging it.
Matt: Grog helps out. You guys move the two bodies slowly over into the restroom area.
Marisha: Wait, we kinda prop them up to kinda like Weekend at Bernie's them, yeah, make them just look like they're, you know, passed out.
Matt: Okay, as they're both generally laying back, like they just got really drunk and barely found their way to the toilet.
Sam: And throats slit. (laughter)
Matt: It's really rough blockage.
Marisha: We take that one and kind of like lean him forward so you can't tell immediately.
Matt: Okay. All right, that's not a worry. You bring that up to that little area there. All right.
Liam: Well done, there.
Taliesin: Oh, thank you.
Matt: You guys move forward to that. Grog has come over here to be able to help. Now, looking down this hallway, here you can see--
Sam: Who we got, who we got?
Matt: This side opens up--
Laura: All I want to do is find the damn treasure room.
Matt: Looking into this room, it appears to be a barracks. A room that is just filled with different beds, all apparently empty.
Laura: Oh, they're up and looking for us.
Marisha: Apparently empty?
Matt: From what you can see.
Marisha: Can I use my keen smell to see if I smell any duergar in there?
Matt: Sure. So you slowly approach the door using your keen senses, which opens up this hallway a little bit visibly to you. You can see it goes back quite a bit. Sniffing this room, you can tell that there were duergar there recently. Apparently, at the moment, though, there is no immediate scent that matches a duergar. So the room, for the most part, has been completely evacuated.
Marisha: Okay, I kinda-- even though I'm not a dog, I'm a cat, I still kinda point. I go into pointer face. You know? Like--
Orion: Pointer face?
Marisha: You know, like a pointer.
Liam: Yeah, angling your nose forward, all right.
Sam: I think Keyleth has to pee. (laughter)
Sam: I never had a cat.
Liam: All right, I'm gonna start sliding down that hall there, ignoring this other passage, and get up to the door and again place my ear to it. Oh look, there's the front entrance.
Matt: As you look to your right, this is a large foyer-type area with two red carpets that are rolled on the sides of it that lead to the front of the main double-sided, large ten-foot-tall stone doors of the front of the fortress. To your left, there is a double wooden door, about eight feet tall each side, about five feet wide, that are currently closed, leading into whatever this large chamber is immediately to your left.
Sam: Can I hang a right and go down that other hall?
Taliesin: We should check out what's in that other hall.
Sam: Is there a door over there?
Matt: There are two doors, actually.
Sam: Closed?
Matt: Both closed.
Sam: I'm going to listen into those doors.
Matt: Make a perception check.
Sam: Natural 17. (cheering)
Marisha: Gotta love that nat 17.
Matt: Listening in, you don't hear any noise.
Sam: That could mean nothing.
Liam: Are you at the double doors with me?
Sam: I'm to the right. I went the other way.
Liam: Okay. I'm going to listen at the big wooden doors, and I rolled, oh, not that great. 17.
Matt: All right. Listening in--
Orion: I scootch up ahead of Grog like, excuse me, excuse me.
Matt: As you listen back, there is no noise internally, except for the slight squeak as you put yourself against the door. It shifts a little bit, making no noticeable noise, but it appears the doors are unlocked, or there is no lock.
Laura: Oh no.
Matt: You're not hearing anything from inside that one door you're at.
Sam: Wait, I just heard a noise?
Matt: No, you hear no noise coming from that room.
Sam: Oh, okay. Stinking Cloud, can I go through doors, or do I have to see what I'm casting it at?
Matt: You have to have sight, unfortunately. I mean, you could peek very low.
Sam: I'm going to open the door and look.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: 'Cause why not?
Matt: You open the door. It appears to be some sort of a guest bedroom. It's a singular bed that's in much better condition than the barracks, it's empty, it's well-made. It's more lit than the other rooms. It seems to be a room that's designed for either non-duergar riff-raff or general soldiers or guests or people that would come to the fortress to stay, so.
Sam: Okay.
Liam: I'm going to try to peer into the door, and I haven't talked about this before, but I'm wearing a cloak of elvenkind, which means I have advantage on stealth, and enemies have disadvantage on spotting me, so I'm going to lean my head in.
Matt: All right.
Liam: Do I need to roll for stealth or am I already stealthed?
Matt: For this, you're already stealthed. So as you glance inside the room, you see what appears to be a great hall of some kind. There are large wooden tables, there is a fire pit in the center that has a number of mostly burned wood that is mainly just small darkened embers with a little bit of glowing yellow and red to it. There are stools scattered about the room, you can see there are remnants of some of a meal that hasn't been fully cleaned up yet on some of the tables. But the room appears to be empty. You do see a slight glimmer across the way on one of the tables.
Liam: Oh, I'm going to go check it out.
Laura: (whispers) Get the sparkly thing.
Matt: All right. Everyone else, what are you doing?
Sam: Can I look around the guest bedroom? Just kinda snoop around up in things?
Laura: Can I ask him, I'm asking you what you see in there. What do you see in there?
Liam: I don't know yet, hold on
Laura: Is it sparkly?
Liam: I'm going to try to sense for traps in this room.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: I'm going to snoop in the barracks.
Matt: Snoop in the barracks.
Liam: 14.
Orion: I'm going to make my way around all this riff-raff, uh, no, uh, yes.
Matt: You push your way through. "Excuse me, excuse me, pardon me." Pushing through everybody.
Orion: I'm going to go past where Vax is in the room down that hallway, then I'm going to do my Mage Hand thingy again. Oh, my Prestidigitation.
Matt: Down this hallway?
Orion: Mm-hm.
Matt: Okay.
Orion: Slowly, five feet by five feet.
Matt: All right. You see slowly, as you move down this hallway to check it out, a secondary set of barracks that are also apparently empty.
Laura: Where are they? The stairs are up in the storage room, man. That's where we just were.
Matt: You see a secondary commode that is open. And as you glance around the corner as the light passes by you see there are two duergar currently coming down the hallway this direction.
Marisha: Oh shit!
Orion: I just stop! And I creep back.
Matt: Okay. As you creep back, you hear footsteps coming your way quickly.
Liam: I'm going to the door, then, I can hear that. Inside the door, inside the door.
Matt: Oh, inside the door there?
Marisha: I'm going to stay actually right there, just right at the threshold.
Matt: Okay. The rest of you guys?
Laura: I mean, I'm so far away. I can try to get up there but--
Matt: You can glance, there's still a hallway around that way if you wanted to go around.
Laura: Okay. I'll go around the back way then.
Matt: Okay, so you move around--
Laura: With Trinket!
Matt: Trinket follows up behind. Makes your way up there. Scanlan, you staying in that room?
Sam: I'm taking a dump on the guest bed. (laughter)
Orion: They don't see me, right?
Laura: I like walk by the door and see that happening (laughter)
Sam: But also just covering it up with a blanket afterwards.
Matt: Okay, well, you're in mid-process, this is all happening very quickly.
Sam: Oh. (grunts)
Ashley: I'll go around back behind where Trinket and Vex just went.
Matt: Okay. Because of your little legs you get about that far. Your little legs carry you.
Sam: I'm invisible. It's poop. (laughter)
Matt: (sighs) (grunting and laughter)
Marisha: It's apparating poo.
Taliesin: I'm staying in the hallway,
Sam: Scanlan's just like, I hate this mission.
Matt: Okay, so. Tiberius, as you're backing up, both the duergar turn around immediately, seeing you, and rear back with javelins, throwing them directly at you.
Orion: Oh! I'll cast Blur instead.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and roll initiative real fast to see who gets off first what.
Orion: I'm not going to count that. Oh, I'll count that. 19. (laughter)
Matt: What, why didn't you count it?
Orion: Because it flew out of my hand, I didn't roll it.
Matt: Okay. All right.
Orion: Yeah. (laughter)
Orion: It's on camera, tell them to play back.
Matt: So you go ahead and cast Blur. You guys see as Tiberius comes running back, (startled sounds). He manages to cast a spell really fast as two javelins come flying towards him. His visible image begins to actually blur; the outline looks almost like there's two mirror images of Tiberius in the same place that are both shimmering and preventing them from actually telling where he's actually standing. The first javelin comes in at a 14.
Orion: Nope.
Matt: Second one comes in at a 17.
Orion: 17. Yes.
Matt: Oh sorry, no, it's a four, 'cause it has disadvantage. So both javelins just whish past. Looks like they pierced part of that kinda shimmering blurring form, but both just ricochet off the walls of stone and come clattering to the ground. Kinda near back where Kima and Grog are. They both step out of the way as they land.
Marisha: Ha-ha.
Matt: All right, so that brings us to-- that was your action. Who else wants to take the next action?
Liam: I'm gonna hold.
Laura: I can't see anything, can I, from where I am?
Matt: It's kinda dark, and you can see movement in the distance.
Laura: Can I hop on Trinket's back and see if I can see higher?
Matt: You can try. All right. So you hop on the back of Trinket, (laughs) looking over the top, and you know Grog is kinda blocking part of your view, but you can see, with your low-light vision, what looks to be Tiberius' form shimmering and two duergar-height individuals that are partially blocked by him. So they do have partial cover, or three-quarters cover. Do you have the feat that ignores that?
Laura: I don't know? I don't know.
Matt: (laughs) Because you don't know I'm going to say no.
Taliesin: It would be called Sharpshooter.
Matt: Yeah it would be called Sharpshooter, is the feat.
Laura: No, I don't have that.
Matt: Okay, yeah. So go ahead and roll for attack on one or both duergar, up to you.
Laura: 21.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: And 23.
Matt: Okay. The 21 misses, the 23 hits. Because they have cover and because it's so dark it's difficult to make out their form, but you do manage to hit one with the arrow.
Laura: Okay. I Hunter's Mark him.
Matt: Okay. Next time, make sure you do that before you attack. Otherwise it won't count for the attack.
Laura: Okay. Okay. 13, uh, 12! (laughs) Math! Stay in school.
Matt: (laughs) All right. There you go. 12, then add your Hunter's Mark bonus to that as well.
Laura: Oh, good, one.
Matt: All right, gotcha. So one arrow sinks in the shoulder, but doesn't appear to be stopping his angry advance towards Tiberius. Let's see. You're staying where you are?
Liam: Waiting.
Matt: All right. You guys are actually kind of like pinched off in the hallway right here, so as you guys are all kind of--
Sam: (strained) Don't say 'pinched off' to me. (laughter)
Matt: -- as you're doing this, Tiberius, you're right there. The two duergar catch up to you and both, now that their javelins are out of their hands, pull out their hammers with their bonus actions and come down at you with an attack each.
Marisha: Run, Tiberius!
Matt: That's gonna be a six.
Orion: No.
Matt: And a 17.
Orion: 17 hits.
Matt: Okay, yeah, that Blur is saving you, man. All right, so as the one-- both the duergar are kinda like swelling with frustration, anger. It's an ability, you've now gotten to the point where you can see, these duergar can actually temporarily increase their form for stronger blows and attacks. Comes and strikes you for 12 points of bludgeoning damage as the hammer comes cracking down, finding purchase on your torso, and it kinda pushes you back a few inches. That's gonna bruise tomorrow morning.
Marisha: Can I do a combo move with Grog, assuming that he would agree with me that it's gonna be super cool?
Matt: He'd probably agree with you, what do you wanna do?
Marisha: Okay. (laughs) Thanks, Grog! So since Grog's kind of there-- Can we arrange like a fastball special, almost? So have him like kind of go up and crouch and I'm gonna bust out--
Matt: How are you going to communicate this to Grog?
Marisha: He-- with--
Liam: (meows) (laughter)
Matt: I'm gonna have to say, unfortunately, that's not gonna work out for this moment. Grog's attention is on the duergar and you are a giant cat.
Liam: Hey, I'm gonna sneak behind Tiberius and stab that guy.
Laura: It would've been so cool, though.
Ashley: That would've been really cool.
Liam: And since Tiberius is there, I can get sneak attack damage, 'cause one of my allies is there--
Matt: All right, just a second there, you're still holding, let's finish Keyleth. So Keyleth, what are you doing?
Marisha: Well, is Grog in my way?
Matt: Grog is there. You can attempt to leap over Grog.
Marisha: I was wanting to vault off Grog's back, is what I was wanting to do.
Matt: You can do that without asking him.
Marisha: Yeah, that's what I was going to do.
Matt: No, you were saying you wanted to tell Grog you were going to do that. But yes, you can still do it. So go ahead and roll an acrobatics check.
Marisha: No, you asked how I was communicating it.
Laura: Just do it, Keyleth!
Marisha: So I'm gonna come out and I'm gonna vault off his back and try and do a pounce over top of Tiberius for that duergar that's closest to you. What am I rolling?
Taliesin: Acrobatics.
Marisha: Acrobatics? Is this an acrobatics thing?
Matt: Yes. From around the corner, you pull back, leap up, jump onto Grog's back and attempt to spring off of it.
Marisha: 11.
Matt: 11, okay. (laughs) All right. So you jump off of Grog's back. Grog, not expecting it, instinctively ducks down and the force you push off, as he's not aware there's going to be a giant cat there--
Marisha: Uh-huh.
Matt: -- in doing so, it doesn't give you the momentum you need. You are able to jump over him and get kind of into center of the fray. But you do not have the pounce attack, unfortunately.
Marisha: Okay. That's fine.
Matt: But it gets you there, at least.
Marisha: Oh, can I not attack?
Matt: You can attack, yeah.
Marisha: Okay, okay, okay. I'm gonna go ahead and do my bite attack.
Matt: Go for it.
Marisha: I'm gonna go right for his throat. Still with the same intention that I had in mind.
Matt: Okay, this is the one that took the arrow from Laura.
Marisha: Okay, 17.
Matt: 17? That hits. Go ahead and roll for damage.
Marisha: 1d10 plus five. Where's my d10s? Ten damage. Piercing damage.
Matt: Ten piercing damage, all right. So, as you rush forward, you bite at him. You see he pulls back, but you get a big, meaty chunk of his forearm and clamp down, and you feel a snap, some sort of bone in the middle of his arm and he gives out a horrible-- (yells) sound, as he takes the butt of his hammer and hits you on the snout. Doesn't do any damage, but it's enough to get you to kind of let go of your grip a little bit, and he rips his arm out of your jaws. Leaving that kind of nasty, irony taste of duergar blood, that you've now become accustomed to, unfortunately. That ends the round. Now you have Tiberius and a cat in your way.
Marisha: (meows)
Liam: Do the doors go in or out, that I'm by?
Matt: The doors go in.
Liam: In. So I'm just gonna go like this (hinges creak) and throw a dagger and say peek-a-boo at the same time. (laughter)
Matt: Okay. As you step out (fwip).
Liam: That is a 29 to hit.
Matt: That does hit.
Liam: Okay.
Matt: You do not get sneak attack bonus, unfortunately.
Liam: Even though my ally is five feet away from him? I thought I remembered that rule.
Matt: You do if you are in melee with them.
Laura: Oh, right.
Matt: You get the bonus if you're both like flanking them, or you're like harrying them in combat. Because you're at a distance, you don't get the bonus.
Liam: Okay, so that is a nine. And then I'm going to follow-- the nine of damage.
Matt: All right.
Liam: And immediately follow up with my other dagger, which also hits.
Matt: All right, go ahead and roll damage on the second dagger. Which is 1d4 plus what?
Liam: Six. That's a nine.
Matt: Nine, okay. So, after the guy rips his arm out of Keyleth's face, essentially, a dagger comes swinging out from behind the doorway, stabs him in the other shoulder. You see he looks down at it confused for a second, and as that dagger vanishes in a puff of dark smoke, returning to your-- the side of your hilt, he looks up just in time to see the second dagger catch him right in the middle of the forehead, and he just falls onto his back at that point, unmoving. That duergar is stripped.
Laura: What-what!
Matt: Who's up next? Who wants to do anything? Who hasn't done anything yet this action?
Sam: Is there is a door next to me for another room?
Matt: You're just finishing.
Sam: Oh, I'm just finishing, okay.
Matt: Sorry. So, Pike, have you done anything yet?
Ashley: Can I-- Is there a door there? Somewhere, right there?
Matt: You move around here, there is a door over here, yes.
Ashley: I can't really do anything. Check it out, check it out.
Liam: Yeah, bust in. You can't stealth.
Matt: The door is a secondary guest room.
Liam: And now, poop on this bed.
Ashley: All right. (laughter)
Taliesin: I can't do anything that could make noise anyway.
Matt: It is a guest room of equal design and dressing as the one that Scanlan, you are unaware, is currently fouling. (laughter)
Ashley: Maybe I get a sudden urge for some reason to just poo on the bed. (laughter)
Matt: You can do what you want. Be aware, Pike as a character has her intent, the more you stray from that, the more it will have ramifications for her in the end.
Ashley: Yes, I know, I'm just kidding, That's not what, that's not what I want to do. I was just, had this feeling that Scanlan was doing something and I felt that--
Sam: She could probably hear, muffled from behind the door, (grunts).
Ashley: Okay, so I'll just-- I guess I can't do anything while I'm in there, so? Can I just--
Matt: That's about as far as you're able to move. You can still use your action if you wanted to do anything, but right now your vision is currently fairly well-blocked by a woman and a bear, and a man the size of a bear.
Ashley: Yeah, okay, so I'll just hang out there.
Matt: Okay, so that brings us back to Kima, who currently doesn't have any sort of way of getting over there, kind of frustrating, trying to find a way over.
Marisha: It's a narrow hallway.
Matt: Clarota, who is still invisible, is just gonna hold on that point.
Orion: As everybody is doing this, I'm going to-- why are you blocking me, I'm not supposed to be this close to this thing! Keep going.
Matt: Okay, Percy! Stand there? All right, Tiberius, you're up.
Orion: Oh, like I was saying. Well, shit.
Sam: Aren't you right next to the guy? Kill him.
Matt: Do it quick, or we are gonna move for the next turn.
Orion: Okay, I'll just lift up my hand and go, Firebolt.
Matt: Okay, point-blank Firebolt. Go ahead and roll your spell attack.
Orion: Okay, okay, 20.
Matt: 20, all right. That'll hit, go ahead and roll for damage for the Firebolt.
Orion: Okay, ten, 18, 20, 21, 23.
Matt: 23 damage? All right. So as you instinctively pull back, you release the blast of Firebolt energy, the duergar who is currently harrying you with this warhammer takes the brunt of it right to the bottom of his face and his torso. The studded leather armor that he's wearing tears open with a sheer flaming burst of the impact of it, and you see most of his skin is charred and burned at that point. He reels back for a second, looking very, very hurt but not quite put down yet.
Orion: As my bonus action, I'm gonna spend two sorcery points and do it again. So I roll for that. It's a 22.
Matt: All right, the second blast, as he reaches back, before he can get a chance to get back to his feet, the second blast hits. This time, it sends him off his feet, flying about five to ten feet back, skidding across the ground.
Orion: 15 damage.
Matt: Yes, and that puts him, still on the floor, laid out with a burning, kind of crippling, crispy scent in the air of what was once a standing duergar, now dead and burning on the ground.
Marisha: So once again I grab him by the scruff, take him, and put him in the bathroom.
Liam: I give a couple of pats on Tiberius's shoulder and start to inch down the hall.
Matt: All right, as you guys are doing this, Scanlan steps out of the guest room, getting his pantaloons back on.
Sam: My invisible pantaloons.
Matt: Yes. You hear the footprints of Scanlan, you being still invisible, you essentially just--
Sam: I phantom pooped. Did I find anything in there, by the way?
Liam: Just relief.
Matt: You found a fun way to prank duergar.
Marisha: Oh, yeah, did I find anything in the barracks?
Matt: Over there? No.
Taliesin: Did Liam-- Did Vax find anything shiny in the room? The shiny thing.
Liam: No, I got interrupted. That's a good idea, thanks for the reminder, Percy.
Taliesin: You're welcome, yes.
Liam: Checking for-- I checked for traps before, but I can't remember what I rolled. I'm sure it was successful.
Matt: Go ahead and roll again. (laughter)
Liam: 17.
Matt: Okay, as you push the door open and get a glance inside of the main hall, you don't see any traps across the floor.
Liam: Okay, I'm gonna go check out the shiny thing.
Matt: Okay. Everyone else staying out in the hallway?
Sam: I'm coming with him.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: If I can get there.
Matt: You manage to scoot through, dancing around folks, people kind of let you get by. Anyone else?
Laura: Yeah, sure, I like shiny things.
Marisha: I'm burying my shame, again. Burying the duergar.
Matt: So, you're dragging the duergar over in the--
Taliesin: I'll go in, too.
Ashley: I'll follow, I'll follow.
Laura: We're all going. It's a big, happy room.
Liam: So say we all.
Marisha: Well, I guess I'll go after I bury duergar.
Matt: Yes, as you guys step in here, move up towards the back corner, where there's the shiny glint. Tiberius, you stay inside or outside?
Orion: I'm going to wait for everybody to go inside.
Marisha: We will be Team Outside Posse.
Matt: Kima walks in, Grog goes to start making his way in. As he does, you go over towards the glimmer. The glimmer on the table, you look, it's just formless and kind of this weird spark of light. It then vanishes, and the doors that you guys entered--
Laura: (singsong) It's a trap.
Matt: -- slam behind you, with Tiberius, Grog and Keyleth all kept outside of the room.
Ashley: No!
Matt: The rest of you guys, the flames go to darkness and the entire room goes pitch-black.
Marisha: Oh, shit!
Laura: Oh, no, we don't have light.
Liam: In the darkness, I say, fuck! (laughter)
Laura: Stupid, stupid, stupid!
Orion: I motion to Grog and I'm like, you know what to do, damn it.
Matt: Grog's gonna go for the door, however, at this point in time, I'm going to ask for--
Laura: Can we stealth? I mean, I guess we're all kind of--
Sam: Ask for?
Liam: Roll for Deus ex Machina.
Sam: Oh, You're gonna ask the chat room something?
Matt: No, no, no. I'm not. I'm working out what's actually gonna happen here. All right, so, suddenly there is a cacophonous bit of pain streaking through Pike, Vex, and Clarota. Guys, go ahead and make an intelligence saving throw.
Sam: Intelligence?
Laura: All of us?
Sam: Some sort of a mind thing.
Laura: Oh, crud.
Marisha: Intelligence.
Laura: Oh, oh, oh! Oh, no, I don't get any advantage in this.
Liam: 13.
Matt: Not you, just you two. So what's the--
Taliesin: Never mind, that was such a good roll.
Ashley: What was that? That's a one. (laughs)
Matt: Okay.
Ashley: I rolled a one!
Matt: So in the darkness, suddenly there is this searing pain, like some sort of screaming sound is blasting you from the inside of your very mind. You two are both currently stunned.
Laura: Oh, crud.
Sam: Who's you two?
Laura: Me and Pike.
Ashley: I did bad things, I did bad things. I shouldn't have killed a man while he was down. Wait, so what does that-- That means we just can't do anything, right?
Matt: On every turn, you get to try and break that, but right now neither of you can--
Marisha: Every turn they have to try and break out of it? It keeps going? It's like a keep-going thing?
Matt: You both just sit there, grasping your heads, just screaming in pain as your body is unable to function or listen to any thought process. Clarota also unfortunately falls victim to this and is also unable to make any actions.
Sam: Oh boy!
Liam: I'm pulling out my flametongue dagger to try to get a little bit of light in here.
Matt: All right, however-- You, as you are currently pulling out your flametongue dagger, you feel a presence nearby, and with a little bit of embers around the fire, you see, out of nothing, a figure step into view that apparently was not visible but a moment before. A tall, lithe figure, with long limbs, fingers and a wrapping of facial tentacles coming towards your face.
Sam: It was invisible.
Liam: I see him, I'm gonna stab, I'm just gonna stab.
Matt: Before you get the chance to stab, you get a surprise attack from this guy.
Laura: Oh, no, what if he sucks our brains out?
Matt: All right, that comes to an 18 versus armor class.
Liam: Yeah, he got me.
Matt: So, as you go back for your blade to pull it out, he grabs you by the shoulders and pulls you, and the tentacles wrap around your face and pull you into this horrible toothy maw. You feel this tearing pain sensation as its teeth begin to dig into your face.
Ashley: No, no, no, no.
Laura: Oh my god, he's gonna die.
Liam: That hurts. A lot.
Matt: You take 17 points of psychic damage as the actual presence of the tentacles pulling on your face, you feel it's kind of grabbing your brain and trying to hold it in place. You are currently considered grappled.
Marisha: Son of a bitch.
Matt: Now, guys, everyone roll initiative. That was a surprise round.
Marisha: Surprise round.
Matt: Yes.
Marisha: 'Cause they got the drop on us
Taliesin: That'll do.
Orion: What's going on in there? I hear lots of ruckus.
Sam: We'll be out in a minute.
Orion: Don't give me that, Scanlan. Oh. Scanlan, you can hear me. What's going on in there?
Sam: We're all dying.
Orion: I turn to Grog. They're all dying.
Matt: (laughs) All right, so 25 to 20?
Sam: No one.
Matt: All right, 25 to 20, no one-- almost forgot, go ahead and make an intelligence saving throw.
Liam: 23.
Matt: 23, all right, you feel the presence of its mind pressing into your brain and you manage to, through the pain of its tentacles pulling you towards its mouth, shrug off its current attempt to push into your mind.
Liam: I'm thinking of the middle finger.
Matt: That's a good thing. Okay. So you're still grappled but you're not stunned.
Sam: Is he a piece on the board yet?
Matt: Both of them are now visible right there. All right, so, 25 to 20?
Laura: Nobody.
Matt: 20 to 15?
Liam: 17.
Taliesin: 16.
Orion: 17.
Matt: 17 and 16, all right. So actually, Grog is going first. All right, and Percy. 15 to ten? Ten to five?
Marisha: Oh, oh, wait, 13. (laughter)
Marisha: Sorry, I was thinking about shit.
Matt: That's okay. Ten to five?
Laura: Nine.
Taliesin: Thinking about shit.
Marisha: Thinking about life and death. (laughs)
Taliesin: Word.
Matt: All right.
Sam: Two.
Ashley: Oh, so did I. Best friends.
Sam: Besties. Twinsies.
Ashley: Gnomesies. (laughter)
Sam: We're still-- Mr. Dungeon Master, sir, this is all the same day. I don't get any of my spells back?
Matt: No, you guys have not rested. All right, so first, the top actually-- Kima is at the top of the initiative order.
Marisha: Kima, get it girl, get it, get it girl.
Matt: Kima angrily leaps on top of the table and goes running down with an angry yell, and leaps down toward the one that's currently grabbing onto you with its grapple. As she's running a little bit of light bursts, as you can see this divine energy begin to burst and glow off the edge of the greatsword that she's holding. She leaps down, and with a giant arc through the air that lights up that portion of the room with a brief sweep, the blade comes down towards-- oh, that'll hit. Second attack also hits.
Ashley: Yes, go Kima.
Matt: So that comes to-- okay, using her Divine Smite ability on top of that, she manages to deal 37 points of damage to it.
Taliesin: Damn.
Matt: As she finishes both of her strikes simultaneously. The mindflayer, however, does not release its grasp on you. You are still considered grappled. That ends her turn. Grog now is gonna angrily attempt to bash into this door, is gonna make an-- actually no, no athletics check, he's going to go into a rage and hitting away at the door. (growling)
Liam: (Grog voice) I would like to rage. (laughter)
Laura: (Grog voice) I would like to rage. (laughter)
Matt: All right, that puts a total of 32 points of damage, that's enough. So Grog just takes two big swings. The first one comes through, cracks the door in half, splitting it down the center. Rears back a second time, cleaves through the door entirely. What little bit is left on the hinges, he kicks out with his foot, leaving now this side completely open to the interior. He then moves in around Clarota. That's as far as he can get in this current turn. That brings us to Vax.
Liam: What can I do while grappled, nothing until I'm ungrappled?
Matt: Well, no, you can try and make an acrobatics or athletics roll against them to try and break free.
Liam: Okay, but then do I have an action once that's done or that's the action?
Matt: I'll let you use that as your move.
Liam: All right, so I'm gonna try to use, I guess athletics is what I would do.
Matt: Or acrobatics, up to you, whichever's higher.
Liam: Well, that would be acrobatics.
Matt: Acrobatics, then.
Liam: 27.
Matt: 27?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: That'll do it.
Liam: Okay.
Matt: You manage to, just in that moment of it being struck with the two blade strikes from Lady Kima, you manage to pull your head free from its grasp. And just manage to right yourself now, the throbbing pain in your head of what you just narrowly avoided still there.
Liam: Okay. Poison dagger in hand, I roll an 18. Does that hit?
Matt: Okay. 18. Currently that does hit, yes.
Liam: I wanna grab him by the calamari and stab him in the eye. (laughter)
Matt: Okay, go for it.
Liam: That's what I did, so-- and then if I'm five feet-- if Kima's there, I can sneak attack according to the rules?
Matt: Correct.
Liam: All right, so I'm gonna stab him in the eye. One. Plus the sneak attack damage is two, four, ten, 13, 19, 38, plus seven-- 45.
Matt: 45. All right. So, as you--
Liam: With the poison dagger.
Matt: Right, the poison dagger. I think you've already used the daily poison ability on this.
Liam: I don't remember, so it's just a stab.
Matt: Okay. So the 45 points of damage. You pull back and you jam it into the side of its eye. You can see as it rears back, a spray of dark-colored liquid kind of warms the side of your face. As you pull the blade back out it rears back and (growls). You can hear its voice piercing into your head going, "I will eat you one way or another!"
Ashley: No, you won't!
Laura: Did it distract him enough that we lost our thingy?
Matt: That's your main attack?
Liam: I mean, I would imagine between ungrappling and stabbing, is that it for me? Or do I get my second attack, I don't know?
Matt: You can get your second attack, I'm sorry.
Liam: Okay, well I think, go fuck yourself, and stab again. Nine plus-- 19.
Matt: 19? Yeah, that hits.
Liam: Other eye, other eye. No sneak attack. Two plus-- eight.
Matt: Eight. Okay. As it rears back and you hear it saying that, you pull back and you grab with your off hand the cluster of tentacles in the front of its face and pull it down. As you do, the inertia-- you jam the blade into the other eye. As you do, you hear this blast burst of angry scream inside your head, before it goes dead cold, silent, and the mind flayer falls to the ground.
Liam: I fucking hate these things!
Matt: All right. That brings us to Clarota, who's currently stunned and fails save, Clarota's still stunned. Tiberius.
Orion: I look through the door.
Matt: Look through the door.
Orion: What's going on in here? Are there any enemies I can see?
Matt: You can see over here, barely. It's very dark in the far corner, you can see just the shape of some humanoid there.
Orion: Oh. Okay, is he-- (laughs)
Matt: What are you doing, Tiberius?
Orion: (laughs) How tall is the thing?
Matt: From what you can see, it's maybe roughly six, seven feet. Grog's blocking most of it.
Orion: No, like, we're in a bunker, right?
Matt: Right now, you're in this giant great hall with giant tables and stools everywhere.
Orion: And the ceiling is--
Matt: You can't see the ceiling right now, there's no light.
Orion: Oh.
Matt: The room is near pitch-black, like there's just very little light in there currently.
Orion: I will waltz in behind Grog.
Matt: All right.
Orion: I cast Light.
Matt: Okay. The room all of a sudden bursts into view, you can now see the walls, the ceiling-- it's a smooth stone room. There is a large chandelier currently hanging from the top of the ceiling. It's about 25 feet up to the ceiling in this current room.
Marisha: (gasps) There's a big chandelier. That's fun.
Orion: And now do I see that guy better?
Matt: You do, yes. You see now there is a mind flayer currently ducking behind one of the tables right now. You can see a number of your friends in the party are currently clutching their heads, silently screaming to themselves, unmoving.
Orion: Ah, right. There's another one of those guys over there!
Marisha: Wait, there's another one?
Orion: Yes!
Marisha: There's two?
Matt: There's two.
Orion: I spend three sorcerer points.
Matt: How many sorcerer points do you have left? You spent a lot over the past couple games.
Orion: No, I have not, because I didn't do anything last game, because I was all recharged.
Matt: That's true, actually. Okay. Just keep track of that. So how many do you have left?
Orion: I have eight right now. Now I'll spend it to go down to--
Laura: Five.
Orion: Five. 'Cause math.
Matt: Okay, got you. Cool, good on you.
Marisha: Fantasy math. Once again, 826LA, after-school tutoring. Good charity.
Orion: I could have used it. I cast my pillars, or Grand Columns, as I like to call it, and (piston sound) all the way up and smash that little bastard.
Matt: All right.
Marisha: Smashy smashy.
Matt: So what's the save you get past that for the spell?
Orion: He does a dex save, and he takes 6d6 damage, and the dex save is to see if he's pinned or not.
Matt: Right. It does make its save, I believe, it's 21?
Orion: Oh, my, what?
Matt: Rolled a 21 versus your DC of your spell, which I believe is not higher than 21.
Orion: No.
Matt: So yeah, so he still takes the damage, but is not pinned.
Orion: Which is 15, 18 points of damage.
Matt: Okay, 18 points of damage, and manages to pull out of the way just in time as it slams into him, he darts off and catches himself on the ground, kind of slowly levitating above the ground as he comes to a stop. The pillar then slams into the roof, this section here. Actually splinters part of the table, which is now kind of lifted off-kilter at an angle. Yup. It--
Orion: Oh, so that-- does that mean he's in the air for a whole round? 'Cause how it works is, he's all the way up to that height, but he gets to come, or fall, back down if he makes the save. That's how-- so he has to travel that distance, so does he cast Levitate as he's coming down?
Matt: How I'm playing it is, the impact of the pillar suddenly slamming in from underneath is what does the initial damage, and he manages to roll off before it slams into the ceiling. He kinda-- So. However, that ends your turn. The mind flayer, now looking around and seeing the room lit up, seeing the entire group now in this room, looks around at everyone, puts its hands together and concentrates-- and as it does you see its form (sucking noise) vanish.
Marisha: Damn it!
Matt: A few seconds pass, you guys manage to shrug your stun, and Clarota as well.
Ashley: Whoa, what happened?
Marisha: That's not good.
Laura: What happened?
Marisha: They really know we're here.
Laura: We need to get out of this room, then.
Taliesin: Let's just search the rest of this floor as quickly as possible.
Marisha: As quickly as possible.
Laura: Grog, can you always put down the dust of tracelessness?
Matt: "All right, I will." He's doing his flower-girl moment. Passes behind you guys. All right, so, what is the current mode of action for you guys?
Marisha: I'm going to go ahead and dart down this hall that we know is for sure empty.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Exit the other side of the great hall that we're in.
Matt: All right.
Laura: And I think we should all go back-- we should go to the second floor.
Matt: Through here.
Liam: Walking in that door.
Matt: You look through here and see what appears to be some sort of a kitchen. You can see shelf units, you can see what looks like a few tables, you can see some kitchen elements.
Liam: I'm gonna walk all the way in, all the way in.
Matt: All right, you walk all the way in. There's a door towards the back--
Liam: The right, what do I see?
Matt: The right, you see what looks to be a doorway that's partially open that leads to a staircase.
Liam: Up or down?
Matt: Looks like it's going up.
Marisha: And what's in this room? I'm looking over here.
Matt: Okay, you look over here. It's a double door that is currently closed.
Taliesin: I will head in your direction as well.
Orion: Eight, two of my d6s to heal up.
Matt: You haven't taken a short rest yet. You have to-- you guys have to stop and take ten minutes, 15 minutes to rest to do that, so--
Sam: I'm gonna look all over the great hall and see if there's any cool stuff in there.
Matt: Make a perception check.
Laura: I think what we should do-- Everyone, I think what we should do is make our way back to the initial storage room we were in and go up that stairway, because that one's hidden. It's by a hidden entrance, people aren't gonna think about that one as much as main stairways.
Taliesin: I agree, I think we should-- I agree with that, I just think we should check the rest of the floor as well. Just double-check everything, make sure we didn't miss the--
Liam: Vax is heading back to the group.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Percy and I are checking this room with the double doors. Do you have any trap checks to see if it's locked?
Liam: I do!
Matt: Okay, so Percy and both you guys open this doorway. It opens up into what looks to be another smaller eating hall. This one's nicer, this one has one long table. This is probably where the more socially risen--
Taliesin: Take a quick look around.
Marisha: Yeah, anything in there?
Matt: Looks like it hasn't been used for a day or two.
Taliesin: All right.
Marisha: No cool goodies?
Matt: No current goodies in this area, no.
Taliesin: So we'll go-- just keep going down and check the rest of that hallway.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: There's a lot more, you guys. I think we should go find the vault on the second floor.
Matt: All right, you guys press down here. There apparently are now-- you can see there's another set of double doors--
Liam: Vax is following.
Matt: All right.
Laura: I think I should gather the group and try to make it back to the other storage room. Just to get us out of this area specifically.
Matt: So you guys are all moving back with--
Laura: Is that cool?
Matt: -- Vex to return to the previous storage room?
Marisha: We can do that. Yeah, go for it.
Taliesin: And you'll hear us if anything goes wrong. Yeah, we'll power through it.
Laura: Use your earring.
Matt: All right.
Marisha: I'll go ahead and very-- I'm just gonna kinda use my keen sense-- or sorry, my keen smell again to see if I can smell any duergar in the area.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and make a perception check with advantage.
Marisha: That's pretty good. Oh yeah, I'll take that first roll, which was seven-- 27.
Matt: 27. You smell that on this floor, there doesn't appear to be any duergar in your immediate vicinity. There is a strong, lingering scent of them coming from the doorway that you're currently at.
Marisha: A strong, lingering scent?
Matt: Correct, like it-- you can kind of tell there was a recent moving of a large number of duergar.
Marisha: But probably not present.
Matt: You don't know.
Marisha: Whatever. I guess we'll see what's in here.
Matt: All righty.
Marisha: Peeky, peeky.
Liam: I kind of parkour past Percy.
Matt: Okay.
Orion: Parkour past Percy!
Marisha: Parkour, parkour!
Matt: You open the doors into what appears to be a large temple chamber, a place of worship. What you see are a series of long, wooden benches that are arranged to look towards the center. There is an altar to the right that is a risen kind of stone dais, and in the center there is a stone table, an altar which has a piece of black cloth wrapped over it and something on top of it you can't see from this distance. In the center of the room there is a 12-foot-tall statue of what looks like an extremely strong armored duergar clutching a giant warhammer and a shield.
Marisha: Hm. I'm gonna-- oh wait, I'm a tiger.
Matt: Yup.
Liam: I'm gonna perception check the room. Which is high. 27.
Matt: 27? There does not appear to be anybody inside this room.
Liam: Screw this room.
Matt: However, do you have a religion--
Taliesin: I would like to do a religion roll.
Matt: Roll religion, guys.
Taliesin: Nine.
Liam: Nine.
Ashley: Could I do a religion roll from where I am?
Matt: You are not over there, unfortunately.
Marisha: That's what I was gonna do, is tell somebody to get Pike over here real quick.
Laura: Do you guys have earrings?
Ashley: I can put on my sprinter's boots.
Liam: Yeah, Pike, Pike? There's some sort of religious artifacts over here. Could use your expertise.
Matt: Pike, you make your way through, eventually coming down this hallway-- (clanking)
Marisha: She's coming! I can hear her coming.
Ashley: Hey guys, I'm here! Did you know I was coming? (laughter)
Matt: Go ahead and make a religion check.
Liam: Don't stab anything.
Orion: I'm gonna follow suit, but slowly.
Ashley: 17.
Matt: All right. As you're heading that direction slowly, best that you can tell right now, this room is definitely a small temple built to-- and the name kind of escapes you, the words trying to form in your head for a second, and then eventually you come to realize this is a chapel to Laduguer. Laduguer is the deity of the duergar. It's the god that basically freed them from their original enslavement from the illithids, and they worship as a pinnacle of power, strength, and conquest.
Orion: I make it up to where those guys are.
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: Let's keep searching.
Sam: Hey, what's the darkness right next to me? Is there a door there? What is that?
Matt: There is a door right over here.
Sam: Oh. I'm gonna open it.
Matt: Okay. All right. So you go ahead and open the door. It opens up into what you can immediately see is a chamber that is some kind of magical laboratory. You see in the far corner, hunched, a robed duergar, and as you open the door, there's a slight sound, a click sound, and a jet of greenish fume begins to spray up into your face. Make a constitution save.
Sam: Oh, god. I don't even know what that is! (laughs) 15.
Matt: 15? All right. So you take 11 points of poison damage. However, you can feel the poison forcing its way into your lungs. You manage to back out of the cloud in time and cough it up and your general physical well-being-- you resist most of the effects of the poison. However, this poison fume trap did appear to go off and as the smoke slowly dissipates, you hear a chuckle across the other side.
Orion: As I hear the noise, I--
Matt: You don't hear the noise, you're too far away.
Orion: Oh, shit.
Matt: You guys do hear it, though.
Laura: Okay, I come over there and see what the-- what just happened.
Matt: Okay, as you rush over, Scanlan's backed up away and you can see there's this chamber here.
Laura: Is the poison still in the air, or is it--
Matt: It's dissipated at this point. It's thin enough. You still can smell it, and it smells awful, like a very, very heavy, electrical fire-type smell.
Laura: So I can see that guy?
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: So should I notch an arrow and try to hit him?
Matt: It's up to you. What're you going to do?
Laura: All right, I attack him, then!
Matt: All right, go for it then.
Ashley: Attack him! Get him!
Laura: Shabang! Oh, dang it, I didn't do it. I meant to Hunter's Mark him and transfer it over, but that's okay, I didn't say it.
Matt: You didn't say it this time.
Laura: That's 30. For the first.
Liam: You did say shabang.
Laura: I did say shabang, and 16 for the second.
Matt: Okay, both hit. Go ahead and roll damage on each.
Ashley: Hit it. (music flares up)
Laura: Well, sort of. 15 and eight.
Matt: 15 and eight. All right.
Liam: The music is on.
Matt: All right. So both arrows you've been firing over the top. He's kind of hard to see with the table and from being crouched in the corner, but both arrows still manage to barely make their mark. One kind of pins him against the wall, and he looks at his shoulder briefly, looks back at you, raises his hand, as he begins muttering something under his breath. As he does, your arrow (shnk) through his hand and he tries to shake it, and now he's pinned to the wall with an arrow in the middle of his hand.
Laura: Yeah!
Ashley: Yeah!
Laura: Trinket! Oh no, I used two attacks.
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: Dang it.
Matt: You can still tell Trinket to move. What are you gonna do?
Laura: No, no no, I'm gonna hold him there, 'cause he's already in the room.
Matt: Okay, got you. All right, so what are you guys doing over in the temple?
Liam: Exiting.
Matt: All right.
Marisha: No! Look and see if there's anything cool, first. What was that thing that's covered up by the blanket on the altar?
Matt: You keep walking towards it?
Marisha: Yeah. What's up with that?
Matt: You make your way, you look at the top of the dais where the altar is, and on top you can see the black cloth that is wrapped over it. The scent gets to you before the actual visual. It's freshly rotting flesh of some kind, and as you glance over, you can see there is a heart that has been cut from a body and it's at the point where the blood has coagulated and begin to become thick. It's roughly dwarven size.
Marisha: I get up and I grab it in my mouth.
Matt: Okay. It tastes disgusting.
Marisha: And then I walk over to Vax and I lay it at his feet. I kind of nudge it with my nose.
Matt: She got you a heart.
Liam: I scritch Keyleth behind the ear, but nudge it aside with my toe and exit the room.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: I did scritch her ears, but I'm going to continue down to the end of the hall.
Matt: This way?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: Okay, you make your way into what looks like a giant foyer, into a secondary entrance in the side of the fortress.
Liam: I just walk all the way over to the corner, stealthing.
Matt: Make a stealth check.
Liam: It's high, it's 28.
Matt: 28, got it, okay. So, as you make your way through, you eventually careen to this corner. You can see another hallway, what appears to be another room of some kind. You also glance back and see there are two sets of stairways that go up and down.
Liam: What's behind me?
Matt: This is a giant foyer that leads outside of the fortress.
Liam: And the edge of the map this way?
Matt: This way here? This way? This comes to an abrupt end at that point, a rocky wall into the mountain itself that it's buttressed up against.
Liam: Okay, I'm gonna keep coming this way, stealthing.
Matt: All right. As you move through--
Laura: What's happening with that dude I-- are you doing all this while I just pin down--
Liam: Yeah. I don't know what's going on back there. I'm just walking around.
Matt: So, you glance in this room. There's an open walkway and what appears to be another barrack section, also completely empty.
Liam: Screw that. Do I see a door for this room that's still darkened out? Then I'm gonna keep sliding along the wall.
Matt: Okay, as you slide along here, to make your way around to a door there.
Liam: Okay. Pressing my hand, just to see if I can check any for traps.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: 26.
Matt: 26, all right. The door does not appear to be trapped.
Taliesin: I'm gonna be heading in that direction anyway.
Marisha: Agreed. Same here.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: I would like to stealth through the door.
Orion: Before I leave, I carefully examine that statue.
Matt: Okay, what are you examining?
Orion: The facial features of the god, the deity, right? Is that what he is?
Matt: Yeah. Okay, so you look at the face of Laduguer. You can see it's very, very old, it's very well-crafted. You can see a lot of very meticulous craftsmanship went into its creation. It almost glistens with a perfection that is out of place in an area that is so covered in soot and various other volcanic activity-based mineral deposits.
Orion: I'm gonna do a quick arcana check, just to see if there's any kind of mystical thing around it or anything like that. And it's 19.
Matt: Okay. There is some sort of a hum to the air that has an arcane element to it, but you are unable to pinpoint what it necessarily means or what the source is.
Orion: Interesting. Knowing that, I kind of gather my thoughts and I head towards where the rest of the group is.
Matt: Okay, so, while you're opening the door, the mage in the far corner kind of looks about sporadically and looks down at the arrow in its hand and its shoulder and just kind of fearfully, "Wait wait wait! Wait. Stop. Don't attack. Let's have a conversation."
Laura: Speak fast. Before I kill you.
Matt: He leans forward, kind of pulling the arrow out of the doorway. (groans in pain) Starts hobbling towards you a little bit.
Laura: Can we all-- we go in the room and Trinket goes up next to him and, like, gets all up in his face?
Matt: Okay. As you both enter, both of you make constitution saving throws. As two more plumes of poison (pff) out of the ground as both you and Trinket walk in.
Liam: Good.
Laura: 15?
Matt: 15, okay. And for Trinket as well.
Laura: Oh, I should've been so smart, but I wasn't. (laughter)
Laura: 14 for Trinket.
Matt: Okay. You take seven points of poison damage.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: Trinket, however, takes 14 points of poison damage.
Laura: Oh man. What did I get, seven?
Matt: Seven. And Trinket is currently considered poisoned.
Laura: Oh no!
Sam: What does that mean?
Matt: It means disadvantage on attack rolls, disadvantage on ability checks.
Laura: That's okay.
Matt: And now there's a bear coughing and kind of thrashing about the room. The table it bumps into and it kind of topples over.
Laura: Is this like a turn thing or can I do something?
Matt: Well, this is just a reactionary moment of you guys coughing and trying to get out of this poisonous fume.
Laura: I mean, can I quickly cast Protection from Poison on Trinket?
Matt: You can, yes.
Laura: Okay. I do that.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: And that cures it.
Matt: That completely removes the poison?
Laura: Yes it does.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Yay Trinket!
Matt: Well done. So that's your action. You now, as you are checking the door and you open it up, you hear all this commotion going off to the side now. Scanlan, you're over there as well, watching as more plumes of these poisonous smoke bits.
Sam: If I get close to the door without going through it, can I see the guy?
Matt: You can move over and look, you can just barely make out his form. It is a dark room that is currently filled with a slowly dissipating green cloud so it's hard to make him out.
Sam: Okay, well then I will just-- fuck (laughs). Well, if I can't see him then I will just yell at him.
Matt: All right.
Sam: I'll yell with Vicious Mockery. I don't like you very much for poisoning me and my friends, you're a poopy head! (laughter)
Marisha: So vicious.
Laura: That is threatening.
Marisha: Damn.
Sam: Ooh. That does seven points of damage.
Matt: Seven points from Vicious Mockery? All right! (laughter)
Matt: I don't know how that works.
Sam: It's Vicious Mockery. It's an attack.
Matt: That's crazy.
Liam: That's, like, 80 points of damage!
Marisha: And who said that words couldn't hurt people?
Taliesin: And bonus damage to his mother, wherever she may be.
Marisha: Sticks and stones can break my bones, but words can hurt.
Matt: Okay. So it has to make a will saving throw, against your DC. It rolls a three. It does not. So, as you shout out into this room, the currently fearful duergar mage kind of glances, eyes slide about, hears these words and you see him wrack his head for a second with a sudden sense of self-loathing and disappointment. (laughter)
Matt: His hands drop and it looks like for a minute his intent to begin muttering some sort of incantation is momentarily distracted.
Orion: Nice!
Matt: All right, awesome.
Ashley: Can I start moving back?
Matt: Yeah, you can start moving back this way.
Liam: I hear that, but I'm still going to poke my head stealthily through the door and see what I see. Do I need a new stealth check or?
Matt: Yes you do.
Liam: Okay, great. So that is a 32.
Matt: All right, you glance inside at what looks to be some sort of a training room. There are-- most of the floor itself is stone, and in the far corner there is a large section that is mainly just sand and dirt and there are a number of wooden training structures. You know, various shields and wooden bars that are used as a means of training for weaponry. There's what looks like a giant rack of weapons, full of arms and stuff.
Liam: Anything good-looking?
Matt: Go ahead and make a perception check.
Liam: One.
Matt: Most of the materials in this room look like the basic duergar fare.
Liam: These don't look very good.
Taliesin: I was going to run in and take a look around anyway so--
Matt: (laughs) Okay. As you run in, go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw.
Taliesin: God damn it. Okay.
Sam: (sings) Traps, traps, traps-traps-traps.
Taliesin: 24.
Matt: All right, so. You take ten points of lightning damage as you feel a tile on the ground trigger and then spring up, and as it does, you hear this sudden high-pitched whine as blue energy streaks up from the floor, runs through your body. Thankfully, you manage to dive out of the way and touch the ground to ground the energy, minimizing the damage. But yeah, you triggered (laughs) triggered a trap plate. You're beginning to get the sense that a lot of this tactic of this fortress now has been to lead you guys through a--
Marisha: Maze?
Matt: A maze of traps.
Sam: A labyrinth.
Liam: Before we hurt ourselves any longer, we should--
Laura: We've got to kill this guy. Or talk to him at least.
Liam: We need to get to the main event here.
Matt: All right. At this point, Kima is now-- As Kima hears you shouting all these curses into the room, Kima pushes past you, and pushes past you. You can see Kima coming into the room behind you guys. Steps over the broken table, down in front of the circle, and grabs the mage by the front of his robe, pulling him into her face. The mage at this point is still kind of reeling from the fact that you managed to strike him so deeply in the heart of his hearts.
Sam: He's just not a nice man.
Matt: However, Kima, with a look of absolute death in her face, grabs him and pulls him forward and says, "Listen, where is the rest of your fucking army?" She's going to make an intimidation check.
Taliesin: Yeah! Damn.
Matt: He does not succeed in resisting that.
Laura: Yes!
Matt: The duergar is pressed against the wall now, and she's slamming him against the back of a bookshelf. "Look, all right, they're waiting for you up there, all right? You're not going to survive this. At this point, the entire city's probably waiting for you in the outside of the fortress and those that are upstairs are well-prepared. Okay? Your best chance of survival is laying down your arms and surrendering. I'm looking out for your best interests here."
Liam: Kill this asshole.
Marisha: Kill him.
Matt: Kima, who is still holding him against there, you can see her hand releases the scruff and he takes a deep breath for a second. But before he can finish exhaling, she goes in, immediately grabbing his throat and squeezing it extremely tight. As she does, you see his tongue, dangling out the side of his mouth (strangling noises) as she's cutting off his entire air supply. She pulls forward and takes the greatsword and begins to slowly push it into his abdomen. As she does, he starts screaming in terrible pain. You can see her just slowly pushing the blade through his body into the bookcase behind. As she does, she goes, "You're gonna tell me, right now, who they have waiting for us upstairs." As she begins to push all the way to the hilt now, he's pinned up against the bookcase and probably a portion of the stonework behind him. He's now got blood pouring out the sides of his face and outside the front of his nose. The duergar being held up against the wall says, "Whatever you haven't killed. The army's probably up with the king himself. They're all waiting for you and I hope they piss on your body when they're done!" At which point she takes the blade and twists it. As she does, he gives this guttural yelp and his eyes just go blank. Blanker than the duergar eyes normally are.
Orion: I make it to the doorway and go, what is going on in here?
Laura: Are there any-- taking that in-- any healing potions or anything in here that we could use?
Matt: Go ahead and make an investigation check.
Sam: Can I look at the door and see if the trap will go off again if we step through it again?
Matt: Perception check.
Sam: 20.
Matt: Looks like, from glancing about the room and getting a feel for it, there were three traps that were all placed directly at the front of the door, basically to give him a point of defense, they've all been triggered, so you don't have to worry about any more in this room.
Laura: Is this still considered the Underdark?
Matt: This is, yes.
Laura: Oh, cool!
Sam: I'm going to go in and look around some more.
Matt: You're looking around as well?
Sam: Look around for potions and stuff.
Laura: Oh, that's considered the-- aw, I could have been rolling twice for all these damn things!
Matt: (sings) Remember your abilities.
Laura: (sings) 25.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Who's the singer here, people?
Matt: Sorry, Scanlan. So, as Kima pulls the blade from its body, kicking it off the greatsword and wiping it across the leather on the side-- the leather that you gave to her! And a little part of you is like, (sadly) hmm.
Liam: That's all right. Worth it. This halfling's hot.
Matt: So you guys made your way back, Clarota's there, against the corner, and Grog rushes over, just feeling like he was ready for action. "What's going on?"
Ashley: You're too late.
Marisha: This might be a good time to stop for a moment.
Matt: That's up to you guys, as I say, do you guys want to take a short rest?
Laura: Did I find any potions? Did I find anything?
Matt: Yes. Glancing around the room, you manage to find two potions of healing, one potion of superior healing.
All: Ooh.
Laura: What is that? That's major.
Marisha: That's cool.
Matt: You also find one vial of some sort of weird, viscous yellow liquid that you cannot identify.
Marisha: Oh, don't open that. Who knows how long those guards had to be staked out here? Don't open that.
Sam: Can I do a-- can I investigate it or arcana it?
Matt: Sure, you can give it a go.
Sam: Yeah. That's a one.
Laura: Oh good.
Sam: Oh wait, no, that's a seven. These dice are horrible. Anyway, it doesn't matter. It's bad.
Matt: It looks delicious. No, actually, you can't make out, it has some changing color as you kind of swirl the bottle and watch the texture inside shift and change with the centrifugal force. You can't make out anything about its intent, but it does feel like it's a potion created with some effect.
Sam: Tiberius, do you want to drink this?
Orion: No! What is it? I check it for 18.
Sam: For what?
Orion: For whatever you're trying to hand to me.
Matt: 18 arcana? Okay. You take a look at it. It definitely is magical, you don't have a lot of experience with alchemy but you gather that the effect that it would have upon imbibement would be to alter your physical form in some way, you just don't know the specific effects.
Orion: Absolutely, Scanlan, I'll take that for now. And I put it in my pouch.
Taliesin: Let's take a short rest.
Matt: So, as you guys all kind of enter this room, this brief safe zone to take a short rest, if you feel you want to heal yourself up and regain any short rest-based abilities, do so.
Marisha: Can we talk about what this duergar just told us?
Laura: Can we go to the bathroom before we do that?
Matt: That's what I was going to say. We can return-- So we're going to take a quick bathroom break, we're going to play the videos again, we'll return here in just a second, as the next element of the attack on Emberhold continues.
Marisha: Oh, and this is your last chance because after the break we'll pick a winner for the Espionage giveaway. So, last chance if you want to tweet @EspionageMakeup and #CriticalRole and look at our sweet nails! They're awesome. They're cool.
Matt: (whispers) Galaxies! All right, see you guys in a second.
Orion: I have text and whatnot. [break]
Matt: Welcome back, guys! All right, so we've had ourselves sufficiently rested.
Zac: Indeed we have. We have a Tabletop Promo Day kit to give away, because you guys got the 50 subs since we started today.
Matt: Which is awesome.
Zac: And we'll give away another one with another signed poster at the end of the night if you get another 50. So we're about to give this away, but I just want to remind you guys to donate to 826LA. That's the group that Critical Role is supporting, and these guys are here out of the graces of their heart, and it would be very helpful for you guys to donate to them and show your love for Critical Role by donating to the charity. We'll post the link in the chat. Get those donations rolling!
Matt: Awesome.
Zac: Zac out!
Matt: All right, thank you, Zac! Couple of quick things. You wanted to announce the Espionage--
Marisha: Yes! Our winner for the Espionage Bath Bombs Tabletop from @espionagemakeup goes to (drumroll) Danny Carr. Who is @Eleine35. So, Danny, I'm pretty sure you follow me on Twitter, just PM me your address and I'll get these out to you. And thank you!
Matt: Yeah, did you follow him? Because you have to follow him--
Marisha: Oh, I have to follow-- Oh, well then I'll follow Danny right now.
Matt: Awesome! Also, as a heads-up, guys, we've had some people perpetually asking us about the shirts that we made.
Orion: You mean these shirts?
Matt: That shirt right there. So, we have a-- it's a temporary-- it's very basic, but we have up, if you guys ever want to go to critrole.com, we have a limited run of those shirts currently available for purchase.
Marisha: Very limited, like once they're gone, they're gone.
Laura: It's less than-- probably less than 15 of each size, less than that, probably. It was a small amount.
Liam: I was wearing mine earlier today and I only rolled 20s. Only.
Marisha: It's true. So, it's www.critrole.com, and, yeah, and the site is still under construction, so. But we managed to rush it out, and I wanna give a huge shout-out to Michael Whitesman, who's a big friend of ours, for helping us make the website
Orion: Thanks, Whitey!
Marisha: @whitesly, if you want to bug him, and, yeah, so, if you buy--
Orion: That's his nickname! It's not like a--
Marisha: Whitesly! His last name is Whitesly.
Orion: I know. But I said, "What's up Whitey," like, to him personally, and then they look at me like, "Oh my lord, that's so racist." (laughter)
Orion: And I'm like, no, no, it's his nickname. It's okay.
Matt: That is actually his nickname.
Liam: I'm just sad that you don't call me Whitey.
Orion: I mean, I can.
Liam: Okay. Let's start. After this game.
Marisha: Anyways. Anyways, you can go buy t-shirts now, which was the whole point of that. At critrole.com. And there's a limited run. Once they're gone, they're gone.
Matt: The cost includes shipping. We'll get-- we're packaging them ourselves. We'll have, hopefully, more in the future, but this is the first attempt at trying to do something like this for you guys, so--
Marisha: Yeah. We're doing this all ourselves just to, just 'cause-- See how this works. You guys--
Laura: And that includes the shipping, that's why the price is--
Ashley: So future t-shirts-- Were you guys saying something, like it would be artwork from--
Marisha: Yes, this was, we got this from @rusegafdi. He wore this at Tabletop Day, so--
Laura: A very similar design, so yeah.
Marisha: Yeah, so we're-- we decided we're going to do, like, fan-designed t-shirts. So, once every so often, we'll do a fan-designed t-shirt, and yes. And then-- but they'll all be limited, so yeah!
Matt: Yeah. Shipping, shipping is included with the price, guys, don't worry. But yeah. So, anyway, check that out! Thank you guys so much, and let's go ahead and get back to the game proper.
Crew: Hey, the t-shirts are sold out already. They're now sold out. They bought all of them.
Marisha: T-shirts are sold out!
Orion: Wait, what?
Taliesin: We didn't even finish telling you people!
Laura: No they're not.
Taliesin: Let us finish our sentence first!
Matt: Okay, so, so, so the limited run was very limited--
Marisha: Holy shit!
Matt: I guess we'll have to order some more, then.
Sam: Uh, mental note  make more t-shirts.
Marisha: We didn't know! We didn't know!
Matt: We were gauging interest. I guess there's interest.
Marisha: I'm sorry! Now I almost feel guilty. Congratulations to the 100 people who got 'em.
Orion: Hold on. Tiberius is gonna work some magic, and then try to conjure up a few more. He was unaware there was a shortage of, of those-- okay.
Matt: Sorry, guys, all right, well, we'll-- thank you guys very much, we'll get more to you very soon.
Marisha: I don't know what to say! Oh god, I'm like, going to cry.
Laura: Second run, yeah! Just hashtag them critical role and we'll-- oh, but if you're selling them already, there's somebody that's making really cool t-shirts on Redbubble, but if you're making them there, like, we can't print them too, so, like, just submit them to us, and then we can--
Matt: Yeah, we'll figure it out! Anyway, guys, thank you so much! Let's get to the game!
Taliesin: Thank you! Cool!
Sam: Guys, guys, the chatroom just solved the Israeli-Palestinian conflict! (laughter)
Matt: Thank you so much, chat! Nice.
Taliesin: We've got a box of stuff coming right for you right now. Thank you.
Marisha: Oh my god, I'm like, shaking.
Matt: All right, so. For all who didn't get 'em, we'll have more soon, I promise.
Liam: Do you guys like D&D? What is that?
Marisha: (laughs) We didn't know if people liked our show or not!
Matt: So. So. So, you've housed yourselves into this enchanting room, this magical laboratory, and taken about a 15-minute rest. You're able to use any of your unused hit dice to heal yourself up if need be. Any--
Ashley: Oh, well, where's everybody at? 'Cause maybe I can just do a-- some healing up.
Taliesin: I just spent a healing surge, so.
Laura: Well, he's, well, as far as health goes--
Liam: I'm low, yeah, I'm pretty low.
Ashley: Yeah, what are you at?
Matt: How many hit dice do you have left?
Liam: I know, I have, I don't have that many left. I'm at, like-- I accidentally erased it, but I believe I'm at 30?
Ashley: Ooh, yeah, you-- I need to, I'll get on that. Anybody else? What's everybody at?
Sam: I can sing to you and give you an extra little roll.
Liam: I'd like you to sing to me, either in the game or on another day.
Sam: Are you Vex or Vax? (laughs)
Liam: I'm Vix.
Sam: All right, I'll sing to you and-- are you gonna use a dice?
Liam: Thank you. Ah, let me see how beautiful your song is
Sam: (sings) Heal the Vax, make him a better elf.
Sam: (sings) For you and for me and the entire adventuring band.
Ashley: (sings) For you and for me and the entire adventuring band.
Sam: (sings) There are duergar dying, if you cared enough for the adventurers, you'd bring Vax back to help us with the stabby-stab. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Liam: And please, vaccinate your kids. (laughter)
Liam: I mean, don't Vax-inate them.
Matt: Yeah, there's the difference. All right, so.
Sam: You get a 1d6 for that.
Matt: So, an extra 1d6 healing to anyone.
Liam: Who needs more than one? Three, okay.
Ashley: I healed you, 18, which was actually low, but I rolled really high for each roll. That's my--
Liam: Oh, thanks. That's very good. Okay, great, I am almost tip-top condition, thank you. I have a blister.
Matt: So, as you guys manage to pull yourself out of your rest mode, you now glance out, and the hallway's still quiet, you can hear the movement of footsteps up above you. What is your intent?
Sam: To win!
Marisha: Okay. Wait, what are we gonna do, 'cause here's-- there's an army waiting upstairs for us?
Liam: They know we're up there, but Kima needs her stuff, and we need to kind of put an end to this problem.
Marisha: I'm gonna hop out of tiger form, by the way, since we rested and stuff.
Sam: Wait, they're above us?
Liam: Yeah, they're all upstairs, including the mind flayer who vanished from the room we're in, so I'm sure he told everyone what's going on. But they don't know we've found the secret entrance, so I think we should go-- Vex'ahlia's correct, we should use the stairwell near the secret entrance.
Orion: Are we sure there's no other way out of here, through this particular floor? Is that the only exit?
Laura: There's-- I mean, there's the front entrance, there's that door over there, there's like two other stairways, but we should use this back one, by the back entrance.
Liam: Also, Lady Kima, our purpose here was to find you, but your purpose is somewhat greater than our own. What do you suggest we do in this moment?
Matt: As she stands up, and she holds the greatsword and swings it a bit. "What I'm seeking lies deeper into this cavern. Whatever is at the heart of this illithid scourge." And she glances over at Clarota-- who's in the back corner, hands folded-- and there's a slight mental hiss sound in her direction. "There's something far darker at the heart of this temple. I've seen it. But I have my thoughts and my ideas, but I need confirmation before I speak of any doom-saying. However, the link between those foul creatures and the assault that's currently mounting against Kraghammer lie upstairs at the center of this duergar people."
Sam: Oh, here? Here at-- where we are now? Yes, here?
Matt: "The link between this K'varn character--"
Liam: And let me ask you this. We can be on the same page, we can go up and fuck shit up. However, your weapons and armor-- would they be a great help? Should they be our short-term purpose, or should we just go up and try to end this problem?
Matt: "To be honest, we've entirely lost the element of surprise. I would not wish to sacrifice as foolishly for a few additional trinkets of my own when I feel that this should do well enough, as long as we manage to work together and be smart about this."
Laura: So we should potentially just leave this castle for now and go find K'varn, rest up--
Sam: No, no, no.
Liam: No, Kima is saying this is the main event.
Sam: She just said there's a link upstairs. The link from-- to K'varn that we need to--
Laura: I get it! Okay. Yeah.
Matt: "How do you think K'varn is able to send these armies up again and again towards the back door of Kraghammer?"
Laura: Right.
Matt: "Besides, if we go on and leave them as they are, who's to say they wouldn't come up behind us, and then we're fighting a two-sided front once we get there?"
Laura: Then let's-- We gotta go upstairs.
Liam: Vox Machina, our years are short. Let's make good use of them.
Sam: Let's leave this decision up to Grog.
Orion: Absolutely not! (laughter)
Matt: Grog's standing there clutching his greataxe. "I say, I haven't been able to kill much since we got here. Let's kill something!"
Orion: That's a terrible idea.
Laura: Have some ale before we go out, Grog.
Matt: "Oh, yeah, of course." And he goes into his bag of holding, and pulls out his now half-empty cask, and you see him frown as he hears it clink around. He pours everyone a small drink, to what is now an empty cask.
Laura: This could potentially kill us all.
Travis: Vox Machina.
All: Vox Machina!
Laura: Scanlan had a great idea, though. Should we talk about what Scanlan wants to do?
Sam: Ah, yes, I have an idea. But also, are there two stairs up to the top floor?
Liam: There's multiple.
Sam: Perhaps we should use more than one. One, half of our band go up, create a diversion. The other half sneak up and kill, kill, kill. That's one option. The other option--
Liam: Pike leads the diversion group.
Ashley: Definitely the stealthy ones with me. (laughter)
Sam: Ah, I do have an idea about gaining the upper hand on our first meeting with this army that's upstairs. An intimidation technique of some sort.
Marisha: You're not going to kill another pony, are you?
Sam: I can't anymore.
Marisha: Good.
Sam: Much as I would love to. No, but we've heard over our eavesdropping that some of these duergar bastards are scared of that strange chimera sort of hodgepodge, human centipede thing? We could be one of those with a little bit of deception, and all of us sort of piling on each other. We could act like a big scary monster and go up and freak the fuck out of them.
Marisha: Ah! That's actually a really good idea.
Laura: -- all of us piled on Grog and Trinket and you as the bases, and we become this--
Sam: They would probably be, at least for the moment, intimidated a bit, and we could get a few licks in before they realized we're just a pile of idiots running at them. (laughter)
Laura: I like it.
Marisha: So we're basically gonna be like three kids Little Rascals-style on each other's shoulders with a giant coat?
Sam: But that could be the diversion, at least.
Marisha: Okay, well then, why don't-- I actually like this idea. Why don't we have a few of our stealthy members, why don't we have the twins be in the shadows, and picking people off while--
Laura: That's true, 'cause I've got range, so that makes sense.
Marisha: Right, why don't we have some of our ranged people-- I'll transform. I can transform into-- how about a giant scorpion? That sounds fun.
Sam: Can you transform into anything?
Marisha: I can transform into beasts. They have to be beasts.
Sam: How about the type of beast that we know would scare them, like that big triceratops thing that we saw with the big metal thing on it.
Marisha: I can be a rhinoceros-- I can be, like-- Can I do dinosaurs? I can be a dinosaur, right? That's a new thing I can be, right?
Matt: Up to a certain point.
Liam: What if you were a scorpion, with a dragonborn tail sliding around and a gnome on your front leg and a--
Marisha: Well here's, oh wait wait, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, hang on, hang on, hang on, this might be crazy-- wonder what would happen if I drank that weird yellowish potion? While I'm a monster?
Laura: No, It could be poison, though.
Marisha: But I'm wondering if you can, like, if I can transform into a monster and then you with Polymorph can maybe just transform.
Orion: Stop talking, stop talking! Hold on. (laughter)
Marisha: You don't have to snap at me.
Orion: No, no, no, you're brilliant, your highness.
Marisha: Oh, thank you. I mean.
Orion: I have an idea, I have an idea.
Liam: We're off the rails, here.
Laura: Tell it to us, Tiberius, what's the idea?
Sam: Does it involve shitting on a bed? (laughter)
Orion: Eventually, actually, yes.
Taliesin: Aren't you empty yet?
Orion: This is what's going to happen. As far as we know, they're all duergar up there, correct?
Laura: Mostly, except for the mind flayers. And another big monster probably, they might have--
Ashley: Which I saw in a vision. I think that's what's controlling them
Laura: Oh no, that's K'varn. No, no, no, he's at the other one.
Ashley: Sorry, read it wrong.
Orion: This is what will happen. Those who can go stealth, we will creep up there. I will go invisible myself. I will be in front. You closely behind me.
Sam: He has a name.
Orion: Vax. There we go. You closely behind me, and whoever else can stealth follows suit. I will cast Alter Self and turn myself into their god.
Sam: Their god?
All: K'varn?
Marisha: But you don't know what he looks like.
Laura: Oh, or into that other thingie.
Orion: I absolutely know what he looks like.
Matt: You mean Laduguer?
Orion: We just saw his statue.
Marisha: Well. that's not K'varn though.
Orion: But that's who they worship. As I give my, whatever the hell I come up with to say at that particular time--
Sam: Maybe you should think it first, think it through first.
Orion: As soon as the mind flayers catch on, and I turn to Clarota, and I turn to Kima, that's when all of you will strike at them first. The rest of you will wait 'til I shoot off a couple of Fireballs at the duergar once they figure out we're full of crap. 'Cause I'm sure that might happen unless I'm super convincing, which I hope that's the case-- But I think that's our best bet to keep a certain element of surprise.
Marisha: So wait, so wait, are you going to be their god, and I'm still going to also be a crazy monster, as like your pet crazy monster, with our stealthy team, or just--
Taliesin: I think the only thing better than their god would be their god on top of a giant scorpion.
Laura: Ooh!
Marisha: Ooh!
Liam: I have faith in you, Tiberius.
Marisha: You'll be like Xerxes.
Ashley: Can I cast, 'cause I've been wanting to use Thaumaturgy. Which can make your voice three times as louder.
Matt: At the moment he would be speaking, yeah.
Ashley: At the moment he'd be speaking, okay, so let's do that.
Laura: Oh, that's going to be so cool.
Marisha: Some theatrics.
Liam: I love it when a good plan comes together.
Sam: So some of us are stealthing, you're being a big god who talks loud and is riding a scorpion.
Ashley: So maybe I'll tuck behind him, on top of you the scorpion, and then when you're getting ready to talk I'll just (whoosh) and then you'll-- your voice will be, you know, you'll have--
Liam: Yeah, that's good, that's good.
Sam: How about this-- so, just to clarify, are we all going up the same staircase, or are we going up two separate staircases, Vex and Vax--
Laura: I think we should just go up the same staircase. There's too many of them. If we split up we could just all die.
Sam: You don't know what-- there could be a million rooms up there.
Liam: We have no idea what's up there, but Tiberius has got a plan, I like it.
Laura: If he's the god, we just go in behind him as the god.
Ashley: What if we did like your Dimension Door? Is it too not very god-like if he's coming up the staircase like, hey?
Sam: The Dimension Door's off the table.
Liam: Tiberius, Tiberius. Tibs.
Sam: But don't use the god thing. But don't use the god thing until we get to the big group. The big thing, if you see a guard, don't turn into a god, you gotta see like more than five people before you turn into a god.
Liam: Tiberius.
Orion: Yes, Vax?
Liam: Do you intend to go up one of the other stairways? I believe this one by the entrance, the secret entrance we came in, will afford us the element of surprise. Do you think you want to go up one of the others?
Orion: No, let's go up that one.
Liam: And make a distraction, right? Your plan is to make a distraction.
Orion: Yes, of course.
Liam: You're a brave dragonborn.
Marisha: I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace on the party. Everyone stay close.
Liam: Who's the stealth party, not you, you and me, you.
Marisha: Well, all of us, all of us I guess, until we get upstairs.
Laura: Potentially all of us will be stealthed except for Tiberius, and you who is a scorpion, and you who's riding behind Tiberius.
Ashley: I'm riding on her, so I probably won't be rolling for stealth.
Matt: Uh.
Ashley: Just kidding.
Matt: You'll be rolling.
Ashley: I probably won't roll well, just putting it out there.
Matt: You hear in the back of your mind this subtle, soft, echoing chuckle. "You're all crazy. I like it." (laughter)
Matt: At which point, Kima, who's listening to all this with a look of kind of awe and curiosity says, "You know, for once? I actually agree with the thing." (laughter)
Matt: "All right." Takes her greatsword in her hands. "Lead the way."
Ashley: So you guys are stealthing up first?
Marisha: We all have Pass Without a Trace as long as you stand close enough.
Liam: Wait, wait for the inspiration.
Sam: I have some inspiration dice to give out, that I can give out as bonus actions. Can I give it out before we go into battle?
Matt: I would say like momentarily, right beforehand.
Sam: Okay, good to know. But I can't mass give it out, just have to give it to one person.
Matt: It's one of those things where it has to be in the moment when the adrenaline's pumping, I think, for it to last into the combat.
Sam: Okay, and do we want to send Clarota and Kima off through a different staircase so we have at least a backup plan?
Laura: No, no, no stick together. Too big of a group of an army upstairs to split us up.
Liam: Don't split the party.
Sam: In those action movies, when there's one guy who goes away for a while, he comes back at the end and saves the day. If we did that--
Laura: That's not going to be us!
Liam: We few, we happy few. (laughter)
Liam: About to go and do something very stupid. Let's do it.
Matt: So you are venturing up which stairway?
Laura: The secret one, the one by-- in the storage room.
Matt: All right. So. You guys--
Marisha: We got this. We got this.
Laura: Oh no, Grog fell over. Oh my gosh.
Marisha: It's been a good day. What are you going to say? Are you thinking about this? Think about something.
Orion: Okay.
Marisha: Start thinking about this now.
Liam: There are rooms up there.
Taliesin: What's the name of the god again?
Marisha: Laduguer.
Ashley: Can I take off my armor right now?
Matt: You'd become a soft target. All right, you guys all make your way up, and you're all squeezing into this tiny, tiny room. You're all shoulder-to-shoulder, essentially. You come up to the top area, there's a small box, and there is just a single stone door.
Laura: Check for traps.
Liam: Excuse me, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, excuse me Kima, sorry, sorry, All right, my hands are on the door. I'm going to check for traps on this door. I get a 21.
Matt: Okay, you take a moment and you place your hand along this stone surface. You find that there's a low hum to it.
Liam: Careful, careful, careful.
Matt: And you can tell that there's a small, almost like a thin whisper of string laid across the very top of the stone, where the wall meets it.
Liam: Of course I can, of course I can. I'm going to take care of this, hold on. Yeah, this is thieves' tools, correct? 26.
Matt: 26, okay. You come up and you find that this is a very, very fine hair trigger. This is actually a partial enchantment as part of a magical trap. You know that with the slightest hint of false vibration to it, the door shifting or hitting it in the wrong place will trigger whatever this trap is. And so you bring your tools up, you manage to place one at the base of each point at where this arcane silver thread lies across. Simultaneously, you take your daggers and place them underneath the thread at each ends and sever them both at the same time. The thin whisper of a string just slowly glides down and vanishes into a small sparkle of light.
Sam: Cut the red wire.
Liam: I'm just going to lay my ear on the door and see what I can hear. That is 21.
Matt: Hearing it, you hear what sounds like a low mutter of somewhere in the neighbourhood of ten to 15 low voices, and the slow, small shuffling of many, many, many, many footsteps.
Liam: Shuffling, you said? And if I listen for a moment, do I-- does it continue?
Matt: It, kind of, couple of footsteps, some talking, soft footprints. You can hear the scraping of metal--
Liam: And it's the only way we can go is through this door, right? We're all smooshed into this hallway--
Matt: There is a hallway this way.
Laura: Oh, so we stealth down the other hall, we try.
Liam: So I mooshed everyone away from this hall.
Matt: The whispers and voices aren't directly on the other side of this wall, they're just in that room echoing through, but you do hear a lot of people there. All right, so, what are you doing?
Laura: Well, well, stealthing down that hallway. Can we check for traps, check for traps, I look, I'm perceiving.
Matt: (laughs) Roll for perceiving (laughter)
Liam: 23 for Vax.
Laura: Oh, I get twice that, good. Oh, good, that was way better.
Matt: (laughs)
Laura: Ten.
Matt: Okay, no traps.
Laura: Yay!
Matt: You both glide your way up and peek around the corner. What you see immediately are six duergar all stationed in this hallway guarding what looks like two large doors and entrance to this main chamber. And they're all just standing there, weapons ready, looking around.
Sam: Wait, which is the main chamber that you just--
Matt: This big chamber here that you--
Sam: Oh, that we were listening to at the door.
Liam: Vax sneaks back to the group and motions Tiberius over, and Keyleth over.
Sam: We're doing this?
Liam: One moment, one moment. Lightning, Lightning, who knows Lightning?
Marisha: Are you gonna try to Lightning Bolt an entire line?
Liam: Do you know the magic of lightning? I've seen you do it before, I've seen you.
Marisha: I do know it right now.
Liam: You know it? Anyone who knows Lightning, I've seen it done on the battlefield with us, person to person to person.
Sam: I can do it.
Matt: Who is up once again, clearing his throat in your presence.
Sam: Hi! Scanlan here.
Liam: Scanlan, you know how to harness the power of electricity.
Sam: I don't wanna brag, but I'm a regular Ben Franklin over here. He's a guy, he's a gnome I knew once.
Marisha: Scanlan, can you and I focus our Call Lightning spells together? To Lightning these--
Sam: I mean, mine's so fricking powerful.
Liam: If Scanlan and one of the others does Lightning at the same time and it goes through that line, we could drop them all at once.
Laura: But that's noisy, they'll come out.
Liam: It's not that noisy, it's not like armor banging around.
Laura: I think it's gonna be noisy, it's not a stealthy attack.
Taliesin: It's a quick way to get rid of six people, though.
Orion: Oh, is that what we need to do?
Liam: There's a row of duergar around the corner, they're all in a line like Radio City, we just-- if I can get-- Scanlan, if you-- what about you, Keyleth? Do I remember light-- or do you bring it down from above? Tiberius.
Orion: What, what?
Sam: Do you want me to shock 'em?
Orion: Oh, I have an idea. Okay, I'll peek around.
Matt: Okay, make a stealth check.
Orion: Sweet.
Marisha: You have plus ten because of my Pass Without a Trace.
Liam: You've got six duergar in a row. Is there anything you can do that's--
Orion: 27.
Matt: That's when you see this long row of duergar that are all kind of armored and ready, guarding the front of this chamber.
Orion: I cast Watery Sphere at the end of the last guy and create a giant ball.
Liam: Wait, you're doing it now?
Orion: What does it look like, Vax?
Matt: Okay, so this giant water sphere appears. At which side of the wall?
Orion: On the last guy. Yeah, and I draw it towards us.
Liam: Vax is grabbing the gnome and tossing him out to the right, out here at the front of the group.
Orion: And I stop at the last guy.
Matt: Okay, as the water sphere begins to pull in. Saving throws, what's your DC?
Orion: My spell DC, 17.
Matt: This is a dexterity save? All right.
Sam: One at a time.
Matt: All of them fail! (cheering)
Marisha: This is gonna be cool, this is gonna be cool. It's gonna put them all in one spot.
Sam: They were already in a line.
Marisha: No, now we can electrocute them and they're wet!
Matt: There is now an entire clustered sphere of water that is containing a mishmash of duergar.
Marisha: Lightning Bolt!
Matt: Call Lightning. All right, so, as Keyleth, you step forward, out in the hallway, you bring your arm up and there's this small cluster of dark clouds beginning to form and swirl up on the top of the 20-foot hallway. As it swirls, you bring your arm downward, and there's a sudden crack of thunder, a loud blasting sound that echoes through the hallway. As the lightning strikes the center of the sphere, the water itself bursts as the actual cacophonous blast of the lightning loosely shakes the aquatic sphere. However, go ahead and roll damage.
Marisha: Do I get any more damage because of the--
Matt: You get an additional two dice of damage to each one of the duergar because they are contained in the water.
Orion: Yeah!
Marisha: So 5d10?
Matt: Correct.
Marisha: Do I roll for each one?
Matt: You just roll once, and that's across the board for all of them, and they are at a disadvantage because they are in the sphere.
Marisha: Oh, and they're at a disadvantage?
Orion: Yeah, yeah, because I'm like holding them up.
Marisha: All right.
Matt: It's really funny, because two of them rolled 20s in a row, but they're at a disadvantage.
Marisha: Nice. Not too shabby. So we have ten, 19 plus 18, bringing it to 28 plus three, 31 plus one. 32.
Matt: Okay. So the sphere explodes, the actual stone on the ground you can feel shake and shudder with the impact of the lightning storm. All but one of the duergar are blown apart and scattered across the wall Akira-style, just (splat) against the walls. One of them is still in the center of the sphere, now looking charred and burnt, and eyes wide open with anger and frustration.
Marisha: Scanlan, go!
Sam: I say, (chants) you ugly, you ugly, yo mama says you ugly! And I cast Vicious Mockery. (laughter)
Matt: He rolled a 14 vs the DC which I think is--
Sam: 19.
Matt: All right, how much total did you do?
Sam: Just a five.
Matt: How much did you do, total?
Marisha: 32, total.
Matt: Hold on. So as the duergar is currently held aloft in this aquatic sphere, half-charred and burnt with pieces of his friends floating in the water around him, he hears through this kind of warbling sound, "You ugly, you ugly," and he sees everyone kind of step in the hallway clapping with you, and he kind of looks around at himself, looks at his situation... and eventually just gives up and takes a big old gulp of water and drowns inside the aquatic sphere. (laughter)
Sam: Yes! I shamed him to death
Ashley: Amazing.
Marisha: (laughs) What a terrible way to die.
Matt: Good news is, you guys royally screwed over six duergar, one of which you shamed him to death. (laughter)
Matt: You have definitely, however, announced your presence at the chamber.
Liam: Vax spanks Tiberius on the tail and says, get ready to deity! Going stealth.
Marisha: I say-- I go, get on my back, get on my back, and I piggyback him.
Matt: You transform?
Orion: I do.
Matt: No, Marisha, did you transform?
Marisha: Well I'm piggybacking him, just now. I'm literally just piggybacking Tiberius waiting.
Matt: Okay, so Tiberius, you leap onto her back.
Orion: Mm-hm, and I cast Alter Self, and I turn to--
Liam: Scanlan, Vex.
Ashley: I'm going to cast the thing on him.
Matt: Okay, so you cast Thaumaturgy on him to give him a vocal emphasis, a roaring, booming voice. Do you stay with him or do you move back with the rest of the group?
Marisha: Oh, oh, Pike Pike Pike Pike Pike. What kind of animal would this god use? Would you know what kind of animal the duergar would worship? Do you know?
Orion: It's a religion check.
Matt: Religion check.
Marisha: What kind of animals he might like? You know, check out-- you know, animals.
Ashley: 14.
Matt: You have no idea. You know the deity exists, you don't know of any sort of animal, beast or creature symbolism that would befit a duergar god.
Ashley: I have no idea.
Marisha: I guess a scorpion, a scorpion sounds good? Scorpion. Giant Scorpion.
Matt: Keyleth's form shifts. As you see a bunch of arachnid-like legs sprawl out the side of her torso, her form condenses into a dark, chitinous shell as two giant claws form out the side of her body, and a giant poison stinger curls up from behind. Tiberius kind of holds on during the transformation--
Ashley: I'm going to go back, because if they see me, then they'll know something's fishy.
Matt: All right, the rest of you are here. So. You feel this kind of divine energy cascade around your throat. You can feel your vocal cords themselves are temporarily infused with some sort of divine presence. You've transformed yourself now into the visage of this duergar deity. Standing at probably a good-- what height are you going at?
Orion: How tall are the--
Matt: The duergar are about four-and-a-half feet tall.
Orion: So let's make him six feet tall.
Matt: All right, six-foot-tall duergar standing there.
Laura: The two of us get back by the other twin door, and get ready to bust into that entrance.
Sam: I'm with them. We're the stealth party.
Liam: I'm in fact nudging Grog away from this door towards the front towards Tiberius. I don't know, they're not that strong.
Matt: What are you doing? Grog says, "Which way, which way do I go?"
Liam: Vax kicks Grog in the butt and sends him forward. Go help Tiberius!
Matt: "I'm walking back for you."
Laura: Grog, don't do that. Not that far. Grog, come back, because if they see him--
Orion: No, stay in the corner, Grog. Wait 'til I say help me, and then come kill everything.
Matt: He looks like he's listening. Mostly. (laughter)
Marisha: Back him up. Back him up.
Matt: You hear shifting in the doorway from the front where you guys are. What's the plan? What's doing what?
Sam: Who's going in first?
Orion: Is this going to be the entrance where we're going in?
Laura: Yeah you bust in and be a god.
Marisha: Oh, are we busting in?
Laura: When you give it, we'll go in the other way.
Marisha: Fuck if I know.
Orion: That's your job. Bust the door open.
Matt: All right, go ahead and make an athletics check.
Liam: I'm simultaneously checking our door for-- no, I already did. It's unlocked, and untrapped. Never mind.
Marisha: Giant scorpion. Athletics. Plus my dex, I'm assuming?
Matt: No, plus your strength.
Marisha: Strength, that's pretty cool, though. 22.
Matt: A 22.
Marisha: I rolled a 19.
Matt: All right, the doors splinter open. The doors are actually broken off the hinges.
Orion: As that happens, I cast Light and I cast Prestidigitation.
Sam: Concentrate. Don't cast too much shit.
Orion: I can't hear what's going on. I hear some annoyances in the background as I cast Prestidigitation to make my voice louder.
Laura: No, she already did it. It's three times louder than it normally would be.
Orion: Oh, shit.
Marisha: So just keep focusing on your Light.
Matt: As you guys come bursting in--
Liam: Holy shit.
Laura: Yeah, there's a lot of them.
Marisha: Maybe do some Prestidigitation where you move shit around.
Ashley: Oh ho ho. What!
Marisha: Oh! Hello, everybody.
Liam: (Grog voice) I would like to rage.
Laura: (Grog voice) I would like to rage.
Laura: Oh, no. Basilisks!
Liam: What?
Laura: Those thingies!
Marisha: Oh, that's right, they have those pet basilisks. Remember?
Matt: So the doors burst open and you guys come through. All of the duergar stand there with their weapons at the ready. You can see in the back, on this raised platform, where the cloth stops, there is two thrones, at the top two duergar sitting on the thrones at the ready. You can see two kind of lizard-like creatures in the back on chained leashes. However, all of the duergar that are ready to strike as you burst through, take a step back, looking extremely confused about what's going on.
Orion: (shouts) Silence! All of you, silence!
Sam: We weren't talking.
Orion: Who knows who I am?
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Marisha: Get it. Get it. Get it.
Liam: Yep. Yep yep yep yep. Vax is quietly moving along the back wall.
Sam: Our door is open?
Liam: It is now.
Laura: Yeah we're going to try to stealth in and sneak attack them.
Orion: 16.
Laura: Oh god. Oh god.
Matt: Okay. The duergar in the front take another step back, looking both frightened and awed. The one nearest to you takes his hammer and throws it to the ground, and takes a knee.
Orion: Well, it looks like there's one saved soul at this point in time.
Matt: At which point two of the other ones nearby kind of look at each other and look back at the one who's on on the ground. They put their hammers down, and they kneel as well. At which point, in the back, you see the two throned figures stand up. One of which you can barely see in the dim light outside of your Light spell that's currently gleaming above you. This long, almost-touching-the-floor black, braided beard that drags right over this heavy-set plate of jagged black iron metal. A giant sword in his hand. "You're kneeling below this false idol."
Orion: Silence!
Matt: "This imposter!"
Orion: As I cast-- As I say silence, I blow a big plume of fire out of my mouth, and I cast Control Flames.
Matt: So the light (pff).
Orion: I don't cast Control Flames. I just do the Fireball for effect. I don't do Control Flames, because that's a concentration spell.
Matt: All right, so you do Fireball. Where are you casting Fireball? Or just doing it to do it?
Orion: Just (fwoosh).
Matt: Plume of flame. Roll an intimidation check.
Taliesin: You guys, what are you doing right now?
Liam: I'm moving along the back wall. I want that illithid.
Orion: 18.
Matt: Okay. Make a stealth check. Who else is going in there with him?
Laura: I go in and stand at the walls next to the door.
Liam: 32.
Matt: Okay, your stealth roll?
Ashley: I'm so stressed.
Marisha: I know! I feel like I'm going to have a heart attack.
Matt: So you rolled a--
Orion: 18.
Matt: Okay, you can see this figure-- which you are gathering at this point is probably King Murghol-- still holding his sword aloft, looks back towards his wife who's sitting in the throne next to him, who is just standing up kind of confused.
Orion: That's right, boy. I am Laduguer! You know, and you know your deeds as of late might upset my rest.
Matt: All of the duergar are now looking over their shoulders back towards the king and watching this transpire between the two of you.
Orion: (shouts) All of you, lay down your arms!
Laura: 32.
Matt: 32. You're moving in, everyone else staying in the hallway?
Ashley: I'm not moving. I'm like this!
Matt: As you guys push in further and further, the group that are kneeling move back in sheer fear and horror. At which point the king takes a step down off of the throne area onto the next platform, weapons still at his side and says, "Men, I've trained you. I've raised you. I've fed you and I've kept you alive."
Orion: And I don't care for you to finish that sentence! I cast Fireball. Right fucking-- Right on him.
Sam: That's an attack right there.
Orion: Of course it is!
Matt: So the blast hits him and a 20-foot radius that will grab everything in that radius. Including you. So go ahead and roll damage. 8d6.
Liam: It's all right.
Marisha: 8d6.
Liam: Heal me, Pike, heal me. Heal me in three minutes, heal me. This is gonna hurt. This is gonna sting.
Marisha: Oh, god damn. Come on, you got this. You got this, Vax.
Sam: You want it to be a lot, but not too much. (laughter)
Liam: A little less than 55.
Orion: Uh, 25.
Matt: 25, okay.
Orion: Oh, I'm sorry, 30.
Matt: Okay, good. So it explodes around them. You see all of them kind of shield themselves from the blast of flame. As it spreads out--
Liam: Wait, I'm doing the rogue thing that I can't remember the name for.
Laura: Uncanny Dodge?
Marisha: Uncanny Dodge?
Liam: No, it's something else.
Orion: Quickly. Quickly.
Matt: So while you're looking that up-- The duergar brace themselves and they have an innate natural resistance against things magical in nature.
Liam: Evasion!
Matt: So they all take the brunt of the damage, however, it does not do as much as you hoped to the group. All of them look hurt, but definitely not taken out of the fight. The two lizard creatures you now have a better look at, you do see it's familiar. They have numerous sets of legs, and though the chains hold them at bay, both of them glance up instinctually. I want you, Tiberius, to make two constitution saving throws.
Sam: Traps.
Orion: Yes.
Liam: DM. Evasion, if I make a success I get half-damage, if I fail I get-- If I fail, I get half-damage, if I succeed I get no damage. I think I failed. I got a nine.
Matt: Yeah you take half-damage. So you take the-- What was the total damage on your Fireball? So you take 15 points of fire damage. So as you glance about the room now, you look over and both of these lizard creatures kind of look towards you. You kind of look back and forth-- there's a slight gleam in their eye. Suddenly you feel your form begin to tighten up, instant. You are considered restrained, which means you are at disadvantage to all your attack rolls and ability checks for right now.
Orion: Hold on, I still have a bonus attack I can do before that happens, correct?
Matt: No, this is as it's happening. Your turn is still happening.
Orion: I got it.
Matt: This is all kind of a fluid moment. Things happen as they happen until initiative is being rolled, which is now. So everyone roll initiative.
Marisha: Sneaky sneaky.
Laura: Oh, great.
Matt: All right, so, 25 to 20?
Sam: Natural 20.
Matt: Plus your--
Sam: Nothing.
Matt: Plus nothing for dex. Okay.
Sam: Oh, for dex. Plus nothing.
Matt: Okay, so 25 to 20?
Taliesin: 23.
Liam: 21.
Matt: 21, all right, all right.
Taliesin: Yeah. Sneak attack.
Matt: All righty, 20 to 15?
Laura: 19.
Orion: 17.
Matt: All right, 15 to ten?
Marisha: I'm nine.
Ashley: Five. Not to brag.
Marisha: (laughs) Big number five.
Matt: All right.
Marisha: I just noticed your shirt. It's really great.
Sam: Guys, tune in every week for this kind of intense action.
Laura: Unless we're all dead next week. In which case--
Liam: -- Mama put the coins on my eyes.
Matt: All right, that brings us to top of the round. Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: I'm going to hold off until-- I'm actually going to delay my turn until post-Pike.
Orion: Can I still yell out shit while this is happening? Even though it isn't my turn?
Matt: I mean, you can yell like one thing.
Taliesin: I'm loud and I've got range, so I'm going to let the room fill, and then I'm going to come in and get some.
Orion: As this is all going down, I'm going to yell, those who want to live, throw down your arms. That's what I do.
Matt: Okay. That brings us back to the top. Vax, you're up.
Liam: Okay, I use my bonus action to click my boots of haste together. And I tap-dance over to the illithid, and I'm going to use two daggers to stab him in his eyeballs.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: First one hits, it's 18.
Matt: It is a critical because it does not see you and has not acted yet this combat.
Liam: Yeah it is. So I just take my keen dagger and I shove it in his eyeball. 1d4 is two, plus--
Marisha: Feel like I'm going to have a heart attack.
Taliesin: We're going to be fine. It's nothing we can't handle.
Marisha: Nothing we can't handle.
Liam: 19, 28, plus 36 is the first dagger into his eyeball.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Second dagger also hits for a little less, for seven points of fire damage in his other eyeball.
Matt: All right. Gotcha. So the first one actually jams into one of its eyes. It didn't even see you, it recoils back, slapping your hand back out of the way. The other dagger strikes and just gleans off its shoulder. However, it turns around with its other eye and it definitely knows you're there.
Liam: I'd like to circulate my hands to kind of carve out the eyeball area. (laughter)
Matt: No, it pushed you off.
Liam: Yeah, okay, okay, it's all right.
Matt: All right. That brings us to Grog.
Sam: (Grog voice) I would like to rage.
Liam: (Grog voice) I would like to go to a whore house.
Matt: He goes into a rage. And Grog is going to go ahead and take his axe with the chain on it and throw it toward the first duergar he sees, which is right here. Throws it. All right, that is a-- That's going to miss. He rolled a four. Swings past. He's going to make an athletics check to see if he can bring it back. That he succeeds. So he throws the axe. It swings past the duergar, clangs to the ground, uses his chain, he yanks it back, catches it in his hand. His turn is spent, however. Next up is Scanlan.
Sam: I step into the room, lining myself up with those two pig, creature, beast things. In a line. Yeah. Can I also catch the king or no?
Matt: No, it has to be a line. It has to go straight.
Sam: Going for the guys. I don't want to scald you. You're already hurting. I'm going to go straight across the piggies and make them squeal with Lightning.
Matt: All right. At the start of your turn--
Sam: Oh shit, there's a trap.
Matt: No, at the start of your turn you come up and the creature looks over and you guys make eye contact. You weren't averting your gaze. Go ahead and make a constitution save.
Liam: Saving throw, saving throw. Come on, Scanlan, you lucky motherfucker! Roll high.
Sam: 17, plus what?
Matt: Plus your constitution modifier.
Sam: 19.
Matt: All right, so, as it glances over at you, there's a shine in its eye, and you feel all of a sudden your form, for a second, tense, and you shrug off the effect, untouched by it. Now, go ahead and take your turn.
Sam: I cast Lightning on the two beasts. In a straight line.
Matt: Okay, so you pull back and you unleash a lightning bolt. It goes streaking across the room.
Sam: If I can get the king, I'll try.
Matt: Unfortunately, he's just out of the line array, but it does streak across and blast both of these now visibly basilisks in front of you. You hit automatically. Just go ahead and roll damage. (laughter)
Marisha: Oh sweet, sweet dice rolls.
Liam: Let it rain!
Marisha: Let it rain d6s from the sky!
Sam: 29.
Matt: 29. One fails its saving throw, one makes it. So 29 damage to one, and 14 to the other.
Sam: And then, for bonus action, I inspire Vax with a little ditty.
Matt: All right.
Sam: (sings) I want to sing a song of inspiration, of inspiration! (laughter)
Matt: All righty, that's it. That ends Scanlan's turn. King Murghol's turn, now. King Murghol is going to-- It sees this blast of lightning streak past now, as it blasts, just barely passing in front of it, hitting both of his pet basilisks. Now seeing that there's, like, a full army between himself and the current intruders, one of which is visibly stiffening, he glances over at this tiny gnome individual, who now gave loose to this bolt of energy. Grabs his blade with both hands and goes running towards you with an angry-- but he uses a bonus action, quickly, to pull out a vial, pop a cork, chug it, shatter the glass on the ground. As he does, you can see his arms actually billow and grow extremely strong and thick with muscle.
Marisha: What color was the vial?
Laura: What color was the vial?
Matt: This was purplish in color. He then runs forward. And is going to take his turn, swinging at Scanlan.
Sam: As he does, I sing (sings) Dodge that sexy attack-oh white boy. (laughter)
Sam: I sing my-- what is it called? Counter-- Cutting Word-- no, yes, what? Cutting Words! And I try to distract him as he's attacking me. What is that, a d8?
Matt: A d8 off of his first attack.
Sam: Five.
Matt: Five. Okay, well, he rolled a 20, which brings it down, oh, a total of 20, which brings it down to 15. What's your armor class?
Sam: 14.
Matt: Oh. Second strike is a 13. Third strike is a 12. Wow, he just can't hit at all this turn. But, however, the one strike he does get on you, the sword comes down, streaks across the front of you, and as you're finishing your last, final note of that song, you take 18 points of slashing damage.
Sam: Okay, okay, okay.
Ashley: Where you at?
Sam: I'm fine.
Ashley: Where are you at?
Sam: I'm fine. I've got more than him.
Matt: That ends his turn. This brings us back to Vex!
Laura: That's me! I cast Hunter's Mark! Actually, I just transfer it, because the other one died. I transfer it to the king. And then I cast-- First I want to move Trinket over and-- oh no, I can only move Trinket. Okay, first I'm gonna cast Conjure Barrage. It's a 60-foot cone. So I want to see how many of them I can get.
Matt: You can, you can get-- let's see. That'll get everybody.
Laura: Can I angle it so I don't hit my buddies?
Matt: You can angle it in a way that will-- well, if you wanna get the king in it, you're going to hit these two here. And Grog.
Laura: All right, I'll hit them.
Matt: Okay, so, you will be able to hit everything in that row. So go for it. How does the effect on that work?
Laura: I roll 3d8.
Matt: All right, so go ahead and roll 3d8.
Laura: That was on a corner. Oh good! 17.
Matt: 17, okay. And what's the effect on the spell, like what do they roll against?
Laura: They roll a dexterity saving throw.
Matt: Dexterity saving throw. King makes his, with a 20. So he takes half-damage for it, or no damage?
Laura: Half as much, yeah.
Matt: Okay, so what was the total again? It was-- What was the total originally? It was-- what was the total?
Laura: The total? Was 17.
Matt: 17. Okay, so that is eight damage to the king.
Laura: Plus a Hunter's Mark.
Matt: Right, so roll the additional one on that.
Laura: Four.
Matt: Four, gotcha. All right. The basilisk also does not make its save. What's the DC on this?
Laura: DC. What do you mean?
Matt: Your spell DC. At the top of your spell page.
Laura: Yes. It's 14.
Matt: 14.
Laura: Oh, I did get a-- I didn't add my spell attack bonus! Should I have done that?
Matt: No, that's just to hit something with a spell.
Laura: Okay, cool.
Matt: All right, so basilisk in front makes it, so it takes the eight damage. Okay, the rest of the duergar, they do make their saves, they take half damage. However, with the spray of arrows that comes flying out of the front of your bow, you manage to take out five duergar in one swipe. The others ones remain, damaged but still standing. Also, now dexterity saving throw for you, Tiberius, and Grog.
Marisha: Natural 20.
Orion: 19.
Matt: Nice. So both you guys take eight damage. Grog fails, Grog takes 17.
Laura: I'm sorry, Grog.
Matt: "It's all right." All right, Vex, is that the end of your turn?
Laura: Oh, I move Trinket in, and I want to-- If I can get him to illithid, I want to get Trinket close, like kind of behind the queen. No, no, I want to get him near. That way he can flank.
Matt: Okay, all right. That ends your turn. It is now Lady Kima's turn.
Sam: Ooh, I forgot about her.
Matt: Kima rushes in angrily. She has to make a saving throw. Succeeds against the basilisk, as it glances past. Rushes forward, in combat with both King Murghol and the basilisk. However, as she goes in for King Murghol, screaming, the blade of the greatsword arcing across the air with a divine glowing energy, you see it aiming for the king, but then looks to her side and sees this dangerous lizard creature, recognizing it in a moment, she changes her trajectory and swings next to the lizard with her first strike. That is a-- that hits. And that strike does just enough damage. She cleaves that basilisk in two with her first strike. With her first strike, using the inertia, she turns around and strikes at King Murghol. However, King Murghol, seeing her come forward, takes his sword up and manages to parry hers to the side. Both of them lock for a second as he steps into her and kind of glares into her face. "Oh, you're supposed to be downstairs for playtime." Pushes her off with his blade..
Marisha: Playtime? I don't-- (laughs) I know, all the ladies are like 'ew'.
Matt: That brings us to Queen Ulara's turn. Queen Ulara is now standing over there with Trinket towards her back. As she instinctually does this, she goes ahead and reaches up, places her hand on the front of her robes. You can see this duergar woman with kind of long, reddish hair that she's let flow to the back, to the small of her back. She stands up out of the throne. As she puts her hand on her chest, her form shimmers, much like you saw earlier on Tiberius, in your earlier battle. She moves back to there.
Orion: As she does that, I try to Counterspell it.
Matt: That's a reaction?
Orion: Yep.
Matt: Okay. So let's go ahead and do the contested roll.
Orion: Contested roll.
Sam: That was almost the name of this show. Not as catchy.
Orion: DC equals ten plus the spell's level.
Matt: Okay. So the DC is 12. Go ahead and you roll that.
Orion: DC is 13. It's a third-level spell. Right?
Matt: Blur is second-level.
Orion: Oh, I thought Counter-- Okay, I see.
Matt: Yes. So, Counterspell. Go ahead and-- Oh-- interrupt a creature in process of casting a spell. If the creature is casting a spell-- third level or lower, it fails and has no effect. So, yeah, it just counters it entirely. So, the-- her form begins to shimmer for a second. All of a sudden, Tiberius, your attempt to go ahead and counter the spell, that burst of energy you're trying to put through the Blur vanishes. She looks back at you.
Orion: What do you think you're doing, lass?
Sam: You still trying to be a god?
Orion: I'm in that form still. (laughter)
Matt: Yeah. So with her sorcery points expended on that quick cast, she turns around for her main action, puts out her fingers, and you see these blasts of blue energy begin to rocket out from her fingertips, across the room, in what is a Chain Lightning.
Liam: Shit. He's got the iPhone out.
Matt: So, this'll be towards-- actually, this'd be towards you, Vex, Kima, and Scanlan.
Laura: All right.
Liam: Did you say Vex or Vax?
Matt: Yeah, Vex and Vax, both of you.
Laura: Wait, you're all the way over there.
Sam: Yeah, you're all the way over somewhere else, right?
Matt: Over there, yeah. Chain Lightning, man. It's a bitch. All right. All right, so. Vax, go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw.
Liam: Not good. Seven.
Matt: Seven, all right.
Liam: Can I use Evasion, or-- Uncanny Dodge or Evasion?
Sam: I gave you some dice. I gave you, I gave you some dice.
Liam: You did give me some dice.
Sam: It's not going to be enough, though.
Liam: So now I'm at 13, but can I use Evasion or Uncanny Dodge? Evasion is for area effects, Uncanny Dodge is--
Matt: Well, you've already used one for the area effect, the other one reduces the damage by half.
Liam: All right, Uncanny Dodge.
Matt: Okay, so you're reducing the damage by half?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: Okay, so instead, you take 18 points of lightning damage. However, both Vex and Scanlan and Kima all have to make dexterity saving throws as well. She makes hers.
Sam: Not great. 14. I have no dexterity.
Laura: 16.
Matt: 16, okay. So you took, was it 18 lightning damage, I said?
Liam: Oh, I didn't add any dexterity. I add a 9 to what I got, which means I'm at 22.
Matt: Just, you mean, your dexterity modifier? 22? Okay, then you would've taken half damage, make it quarter damage, so you take half of that even. So keep that in mind when you make your dexterity saving throw. So, that would give you total how much damage? So, it was 18 you took, right?
Liam: Yeah, and we halved it to nine. Five?
Matt: So, 36 damage to Scanlan and to Kima, and to you, Vex. 36 points of lightning damage. That ends her turn. Tiberius, you're up. So you, it's your turn now, as you're now on top of the scorpion still.
Ashley: It's okay.
Marisha: You're on top of me. I'm holding you!
Ashley: I got you.
Orion: Cool. This is-- there's still on the altar that's raised above-- and all that.
Taliesin: You've got a problem down there, to be fair.
Orion: Where we're at?
Taliesin: You've got the witch problem to deal with.
Matt: What do you got, Tiberius? Quick, before you miss your turn.
Orion: I shall miss nothing. I'm going to stay right where I'm at.
Matt: All right.
Orion: I'm going to snicker, and I will (laughs) hand out, put out my hand, and give my little ring a rub, and let out a Fireball from it, right where no one else but these buttholes will get hurt.
Matt: All right, so (laughs), I'd say probably a 20-foot radius around would put it about there.
Liam: (Tiberius voice) What is the Common word for it?
All: (Tiberius voice) Butthole.
Matt: So, as you polish off the ring and release it, the bead of red energy streaks across, blasting the floor, the secondary explosion, giant Fireball just bursts into the room, go ahead and roll damage on that.
Orion: Six, I have enough, there's a four, this is terrible, help me count, eight.
Marisha: Okay, well, we have all these twos. Let's put the twos side by side. That's fun. Uh-huh.
Laura: Your turns are taking so long!
Orion: 18. 23!
Matt: 23. Okay. The rest of these duergar detonate, blasted away out of play. Just, their bodies go thrown against the walls and the various pillars in the room. There's two pillars over there, they're kind of holding the ceiling up. The rest of them just go thrown about the room. The queen takes a bit of the damage, but seems to shrug off most of it.
Orion: I'm going to spend two sorcerer points. And I'm going to reach out my hand, and I'm going to form an ice knife and-- where is the queen, actually?
Matt: Right there.
Orion: Oh, very good. I'm going to throw the ice knife right there.
Matt: Okay. Right there? All right.
Orion: And I cast it at level two.
Matt: All right. So you get to throw at a target, though, right? Or are you just throwing on the ground to do the radial? Okay, so you take-- you form the ice knife, you throw it, it streaks across, slams into the stone floor and explodes, sending shards of ice out. Go ahead and roll damage.
Orion: Which is 3d6, because it's at level two now.
Matt: Correct. Saving throw, which it succeeds.
Orion: Much better. 14 points of damage.
Matt: Okay. Both succeed for half damage. So seven points of damage to each. All right, got it, cool. That ends your turn, Tiberius. Clarota, now--
Orion: How do you like them apples?!
Matt: Clarota steps forward-- Seeing the other mind flayer there, steps past and decides to go into a contest of wills against it.
Marisha: Contest of wills, staring contest, staring contest!
Matt: All right, this is intense. All right. Clarota is going to step forward and begin to intensely stare at-- you can see the air itself seems to shimmer and push, like a strange bubble shifting between the two of them at this connection point. Mind flayer, now one-eyed and seeping liquid from the side of its face, glares back at him. Fails his saving throw.
Marisha: That's right, he does.
Matt: This mind flayer suddenly diverts its attention away from Clarota and towards the queen. (cheering)
Sam: The old Dominate.
Ashley: Tight, tight, tight. (laughter)
Matt: That ends Clarota's turn. All right. The duergar would go if they weren't all blasted to hell. That brings us to Keyleth.
Marisha: All right. I'm going to go right for the king. You're coming for a ride, Tiberius. I'm gonna make a straight line. I have a 40-foot movement, pretty straight movement.
Orion: All right! Let's get 'em!
Laura: Oh no, Tiberius fell off.
Matt: There you go.
Marisha: Okay, I'm in melee, yeah?
Matt: Yes, you are.
Marisha: All right, I'm gonna do my full three multi-attack.
Orion: I'm maniacally laughing.
Matt: You are going to have a disadvantage on the tail attack, because you have Tiberius on your back and you're trying to make sure you don't hit him with your tail.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: So, first two claw strikes.
Marisha: Okay, first one, probably not gonna hit. 12?
Matt: No, that does not hit.
Marisha: Second one. 16?
Matt: Does not hit. Clink, clink! Off the armor. Tail strike.
Marisha: Tail strike. Two. Ten. Nothing.
Matt: Yeah, unfortunately just his thick suit of armor-- you're just hitting at him with the giant scorpion claws, but nothing seems to be getting through.
Marisha: God, you're so heavy, Tiberius, god!
Matt: You hear this clacking scorpion angrily (scorpion sounds).
Marisha: My balance is wonky.
Matt: Pike, you're up!
Ashley: All right, time for some healing. So pull me in there. I'm gonna do a-- I'm gonna do a Mass Cure Wounds. At level five gives, which I thinks gives-- thinks? Which methinks gives me 4d8? Plus my spell ability modifier. Okay, so--
Marisha: Get your heal on.
Liam: (Yoda voice) 4d8 you would give.
Ashley: Oh, so, 20. 20 points of healing for whoever would like it.
Matt: For everyone who's in the radius. Everyone but Grog, essentially, gets healed for 20 points. Grog's too far away from you, unfortunately.
Sam: Thank you, my love.
Matt: All right, Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: All right, I'm going to just get-- just step into the doorway to take a look. I'm just stepping one step. And now I'm just going to shoot-- can I-- I'm just gonna try and-- The minute I recognize what a basilisk is, since I've faced them before, I'm going to do my best not to look and take a shot.
Matt: Okay, so go ahead and fire with a disadvantage against the basilisk on the far end of the room.
Sam: Don't you shoot me.
Marisha: Oh, that was a pretty one.
Taliesin: I get 16 at my disadvantage.
Matt: 16 at disadvantage? That does hit. Go ahead and roll damage.
Taliesin: Nice! I'll be taking another shot, too.
Matt: Also, Tiberius, make another constitution saving throw.
Taliesin: Six points of damage.
Matt: Six points of damage to the basilisk, got it.
Taliesin: I'm going to take another shot, though. 16 again.
Orion: Ten.
Taliesin: 16 hits. This time I do 12 points of damage.
Marisha: 12 points?
Taliesin: 12 points. And then I'm gonna duck back around the corner again.
Matt: Okay. Cool. As you duck around the corner, you've gotten these strikes in, and as you're trying to-- as you finish your blows on the duergar king, Murghol, in front of you, you hear this clanking sound as Tiberius's now fully stone form falls off of the scorpion onto the ground, beside you.
Sam: Oh no! He's stoned!
Ashley: You turned to stone?
Laura: 'Cause of the basilisk.
Liam: We've dealt with this before.
Laura: Basilisk blood, we can fix it.
Sam: I think you pee on the body and it cures them.
Ashley: Can I-- I can't, I have to go--
Sam: Let's try it and find out.
Matt: The basilisk now takes its turn.
Liam: (stone Tiberius voice) Please, no!
Matt: Steps forward onto the edge. It's going to go ahead and-- it's gonna be for Lady Kima. It's going to attempt to make its stare at her. Lady Kima--
Ashley: Close your eyes!
Laura: She's smart, she's closing her eyes.
Matt: Lady Kima, who's currently in this blood frenzy against the king, unfortunately is not paying attention. Off to the side, the basilisk gets a glance out, which she looks at from the corner of her eye, she sees the movement over and has a hard time pushing through the stiffness as the gaze begins to take a clenching effect on her body.
Laura: Oh no.
Computer: All set, let's go.
Generated voice: All set, let's go.
Matt: Yes, thank you. Let's do that. Oh, Waze. Why's my phone on? All right, so, that brings us to the-- Oof, okay.
Liam: (computer voice) I'm sorry, I can't help you with that, Vex'ahlia.
Matt: This mind flayer, who's currently Dominated, steps forward and is going to attempt to make a tentacle grab against the queen. Queen Ulara manages to dodge out of the way, seeing this coming, and just backhands it, while taking a step back. Unfortunately does not cling with the tentacle. That ends its action. Yeah, unfortunately that didn't hit. All right, next, at the top, that brings us to Vax.
Liam: I'm hasted. I'm gonna try to go stealth again from where I am. So I'm stealth, 17-- 30. Okay. I'm going to scuttle along the floor and leap on the back of the basilisk and try to stab it in the eye while looking at the ceiling.
Matt: Well, at the start of your turn, it's within 30 feet of you and you can see it. Are you going to--
Liam: Not look at it, no, no.
Matt: Okay, so you're taking disadvantage on this attack. So you move behind, you're hidden.
Liam: 15 for my first attack.
Matt: Your first attack, that will not hit, unfortunately.
Liam: And second time, 19 for the second attack.
Matt: That does hit, yes.
Liam: Okay. Feel for the eyes, stab it with keen dagger-- Four. 11.
Matt: Okay. As you rush over, you take your first strike at the basilisk, you see it reel back and slap around its tail. You barely just get out of the way, and as you see its head turning around to attempt to glare at you, you instinctively take your offhand dagger and place it directly into the eye socket of the basilisk. It sinks past your fingers and you feel that warm rush of blood and gore against your hand. As you pull back, it just slumps to the ground. (cheering)
Ashley: We'll get you some of that-- we'll get you some of that blood. Blood! Basilisk blood!
Liam: I only moved ten feet. So who's stone right now? Tiberius and-- wasn't-- aren't two people?
Matt: Lady Kima is mid-effect and Tiberius is solid stone.
Liam: I've got Haste on-- If I've got Haste on, can I get to Kima? 'Cause I've got haste boots.
Matt: I would say, yeah, you could spend the rest of your movement doing that, yeah.
Liam: Okay, and I use my thumb to slide some of its blood off the blade and drip it onto her eyes.
Matt: Okay. All right. That ends your turn. That brings us to Grog. Grog turns and is going to go ahead and go raging, frenzied, against the queen. And a critical hit. (cheering)
Marisha: He crit?
Orion: Yeah.
Matt: The first hit, she's gonna go ahead and use her reaction to do Shield, it's going to up her defense. First attack misses, so two attacks miss now and the last attack is a critical hit, which is nice. So that's a--
Marisha: No crits for you! Crit happens, whether you're here or not.
Matt: All right, so that's 31 points of damage. Oof, that's a hefty chunk. All right, that ends Grog's turn. That brings us to Scanlan!
Sam: I'm next to the king, right? I'm near the king? Over there.
Matt: Yep. You're right next to him.
Sam: Okay. I just make eye contact with him and I mentally tell him that he really has the urge to try to do a headstand. Lay down his weapon and he really just wants to see if he can do it. (laughter)
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Suggestion.
Matt: Okay. (laughs) What's your DC?
Sam: 19.
Matt: All right. This is through the hand cone?
Sam: Through the hand cone, through the hand cone.
Matt: Okay. That will be a 20, unfortunately. Makes his saving throw. He glances back towards you with a look of confusion for a second. Looks at his feet and like begins to reach forward and then steels his mind and looks up at you angrily. All right.
Sam: Can I also, as my bonus action-- Who's around me? Who needs inspiration? Who needs inspiring? Who's-- yeah, oh, shit. I'll give Pike some inspiration, 'cause she's my awesome sweetheart.
Ashley: What do I get?
Laura: You get 1d8.
Ashley: Hey, thanks, man.
Matt: Next up is King Murghol, who's furious now. Both of his beasts have been slain and most of his men have been completely torn asunder by multitudes of arrows and fireball spells. He, now growing in physical form, on top of already the musculature he acquired from that potion, is going to make his three attacks against whatever is nearby. That's actually going to be-- actually, that's gonna be two strikes against you, Scanlan, since you just now tried to make him stand on his head, and one against Kima. (laughter)
Matt: That is a 15--
Sam: Hit.
Matt: -- a 24--
Sam: (higher voice) Hit.
Matt: -- and against Kima is a 20, that also hits. So all three hit.
Liam: Nobody puts baby in the corner. (laughter)
Matt: Oof, all right. So the first strike hits you for 21 points of slashing damage.
Sam: Still alive.
Matt: The next one hits you for 23 points of slashing damage.
Sam: No longer alive (laughs).
Ashley: You're no longer alive?
Laura: Are you unconscious?!
Matt: Scanlan falls unconscious on the ground from the two strikes of the king. The third strike back towards Kima, who's currently seizing from the effect of the spell. She's restrained, so he has advantage.
Liam: But she's got the basilisk blood in her eyes.
Matt: There's a process to undoing a creature into stone. To your knowledge, it does not seem to be having an effect. However, Lady Kima takes 22 points of damage. All righty. That brings us to-- Vex, you're up.
Laura: Oh, that's me. Every time!
Liam: I'm Vex.
Laura: No, you're not. Okay, I'm gonna hail, I'm gonna-- hail of arr-- no, yeah, Hail of Thorns? At level three.
Matt: Okay, at who?
Laura: At the queen and the illithid. So, I should've transferred my bonus action over to-- but I didn't, that's okay. That gives me-- I should've done this before, I'm an asshole, I'm sorry.
Liam: But what about in the game?
Laura: That gives me 2d10.
Matt: Additional damage to the arrow.
Laura: Yes.
Matt: So it explodes around, right? All right, so, fire the arrow. So, as your bonus action, you go and you grab one of the arrows out from the back, and as you pull it back you can see a bunch of these little thorns begin to grow and sprout from the actual shaft of the arrow. You release it and as it arcs across--
Laura: Yes! Natural 20! (cheering)
Matt: Against the queen. All right, go ahead and roll the damage for the arrow and the damage for the spell. And all that doubles.
Laura: Oh, awesome.
Marisha: (sings) All that doubles is gold.
Taliesin: (sings) Only shooting arrows.
Orion: (sings) In a butthole.
Laura: Yeah, all of it doubles.
Matt: The bonus at the end doesn't double, just the dice.
Laura: Oh, so, 36--
Matt: 36 points of damage. Yeah, plus the seven. And then it does-- it explodes? In a radius. And it does the dice damage, the 2d10, to--
Laura: To everything within five feet.
Matt: All right, so the mind flayer and Grog.
Laura: Oh, right, yeah, I should've hit the mind flayer with that arrow. No, it would've still hit Grog. Okay.
Liam: Grog is a tank.
Laura: They have to make a dexterity saving throw.
Matt: All righty. Grog does not make it and the mind flayer does not make it.
Laura: Yes!
Matt: All right, cool. All right, second arrow you can fire now if you want to.
Laura: Second arrow. I'm gonna fire from my flaming bow. I've got one shot on that left. At her again.
Matt: All right.
Laura: And that's a 28.
Matt: That hits.
Laura: And that's nine plus a ten, where's my ten? There they are. That's plus two. 11.
Matt: All right. You see flames begin to burn up along the side of her robe and she's looking really flustered and frustrated at this point. All right, that brings us to Kima's turn. No. She's made of hardy stuff. Kima currently is fighting this, is going to go ahead and release an entire-- all of her attacks against the king Murghol as he's right in front of her. She has disadvantage on that, unfortunately, because she is restrained. She's gonna make two attacks against him using Divine Smite, expending a 3rd-level spell. So that's 3d8 extra damage to each strike. So the first one hits. Both hit. All right. She's going to do it twice. That's gonna be 6d8 additional damage.
Marisha: Ooh! That's hot.
Matt: Oof. Okay. So, as Kima rears back, her first strike comes down and hits overhead, into King Murghol's armor, and as it does, it hits. The blade only goes about a few inches in, but then all of a sudden the blade heats up white-hot and actually buries itself an additional six inches into his shoulder. He screams out in pain, reaches up and grabs the blade and as he does, his hand actually burns in the process. She pulls the blade out, around and swings it down again, sinking another eight inches into the side of his torso. This time with a giant arc of white divine light into the side. He looks like he's starting to bleed out from the two of the wounds really heavily. The king is looking a little rough. That ends Kima's turn. Kima's going to try and make a saving throw. Kima pulls the blade out, and turns to stone herself.
Laura: Oh shit. Shit, shit, shit. He's still at like really high health, too. The king.
Sam: What, he is?
Matt: The king is looking a little rough.
Sam: You never know. He might just start doing a headstand. (laughter)
Matt: The queen's turn.
Laura: Oh no.
Matt: The queen looks over at Grog in front of her, kinda frustratedly, uses a bulk of sorcery points, puts her hand up towards him as he's pulling his axe back angrily. He fails his save. And he puts his axe back down and looks towards the rest of the group.
Marisha: Oh no! Not again!
Matt: Eye color glazed over.
Sam: He's so easily influenced.
Laura: No, he's under her control.
Matt: So that was her sorcery points, her quick action. She then says, "We're not gonna die this day alone and I won't die. My love, I'm sorry, but there's much more work to be done." And she raises her hand up and you see this buildup of green arcane energy at her hand. She turns it towards the rest of the group, faces it up towards the ceiling and releases this pulse of arcane, green, ill-looking energy that blasts into the stone ceiling. As it does, the stone itself disintegrates in a large chunk, and a glowing mass of seeping, hot, molten magma begins to pour into the room.
Marisha: Oh shit!
Orion: Where's it coming from?
Matt: It's now coming from right here.
Laura: Oh my god.
Liam: (sings) TPK. TPK.
Matt: So now, magma is pouring onto the throne room from above. The giant fall that is on top of the fortress is now peering into the room.
Sam: (high-pitched) Someone grab me and leave.
Matt: That brings us to Tiberius, who is stone. Clarota currently looks around and--
Orion: Hold on. Am I conscious in stone form?
Matt: No. You are a slate. You are a blue screen. You are Grog after the intellect devourer.
Ashley: Oh god, this is bad.
Matt: Okay. (laughs)
Sam: Pike, it's all on you, dude.
Marisha: Do you have water?
Ashley: I can create it.
Matt: Clarota steps back and grabs Lady Kima and begins dragging her back through the doorway.
Laura: Oh god, we've got to get out. That's a retreat.
Matt: Pulling her down towards the stairway. That brings us to Keyleth.
Sam: Keyleth. Keyleth. Get us out of here.
Marisha: Okay, okay, okay. I come out of the form. Yes, thank you.
Matt: It's a free action.
Orion: Isn't there a dead basilisk right in front of us right now?
Matt: There is a body of a dead basilisk on the ground, yes.
Marisha: I'm going to take Wind Wall. I'm gonna cast Wind Wall and try and wrap it around the lava column and try and contain it within the Wind Wall, cooling it down. Essentially making a tornado-like vortex around the lava.
Matt: Okay. For the purposes of this, I want you to go ahead and make a basic religion check.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: Wait no, not religion. For you it'd be nature. Just for the purposes of my thought, I think a nature check would be an interesting way to see how this plays out.
Marisha: 18.
Matt: 18? Okay. So, as you bring this gust of cold wind, swirling around, the column of magma begins to cool and darken as Trinket is like backing up against the wall and the magma is starting to singe the edge of Trinket's nails. It cools to a dark, black, kind of rockish color. And the magma fall ceases, but you can see parts of it breaking and beginning to break past that shell exterior. So you've slowed it.
Marisha: This isn't gonna hold for long! Somebody rub some blood on Tiberius, quick, and let's get the hell out of here! I'm just holding this.
Matt: Holding it there? Okay. That brings us to Pike.
Ashley: There's so much to do. I don't know if I should heal you, if I should rub blood on you or if I should go try to remove the curse from Grog.
Laura: See if you can get the curse out of Grog. Because if we've got to retreat, then--
Ashley: Can Remove Curse remove the thing off of him?
Matt: From your knowledge, no, it's an arcane effect, not a curse.
Ashley: That's an arcane effect. Okay, so, Grog might be on his own for a little bit. Okay. So can I heal Scanlan and then also rub some basilisk blood on Tiberius?
Matt: From your previous experience, it's not the blood directly. The blood itself has to be distilled into a specific alchemical form to reverse the effect.
Orion: We just drank the blood last time.
Matt: No, it wasn't drinking. After the battle, you guys took the blood, prepared it, and then used it as part of the recovery.
Marisha: Will someone collect some blood?
Matt: Okay, so you heal Scanlan. How much does he heal?
Orion: The king's almost dead.
Marisha: Do we want to kill the king? Do we need somebody alive to help us?
Ashley: Oh, 19, 19!
Matt: So you're healed 19. You're on the ground, prone, but you're conscious now.
Sam: Hi!
Matt: You look up at Pike and smile and you look over and see this large column of magma that's now cracking through stone and pouring into the throne room again.
Ashley: Is there anything else we can do? Is there anything else I can do at this moment?
Matt: No, this has been a heal, this has been-- no, okay, you can move, that's about it.
Ashley: I can move? Can I take anyone with me while I move?
Matt: I will say you can drag him. You'll be at half speed.
Ashley: Can I try to drag Tiberius away from the magma?
Matt: You can try. Make a strength check.
Sam: You're two feet tall. He's a dragon.
Matt: Let's say athletics, do athletics.
Ashley: Athletics? 19.
Matt: Okay. So, you grab onto Tiberius, you rush over after healing him, grab and start dragging him towards the entrance. At half-speed you manage to get him three squares, that's as far as you got. As you're pulling back, the king, as a reaction, gets one strike on you with his sword. That's gonna be a 19.
Ashley: Get outta here. (laughter)
Matt: Your AC is 20?
Ashley: It's 20.
Matt: So the blade hits you--
Ashley: I just flip him off. (laughter)
Matt: The blade comes down towards you, but with a flash of divine energy in your shoulder armor, it just gets deflected off the side and you glare at him out of the side of your face. And continue to drag Tiberius out of the room.
Liam: Now go home and get your shine box. (laughter)
Matt: All right. Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: All right. I'm going to step into the room, to give some cover. Right about, probably just slightly on the other end of this.
Matt: Where, over here?
Taliesin: No, like, next to Keyleth, like near Keyleth.
Matt: Oh, you're gonna have to go around here, then. This is a really harrowing place.
Taliesin: Okay, the first thing I'm going to do, is I'm going to-- I've got my ice shot loaded. I'm going to take a shot at the break in the ceiling and I'm gonna try and ice it over.
Matt: Okay, all right. So as you pull over, you go ahead and aim up with your ice shot ready. Go ahead and fire.
Taliesin: That's 20.
Matt: 20 definitively hits. It's not hard to do. Go ahead and roll damage and that will signify how long and how much it will stop. So just the ice damage. Not the actual bullet, it won't do anything. So just--
Taliesin: Oh. So just the ice damage
Matt: Just the ice damage.
Taliesin: Two.
Matt: Two. Okay. So as you blast up, you can see, as the magma's beginning to pour down again, you blast it and it immediately-- a spot cools into a rock and begins to slip again. You've maybe given yourself a couple more seconds. That may be what you need, you don't know. But that's all you got on that one.
Taliesin: Okay, my next shot, I'm just gonna turn to the king and just shoot.
Matt: Okay, go for it.
Taliesin: I'm also gonna spend a point for additional damage. And I'm also taking Sharpshooter for additional damage.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: That's 16.
Matt: 16 versus armor class will not hit, unfortunately.
Taliesin: Oh! Wait, okay, no, I just, I don't get the-- oh god, it's not Pathfinder, gah!
Matt: Yeah.
Taliesin: Okay, that's fine. I'm gonna spend my bonus action to take another shot.
Matt: Okay, so you're using your Action Surge?
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: Okay. So Action Surge. You now have two more attacks. Go for it.
Taliesin: 23, eff you.
Matt: That hits. (laughter)
Taliesin: That's nine points of damage.
Matt: Nine points of damage, got it.
Taliesin: Taking another shot.
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: This shot's fire, fire bonus damage. And I'm also gonna spend another grit point to maybe do a little more damage. 28 to hit.
Matt: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage. With the extra grit point you do two dice, right?
Taliesin: Yeah. I get a bonus die, I just have to find one. Oh, that'll do. That's 17 points of damage plus one point of fire damage.
Matt: Nice. Okay, so, the next-- the first shot fires, just ricochets off his armor and streaks across the room. You get his attention, though, and he looks back at you with this kind of wild look in his eyes, the muscles tensing. You can see the armor actually bending and twisting against his physical form underneath. However, the next shot blasts off side of his jaw, there's actually a giant gap now in his flesh as he looks back at you and you can see his teeth. And as he grits down towards you, now definitely intent on getting vengeance on that, the second shot (impact sound) takes off a chunk of his head. You can see the skull exposed on where you've now taken a piece of flesh off the top of his scalp. He's looking pretty rough.
Taliesin: Let's move it, people. And I'm gonna take like a step back towards the door. Just with what's remaining of my movement.
Matt: Okay. You can get back to there. All right. That brings us to--
Taliesin: Oh, I killed him, didn't I? No, he's not dead, damn it.
Matt: He's not dead yet. Not dead yet.
Taliesin: I know, that would've been so cool.
Matt: All right. The mind flayer, who is no longer dominated as Clarota took his attention off of that for the time being, looks around at everyone, sees the circumstance, the magma flowing down, and just grabs his chest and you can see his form blink out and vanish.
Orion: (groans) He peaced out.
Matt: That brings us to the top. Vax. At this round, by the way, is broken and has begun to spread, the magma has now filled this much of the room. And it's quickening.
Liam: My boots of haste are on, so I run-- I just dart right around Grog, around that column, up to the queen, while pulling out my keen dagger, I speak my mother's name, kiss the blade and shove it in, right into her collarbone.
Matt: All right, go ahead and roll for the attack.
Liam: So that's a two, but I'm gonna use Luck. I get ad-- 20.
Matt: 20 does hit.
Liam: Because of it, and because Grog's there, this--
Matt: Grog is not an ally, currently. You do not get Sneak Attack.
Liam: Don't get Sneak Attack, all right. Three, ten, then. That's the first attack. And the second one also hits, that's a 29.
Matt: All right.
Liam: Is ten.
Matt: Ten, nice. So the first blade plunges into her clavicle, she maneuvers out of the way to the point where it misses any vital points, but still sinks in. She looks at you angrily and you can see her dull white, ashy, duergar eyes flash with an intense arcane rage. As you pull the blade out, her eyes dart around with some sort of a plan, a thought process going through her head, as the other blade sinks into the side of her torso she spits out blood that actually spatters across your face. She pushes the blade out and you see her preparing herself for something. That ends your turn. Grog currently moves forward towards you.
Liam: (Grog voice) Wrong direction!
Matt: That is a 25 versus armor class.
Liam: Yeah, but Uncanny Dodge!
Matt: How many times can you-- you've already used that. It's once per encounter. Once per encounter you can use that. Next one is a 21 versus armor class?
Liam: Once a round.
Matt: Once a round you can do it? Okay, well never mind. So take half on that first attack. All right, so. First strike comes at you with a-- oof, that'll be 19 points of damage. Reduced to nine.
Liam: Yeah, okay.
Matt: Second strike hits you for a total of 15 points of damage. So 24 total.
Marisha: Could be worse.
Matt: And that's Grog's go. That brings us to Scanlan.
Liam: That really hurts, Grog.
Sam: With my knowledge of the arcane arts, do I have any knowledge that using my Dispel Magic spell would work on Grog? Or do I just have to try it?
Matt: It's a possibility. You know the spell that's been cast on him-- you use it. There is a chance, but it has to be a contested roll.
Liam: You could roll a 20.
Marisha: You could roll a 20.
Sam: Does it take my move to just stand up?
Matt: Yes, it does, unfortunately. So it's your call.
Sam: But I don't have to be standing to cast a spell--
Matt: No, but I would say it's going to be difficult, it's going to give--
Sam: All right, I'll stand up.
Matt: All right. You get back up. What are you doing?
Sam: And I will-- Jesus, is it better for me to get out of there or get the king?
Laura: Yeah, get the king. You may be able to kill him. He's on his last legs, probably.
Matt: He's looking pretty rough.
Sam: Yeah, but Keyleth is right behind him.
Liam: Do it. Stab him.
Laura: You can attack him with your sword.
Sam: I am a tiny, tiny boy. I can only do--
Laura: Do it anyway. He's at his last legs. It would be epic, Scanlan.
Matt: What do you got? Go ahead, quick. Magma's pouring through.
Sam: Okay, I swing my Singing Dawnblade at him. (laughs) I have a dawn blade. It's just so lame though! It's so weak!
Matt: Okay, so. Go ahead and roll for an attack, d20.
Sam: A natural 20. (cheering)
Marisha: We said he could roll a 20! We called it! Who called it? We called it.
Matt: So, roll the dice.
Sam: So that's eight.
Matt: You rolled an eight. Times two, that's 16, plus whatever the bonus damage is for the sword.
Sam: Plus seven. Plus the dawn blade gets another bonus attack at disadvantage.
Matt: It does. So, you strike with a critical hit, doing-- let's see, that's eight, 16, plus seven, 23 points of damage, go ahead and roll for a second attack.
Sam: I've never hit anyone with a sword before! Five.
Ashley: Can I give him a War God's Blessing and give him a plus ten?
Matt: You can.
Ashley: All right, plus ten, so fifteen.
Matt: So what's your total? You rolled a five, plus--
Sam: Five plus-- ten-- I don't know, what am I adding? I've never used a sword before!
Matt: Add your proficiency modifier, which is four, plus your strength modifier, so that's five to that, which is ten, makes it 20, which hits! Roll damage on the attack. (cheering)
Marisha: Kill him, kill him!
Sam: Six!
Matt: Six points of damage. All right, six on that plus your strength, which is one. Seven. Plus the dawn blade, which is-- that's eight. So that's eight damage on top of the 23. How do you want to do this? (cheering)
Sam: I-- as I draw back the blade, I say, oh! You should've stood on your head! And I lop it off.
Matt: So. As you say that, you-- the blade vibrates to the sound of your voice, like the echoing of a song of Scanlan behind yours in almost a chorus out of nowhere. The blade streaks through the air, coming down, slitting across the back of his Achilles' tendon. He instinctually falls to one knee, which is kind of the height level for you. As you do, you bring the blade around with a flourish and take Murghol's head off his shoulders. It spins, tumbles to the ground, and rolls across the floor into the magma. Blackened beard curling back as the rest of his face is melted away by the lava, which is now pouring pretty heavily into this room.
Sam: (sings) Scanlan make you feel good!
Matt: All right. So that's your action. And your movement. And your bonus action. No, you did your bonus action to do the extra attack.
Sam: Oh! Great, great. I don't know how to use swords!
Matt: All right, so. That's the end of your turn. Wow! You used a sword! And got a kill! On a boss!
Sam: Yay!
Ashley: Good job, Scanlan!
Matt: All right, King Murghol's turn would be now, but he's on the ground. Vex?
Laura: I call Trinket back. Get him away from that lava. I run past, 'cause I can't-- can I see? Do I have an angle or is it being blocked by molten tornado?
Matt: You-- it's completely blocked right now.
Laura: Can I run across behind it?
Matt: Through here?
Laura: Yeah. Is that magmous right now?
Matt: Yeah, it is. It's still pouring! She slowed it down, but it's still breaking through and pouring out slower. It would be even bigger if they hadn't slowed it.
Laura: Okay, then well, maybe I won't run in that direction. I run in the other direction and down-- yeah. So I can see.
Matt: Go for it. Roll for an attack.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: First attack.
Laura: First attack is (sings) 20. No. 19.
Matt: Hits.
Laura: Yes! Okay. 14.
Matt: 14 points of damage.
Laura: Second attack is-- Second attack is (sings) 21!
Matt: Hits. Roll damage on that.
Laura: What's that? 12?
Matt: 12 to hit?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Or 12 damage?
Laura: 12 damage.
Matt: All right, 12 damage.
Laura: Oh, um. Hunter's Mark. Damn it. Bonus action!
Matt: Yep. All right, so both arrows (impact sounds). One clips her in the leg, and the other embeds itself in her abdomen. You see she grabs for it. She's looking really rough. Next is Kima. Kima's stone. It's now the queen's turn. She looks over at you who's stabbed her, the arrows in her abdomen, and she looks up at Grog and says, (sighs) "We've got business elsewhere." And she reaches out and touches Grog. Both of them blink out, Dimension Door.
Sam: We've lost Grog again!
Matt: A very familiar purplish color as you've seen you cast it, they Dimension Door out of the entire vicinity.
Sam: Son of a--
Marisha: This is the second time we've lost Grog.
Matt: At which point, the stone rocks crack on the column and the magma now goes into full pour.
Laura: We've got to get out!
Matt: You guys have to get out of that tunnel. What do you do now, what's the process?
Ashley: We run!
Sam: Wait, we gotta get our stone friends out.
Matt: So, this is going into a skill challenge now.
Laura: Yeah, we all run out that--
Sam: No, we don't all run out, they're stone, we have to drag them out, yeah.
Liam: Who all's stone, it's Tiberius and Kima? Okay.
Marisha: Can we-- where's the magic carpet? Throw their asses on the magic carpet!
Laura: Grog has the magic carpet. Grog had everything.
Sam: Wait, Feather Fall, do you have Feather Fall?
Ashley: Before, before we leave, can I take some of the basilisk's blood and put it in a vial?
Matt: Okay, this will be the first skill challenge. Go ahead and make a dexterity check.
Ashley: Dexterity check?
Marisha: Oh, can we get the magic carpet now?
Matt: No, the magic carpet is in the bag of holding. That thing is huge. You carry that with you, you would be at disadvantage for everything you've been doing.
Orion: Oh, I see.
Ashley: 18!
Matt: 18, okay, so. I mean, you go over to it, and you manage to gather up into your wine skin a little bit of basilisk's blood, best you can. The magma pulls close to you and you manage to just take six points of fire damage from just the general heat of the magma now pouring into the room. It's spilling out and now just continuing to fill the rest of this chamber.
Liam: I shout to Percy, come, Tiberius, now!
Taliesin: We pick him up.
Matt: Both of you guys make an athletics check.
Sam: Oh, it's not a strength check?
Matt: For this, this is just an athletics to pull them all off.
Liam: 19.
Taliesin: 17.
Matt: Okay. You guys grab and pull Tiberius out of the room. It takes the two of you to heft him over. You manage to pull him out of the way, that works out well. Down the stairway, all right. We don't need the video for this, we're just going to do this visually. So, you guys manage to bring Tiberius down the stairway. What are you doing, Scanlan?
Sam: I'm unfurling my Bull's Strength scroll and reading it so I get a plus five to strength? Is that a thing?
Matt: All right, so that's Enhance Ability. So you go ahead and give yourself Enhance Ability. Your strength is now-- you have advantage on all of your strength checks.
Sam: Okay, and I start to help, who was pushing Kima? I'm gonna help push Kima out.
Laura: Oh wait, no! Wait, didn't Clarota take Kima?
Matt: No, Clarota pulled Kima out of the room.
Laura: Oh, so we're all fucking fine, let's just get out.
Matt: So you guys are fine.
Marisha: I go ahead and on our way out I cast Create Water, and I kinda just use my air ability and make a mist to try and like mist the lava that's coming towards us.
Matt: Okay. You do, but the magma's so intense and this has filled so much of the room now that you get a localized area. The rest of it just kinda flows around and continues to fill the space. All right, so. All of you guys make a dexterity check to try to get down quickly. Go for it.
Ashley: Can I make another one?
Matt: Yes, everyone makes one.
Taliesin: Natural 20.
Liam: Natural 20.
Orion: (hoarsely) I rolled a 19!
Marisha: 20.
Sam: (sings) Seven!
Ashley: Four!
Laura: Do I get to roll twice 'cause of terrain?
Matt: Because of-- yes you do.
Sam: Do I get my Enhance Ability?
Matt: Not for this one.
Orion: I would like to note that I am frozen like this.
Matt: Okay, Tiberius is.
Laura: 29.
Matt: Okay, gotcha. So, Pike and Scanlan, both of you guys are, unfortunately 'cause you're smaller and your legs are moving, you guys rush down the stairway and curl around. As the rest of you make your way to the door, which is currently closed, you are all kinda gathered at the exterior of that hidden doorway. It's currently dark and held shut on where you guys entered. However, you two, the magma's now reached the stairway. It's beginning to pour down off the top, and it manages to catch the two of you. You guys each take five points of heat damage from the magma's proximity.
Liam: To the two ladies?
Matt: No, Pike and Scanlan. You guys make it to the bottom floor. The doorway is currently closed for the secret exit of the fortress.
Liam: Vax drops Tiberius' stone ass to the ground and starts feeling to get the mechanism of the door open.
Sam: Are we at the foot of the stairs yet, me and Pike?
Matt: You guys just make it to the foot of the stairs. You guys are now--
Marisha: It's a big stone door?
Matt: Yeah, it's the one you guys, the one you guys-- it opens up, outward.
Marisha: I just cast Stone Shape and make a hole.
Matt: Okay, as you're feeling around for the mechanism, Keyleth steps forward and basically the stone turns into almost a clay, and she just pulls it apart.
Marisha: Sorry, Vax. I didn't mean to, like, overstep there.
Matt: A giant glob of magma pours down and splashes down onto the ground, hitting everyone in the vicinity. Everyone down here takes 12 points of heat damage.
Liam: Ah, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot!
Laura: Hot hot hot hot hot.
Liam: All right, I'm picking up Tiberius' stone butt and continuing--
Matt: Okay, you guys push through the open hole that Keyleth pushed in, sweat dripping down your faces as the heat proximity to you is nigh-intolerable. You make your way out of the gate and now you have that giant magma flow.
Laura: Oh, right! Is the thing not-- wasn't there--
Matt: No no-- as you guys go and step out, the doorway that opened up, previously? Is what parted the magma flow. You pulled it open, so now it's just a wall of magma in front of you.
Laura: She also had created a wall barrier.
Marisha: I did create a wall over top.
Matt: You did. It's not there anymore.
Marisha: It was permanent!
Matt: It was permanent, but a perpetual flow of magma on it for a period of a few hours will eventually eat through a stone wall.
Laura: Can you cast it again?
Marisha: I can. Yeah. Do it again. Bam.
Matt: Okay. It's probably the last of that. You create a stone wall that juts out, once again blocking off the magma flow. You guys all step out of the room just as the main force of magma begins to fill the room behind you. Everyone make one more dexterity check to get out in time, as it's a small space and you're pushing out.
Sam: Natural 20.
Orion: 16.
Matt: You made nothing.
Marisha: "You made nothing." Seven.
Taliesin: Ten.
Ashley: Two.
Laura: Oh no. 29.
Liam: 12.
Matt: Okay. Everyone under 15  you, you, Percy, I believe, and Keyleth. The magma now, as you're helping getting your friends out, you're pushing out, you push Vex out-- Vex darts out, Scanlan manages to get out. As you guys are pulling Tiberius through, the hefty force of magma comes funneling down into the room and splashes across the floor.
Taliesin: Oh, that's a lot of dice.
Matt: That is 18 points of heat damage.
Liam: Vax is unconscious.
Marisha: 18 points?
Matt: As you're pushing through, Vax, you fall unconscious as the magma is currently lapping at the back of your leg. The rest of you begin pushing out as you begin to realize that your half-elf friend is currently melting in a pool of magma.
Ashley: Can I grab him? Can I grab him out?
Matt: Go ahead and make a strength check. This is strength at this point, this is pure adrenaline pushing through.
Ashley: 12!
Matt: 12. You manage to start pulling him up through the hole that Keyleth made.
Taliesin: I'm going to assist, I'm pulling out-- I'm doing another ice shot to try and cool off the magma around him.
Laura: I send Trinket up, to like, pull him.
Matt: Before you get to that point, as you're readying for it, 'cause it's a small space-- as you're pulling it, giant bear claws come over and latch onto the back of Vax's armor. The grizzly bear begins to tense, pulling back. Makes a strength check. That'll do it. Both of you manage to pull you out. You take an additional bit of heat damage. You are now at two failed saving throws. Two failed death saving throws.
Liam: I am a centimeter away from real death.
Matt: As he pulls it out, you can see most of his foot is melted. And his right leg.
Sam: Aw, that's his best leg.
Taliesin: I pull a level two healing potion, just get it in his mouth.
Matt: Okay, you pull it out. At this point, the magma's beginning to fill up the room, by the way.
Marisha: Okay, wait wait wait, can I take my stone wall and like, close it off? We're all out, right?
Matt: You're outside of it. How long does Stone Shape last?
Marisha: Stone Shape?
Matt: What you used on the wall.
Marisha: I'm just-- I'm just taking it away.
Matt: Closing the wall?
Marisha: I'm closing it. I can do it again, I still have two more spell slots.
Matt: Okay, how many spells do you have at that level?
Marisha: Three.
Matt: Three. So you spent--
Marisha: One, so far.
Matt: One going out, coming-- no, wait, it's the same-- you haven't had a chance to do a full night's rest.
Marisha: I know. I was an animal all week-- all last game. I didn't use any last game.
Matt: That's true, so you used the stone form, used Stone Wall.
Marisha: I used one Stone Wall last week and I have two level five spells now.
Matt: That's true, that's true, you do, that's good. All right, I just wanted to make sure. Okay, so as you do that, you send up another Stone Wall. It blocks off the magma just as it begins to pour over and spill out into this vicinity. It'll last a short time, but it'll last enough for what you guys need. You guys drag--
Ashley: Can I heal him?
Matt: You can attempt to, yeah, go for it.
Laura: Anticipation.
Marisha: I know. C'mon, Pike!
Ashley: 24.
Matt: All right. Heals you.
Laura: Oh my god.
Matt: Comes to consciousness. You guys are about ten feet away from the base of the stronghold. Your foot heals up, but it's still burned.
Laura: Ew, get that away from me.
Matt: For the time being, until you can take some serious physical rest, your movement is reduced by five. And your stealth rolls are currently at disadvantage.
Ashley: Can that ever be healed?
Matt: Over time with some rest it can be, but right now-- like, you're healed up, but that foot is scarred. It probably spent a good six seconds completely submerged in molten lava.
Liam: Are you telling me I'll never compete in the roller derby again? (laughter)
Matt: Quite possibly. You all are just on the outskirts of the stronghold. You can see now elements of the windows of the top floor are beginning to glow with internal light, as the entire stronghold is currently filling up entirely with molten rock.
Sam: Oh, I left my keys in there! (laughter)
Matt: You're all resting for a moment, off to the side. Grog is missing. And you all take a moment to realize that somehow you all managed to survive this, mostly.
Marisha: Sort of.
Matt: However, you didn't find the vault, didn't find Kima's stuff, and a number of escaped individuals from this are out and at large. We'll end today's game on that note.
Liam: Percy, I need Bad News to be my other foot now.
Marisha: Yeah, you should have-- you need, like, a sweet pimp swagger now.
Matt: So that went a little long, guys. Thank you for your-- for hanging out, but that was an intense session. Some climactic moments there.
Liam: Are you sure you guys don't want to send in a bulette, right now?
Marisha: Yeah, or maybe, like, you know, a black ooze. You wanna do that?
Sam: Wow, guys.
Zac: That was fucking intense.
Matt: That was crazy!
Zac: Guys. Riveting. And exhausting. Are you guys tired?
All: Yes.
Zac: No dancing tonight, guys, get over it.
Ashley: Sorry it went late.
Laura: That went so long, I'm sorry guys.
Zac: No, they are happy that you went late. They want you to stay forever.
Matt: That was nuts.
Zac: So I wanted to make a couple announcements of people that helped out tonight. Not just donators, oh so-- I'm gonna read off a couple of people who helped out first and then we're gonna start off reading off people who donated to the charity. If you want us to read off who you are and your message to the Critical Role crew, you still have time to donate, 'cause I'll start at the bottom and work my way up. So if the mods could post the link to, you know, the command for Critical Role and you guys'll see there's a link there to donate. Donate to 826LA. Every little bit helps these guys a lot and it would be really helpful to the stream and the show. These guys have been working really hard and Matt puts in a ton of time and to show your support, go donate to the charity and we'll get to your messages. Okay, so first off, I'm gonna thank the_Duganator8--
Marisha: Yes! Was it the Duganator's birthday?
Zac: Yes!
All: Happy birthday, Duganator!
Marisha: (sings) Happy happy birthday, from all of us to you. We wish it was our birthdays, so... we're partying. Yay, woohoo!
Zac: Way to not use the copywritten one.
Marisha: (laughs) Yeah, way to not use the copywritten one, yeah.
Zac: Arislan and Alduin and JakeBoudreaux and Negihama and Duganator8 were all the ones that pitched in to buy dinner for you guys.
Marisha: Thank you guys, we love it, cupcakes! Happy birthday.
Zac: And then as a quick update for what's happening tomorrow, we have three performances tomorrow night. So tomorrow is Gather Your Party and it's kinda like our bring your friends, have a good time with board games and music and everything. So Indiecade's coming by tomorrow night to show off some new board games. And then we have two bands playing, Sonja Midtune and Bearwolf. And then we have the musical improv group that was here during the charity drive is coming back to do a performance, Robot Teammates and The Accidental Party, and that's tomorrow night, it'll be a lot of fun. So I'm just gonna pull up these donations and messages, if you wanted to see and start going through 'em. And we'll probably have more as we get to the top. So starting at Fifthdreamtoday said, "I love Critical role, kudos for giving to a great cause."
Matt: Oh thank you, Fifthdreamertoday.
Zac: Ravendreamer  "Cheers and godspeed to the bold members of Critical Role for supporting reading in children."

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello and good evening, everyone. Welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us voice-actors get together and play Dungeons and Dragons-- crazy, fun, nerdy times. So we are unfortunately missing Travis Willingham again this evening, because he's a pussy and had to go see Avengers tonight, so feel free to let him know on Twitter. But anyway, we have a really fun, action-packed adventure-- as if last week's wasn't tension enough. Let's see how the rest of the group manages to recover from their climactic battle at the top of Emberhold. But in the meantime, let's go ahead and give you an intro and some of the character backgrounds before we come back. [dramatic music]
Ashley: Pike grew up on the outskirts of town, near the Bramblewood. Her ancestors were a family of deep gnomes with quite an unfavorable reputation. Thievery, destruction, and trickery left them with the curse of the last name Trickfoot. Sarenrae, the goddess of healing and redemption, had other plans for Pike's great-great-grandfather Wilhand, who left his family at a young age after a dream: a dream that changed the course of the Trickfoot family. Wilhand devoted his life to Sarenrae and pledged from then on that him and his family would live a life of service and devotion. As a child, Pike seemed to have an affinity to heal. Whether it was animals, people, or even flowers, she felt she had a purpose in making things whole that had once been broken. She studied and learned the ways to heal though divine magic. She lived a peaceful life, quiet and simple, until one day, Wilhand was captured and almost killed by a group of goliath barbarians. One of the goliaths took a stand against the murder of the innocent gnome and he himself was beaten, bloodied, and left for dead, abandoned by his herd. Wilhand went to Pike for help. She prayed and healed this barbarian as best she could, bringing him back to life. When he awoke, she discovered his name was Grog Strongjaw. After that, they were best of friends, a rather unlikely pair. Little did she know that in a few years' time, Grog would soon return the favor and bring her back from the clutches of death. (roar, crunch) After being killed in battle, Pike felt angry. She wanted to be stronger so that it would never happen again. She spent four months at sea training with the men and women aboard a ship called the Broken Howl. Gripping her holy symbol in one hand, and her morningstar in the other, this time, Pike is ready.
Travis: Right, Listen up! If you have ale, then you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw. A goliath of towering height and size, this barbarian has an appetite for the two great loves in his life: combat, women, and ale! (chuckle) (record scratch) Wait. Easily the brains of the group, Grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes, colors, and (chuckle) shiny things! Also ale. In his early years, armed with his two-handed great axe, Grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst the ranks of his family's wandering herd. But after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly gnome in the woods, he objected to the killing of such an innocent life. A creature of impulse, Grog felt only pity for this-- well, this terrified little thing. And his disobedience cost him dearly. Beaten bloody and banished by the herd leader, his uncle Kevdak, Grog was abandoned and left to die, exiled from his herd. It was then that the relative of the very gnome he fought to save, saved him. It was the kindness of a gnome cleric named Pike that healed Grog, bringing him back from death's edge. And they have remained close friends ever since. Most nights, Grog can be found challenging entire taverns to wrestling matches! Ha! Or accompanying Scanlan to the nearest house where you pay for lady favors. Also ale!
Marisha: A first impression of Keyleth would leave you with little information on the half-elven druid. You might even think that her social awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is kind of sweet. (chuckle) Of course, it would be unwise to underestimate her based on first impressions. (thunder) Under that unintimidating petite frame is a vicious beast waiting to be unleashed, whose natural powers have made even the fiercest of champions pee their pants, literally! (soft chuckle) Born to the Air Tribe of the Ashari people, Keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and the elemental magics. It is her people's inherent duty to protect the delicate areas in Tal'Dorei where the four elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm. Since she was a little girl, she had quite a knack for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities. Well, if you consider kittens and flying squirrels to be little beasts. Which, I do. (clears throat) Anyways, it wasn't long before the headmaster of the tribe, her father, Korren, realized her true prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster. Just like that, her jovial childhood was stripped and replaced with endless spell memorization, teachings from ancient traditions, and exceedingly high expectations. Every druid leader to be must embark on a journey to seek out the sister tribes in order to introduce and establish respect amongst the fellow headmasters. They call this the Aramente, or Noble Odyssey. When her father felt she was ready, he set her on the path to truly discovering herself, not knowing when, or if, she will ever return. As she hiked down the mountain towards Stillben, she meditated on the task ahead. Part of the Aramente is proving yourself a strong warrior, a valiant protector, and a wise and compassionate leader. With this knowledge, one thought plays on repeat in her mind: Is she even worthy?
Taliesin: Percy was the third of seven children, born to a noble family who lived far to the north in the ancient castle of Whitestone. With so many siblings to share the burdens of lordship, Percy turned his attentions to the sciences, engineering, and naturalism. One day, a mysterious couple named Lord and Lady Briarwood came to court. During a feast held in their honor, the Briarwoods violently took control of the castle, killing or imprisoning everyone who would stand in their way. Percy awoke chained in the dungeon, only to be freed by his younger sister. Together they fled, chased by the Briarwoods' men. As they ran, Percy's sister took several arrows to the chest and fell. Percy kept running, eventually jumping into a freezing river and floating unconscious to freedom. He did not remember waking up on a fishing boat. He barely remembered the next two years, as he slowly made his way as far south as possible. Then one night, Percy had a dream. A roaring cloud of smoke offered him vengeance against those who destroyed his family. When he awoke, Percy began to design his first gun. (gunshot)
Sam: Oh, you haven't heard of Scanlan Shorthalt? Well, gird your loins, ladies, because he has his eye on you. A talented musician, master of disguise, and dashingly handsome in his own mind, Scanlan sings songs almost as much as he sings his own praises. Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used his endless charm and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and support his single mother. One day he was discovered by a half-orc promoter, and joined Dr. Dranzel's Spectacular Traveling Troupe, where he learned the ways of the world, and honed his skills as a bard extraordinaire. A loner much of his life, Scanlan has never quite come to terms with the violent death of his mother at the hands of a goblin invasion. While his years on the road provided many, shall we say, educational experiences with the opposite sex, deep down, Scanlan yearns for the one thing he's never known: the true love of a fellow gnome. Still, Scanlan considers himself a lover first, performer second, and fighter distant third. On the battlefield, he'll support his allies, but rarely draws blood, unless it's to protect fellow gnome, Pike. Count on Scanlan for a hearty laugh, a rollicking song, and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts and makes the females swoon.
Orion: Greetings and salutations. I am Tiberius Stormwind. I hail from a town called Ty'rex, located in the heart of Draconia. From a politically respected family, at the age of 15, I succeeded in passing the Sorcerer's Rite, showing prodigy-like control of my magic. The judges and the Draconian high council were amazed at how powerful my spells were for how long I had been training. At 20 years old, I was the youngest appointed member of the magic guild in Draconian history. For the next few years, I almost went mad from the malaise of being a guild member, as it's rather boring. However, one day I happened upon a chamber, unused for quite some time. In the room were stacks of books and maps of the surrounding cities and areas around the known world. For months, I would frequent the chamber, and learned of artifacts from legend. After a long period of research, I made a list of artifacts that caught my eye. I brought these findings to the high council and was told that all of the information in the chamber I had stumbled upon was either believed to be fiction, or unsolvable mysteries, and hence were lost forever. I found those answers to be unacceptable. A year later, I devised a ruse and managed to convince the city council to lend support in me leaving Draconia on a mission of peace and diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms, going from town to town and making friends and allies, in and for the name of Draconia. Being a red dragonborn, I had quite the task on my hands in that respect, but it was exactly what I needed so I could explore the world and find these artifacts, as I felt the truth was out there. Some may describe me as buffoonish, but I say poppycock to all that. I am much sharper than most give me credit for. I just don't pay attention to things sometimes. I've also been known to be rather cunning, loyal, happy-go-lucky, and well, dangerous. I can't help but show my true scales every now and then. But overall, I think I'm quite friendly for a dragonborn!
Liam: Never entirely welcome in the company of elves or men, Vax'ildan learned at a young age to skip past formality, preferring instead to invite himself in your door. Along with twin sister Vex'ahlia, Vax was born by a chance encounter between elven royalty and human peasantry. Raised by their mother in their early years, the twins were eventually sent off to their father in the elven capital of Syngorn. But their cool reception among the elves there never warmed, and their time in the capital didn't last. The siblings stole away one autumn night and set out on the open road. After a few years of wandering, they eventually decided to return to their mother, and journeyed back to the lands of their youth. But instead of finding their childhood home, they returned to a pile of rubble. Their mother was gone, their home burned to ash. Pressing the townspeople for answers, they learned of the day the dragon came. (roar) With their ties all severed, Vax'ildan and his sister set out to find their fortune together in Tal'Dorei. An outsider since birth, Vax quickly learned to solve life's challenges in his own particular way, often by side-stepping them entirely. And when his knack for circumventing adversity isn't enough, (knife scraping) the way of blades the elves schooled him in more than makes up the difference.
Laura: Like so many half-elves, Vex'ahlia has spent most of her life suffering the cool reception of a people who don't fully accept her. Born of a human mother and an elven father who only later in life took an interest in their existence, Vex'ahlia and her twin brother Vax'ildan quickly realized the only people they could truly rely on in this world were each other. It was at the age of ten when the two were taken from their mother and brought to live in Syngorn, the isolated elven city for which their father was an ambassador. He quietly took them in, but always kept an icy distance, and after too many years of disdainful looks, the pair decided to leave his indifference behind, and set out on their own. Vax took to the cities, stealing small trinkets and learning the ways of the thief, while Vex kept to the woods; she preferred the isolation. Always the keen observer, she learned to hunt and to track, to spy and to shoot. And through a series of fateful events, earned herself a companion in the form of a bear-- her own stolen Trinket-- to fight alongside her and protect her fiercely. Also, he is adorable, and gives expert massages.
Matt: Hey guys, welcome back. While we are missing Travis, it's totally fine, Avengers is a fantastic film. It's a wonderful film and hope he doesn't spoil anything for us in his return, but he is missed. Travis, we miss you. We'll have you back next week, hopefully.
Orion: I'm going to spoil the movie for everybody they win!
Taliesin: But do they?
Laura: But do they?
Matt: I don't know. It's Joss Whedon (laughs)
Orion: I didn't say who 'they' were.
Matt: Oh, that's true. All right, so, welcome everyone. For those of you who's this the first time, (laughs) buckle up for some interesting-- So we're a bunch of voice actors who play Dungeons & Dragons and this is our campaign we've been running for a while. To give you a little heads-up on the story so far, the party was hired to find an individual named Lady Kima, and she is a halfling paladin. The platinum dragon Bahamut is her deity
Sam: And we found her!
Matt: You did. I was going to get to that. (all laugh)
Matt: So they went seeking her in caverns beneath the dwarven city of Kraghammer. After much fighting and surviving, they manage to find their way to a duergar fortress called Emberhold, where they found Lady Kima captive beneath. They released her and then, using her help, assaulted the throne room at the top and managed to slay King Murghol of the duergar. However, in the process, Grog, our intrepid barbarian, was kidnapped by the queen mage before she could be slain, who then also disintegrated a portion of the roof, letting an entire cavalcade of molten rock into the fortress. The party then had to make a heated escape. However, a number of the party members, due to the gaze of the two basilisks that were kept in the throne room as pets, Lady Kima and our Tiberius Stormwind, our dragonborn sorcerer, are currently stone. Dragging them out of the fortress as the magma began to fill the interior, a very deft escape was made, aside from Vax unfortunately getting his foot temporarily submerged in the lava, taking some serious damage to his foot. The party manage to make their way outside of the Emberhold proper, and you've all taken a moment to breathe at this point, realizing that thankfully, for the most part, you've all survived. Aside from the missing party member and a few in a state of flux at the moment. So, picking up there where we left off. You're all breathing heavily. The sincerity of the battle has just come over you. The adrenaline's still pumping through your system.
Laura: Your foot is melted off.
Liam: It's kind of there (groans).
Matt: Mostly. There's some... You can see four of the five toes.
Laura: Oh, that's not bad. It's four out of five.
Matt: About three and a half.
Liam: Did I lose the big or the small?
Matt: (laughs) This would be the small.
Ashley: Oh, you can do without the pinkie.
Marisha: Your balance is probably a little wonky.
Matt: Yeah, a little bit.
Liam: Clears that athlete's foot, though. Gone.
Matt: Sure enough.
Sam: Is anyone following us? Can we do a quick check around and just see?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Sam: Perception check? Starting it off with a 19.
Matt: Glancing around, you start hearing various duergar screams from above as the individuals that were still inside the fortress are in the process of trying to get out, or in the process of slowly melting in the molten rock. What you do also notice is that off towards the bottom base of the stronghold, a number of duergar that reside in the buildings that surround the exterior of Emberhold proper are mounting arms and charging up towards the stronghold to give aid to wherever this seeming, loud shouting and screaming is coming from
Laura: Can they see us?
Marisha: Does anyone seem to be paying attention to us?
Matt: No, they're far enough away where you don't think it's an issue, and you're off to the side, for the moment. But you do see probably close to 30 to 40 duergar are currently swarming out the small city, making their way towards Emberhold.
Marisha: So right now they're focused on the chaos of the temple?
Matt: From what you can see.
Sam: We should get out of here.
Laura: There was a path further down that led further on into the tunnels. I think we should follow that.
Marisha: Well, hang on. Grog can't be far, right?
Sam: He could be in another dimension.
Marisha: No, he can only be a thousand feet away.
Sam: Says who?
Marisha: They used the spell Dimension Door that Tiberius has.
Laura: So we hope he used Dimension Door.
Sam: I have a spell that can go to another dimension (chuckles).
Marisha: Well, I remember the gods on high telling us last week that we recognized the spell that was used.
Sam: By the way, this is the best conversation we've ever had with Tiberius. (all laugh)
Laura: Oh, Tiberius.
Marisha: Aw man, I feel that comes back to bite us in the ass later (nervous laugh) because he is still conscious, right?
Matt: No.
Laura: He has no idea what's happening.
Matt: He's in darkness. He can't hear. He's not conscious.
Sam: If Grog is close, we still need to get out of the way of these 30 people. So let's go hide.
Laura: We still need to hide. And heal.
Taliesin: Let's at least follow the path, find a place where we can hide, and recuperate.
Laura: Around the corner or something. Can we stealth further down?
Matt: You can try to. You currently are carrying two large solid stone statues with you, so it's definitely possible, but you're going to have to come up with a creative way of doing so.
Taliesin: Grog had the rug, didn't he?
Matt: Grog had the entire bag of holding.
Taliesin: Shit!
Marisha: I'm going to go ahead and cast Pass Without a Trace on the party.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Percy, I think you and I are on Tiberius duty.
Taliesin: Yes. (sighs) Okay.
Sam: If we do not move, will this 30 duergar mass hit us at some point?
Matt: You can find out.
Sam: Oh, Jesus (laughs)
Orion: It's like asking the future.
Laura: Can I use my robe of infinite twine, which I have on my person in another game before. Because it's connected to my rope. Can I use that and tie it around Kima and hook it to Trinket so he can drag Kima along?
Matt: You can.
Laura: Okay.
Taliesin: Very clever.
Matt: So I will say for this circumstance as you guys are preparing this: casting the spell, beginning dragging the stone. The group make an initiative check.
Sam: We took too much time!
Laura: We should just run.
Taliesin: Natural 20.
Matt: Yeah, you have some flashing, there we go.
Marisha: That's been a kind die to you.
Matt: So, 20 plus whatever your initiative modifier is.
Taliesin: 27.
Matt: 27.
Marisha: 13.
Orion: Who cares.
Sam: Ten.
Ashley: 12.
Laura: 17.
Liam: 15.
Matt: All right.
Sam: Distract them. Get them away from us.
Matt: You guys begin to drag the stone, or (chuckles) your two stone companions across the jagged obsidian floor in this deep, dark cavern. The heat from the nearby lava fall is still causing you to sweat profusely, and you're sore from the previous battle you just endured. Those of you who are wounded, you can feel the stretch of the muscles and tearing of what sinew has taken damage in the process. As you begin to pull, parallel to this duct of lava that pours off the side of Emberhold, you keep low so that you aren't actually blocking the light source, which would be a very keen visual to anything that's looking in that direction from a distance, but you slowly make your way across. At this point, the duergar have not been able to get there before you guys move off from the side, so they haven't caught up to the position you were previously, but they're beginning to swarm around the sides, and you see them yelling at each other and shouting commands. Some of them are starting to grab large rocks and fill in areas of the stronghold. Some of them you can see are robed individuals begin casting spells. You can see portions of other stone walls beginning to mount up and try and block the flow from the interior and exterior of Emberhold. However, you guys are still within eyesight, technically, of any duergar on that side of the fortress, so I'm going to ask everyone now to make a stealth check. Those that are pulling the statues with disadvantage.
Laura: So that's Trinket.
Orion: Plus ten.
Laura: But we all add plus ten?
Matt: Correct. To the final roll.
Laura: Okay.
Liam: I have a question. If I have advantage for other reasons-- I have a cloak of elvenkind which gives me advantage-- does the advantage and disadvantage cancel out into one?
Matt: They do. Your foot being wounded, though, is a disadvantage right now.
Liam: Right.
Matt: So that then goes back down to disadvantage.
Sam: Can't win with this guy.
Matt: Just for this circumstance, unfortunately. You're dragging a statue with a partially melted foot right now.
Taliesin: Liam, it doesn't matter.
Marisha: You still have plus ten to the roll because Pass Without a Trace.
Matt: So?
Sam: 14.
Matt: Plus the ten?
Sam: That's including the ten.
Matt: All right.
Marisha: 22.
Taliesin: 11.
Ashley: 20. That's my low roll.
Laura: That's 20 for Trinket and 29 for me.
Liam: 25.
Matt: All right, so you keep hunched low, slowly (stone grinding noise) dragging these stone obelisks of individuals across the jagged floor. You seemingly do so without any of the duergars' eyes catching you through the low light of the cavern. Partially due to the fact that you guys are doing a pretty decent job and partially the fact they're more obsessed that the central piece of their fortress right now is essentially about to be completely filled with molten rock. About 20, 25 minutes or so, you manage to pull just past where the lava flow dips down into what looks like a small opening in the flooring, and you are past the immediate heat of the magma river. You are now pressed up against the wall of the cavern as it begins to twist around and head downward, further deeper into this subterranean mountainous space. You're all beaten, you're all sore, and currently, what do you want to do?
Taliesin: Keyleth, can you cover the entrance to where we are to give us a little bit more of a stealthy--
Marisha: No.
Laura: No more spells?
Marisha: I am exhausted. I can't do anything else right now.
Liam: And what's the terrain? Is it just flat out out in the open to see, or is it scoured with ins and outs? Peaks and valleys?
Matt: It's the same type of topography you've encountered when you first entered this giant cavern. So you can see large, crooked black spires of obsidian rock shooting up and curving towards the ceiling. It's all over the place.
Marisha: I can make another Hallucinatory Terrain. I can do that still.
Laura: Okay, maybe you can make it--
Marisha: Can I make it to where it just looks like a wall?
Matt: How long does it last?
Marisha: I think Hallucinatory Terrain lasts an hour, if I think about it. Books, books, where's my book?
Laura: Can I look around and and see if there's anywhere that looks like we could hide, tuck in between rocks or something where we wouldn't be visible?
Taliesin: Please.
Matt: Go ahead and make a perception.
Laura: Oh wait, I get an advantage.
Matt: Because you are in the Underdark, correct.
Laura: 20.
Marisha: It lasts for 24 hours.
Sam: 24 hours!
Taliesin: Put a lava flow in front of us.
Sam: But you have to be concentrating the whole time. And you can't. You can't go to sleep.
Laura: 20.
Matt: As she's glancing at that, you make your way about ten minutes away from the area where the rest of the group is currently gathered, keeping a very very close eye on the topography of the wall of the cavern as it slowly curves around and further in that direction. You do manage to find portions of the wall that jut out and leave these small pockets. They themselves might not be super safe for a long period of time, but they give you a little bit of--
Laura: Cover.
Matt: Little bit of cover, depending on how well you were to dress. You might be able to see few individuals discovering you if you were to stay there.
Laura: Okay. Let's do that.
Marisha: It's not a concentration spell. It just takes a minute to cast and it lasts for 24 hours. So I'm going to go ahead and cast it and make it look like there's just a wall with another lava flow that's come out, and is starting to happen.
Matt: Okay, so as you walk back to notify the party, you watch as a portion of the mountain seemingly out of nowhere, extends, and a lava flow appears, pouring out of the wall.
Marisha: Wait, was someone not inside?
Sam: No, we're all in.
Matt: She was out and about while you did this.
Laura: I was searching for another place to hide.
Liam: It's fine. It's an illusion. Vax pokes his head through the illusionary lava and goes, We're in here.
Laura: Oh! Lovely.
Matt: So your heart rate eventually normalizes. You do have a decent pocket of space here that as long as nothing attempts to walk into the wall, you should be okay to rest here.
Taliesin: So we have some time. Let's regroup.
Laura: I think we should probably--
Taliesin: Sleep in shifts.
Marisha: Wait, here's what I'm afraid of. If we sleep we could lose Grog's trail. He could be nearby right now.
Taliesin: We're not much use to anyone right now.
Sam: Let's just make a decision right now to leave Grog and continue on.
Ashley: No!
Sam: Let's just forget about him. He was a good friend.
Laura: What?!
Sam: We'll have a toast to him.
Laura: Scanlan!
Ashley: Scanlan!
Sam: We'll sing about songs of his memory.
Marisha: You are shitting with us, right?!
Sam: Within a few days we'll forget he ever existed.
Taliesin: Scanlan, no one else wants to go to a whorehouse with you. You'll be going to whorehouses alone.
Sam: All right, fine.
Taliesin: Thank you.
Liam: Here's another option. My foot hurts, but I'm not too bad. How are you?
Laura: (sighs) I'm okay.
Liam: We could go look.
Laura: Or maybe I can use my tracking and see if I can catch a scent. Grog does smell.
Marisha: I can use my beast sense; that is one more thing I can still do. I could theoretically-- We could use Trinket.
Liam: We need to undo the stone that has taken over Tiberius and Kima.
Taliesin: Do I have the necessary tools to synthesize a potion out of the basilisk blood?
Matt: You can certainly try. It's a very ramshackle set-up. You do not have an alchemical set, but you can certainly attempt to, using a small fire, a couple of your general smelting tools you use for your metal work. You could attempt to distill it down, but that would be a combination of a tinkering roll on your point, followed up by somebody else's medicine roll to attempt to properly prepare it.
Laura: Are all of Tiberius's things stone with him?
Matt: Yes.
Ashley: I'm going to walk over to Tiberius and cast Greater Restoration on him.
Matt: Okay. So as you're having this discussion. Tiberius, you briefly go from this moment in the heat of combat where you feel your muscles intensify and tensing up and not answering to your mind's command as you look up angrily at a series of duergar that have just been blown up by a fireball, to cold taking yourself. And as the cold fades, you are now in the center of a gargantuan cavern surrounded by all of your friends. You guys watch as Tiberius's form fades in through the stone.
Marisha: Tiberius!
Ashley: Tiberius!
Laura: Good job Pike!
Sam: I was so worried about you!
Taliesin: Or we could cast a spell. That also works well.
Orion: (Dwarven accent) What the hell is going on?
Ashley: I didn't know if that was going to work.
Marisha: But that the only time you can do that, right?
Laura: Wait, she can't do that again? You can't do it again for Kima.
Ashley: I have another 5th level now, so I could do it again.
Laura: And once we rest, you'll have it again?
Orion: (Dwarven accent) Whoa. What happened to all the other little dwarves?
Sam: You don't have to do the accent anymore.
Laura: You probably should keep your voice down, Tiberius.
Orion: Well, this is just how I sound.
Ashley: No. We already got through. We're on the other side. You don't have to act like a god anymore.
Laura: Grog is missing, actually.
Orion: (Dwarven accent) Oh, great.
Laura: And the queen took him.
Sam: Are you stuck like this?
Orion: No, I could change back anytime I want, but I really like how I look. (all laugh)
Ashley: Are we going to rest?
Sam: Wait, but what about Kima?
Marisha: We have to find Grog!
Laura: We have to find Grog but we have no spells. If we do find him, we can't do anything!
Sam: Can you unstone Kima now or?
Ashley: I can, but then I wouldn't have another 5th level.
Orion: (Dwarven accent) Clarota, what do you think we should do?
Matt: Clarota, who is currently like staring at the statue of Kima, you can see there's a brief bead of thought behind Clarota's eyes and the voice sinks into the rest of your minds simultaneously. "We may be able to leave her here for safekeeping."
Orion: I knew you were going to say that. A different option. Oh, and thank you, Pike.
Ashley: You're welcome, Tiberius. (all laugh)
Matt: "If you insist on bringing her, then we should do it soon. We should not be leaving anything behind. Trace of our passage."
Liam: Where did your kin take our big friend?
Matt: Clarota thinks for a second and says, "It was not my kin that took him but the duergar. If anything, I imagine he might be residing within that infernal city, though if they've taken him elsewhere I do not know the way of the ash-skins."
Orion: But Kima does.
Laura: We should wake her up.
Orion: Pike, you can do it one more time and take a little rest, right?
Ashley: I am going to walk on over to Kima. Touch her. Cast Greater Restoration again.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Where do you touch her? (laughs)
Ashley: I touch her arm.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: Don't cheapen this.
Matt: Classy. As you reach out, the divine energy emanates from Pike's hand that begins to cascade across Kima's form. Kima, who is in mid battle, with her greatsword in the air, as soon as her flesh returns to her, she finishes her swing.
Ashley: I put my shield up!
Matt: However, it does (ping) into the side of your shield and you deflect the blow and you see Kima for a second is like, (panting slowing to normal breathing).
Liam: Easy! Easy!
Ashley: Calm down!
Matt: She throws the blade down on the ground and goes, "I am so sorry."
Ashley: It's okay! You were mid-swing, I get it. We are fine it was just a shield. We're fine.
Matt: She reaches around and she pulls her symbol of Bahamut out from her around her neck and just clutches it for a second and says, "What happened?"
Laura: You were turned to stone, the king got killed, the queen took Grog, we don't know where.
Sam: And Clarota was really helpful to us.
Laura: Actually, Clarota got you out of that castle alive.
Matt: She turns around and glares at Clarota briefly with a look of confusion and mistrust and Clarota just goes-- (all laugh)
Liam: You honestly would not be here if it weren't for the illithid. It's true.
Matt: She glances back at you and gives under her breath, "And there's a good chance none of us may be here if it gets its way down the road. (louder) Nevertheless, I thank you. It is good to know at least we took one of their top champions down. The fact that the queen still exists is worrisome, as at least from what I seemed to gather she had the true reign over most of the duergar down here."
Orion: Do you know where she would be at?
Matt: "Where did she escape? How did she take him?"
Liam: She disappeared with our goliath friend.
Laura: (gasps) Oh my gosh. Wait, did I Hunter's Mark the queen?
Liam: Yes, you did.
Laura: Did I?
Taliesin: You did.
Laura: I can use my Hunter's Mark to track her!
Sam: You can? (all cheer)
Sam: How long does it last and how does it work?
Liam: But that was just 30 minutes ago.
Sam: I know, but we all have to rest.
Laura: It maintains for up to eight hours!
Sam: Eight hours, but we have to rest!
Ashley: Because we need to heal. I am pretty low.
Sam: I'm at two.
Ashley: You're at two?!
Marisha: Okay. Theory? Proposition? Proposal. What if we use your Hunter's Mark, figure out where she is, get there, camp out nearby, tackle it in the morning?
Laura: Can I use my Hunter's Mark to find out where she is and then we rest and go there?
Matt: You can attempt that.
Ashley: What if we took a short rest?
Laura: Wait, wait, wait. Let's just find out where she is first.
Ashley: What if we just took a seven-hour nap? (all laugh)
Ashley: Because that's all really anyone sleeps anyway.
Taliesin: I think six hours is about what it takes.
Matt: Six to eight hours is the general long rest period that I would allow for that.
Laura: Okay.
Ashley: Okay.
Liam: I think we should all rest for a moment. I think Vex'ahlia and I should go out for an hour or two, just to see which direction-- I mean, they are not going to back to Emon.
Laura: I've got Hunter's Mark! Just stay put, Footless! (all laugh)
Orion: Wait a minute. What happened to your toe?
Sam: You're not stealth anymore. You got a busted foot. You're at disadvantage on everything.
Liam: I was pretty awesome 30 minutes ago. Now I'm just slightly less awesome.
Sam: Can we at least heal you up, before you go?
Laura: Yes. Just give us one second. Can I use the freaking Hunter's Mark?
Sam: How does it work?
Laura: I don't know!
Matt: So you take a moment, you step beyond the boundary of the illusion momentarily, close your eyes and concentrate on that small blip of nature based divine energy that you lent and grappled onto Queen Ulara with. You take a moment and concentrate and you recall her face, you recall, strangely, her scent. In a weird way, the bestial nature of your connection with Trinket and nature, scent is a very strong means of tracking and the scent of a duergar is a very terrible mix between salty brine and earth.
Liam: Like Axe for Men?
Matt: Essentially, yeah, yeah. It's Ye Olde Axe. You concentrate on this and you recall the stronghold, you begin to see a trace where all of a sudden her path in the stronghold is fading and is cold. A new path has opened up in the center of the duergar city at the base of the stronghold. It seems to have moved slightly in that direction, but you can't pinpoint where, and is currently at rest somewhere in that vicinity.
Sam: She is still close.
Laura: (whispers) The city, they're close. (louder) So that is right in front of the keep?
Marisha: Wait. Are they in an underground base?
Laura: They are in the city.
Matt: Essentially, where the cavern kind of rises up and meets the wall, Emberhold is at the top of that rising of the ground, and Emberhold lies there, where all the lava pours down and trickles down. You guys are off to the side. This whole portion of the floor that crawls up to Emberhold is covered in duergar buildings. It is a small city that surrounds it. She resides somewhere in the center of that.
Marisha: So we're on the same level as them or are they above us?
Matt: They are a little bit above. You guys are at a lower point, as the actual ground you follow curves around and descends.
Sam: But once we walk out of here we will be at the same level.
Marisha: I have a theory. I've a new skill that I've recently learned and was practicing a lot when I was with the Earth Ashari while we were gone for the past six months. They taught me the ways of the earth elementals.
Orion: Oh, that's fun.
Marisha: So. And as an earth-- but I am still new at it.
Ashley: That's okay, we all start somewhere.
Marisha: Thank you, Pike.
Ashley: You're welcome.
Marisha: Thank you. I mean I am a little self-conscious about it still, but I can travel through the earth.
Laura: And pop up, perhaps, where she is?
Orion: (Dwarven accent) Ooh, like a little gopher.
Laura: All of us? Or just you?
Marisha: It is not a burrowing thing, right?
Matt: You glide through the earth.
Liam: More like a Shadowcat kind of thing?
Matt: Essentially.
Laura: Is it all of us or just you?
Marisha: Just me. But I could get inside.
Laura: Well, but then you will be alone, surrounded by duergar and Grog.
Marisha: Well, I am not talking about right now.
Ashley: Could we put invisibility on her?
Marisha: If we do some sort of flanking thing.
Liam: Well that does sound useful.
Taliesin: It is. It is going to be useful.
Marisha: I am wondering if we can make a tunnel, though. I can theoretically-- okay, theoretically we could rest and I could keep all of my spells and use all of my magical focus to tunnel us out, depending on how far we are going. We can do an underground approach
Liam: But concretely, right now we need nappies.
Marisha: Yeah.
Taliesin: Let's sleep.
Marisha: But what if they leave while we sleep?
Liam: But we are essentially powerless.
Taliesin: And what are we going to do if we find them?
Laura: I'm going to only sleep for a little bit, cause I didn't use all my spells I only need to rest for half the amount of time, maybe.
Matt: It doesn't work that way. (all laugh)
Matt: A solid six hours you'd probably be able to, since you guys are in a hidden area you'll feel more comfortable, depending on how you set your bedding here you could probably do it in six hours.
Laura: I think we'll be fine. Because she needs to rest as well. We hurt her pretty badly.
Liam: I think it is safe to assume she's brought Grog back to her seat of power. Why would she go anywhere else? She's at her strongest where she is.
Taliesin: I think they're staying.
Sam: We're going to rest.
Liam: Sleep.
Marisha: Okay. All right.
Laura: We've got to sleep, Keyleth.
Ashley: I know. You're right. I see what you're saying, but we need to...
Sam: Grog will be fine.
Ashley: He's at a two!
Marisha: I'm so mad at him. Why'd he get stolen?
Matt: Kima comes over, Kima puts her hand out a little bit and says, "It's all right, he's a strong one, he can handle himself. If I could survive what I've been through, he can do far better than that. Rest is good. I think we need to take some time, discuss our plan of attack, our current direction, and decide on how we'll move forward." She glances briefly over at Clarota, who's now further back towards the wall just sitting in this meditative state. "So. Let us rest."
Taliesin: Brilliant idea.
Liam: One last thing before we lay our heads down for the night. Pike, do you have any salve or anything you could help me put on my foot, or could your god help with my little toe?
Marisha: I could help you with some natural mediciney stuff, maybe.
Liam: It stings a bit.
Matt: You have not encountered a person with any sort of physical marring to this degree, necessarily, and those that usually did, it was a permanent thing. So this is something that you would have to experiment with.
Ashley: Could I try healing? A very concentrated energy just on his foot? A healing spell?
Matt: You could certainly try.
Laura: You can do it, Pike.
Marisha: Is there anyway I could assist her?
Matt: Possibly. All right.
Ashley: Let's try it.
Marisha: Possibly?
Liam: I mean a clockwork foot from Percy does sound cool.
Ashley: If we're going to rest, it doesn't hurt to try.
Marisha: That way we can sleep on it.
Ashley: You can sleep on it.
Liam: Literally.
Laura: Maybe this yellow vial of potion could do something for it as well.
Liam: That's Ben-gay.
Ashley: I'll try Cure Wounds at, I'll try 4th level, since we're going to sleep.
Matt: All right so go ahead and roll the corresponding dice for that.
Ashley: So I roll...
Matt: 4d8 + 5 Is what it would be.
Laura: Why do you keep putting your foot up near me? (all laugh)
Laura: Can I keep an ear out for anything approaching?
Matt: Very much so.
Ashley: Wait, plus my spell caster--
Matt: Plus your modifier, which is five.
Marisha: I start building a positive chi. Like a healing chi ball.
Sam: Is she doing a standard healing here? Is my song of rest going to help at all?
Matt: Your song of rest would actually be of aid to this.
Sam: Okay. So I'm going to sing while you heal, if that's all right.
Ashley: Please do.
Matt: All the healers convene, Scanlan begins--
Marisha: I light some sage.
Sam: Okay, ready? (singing) Wherever you go, whatever damage they've done, we will be right here waiting to heal you. No matter what hit points you take or how your foot breaks, we will be right here--
Sam: Waiting for you.
Ashley: Waiting for you.
Liam: All that improv school paid off. (all laugh)
Matt: As you take the healing energy you've gathered from your own nature-based casting, you infuse the healing spell. You do how many points of healing from the spell?
Ashley: 27.
Matt: 27. Go ahead and make a medicine check.
Marisha: Is this what I can maybe assist her with?
Laura: It looks really disgusting by the way. It's so gross.
Ashley: What do I roll? Do I roll the 20?
Matt: Roll a d20, and add your proficiency modifier
Liam: Can I apply my Luck feat to her?
Laura: You don't have any feet left. (all laugh)
Sam: Feet pun!
Ashley: 21.
Matt: 21. As you finish the spell, you can see where the mostly-gone second small toe has grown to mostly a full toe, and there's a small stub where the little one is.
Laura: You've got a toe nubbin.
Ashley: Hey man, we got a little stub. A little bit.
Matt: You're promoting a level of divine regeneration at a very, very slow pace. You've never attempted this before, and there is some progress, but this may be an over time thing you have to do.
Ashley: Over time, I just keep doing it?
Matt: Once a day, you might want to attempt this and eventually he probably will recover. But not immediately.
Sam: Until then, he's a gimp.
Liam: I think I see Pike's deity in my toenail! (all laugh)
Ashley: It's gonna take time. That was just a little manicure that we did real quick.
Marisha: We could just own it and call you--
Taliesin: Little piggy?
Marisha: Well I was going to say Vax the Nine-Toe.
Liam: And put a knife on it?
Taliesin: Could put a very tiny knife on it.
Laura: A teeny tiny little knife.
Taliesin: Could actually give you a nail clipper. You could clip your own nails.
Marisha: We can get you a prosthetic little toe that has a little compartment for poison.
Liam: I would take a brass claw.
Marisha: Or a brass claw toe. That's fun. Maybe we could get you a raptor claw. That's cool.
Taliesin: Let's sleep.
Sam: Before we go to sleep, I go over to Kima and I say to her, Lady Kima, I think we're all going to take a rest and you as well, correct?
Matt: "I think I should."
Sam: We can trust you while we're all asleep not to do anything to any of our companions, correct?
Matt: "If you're worried about the mind flayer, I'll be keeping an eye, but nothing beyond that. Remember: he has to make the side-step, the wrong step, before I take any action. Trust and know that if I were to strike a blow, it's at his own poor choice and actions."
Orion: That first part of what you said rhymed.
Sam: Does she seem to be telling the truth?
Matt: Make an insight check.
Sam: A what? What check?
Matt: Insight.
Sam: Insight. Okay, 18.
Matt: She seems to be true.
Sam: Okay.
Matt: She is legitimately concerned about Clarota. But also understands that at this moment, it has not done anything to necessarily draw her blade.
Liam: Lady Kima, Clarota, may I suggest you take the first watch?
Sam: (laughs) Oh my god, what if they start fucking? (all laugh)
Taliesin: So it's going to be that sort of evening, excellent.
Liam: Rated M, for mature.
Matt: Clarota says, "Should you insist." And Clarota's image shimmers and vanishes.
Orion: Sweet.
Taliesin: I'm falling asleep.
Matt: As you guys are all going to sleep, Kima's still sharpening her sword and she stops for a second and goes, "Everyone, I'm sorry you've lost your friend. If he lives, we shall find him."
Laura: He will live.
Taliesin: And we will find him.
Ashley: No, he will, Scanlan! You just calm down.
Matt: "But if they have indeed taken him prisoner and Emberhold is lost, there is only one place they would bring him: Yug'Voril."
Laura: (gasps) With the dude with the black horn.
Matt: "Considering the mess that you've made since entering their realm of living and work, you'd make for a great gift to their current standing demigod. If we aren't able to find him within the city, I think that may be the next place to look."
Marisha: Once again, are you afraid they're going to take him while we're asleep? Is this a genuine concern? Is this something we should move on now?
Matt: "Not as long as you're keeping concentration, we should be fine."
Laura: I'm concentrating so hard. (all laugh)
Liam: We're busted up.
Taliesin: There's legitimately nothing to be done.
Matt: There's a softness that hits Kima's face and you can see a bit of a quiver to her chin and she goes, "The guilt I feel for unknowingly putting you all in danger for my sake is immense. It's because of me and my actions that you even delved this far and nearly lost life and limb, merely at the behest of Allura and... I want you all to know that I appreciate it. I really, truly do."
Orion: That's great. If you can mention that to Allura, that'd be wonderful.
Matt: "I would really appreciate it to speak to Tiberius."
Orion: (mumbles, makes spell sounds, returns to normal voice) I would really appreciate it if you mentioned that to Allura. I'm trying to get into her good graces and whatnot.
Matt: She chuckles a moment and says, "All right. Allura is a good friend. Well we've known each other for... gods, 15 years now. Since we defeated the Scourged Rider, together. But she has always had more of a political mind than I do, so, when we were both offered a seat on the council of Tal'Dorei and Emon she stayed, and I... I'm a woman of action, and I knew my destiny was out in the world."
Orion: We share something in common, Lady Kima. I, too, have left my home and land because I did not want to sit on the council of Draconia. With blessings from my father and such, I gained ambassadorship on a mission for them, but really, just so I could--
Matt: Her eyes have glazed over and are staring off into the distance. (all laugh)
Orion: To get all the things out, and I saw this wonderful lamb in this field one time--
Matt: "I was speak to Allura of your honor and deeds, Tiberius. We try to have drinks and swap stories every few months. She's a good one."
Orion: Yes, I think so.
Matt: She takes a moment to herself and looks around at the rest of you and says, "The cruel king. Who dealt the final blow?"
Sam: (clears throat) That would be the kingslayer. Me.
Matt: She steps up and walks over to you and puts a hand on your shoulder and gives you a stern look in the eye and shakes your shoulder. She's a halfling, so she's not too much taller than you. (all laugh)
Sam: (laughing) Oh, okay.
Matt: "Good. The cruel king is down, and I thank you for that." She walks back to the little perch on the rock at the side of the wall and says, "He tried to break me. Relish in his false superiority. Dragging hooks across my flesh, underestimating the will of a servant of Bahamut."
Marisha: Are you congratulating us for being murderers? Is that what you're doing right now?
Matt: "Murder and justice are two entirely different things and the deities of all good saw to it that this King's time was limited."
Marisha: Are you suggesting now that we control the wills of the deities?
Matt: "No, but we enact them, as long as we work within your plans to keep us safe."
Marisha: That's mighty bold and presumptuous of you.
Matt: "My life has been given to guidance of the platinum dragon, who has not seen nothing but the positive direction for all of your species, mine and the rest of humanity, that exists in the material plane. You would do well to not disrespect one who looks out for you, even though you may not look up to him for guidance. The reason these lands that you grew up in are safe and free, as much as they are, are because of the sacrifices of my brethren who came before me under his light and guidance. I'm not saying you to worship him-- each one has their own gods of choice. I just say, show some respect."
Marisha: I do show respect, Lady Kima. I show respect when I feel that respect has been earned.
Orion: She's royalty, you have to understand.
Sam: We're all a bit cranky. Maybe we should just turn in.
Matt: "I watched as they executed my companions! The wondrous men and women who came down to these caverns at my sides with my coin in their pockets, with the promise of justice. And they laughed as they cut their throats before me, hoping it would be able to crack me. It was Bahamut's strength that held me there."
Marisha: Lady Kima, I am not saying that what we are doing here is not just. I only wish that you understand-- and I humbly thank you for your appreciation and thanks for coming down here to rescue you. But you are correct. We have lost a friend. Someone who we have been through a lot with, way more than we have been with you. So. Before we start boasting congratulations and you start thanking us, why don't you wait? And we'll see what happens when we all get out of here first.
Liam: She's suffering from PTSD. Why are you poking the badger?
Laura: Maybe we should just calm down and go to sleep.
Matt: Kima takes a step forward towards Keyleth. And as you look up at her face, there's a tension, but you can see now that she's stepped near in to you, towards what little bit of light seems to cascade through this cavern, there are tears streaking down her face.
Laura: How do you feel now? (all laugh)
Matt: "They tried all they could to break me, but I knew my destiny would not end here. I have a destiny that does not end here."
Ashley: I reach out really slowly and give her a handkerchief. (all laugh)
Ashley: And then retreat.
Taliesin: Lady Kima, as I'm sure you know, grief speaks before sense.
Marisha: All I'm saying, Lady Kima, is that after what we have done and what we have been through and the lives and the blood that even I have on my hands, you had better be worth it.
Taliesin: Let us wait for talk of worth and talk of might until we are reunited.
Matt: She puts a hand up towards you. "Child, let me explain to you why we are here. As while you may have stepped into the pretense of keeping me out of harm's way, there is a purpose that I and now all of us serve, here in the Underdark. Now, I've been on this journey for more than a year, traveling wherever the wind took me, finding where my gift would find an end to suffering, justice to the wicked and comfort to the downtrodden. I'd just returned from the frozen tundra northeast of these Cliffkeep mountains, heading to meet with Allura, the same friend who brought you here."
Orion: I pop out of my sleep. Did you say Allura again?
Matt: "Shh."
Orion: I'm sorry.
Laura: Tiberius. Shh.
Matt: "My vision came to me. I'm sure you're familiar with visions. The great platinum dragon bestowed upon my humble self a dream. I saw an ancient vision of the great and terrible god of undeath himself: Orcus. His crimson, leathery skin and endless wings rumbling through the Abyss itself. He had chosen a champion, one that would unite the material world and the heart of the Abyss, bringing a doorway of oblivion to our world. He cut from his own head two of his terrible black horns, placing them upon the brow of this chosen warrior, his avatar to these realms, granting him power no mortal should ever have. I saw heroes, long forgotten, rise up to destroy this shadow champion, losing much in the ensuing battle. Loss, far more than you or I will ever know. The body of the avatar was burned away, but the horns of Orcus remained. Untouched by flame, blade, nor divine judgement. These keepers of the horns had a title that time has taken and the whereabouts of the artifacts that had been, thankfully, lost as well. Until the next dream dispelled my confusion. I felt a cackling entity of immense power, who had discovered one of the holding vaults, never meant to be found. This creature obsessed, spent all their attention to unlock the promised treasure within and over time, they did. One of the two horns had found a new champion, one who now resides deeper within the Underdark here. One we've now known to be called K'varn. This one who has united the illithid and the duergar alike under a banner of madness, expansion, and mockery of life. I've seen these experiments, as have you. This is what I came down here to dispose of, once and for all. Now, I hired some of the finest warriors in Kraghammer for this, all of whom have been slain or worse. That guilt weighs upon my soul. And this very quest, whoever this K'varn monstrosity, it holds the horn of Orcus upon its brow. My visions have told me that we must destroy it and must do so soon. If it had already unlocked the artifact's true potential, Kraghammer would be a ruin before you even arrived. But it's only a matter of time. We must end K'Varn and retrieve this horn and return it to the Tal'Dorei council to discuss how to seal it once more, hopefully for all of eternity. Your friend's loss is a terrible thing, but we will try to find him and should we not, understand that his sacrifice was not in vain. For we're here not to save one, but thousands, hundreds of thousands of lives, if we succeed. So we sleep, we rest, we find your friend and we destroy this, this abomination, this anathema."
Marisha: Lady Kima, I only hope you do not eventually become what you fear so much. Good night.
Sam: Sleep tight.
Matt: She picks up her blade, sits back down and goes back to sharpening (sounds of a sharpening stone hitting blade).
Laura: That was weird, right? Good night.
Taliesin: That went well.
Sam: Pike, I'll cuddle you for warmth, if that would help?
Ashley: It's already so hot in here with all the lava and stuff, I would just prefer to sleep alone. I'm sorry.
Sam: That's fine. That's what I meant.
Marisha: I turn into Minxie form and go off in the corner and curl up in the corner.
Liam: Scanlan, I'm very cold. (all laugh)
Sam: You know what? We better let that foot heal. We better let it heal.
Laura: Trinket, go sleep with Vax.
Liam: That's a good idea. Come here, Trinky. Trink!
Matt: (bear sounds and sniffing)
Liam: Who wants nibbles?
Matt: Trinket comes up and curls next to you. The evening goes by, uneventful. Occasionally, you stumble out of your rest, keep an eye out. The beacon still resides. From what you can imagine, a natural body sleep cycle that you're used to passes. A few begin to wake up before the others, as you have no daylight to ascertain whether it is day or night. Indeed, who knows what it is at this point.
Orion: I relieved myself in the middle of the night.
Laura: Thank you for telling us, Tiberius.
Sam: Did you get up?
Matt: Just wake up in a puddle of his own dragonborn filth?
Orion: I did my dragonborn business and buried it. As we do.
Laura: So have we healed completely?
Matt: Yes, you've all healed completely at this point. You had an evening's rest.
Sam: Do we get all our spells back and stuff?
Matt: You get your spells back.
Marisha: We have to pick them for the day, right?
Sam: I can do things again.
Marisha: Yeah, hang on, got to think about this.
Orion: Put some Greater Restorations in there.
Matt: Your mark? Wait, your mark, your Hunter's Mark, which you can feel, the magic of it is slowly waning as the spell comes to the end of its effective period, is moving.
Laura: (gasps) Where's it moving?
Matt: It's moving out of the city.
Laura: Where, which direction?
Matt: Best you can tell, it's heading towards the opposite side of the cavern towards where it curves down, deeper and below.
Laura: Wait. Where is that in relation to us?
Matt: To where you guys are? If you're looking out from next to the Emberhold, it's to your right, curving down and around.
Laura: We should go that direction.
Marisha: I go and cast Pass Without a Trace on us.
Matt: All right.
Liam: This is suddenly turning into Labyrinth. "Beyond the Goblin city..."
Matt: To take back the child, which you have stolen.
Laura: You have no power over me.
Sam: The way we came in the city was through the side path, right?
Matt: Yes, the side of Emberhold, which you followed the curvature of this giant cavern around and you slept on the side, up against the wall, using the illusion, the illusory terrain.
Sam: So we're already--
Matt: You're already away from Emberhold, you're on the side of the wall, maybe about a quarter to a half a mile further down.
Sam: But if we keep going, we'll get to the--
Matt: You'll head down further into the cavern, seemingly in the direction where her Hunter's Mark is currently leading, which has now faded.
Sam: Okay! Your Hunter's Mark is gone.
Laura: Well, it went that way. We should go.
Sam: So, let's go. Let's just hurry.
Laura: As stealthily as possible so we don't alert the entire freaking camp.
Taliesin: We've got Pass Without a Trace, so we should be all right.
Matt: All right.
Laura: I try to make it look like we weren't around this area as much as possible without our Dust of Tracelessness.
Matt: You're sweeping behind the group as they're all moving along. With your imaginary brush.
Liam: Trinket's doing that thing where he pulls with his front feet and drags with his behind.
Taliesin: He's just rolling like a giant brillo brush.
Marisha: I put Stone Shape in my Ring of Holding last night with my unused spells. I meant to tell you that last night.
Matt: That's all right. All right, you do that.
Ashley: Oh, I forgot you had that ring.
Matt: All right, so.
Orion: I take out my Ioun Stones.
Matt: Okay, so your Ioun Stones are now slowly rotating around your head. Well, you can only have one up at a time.
Orion: Well, I only have one.
Matt: Yeah, okay, good. You said stones, so.
Orion: Sorry. Pathfinder habit.
Matt: I know. So moving around your head slowly. All right, so the rest of you gather, you cast your spell Pass Without a Trace. You continue to crest along the outskirts of the cavern wall at this point. Looking over, you can see, throughout the night, most of the fortress, currently-- the lava fall that once contained it is completely cooled and is dark. It looks like their way of stopping the flow was to stop the entire magma fall. Who knows how much damage has been done, but currently the flow is halted and you can see now, there's a number of parties of duergar that are wandering out, through the cavern, presumably in search for you.
Laura: So technically, Lady Kima, we might be able to get back in eventually and get your weapon.
Matt: As you say that, she grins to herself and says, "I would like that very much. I had some sentimental value to that equipment."
Laura: And there's a vault.
Matt: "And there is a vault."
Sam: Unless it melted.
Liam: This will greatly enhance your ability to move forward with us, won't it?
Matt: "I think right now time is of the essence for your friend more than anything."
Laura: We should go look for Grog.
Matt: "Besides, I highly doubt that that stronghold has been left alone, just because it's filled with rock."
Liam: Maybe on the way out.
Matt: Okay, so as you guys progress on the side, I would like everybody to roll a stealth check, please.
Laura: Oh, I don't know which one to roll.
Matt: You still have disadvantage, but you have advantage with your cloak, so you're neutralized. You're a normal roll right now.
Marisha: (softly) Stealth check.
Ashley: We have advantage?
Marisha: You have plus ten.
Matt: No, you have disadvantage still.
Ashley: I do not. There's no plus anything?
Sam: Plus ten.
Ashley: Ten still?
Orion: 29.
Liam: Plus ten?
Matt: Plus ten.
Orion: 29.
Sam: 19.
Marisha: 33.
Taliesin: 17.
Ashley: 21.
Laura: 24.
Liam: 33.
Laura: Oh, I didn't roll for Trinket. Hold on.
Liam: Oh, Trinket rolled a one.
Laura: Trinket, shush. Oh, I didn't feed him today, he's probably so hungry.
Sam: Have any of us eaten?
Ashley: We've rested.
Matt: Essentially, as opposed to having this minutiae of reminding you all to eat, I just consider when you rest and take short rests, you're snacking and resting. Otherwise, we communally spend ten minutes a game talking about what you ate. If food begins to become scarce, which it may in time, I'll let you know.
Liam: Foot flakes anyone? Foot flakes?
Matt: It's like pork rinds (chuckles). All right. So, as you continue down this cavern, you begin to see the search parties in the distance and you keep low and watch as they pass. Some of them have small, that red glowish stone torches set out to keep their vision about. You can see a few of the parties returning to the city. Eventually, you guys begin to crest down deeper and dropping into a small decline as this giant, almost hatchback cavern where most of the duergar civilization is built in comes to an end. You begin to travel deeper, deeper into the Underdark caverns below. As you're continuing forward, you find a very very familiar scent catches your attention immediately, as you're tracking through, trying to keep your attention on possibly any sign of Grog. It's the smell of blood. It's the smell of fresh blood. Fresh-ish.
Laura: Fresh-ish?
Matt: Fresh-ish blood, if you will. You smell fresh-ish blood. You immediately glance over and you can see on the side of this cavern, which is about 50, 60 feet wide at this point, as it's come to a pinching point leading downward, you can see a spatter of blood across the wall to your immediate left, and what looks like a mangled mass of what once was a duergar, currently just torn asunder across this rock wall.
Laura: Oh no.
Marisha: Does it look to be natural, done by an animal? Or does it look like people with weapons?
Matt: Go ahead and make an investigation check.
Laura: The only time I've seen duergar split across like this was when we saw the camp of that creepy centipede creature.
Liam: With the stalagmite coming up?
Laura: Yeah.
Marisha: Ten.
Laura: Do I see any of those kind of tracks around?
Matt: You check and look around on the ground as well, you unfortunately, as you look around, you're not able to pick up the fine details. You, however, just being naturally understanding of the Underdark, as well as having the previous knowledge of inspecting the initial camp: yes, these tracks are very similar. You see what looks like these strange dragging marks on the ground, these elongated ones. No footprints. Occasionally you see what looks like a human-sized footprint as well, and then these drag marks. You also notice that there is just beyond the rock threshold, as you step over towards the wall, you see three other duergar bodies that are torn asunder. Many of them partially eaten and violently torn apart. Some parts are scarred, some sort of acidic burn, and you see tooth marks, you see claw marks and you see portions of limbs that have been pulled off by sheer force.
Marisha: Could I do a nature check to see if I would know of a creature that could do this?
Matt: You certainly can.
Laura: It's going to be that centipede creature thingy.
Marisha: Ooh. 26.
Matt: 26. It's weird. There are elements of the drag marks on the ground that resemble a creature that has pseudopods or some sort of a tentacle-like mass, but you know of no natural creature that also has this power, this type of hunting technique, nor would be this far underground.
Taliesin: I think it's another stitch monster.
Liam: Yes.
Laura: Stitch monster.
Taliesin: Stitch monster.
Laura: I like it.
Taliesin: I do, too.
Laura: It's a good name.
Marisha: Something tentacle-y though. Nothing ever good is tentacle-y.
Laura: Can I tell if Grog definitely came this way?
Matt: Go ahead and make a tracking check, so just go ahead and roll a d20. You have advantage, because you're in the Underdark.
Laura: What do I add that to?
Matt: It should be under your tracking ability under your ranger abilities there. In your spells, under you ranger abilities. I'll see if I find it before you.
Laura: I don't understand.
Matt: It's on the sheet I gave you, with all your character stuff.
Laura: Oh. Okay, cool.
Matt: That one. The one that's easiest.
Laura: Natural explorer, primeval awareness.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: I don't have any idea what I'm looking for. (all laugh)
Laura: I'm just looking at words right now.
Matt: It's a survival check. There you go.
Laura: It's a survival check.
Matt: You have advantage on it.
Laura: Okay. Oh, good. So that's 22.
Matt: 22. All right. Looking around, what you do find is, there is a very familiar scent that a goliath barbarian does have. You, using Trinket's help, as you yourself are not quite as attuned, Trinket does pick up a little bit of Grog's scent in this pathway. So Trinket (moans) gives you a nudge and points deeper down the cavern. And you can see what looks to be a smattering of small duergar-sized feet and two grooves.
Laura: Two grooves?
Matt: About two-inch-wide grooves that continue down the path.
Laura: I wonder if they have him prisoner now. If he came out of his mind funk.
Marisha: Wheel tracks?
Matt: It could very well be wheel tracks.
Orion: Or they're dragging his body.
Matt: They're consistent and their width is consistent.
Marisha: Their width is consistent? And they seem clean?
Sam: They've put him on some sort of stretcher thing.
Marisha: Yeah, sounds like they have him on, yeah, a trailer.
Laura: Lovely. Well, Grog definitely came this way. As did the stitch monster, so you don't have much choice but to follow.
Taliesin: Let's continue.
Orion: Shall we?
Taliesin: All right.
Laura: Be aware. We're all very aware of--
Marisha: Things.
Laura: Any movement at all... happening.
Taliesin: Guys, stuff.
Matt: Keeping your eyes peeled, you travel for another two and a half hours down this cavern path. It grows tighter at points where you can only really fit three or four individuals through, it's about 20, 25 feet wide, then opens up sporadically into other small pockets, where the natural topography of this portion of this Underdark cavern structure seems to weave and bend. The warmth and that sulfurous smell that was intrinsic to the duergar portion of this cavern that you were so used to, begins to slowly fade and temperature begins to drop. Still uncomfortable, but it's growing more humid as opposed to dry heat.
Orion: It's so good.
Matt: After another hour of travel, keeping your eyes out, the temperature drops significantly and is actually quite cold. The heat in the volcanic portion of this cavern structure apparently has passed you now, and you've hit an area of the rock where it is a much more chilled, much more ominous--
Orion: It's humid still?
Matt: Human?
Orion: Humid.
Matt: Humid? The humidity begins to fade as well. The air becomes a dry cold.
Orion: So we're past that.
Matt: You eventually using, which by the way the only light source you have going forward is the light from your staff.
Orion: Oh, Light!
Matt: I assume you've had it up this whole time or you've been walking in the darkness.
Orion: Oh, yes, of course.
Matt: (chuckles) You continue down and the topography, which was once the black, jagged obsidian flooring of the previous portion of the Underdark, begins to give way to a more natural gray sand-type texture. Your feet sink about a quarter inch or so with each step, and you get about ten, 15 feet before the color of the sand and the texture changes dramatically. It looks almost like a peppering of small whitish-yellow stones and rocks, as well as bits of black and grey. It's like a giant, rocky pit out in front of you.
Marisha: What?
Liam: Meaning it's all solid stone that color or loose gravel and rock?
Matt: You find sand and then the sand eventually gives way to like larger pieces of these rocks and stones.
Marisha: So it's like a pebble ball pit in front of us?
Matt: Essentially.
Taliesin: I'm looking for signs of mining.
Matt: Okay, go ahead and make an investigation check.
Orion: I'm going to make an arcana check, also.
Taliesin: 15.
Matt: 15. Checking the walls immediately in your vicinity, you see there are signs of mining, but they're old, they haven't been used in a while. You can see some veins that are dried up. Looks like maybe the duergar had business down here mining.
Marisha: Does it look like there-- Can I do a nature check to see if this is an old lake bed? Like there is a river bed?
Matt: Sure, go and do that. What did you roll?
Orion: 11.
Matt: What are you checking?
Orion: For arcana.
Matt: What are you checking?
Orion: Just general, if I feel a general source of sinister magic anywhere.
Matt: Nothing arcane seems to emanate from the vicinity.
Liam: Vex'ahlia, you know the Underdark. Are there any critters crawling around in that pit?
Laura: Is this still the Underdark?
Matt: You seem to be still in the Underdark, but the Underdark in general you're familiar with; your training and studying on the denizens of it, what things to look for. This is not a natural or overall occurrence you've read about before.
Laura: I can't sense anything or any creatures nearby?
Matt: Not per se.
Marisha: I rolled a 16.
Matt: Rolled a 16? As you're looking around, you go and inspect the stones. What you do notice is, they're not stones. There are pieces of glass, little shards of actual volcanic glass scattered across this entire field mixed with an endless seemingly sea of small bone chunks.
Laura: Ugh!
Marisha: Chunks?
Laura: Great!
Matt: Pieces of bone that have been rounded off, ground, broken.
Orion: Bone petals.
Matt: They're ancient.
Marisha: Okay, so there appears to be-- are there any whole pieces of bones? Big femurs or skulls?
Sam: This was some sort of burial ground.
Matt: It's hard to see. Most of the bones that have been here, have been around long enough to the point where they've eroded, been broken, destroyed over and over again to the point where you can't discern any of the original creatures they may have come from. It's just a sea of bone, obsidian glass, and small bits of stone that have fallen from the actual nearby cavern.
Liam: Can we see any sort of civilized construction here? Or is this all the work of nature or some living thing?
Matt: Go ahead and make a perception check.
Liam: 18.
Matt: 18? You look past the barrier of his light spell, because you can only get a little bit past that due to your elven low-light vision. You do notice there are occasionally some spires of natural rock, some stalagmites that are jutting out in the distance, and you see what looks like some semblance of a ruined wall just beyond the edge of the vision. Like a crumbled, small wall.
Laura: Can I use my primeval awareness and see if I can sense Grog within six miles of us?
Matt: Certainly. All right, so how does your primeval awareness work, miss ranger?
Laura: Oh, I can use an action to focus my awareness on a region around me and then I can sense whether-- oh, well, no. It's only certain types of creatures.
Matt: Right. Which are?
Liam: Like goliath?
Laura: Well, no. It says "aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead".
Liam: That still might be useful, even if it doesn't find Grog.
Matt: What you do gather, you do sense a very strong force of aberration-based, much further, like five miles ahead, way ahead, and you have this weird, "Okay, good to know." You don't sense anything else, but you do sense a general presence about this entire sea of bone.
Ashley: I've been here!
Marisha: What?!
Ashley: I was here in the vision.
Laura: Really?
Ashley: Yes, it was a field of broken glass and bone, and I feel like this is it.
Laura: So what do we do?
Ashley: And then after that, I got to a cavern of blue crystal.
Laura: So we have to go beyond it.
Marisha: So we're on the right road.
Ashley: I think we have to go beyond this.
Taliesin: All right.
Orion: Well, let's keep moving, then.
Laura: Can we keep to the edge and try to not disturb the rock as much as possible.
Matt: As you move to either edge, you can see the wall comes to a straight meeting with this. Aside from the climbing the walls proper, you have no other way of traversing this.
Liam: Could you describe the dimensions of this one more time?
Matt: Yes. The cavern itself is about 120 to 150 feet wide. You don't see the ceiling right now.
Laura: Oh, it's that high?
Liam: So, from our left to our right, 150 feet?
Matt: Correct.
Liam: And is it a big circular shape?
Matt: From what you can tell, it just opens up and then continues and then darkness. You cannot see beyond it.
Laura: Are there any rocks around us? Any big rocks?
Matt: There are a couple of small spires about 60, 70 feet out.
Laura: Anything loose? Anything I can grab near us?
Matt: Around you? Most everything that's grabbable are part of it, yeah.
Ashley: We don't have the magic carpet. So never mind.
Sam: What, do you want to fly?
Liam: I say we take a wall.
Taliesin: Say we just gingerly try and cross against a wall.
Laura: Yeah. Anything to throw as far as I can out and see if it--
Matt: You look around and find a small pebble, and you chuck it (sound of pebble flying through air and landing) It arcs around, bounces a bit, and comes to rest.
Sam: Let's just go.
Marisha: No! No, I'm not touching that. Nope.
Sam: What are we going to do? Turn around? Grog's that way.
Marisha: Okay, here's my idea. We've got that immovable rod.
Orion: Yes, I know where you're going with this, and we'd all have to make a certain--
Matt: Once again, there's something about this whole area, there's a presence about it. It's ominous, and everywhere about this floor.
Marisha: I don't want to touch this. I feel like we should go over it.
Ashley: What if these bones come to life?
Laura: Can you send your light source up? Can anybody send light up and see how high the ceiling goes?
Orion: (mumbles) Shoot an arrow, if you would, Vex, please? Wherever you wish.
Laura: Okay.
Orion: Light!
Matt: Okay, cast out an arrow. As it shoots over, arcs through the air. You get a look of the cavern. You can see it's a large, arched, natural cavern with a number of hanging stalactites at the top. It goes up, arcs past, and then lands probably about a half a mile down the way. Really nice shot.
Laura: Thanks.
Matt: And it lands with a (impact noise). With what little bit you can see through the arc, this path just continues and continues and continues for that full half mile.
Laura: There's no way to avoid it.
Marisha: There's no way to avoid it.
Matt: You do get a nice view of what looks to be more of these little, central pieces of broken wall. Looks like there was either a small series of structures or buildings that were built once within this cavern that have all completely crumbled to ruin with but a few small bastions of foundation that still remain.
Laura: Tiberius, how many times can you cast pillars of... whatever? Pillars.
Orion: Grand Columns is the spell, Vex.
Laura: How many times can you cast Grand Columns?
Orion: Multiple times, I guess.
Laura: Could we potentially walk on columns across this thing? Potentially.
Marisha: I mean, I could wall of-- bend us a stone wall that's and we could just walk along the path. But it goes only so far.
Orion: Hold on a second. I've got something here.
Liam: We're seeing the remains of buildings scattered throughout, maybe we could go from--
Laura: What about a wall from out from the side?
Marisha: The side? And then we walk along that side?
Laura: Yeah!
Marisha: Yeah, we could do that, right?
Matt: How big is the wall you can make?
Laura: What were you going to say?
Liam: Well, there's little islands of structure left, we could just--
Laura: Hop.
Liam: Stand bridge, stand bridge, stand bridge.
Marisha: I can go 120 feet. I can make about 120 feet wall.
Matt: You saw about a quarter to a half mile. This seems to continue.
Laura: So, that might not be enough.
Sam: She'd have to do it 20 times.
Taliesin: I think we may just have to walk gingerly.
Marisha: Maybe we can fashion--
Ashley: Should we find traps? Check for traps?
Marisha: Can we fashion snow boots?
Liam: Vax starts feeling along one side of the wall. Does the ground look firm and more stable on the edges? Or is it all just the same?
Matt: Do you step out a little bit into the area?
Liam: Hand on the wall.
Matt: Hand on the wall? I mean, it's a wall.
Liam: No, but I mean-- yes.
Matt: But you step out with your hand on the wall.
Liam: I'm not stepping out yet. I'm looking at the ground. Is it pebbles and rock all the way to the sides?
Matt: All the way up to the wall.
Marisha: Okay.
Orion: Lady Keyleth, if you will, could you perhaps make a flat, sturdy stone tablet we could all particularly stand on.
Marisha: Sure.
Orion: Make sure it's under a hundred pounds, if you could. Or actually, two hundred pounds, a little bit more to work with.
Marisha: I use Stone Shape and I bend down and make a big circle where I am. Carve out a little cylinder with Stone Shape.
Matt: So, using a very earthbender-y hand motion, you take a portion of the wall right next to you, send it outward and begin to shape it into this large cylinder--
Marisha: Disc.
Matt: Disc-like platform, that's (boof) on the ground, right at the base of the platform.
Orion: Everybody, hop on.
Laura: Trinket, hop on this rock.
Orion: Wait a minute, how much does Trinket weigh?
Laura: A lot.
Liam: Is it 200?
Matt: Trinket weighs more than that.
Liam: Trinket weighs a ton. All of us together.
Marisha: Maybe you could just levitate Trinket behind?
Orion: I don't have that spell anymore. I need to know how much she weighs for this.
Matt: Trinket, I mean, looking at it, you haven't really weighed her yourself, you gather--
Laura: Trinket's a boy!
Matt: Trinket weighs approximately-- (all laugh)
Sam: Trinket's a boy?! With a name like Trinket?
Liam: Haven't you seen his wang flopping around under his tail?
Matt: Trinket's probably close to a thousand.
Orion: So here's the situation. I can get us all across, but I cannot take Trinket as well.
Laura: I'm not leaving Trinket behind. So everybody get on that and we'll see what happens.
Sam: Why don't we go across. He can come back and get Trinket.
Laura: Okay, yeah. How about you guys go and I'll stay with Trinket. You guys go.
Liam: Well, I'm not going to leave her.
Marisha: Can we make him weightless and then tug him along with the rope? We can't do that?
Ashley: I have a question. How many feet across?
Laura: It's like half a mile.
Matt: Quarter to a half mile from what you can tell, like I said, you only have vision enough to where the arrow arced and it was a very long arc, that just trailed off so you gather anywhere between a quarter to a half mile.
Ashley: I want to run across. (all laugh)
Sam: With your heavy armor.
Liam: Sneak right in there.
Laura: Oh, just do it.
Ashley: Wait, are we getting on the rock?
Liam: How far is the closest little island of remaining structure that you referenced?
Matt: Oh it's probably about 60, 70 feet out.
Laura: I don't sense any undead with my primal awareness do I?
Matt: The perpetual presence that you sense across the entirety of this bed of bone and glass, if you had to describe it, it has some sort of undead-ish realm. It's not your specialty, I mean it is, like undead creatures are, and the presence is similar to that.
Ashley: I get my Mace of Disruption ready.
Laura: Oh, and Kima!
Marisha: (gasps) Oh! We're done! We can do this! We polymorph Trinket!
Orion: That's it, yes!
Marisha: We polymorph Trinket!
Orion: Very good.
Ashley: Into a tiny tiny?
Orion: Make him into a chicken.
Matt: You instinctively glance around, you look down, and you notice your holy symbol of Sarenrae has a hairline fracture in it. What was once a perfect and impeccable sphere of design-- you've had this your entire life, you look down and see, you don't know how recently, but a portion of the metal symbol itself is cracked.
Sam: Oh, Pike.
Ashley: Oh no, this is terrible.
Laura: Pike, pray! do something!
Orion: I motion over to Pike and I take her medallion slowly off of her and go-- and bring out my Mending Wheel.
Matt: Your Mending Wheel, which was where? It was in the Bag of Holding.
Orion: No, I held that.
Matt: The Mending Wheel's this big. You haven't been carrying it with you this entire time!
Orion: What? I thought it was like this big.
Matt: (laughs) Tiberius.
Ashley: I'll take my symbol back, put it back on, and say, this is something that I've got to-- this is something I need to deal with. We can't just put it in a Mending Wheel.
Liam: The gods reward deeds, not words.
Ashley: Yes.
Marisha: Maybe it happened in the fight.
Ashley: I think I know why it happened.
Sam: Maybe because you've been killing unarmed people?
Ashley: I think it was when I slit the guy's throat. She got mad. Just a hunch.
Sam: But you know what? We'll do some good deeds when we're done.
Ashley: Yeah. This is something that I need to fix, but thank you for trying.
Orion: I forgot we didn't have it.
Laura: Well, Trinket, what do you want to be? A lizard? A mouse?
Matt: (bear noises)
Laura: A kitten? (gasps) A kitten.
Ashley: A little kitty.
Laura: You want to be a kitten?
Matt: (laughs) Trinket glances over at you with a look in the eye of like--
Marisha: And I go (floop), and I make him a kitten. What kind of kitten?
Laura: Oh, he's a Persian.
Marisha: He's a Persian kitten.
Matt: Trinket's form (shwoop) shifts down into this tiny white puffball with a pushed-in nose.
Laura: You're the cutest, Trinket.
Ashley: I go and I snuggle, and I nuzzle him.
Laura: I tuck him into my shirt.
Matt: You sense immediately, Trinket is not necessarily pleased, but will deal with it.
Marisha: Well, he's so cute.
Laura: He's so cute.
Orion: In Draconia, those are snacks.
Sam: I wouldn't say that.
Laura: Let's go! Come on! Let's get on this thing! Grog's getting ahead of us.
Sam: All right, let's go. On our stone airplane.
Marisha: Let's get on the Wonkavator, everybody.
Ashley: All right hop on. I hop on.
Matt: All right, so you all hop onto this giant stone. It's really cramped, you're all shoulder-to-shoulder pushed onto here, clutched onto your new Persian cat. Kima and Clarota step onto it.
Orion: I cast Telekinesis on the stone slab, lift us up, and push us.
Matt: Okay, how much weight can you push through Telekinesis?
Orion: A thousand.
Matt: Okay.
Orion: I did all the math. (clears throat) Vax weighs 155, Pike weighs 75. Taliesin weighs 190, Vex weighs 120.
Ashley: But Scanlan weighs nothing.
Orion: Sam weighs the same, 75. Keyleth weighs 125.
Matt: Yep. Kima weighs 105. With all of her armor, she'd be 105.
Sam: Clarota can float.
Matt: Clarota can float. Does that still fall under a thousand total?
Orion: Yeah, should. Is that right?
Sam: What about you?
Taliesin: Plus the rock.
Laura: The rock would be less.
Orion: That's why I kept a hundred pounds for that.
Marisha: A hundred pounds for the rock.
Liam: Want to run those numbers again for the calculator?
Matt: Rock's 100 pounds? That's not a lot of stone.
Laura: It's a very thin piece of stone.
Matt: That's a very thin piece of stone. All right.
Orion: Nine. Nope, we're at nine-- we're there. We're at nine-something. You can do all the math, but it's nine-something.
Matt: Okay, all right, so you all stand on the platform. It (straining noises) rises up, and it's one of those all of you have to gather yourself, but nevertheless it is now floating. How long does it last, concentration wise?
Orion: Ten minutes.
Matt: All right.
Laura: Quick! Float us!
Matt: So, as Tiberius begins to concentrate, the stone begins to glide out over this expanse of broken bone and obsidian glass.
Orion: I hover about-- what's bone break?-- around six feet above the air. That's how high I take it.
Matt: Okay, so you're cresting about six feet. You have to move it around occasionally to avoid some of the large stalagmites that are jutting out of the bones.
Laura: Do we see anything? I'm keeping an eye out, see if I see any movement or anything that's maybe sparkles. I don't know.
Taliesin: Keeping an eye behind us, as well.
Matt: Okay. You guys, keeping an eye out, you see more and more of this ruin, and you can see the the further in you go, you start seeing bits of bone that are larger than what's near the edge. You start seeing bits and pieces that are full bones, so they've been more-- still rounded and weathered, but they're less ground down as supposed to the edges where most of the traction seems to be. You get about 300 feet out before you hear a loud, echoing scream across the cavern. (loud yell)
Orion: In front of us?
Matt: In front of you guys.
Laura: What's it sound like?
Matt: It's male, and it's loud.
Laura: Go! Can we go faster?
Orion: We hear this. I push us forward. I mean, we're going in that direction anyways, so I speed us up.
Liam: Keyleth, take the gnomes!
Matt: Correct, okay. As you speed up and continue--
Ashley: I jump on Keyleth.
Liam: Take the gnomes!
Matt: Okay.
Ashley: Grab some feathers.
Sam: I'll grab on as well. Why not.
Matt: All right, so Keyleth, you transform maintaining concentration on Polymorph for Trinket, I believe, right? All right. It's not a spell, it's an effect you do. So you (whooshing noise) you transform into a giant eagle, you grab both the gnomes, you guys are lifted up off the platform as the platform continues to push forward.
Orion: Cool, so I get a little bit more control over it now. (grunts)
Matt: A little bit more. As you're pushing forward you feel the stone itself has this weird wobble to it, but you still manage to keep concentration, pushing forward. Eventually, the little bit of light from your Light spell cascades past one of these joining parts of a wall, and then beyond that you can see what looks like a few other stone pillars that are sticking up. And you see what looks to be a small party of duergar that are in the middle of battle. There is one duergar who is splattered across the bone floor. You see a troll that is currently in the middle of a fistfight with something that's moving extremely fast. This blur of motion. You can barely make out the physical form before the troll turns and runs in your direction, surprised to see the light coming towards you, and in its expression of extreme confusion and fear, you see something (whoosh) past, and its head just (soft falling sound). Rolls off the top of his shoulders.
Laura: That's not Grog! We're going to toward a monster!
Matt: (crashing sound) The troll body hits the ground. As it does you see bits of bone begin to rise up and pull the troll down underneath.
Laura: Oh, it's really good we're not standing on it!
Orion: Avoid! (whooshing sound)
Liam: Daggers out.
Taliesin: Guns out.
Matt: As you guys begin to push forward you can see two of the duergar are now backing up instinctually. One looks down at his feet now that have been grabbed, and he's being pulled under, and he just starts trying to wrestle himself free. This blur of motion jumps off one of the platforms, spins in the air, and lands with a slam that completely splatters across the rock that he's right next to. This duergar, you can see part of his jaw go flying off to the side and silence hits him in the middle of his scream. The last duergar there, you can see who's looking around, sees the stone platform, and goes, "Let me on! Let me on!" He goes running over and is trying to jump up towards the stone platform you guys are on.
Laura: How much does he weigh? (giggles)
Matt: Well, he's going to go ahead and try and grab it with an athletics check-- he makes it! (latching noise) He gets onto the side.
Sam: Kick him off!
Marisha: Fuck that guy!
Laura: I punch him in the face!
Matt: Okay, okay. You go ahead and (punch thud noise). You just beat him in the face. He holds tight. You're not a very strong person, unfortunately.
Liam: I grab him by the cloak. What is it? What is it?
Matt: "I don't know! Get it away! Get it away!"
Marisha: In eagle form, I'm going to do a nice high soaring lap.
Sam: We're on you!
Marisha: I know! It's okay! I'm going to use my-- I'm soaring high. It's an easy breeze. We're on the people mover. Okay. And I'm going to use my keen sight to see if I can get a good... (pew)
Matt: Okay, so, using that you glance down and in this brief moment where it seems like the cacophony of this entire circumstance slows down (slowing sound noise). And your eagle eyes glance down, and you can see in a brief moment the blur stops. You see a humanoid form. Looking at the body and the torso, it looks elven. Its very thin and gaunt legs dangling as four giant, jagged-looking tentacles sprout from both sides of its torso, holding it aloft. Two lifting it off the ground and keeping its body suspended, while two are (fwhoosh) whipping around in the process. As you're glancing, you see its head (cracking noise) glance up toward the wall. These blank, white eyes shooting around in different directions spontaneously, with this maddening look. Whatever this is is clearly insane and is currently driven on some sort of hunger bloodlust. The stitch marks you see across its body are very reminiscent of the earlier abominations that you saw, created by K'varn and sent throughout this cavern structure.
Liam: Keyleth's the only one who sees it, though, at this moment?
Orion: Do I see it?
Matt: You guys haven't yet. At the moment, you're talking to this dwarf or you're shoving him off the platform.
Orion: Can I see it as I'm cruising through? I see him?
Laura: We wanted to throw him as far as we could.
Liam: Yes, the twins pull him up and one--
Liam: Two, three!
Laura: Two, three!
Matt: (laughs) All right. As you chuck the duergar through the air, the creature who briefly had stopped, and you guys now see its motion stop, and you get a full view of its horrible form. (grunting, panting sounds)
Orion: As soon as I do that, I cast True Strike. (ftsssh)
Matt: All right, you cast True Strike on yourself?
Orion: On him!
Matt: On him?
Orion: What it does is, it allows me to see--keep going, I'll tell you. Go ahead.
Matt: All right, so it stops for a second. You guys all get a view of its vision. As it's looking up towards where Keyleth is, suddenly its head (shh) snaps back into focus as the duergar goes swinging through the air. As it does (snarling) it licks its lips and you can see now, where its mouth is, the lips curl back and the jaw splits open slightly with this horrible Predator-like fanged jaw, and the two tentacles that are currently up in the air reach out, grab, and (tshhh) just split it in two. Its torso then divides and sprays it with crimson as it (tongue flicking noise) licks it out of the air. (breathy growling)
Laura: (whispering) Go faster. Go faster!
Orion: I'm still going! We're still going. I'm not standing and watching.
Sam: Have we passed it yet?
Matt: Everyone roll initiative.
Laura: Oh my god, we're going to fight? We're going to fight this thing?
Marisha: I was going to say we should try and avoid him. Poop monster.
Laura: Oh, god.
Sam: No, we're floating above it. We've got advantage.
Marisha: Do we?
Laura: We're all stuck on a single piece of rock.
Orion: Yeah, well, that's the thing.
Sam: We're fine. One of us has guns.
Matt: All right.
Liam: And we saw the duergar get pulled under by skeletal arms?
Sam: By the bones.
Liam: Yeah, the bones pulled down, right? So it's not just this thing.
Matt: I'm using this as the figure for the creature.
Orion: By the way, Matthew.
Matt: Yes.
Orion: True Strike. I extend my hand and point a finger at a target. My magic grants me a brief insight into the target's defenses. On my next turn, I gain advantage on my first attack roll against the creature, using that spell as a guide.
Matt: Gotcha. So! For the purposes of this, the two gnomes are alongside Keyleth's eagle form.
Taliesin: Oh, we're going to use the little thingy?
Marisha: Yeah, are we going to use the levitating thingies?
Matt: What? Yes, we are. Let me pull them out right now over here.
Taliesin: Levitating thingies!
Marisha: Levitating thingies! Makes us look cool.
Taliesin: It's been so long.
Laura: Ooh, I like it.
Matt: There's the rest of you. Although, Trinket is a kitten.
Sam: Trinket is a cat.
Taliesin: Trinket only has the power of "adorability."
Matt: This is the stone slab over here that you guys have created. All right, so. Initiative rolls, everyone. Starting at... 25 to 20?
Laura: 21.
Matt: All right. That puts Vex at the top of the round there. And brings-- there we go. 20 to 15?
Liam: 17.
Orion: 18.
Matt: 18? 15 to ten?
Sam: 12.
Matt: Ten to five?
Marisha: Eight.
Taliesin: Eight.
Matt: (laughs) Okay.
Marisha: Team Eight.
Taliesin: Boom.
Matt: Pike, what did you get?
Ashley: Four.
Laura: Yay!
Matt: Okay, yay, Pike, bringing up the rear!
Marisha: Team Single Digits!
Ashley: Team Single Digits!
Taliesin: We'll get there.
Matt: Top of the round is the monstrosity. It is a very quick-- move the camera. Follow me this way. There we go. (all laugh)
Matt: It uses its quite grand movement of 50 feet to (shh) lumber over to this side, and it gets two attacks with its tentacles, with reach. Actually three attacks.
Marisha: On who?
Matt: This is going to be at you guys.
Liam: I don't need this foot.
Matt: This is going to be one at Kima, one at you and one at Tiberius as you are the three currently within its positioning view. First one is going to be at you.
Liam: Okay.
Matt: Oh, that is going to be a 14 to hit?
Liam: No.
Matt: All right, so you (whoosh) dodge out of the way. The one towards Kima. Oh that's going to be a 15 to hit, which it strikes her armor, but she manages to pull out of the way and it gleans off the side and you can see a little bit of this acid scarring across the edge of her leather armor. The third strike going out towards Tiberius (swoosh). That is (laughs) a critical one. It actually whips out and strikes the bottom of the stone you guys are standing on, which rocks it for a second, and you all essentially get worried but it seems to have no effect. That was a really terrible opening round for the creature.
Marisha: Here's my question. Is this all happening still over top of the bone pit?
Matt: Oh yeah.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: That brings us to Vex.
Laura: Hunter's Mark!
Matt: All right so you mark him
Laura: Right on that guy.
Matt: Do it. He is Hunter's Marked and I'm putting this on here as a reminder of your mark.
Laura: Okay.
Taliesin: It's so fashionable.
Matt: Isn't it though.
Laura: I'm going to lightning arrow him. Oh, I can't do that because I Hunter's Marked him.
Matt: Correct. that was your bonus action.
Laura: I'm going to Hail of Thorns that guy.
Matt: All righty, thorn hail him.
Laura: Okay, at level three.
Matt: Okay!
Laura: Through my Bow of Blazing Bowstring.
Matt: Okay, so as you pull back your arrow, you pull it up, you can see the thorns (thoosh) actually grow rather rapidly out of the wood itself and as you pull back, the bowstring itself ignites setting the bow, the shaft of the arrow on fire as well as you release, rolling?
Laura: 22.
Matt: 22 to hit?
Laura: Yes.
Matt: That hits.
Laura: Yes!
Ashley: Yeah.
Laura: So then I roll my regular damage plus 3d10?
Matt: Correct, plus the fire damage which is 1d10.
Laura: Okay, whoa. So 14 for the first.
Matt: Okay and then roll technically 4d10 because it's the fire.
Laura: 4d10, this is crazy.
Matt: Yeah!
Laura: Four, 11, 19. 21.
Matt: So 21 plus 14?
Laura: Yes.
Matt: 35 points of damage. Nice. So you release (soosh).
Laura: Oh plus Hunter's Mark damage!
Matt: Yep, there you go. That's why you did it.
Laura: Six.
Matt: Nice, 41 points of damage in the first attack from the ranger.
Marisha: (cheers)
Matt: All righty, so you release the arrow as the creature (woosh) shifts into place, it lashes out with all its tentacles and as it pulls back, looks like it's ready to pounce you release the arrow right towards its torso, it hits, and it looks down instinctually and it bursts into a spray of thorns all over its face and its torso and you can see it (monster screech) reels back from the pain, you can see the flames licking up over the front of its body. You can see there's a semblance of clothing on it. Whatever this thing once was, it's still wearing the clothing it had and a portion of it has burned off part of the torso. Whoever this poor soul once was, there is no shred of humanity left in it.
Orion: Before that ends I go, hop off.
Laura: Hop off? No way. I'm not stepping on this bone shit.
Liam: There's undead things in there
Laura: That's my turn.
Matt: And that's your turn, and you're holding a kitten.
Laura: Oh he's tucked into my armor.
Matt: Oh, he's tucked into you? Okay. That brings us to Tiberius, you're up. Tiberius, what are you doing.
Liam: Tibber-hoods.
Matt: What you got?
Orion: Okay, everyone hold on tight.
Sam: You're giving us opposite notes.
Matt: What you got?
Orion: How wide was the stone tablet? Ten feet for all of us to fit on?
Matt: It's about 15 feet round.
Orion: Perfect, I move us right above the butthole and, everybody hold on. And I fucking slam all of us right on him. (boosh)
Matt: Okay. So the platform comes cascading down at a fair speed immediately breaking over this creature, as it is a pretty thin wall to have only been about 100 pounds. It completely shatters over the top of it. Everyone who was on that platform, go ahead and make a dexterity check.
Ashley: Get it, guys. Come on.
Laura: I get two because it's favored terrain, right?
Matt: Correct.
Laura: Yes, okay good.
Matt: All right so.
Liam: 17.
Laura: 23.
Matt: Oh, Pike's not there.
Taliesin: 24.
Ashley: I'm not happening for a while.
Orion: Me too?
Matt: Yes.
Orion: 12.
Matt: 12. All right. So all the rest of you manage to leap off and tumble the best you can to catch yourself-- except for Tiberius.
Orion: Wait, do I make a dexterity check? I mean I'm not-- okay.
Matt: You do. You're still on the platform. It just shattered around you. So you however fall prone on the ground from the impact and land on the ground. That's also going to end your turn.
Marisha: Did it do any damage?
Orion: Can I not do any bonus actions?
Matt: Unfortunately not, due to the failed dexterity save. It practically knocked the wind out of you due to the impact.
Orion: Okay.
Matt: That was the unfortunate part of missing that dexterity check.
Orion: Okay.
Matt: However, it does deal from the crushing damage to the entity that'll be I'll say 3d10 points of damage. I'll see if it makes its save to reduce to half. Which it does. Rolled a 21. What's your DC in your spell?
Orion: 17.
Matt: So it makes its save, so it's half damage. Roll 3d10 and it's half that.
Orion: (counting noises) What is that, 19.
Matt: Okay, so it takes a total of nine points of damage. Crushing damage from the blow of the stone on top of it. Nice. As it (crssh) shrugs off bits of chunks of stone that are around its body, you can see a little bit of blood is being pulled to the seams of its body. It's taken some hits. It's still doing all right but it's definitely-- you can see it's not impervious by any means. That brings us to Vax.
Liam: All right, well, I use my bonus action to click my Boots of Haste together.
Matt: Your Boot of Haste.
Liam: Boot of Haste? But aren't magic items resistant to--
Matt: Oh yeah I was messing around.
Liam: Okay, yeah. Start sneak attack from behind. 32 for the first attack.
Matt: You unfortunately do not get sneak attack on this. It knows where you are. You do not get the round before it-- nobody else is adjacent to it because everyone else had to jump off the platform.
Liam: So no one's right next to it? I'm the closest one?
Matt: Currently no. You are the closest one to it because everyone had to jump off as it fell, and the fact that as soon as you rush towards it, its head (cracking noise) clicked over its back and looked straight at you, almost the neck bending in the process.
Liam: You block me every chance you get with this one. So that was the first attack...
Matt: No, this creature is really quick and very aware of its surroundings.
Liam: So first attack is nine. There's more coming. Here comes the poison dagger, which is 23.
Matt: 23. That does hit.
Liam: That is ten. Because of the Boots of Haste, I get a third attack.
Matt: You do.
Liam: And that misses entirely. In fact, I think I threw my dagger into the bones.
Matt: What did you roll a one?
Liam: A one, yeah.
Matt: Okay, so the first strike hits. The second one, you feel the poison energy pulse through the blade. What's the DC on that again?
Liam: It's 15.
Matt: That hits. You feel the poison (crssh) enter its side, and it looks down-- oh, it is immune to poison. Sorry. Oh, abyssal abominations! So the second blade goes in. The third one, you go ahead and swing towards it, and it (splssh) actually slaps the blade out of your hand and sticks to the ceiling. (whoosh) Thankfully, it returns back to your belt because magical belts are cool. All right, cool. That ends your turn. Kima's turn. Kima, who just managed to land, grabs her sword and reaches over. You can see the divine energy instilled within her blade. She is going to make two attacks against the creature. She rushes towards it on that side there. It's going to be yeah, 17. That'll hit. That's 27 to hit, and then a natural 20. So a hit and a critical. She's going to go ahead and get 15 damage from the first strike. Second one is going to be...
Marisha: We need to get off this floor real bad.
Sam: Well you're not on it.
Marisha: I'm not.
Sam: You can make a dance floor next to them.
Matt: All right, as she strikes it both times with the sword, you can see the first strike hits and the second one, she swings around and she instills with her Divine Smite, which does an additional eight points of divine damage. The second strike, as it slashes across, you can see the torso splits open. As the torso opens up, you can see a part of its guts spill out, and they begin to slowly pull themselves back in.
Marisha: Hell no.
Sam: She's Wolverine!
Matt: (laughs) Scanlan you're up.
Sam: Okay. Do I have a clean line of sight on her? Or are we too far away?
Matt: You guys are up in the air being held by her. Probably actually I'd say...
Marisha: I'm doing the eagle glide.
Matt: You guys are about 30 feet up right now.
Laura: Oh man.
Sam: All right, so I think I'm in range. I'm just going to blind the bitch. So I cast Blindness on her.
Matt: Okay, what's the range on that?
Laura: It's a girl?
Ashley: It's a her?
Sam: Isn't it a girl?
Matt: No it's a male elf.
Sam: Yeah, well I'm so demeaning to it, I call it a girl.
Ashley: Why is that demeaning?
Laura: Why is that demeaning?
Sam: Because it is a chauvinist. I know that.
Matt: What's the range on that, Scanlan?
Sam: I'm looking.
Ashley: Disadvantage on his roll!
Liam: You're in the wrong group to being saying that shit, man. (all laugh)
Sam: I'm drunk!
Marisha: Whatever. (laughs)
Sam: How far am I? I can't even tell. I can't see the board.
Matt: You're about 70 feet.
Sam: I can't do it.
Matt: You can hold your turn if you want to wait for Keyleth to go.
Sam: I can hold my turn? I've never done this before.
Matt: Yeah. Meaning if you're waiting for someone else to take their turn first, you can hold back until they do theirs. So you can wait for her to pull you closer.
Sam: Okay. I will wait for that, then, and I love women.
Ashley: Oh, we know. We know.
Sam: Biblically.
Marisha: Keyleth does a little dip really quick.
Matt: All right, gotcha.
Marisha: Makes Scanlan a little nervous.
Matt: All right. Clarota takes his turn. Clarota is going to... the situation's too dangerous to do anything Lightning Bolt related. Clarota instead is going to use Mind Blast against the creature. No that's no good either, at this positioning-- yeah no, because he'll get a bunch of you guys, too.
Sam: God, Clarota.
Marisha: Clarota!
Matt: Instead Clarota is going to...
Laura: Can he heal us?
Matt: No. Clarota's not really the healing kind. Clarota is going to cast Blur on himself to try and keep it from taking one of these points of wound damage. So he uses his turn to cast Blur. Clarota's form begins to shift and vibrate in and out of place where it's hard to see exactly where Clarota is standing. Clarota is going to take two steps back, unfortunately in the threat range of the creature. It gets (whoosh) a reaction to attack against Clarota. Thanks to the Blur spell, though, it misses entirely. So the strike strikes and it passes through with no effect. Clarota moves behind one of the rocks here, actually this far, for cover. That ends Clarota's turn. Keyleth you're up.
Marisha: Okay. I caw-caw closer
Matt: Like over where?
Marisha: Yeah, there's good. Shit, can't cast any spells unless I land. I'm going to have to drop down. Can I perch on one of these stalactites?
Matt: You can, but you're going to have to let go of the gnomes to do so.
Ashley: Do it.
Marisha: Can I drop off you guys?
Ashley: Yep.
Matt: You hear (bird noises).
Sam: What?
Marisha: And I drop them off really quick.
Ashley: What did she say?
Matt: All right, so both of you guys make acrobatics checks. Disadvantage for you because of your armor.
Ashley: But don't I get a plus ten?
Matt: Not for acrobatics, you don't.
Liam: Right. You're a bullet falling from the sky.
Sam: 16.
Matt: Okay.
Ashley: Eight.
Matt: All right. As both of you guys get released as you go to perch on these rocks.
Marisha: I'm going to turn back into Keyleth holding onto the rock.
Matt: Okay. So we'll put you there. Keyleth, no longer an eagle. This is out of the way. You guys both land here and here.
Marisha: But I'm still on the rock. I still want to be on the rock.
Matt: I'm considering you on the rock, but I don't want to have to try and balance you right there. Scanlan, you land, catch yourself on the bones, and you're fine. Pike, you sink into your waist at the impact.
Ashley: Because my armor's so heavy? (laughs)
Matt: Speed and the way your inability to catch your weight and use it. You just go (schoomp). Just stick directly into the bone up to your waist.
Liam: You're gnomic lawn art.
Ashley: Aw, dang it!
Matt: Percy you're up!
Marisha: Wait, I'm not done!
Matt: Right. Sorry, you turn back. So Keyleth, what are you doing?
Marisha: The laser pointer's dead. Now I'm going to make a wall of stone. Wait, is there someone in the way? Is there somebody behind him? Is that Vax?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: Damn it, Vax!
Sam: He didn't ask to be dropped there.
Laura: That's where we landed.
Marisha: Shitballs. All right. I'm going to do Grasping Vine, then. No, I should make us a dance floor. I'm going to make us a dance floor, then. I'm going to do a wall of stone. How concentrated can I do my wall of stone, actually? Can I do a wall of stone to where it's doughnut-shaped? Where there's a hole in the middle? And now I make a wall going across the top?
Taliesin: A doughnut of stone.
Matt: I would say, based on the description of it here...
Marisha: A horizontal wall?
Matt: Ten foot by ten foot panels.
Sam: Panels. Squares.
Matt: Alternatively, you can create ten foot by 20 foot panels that are only three inches thick. So yes, you can, you can create any shape you desire, so you can make it a doughnut hole type thing if you want to.
Marisha: Dope. So, I'm going to make a doughnut-shaped dance floor, and I'm going to make a hole in the middle to where he's still in the middle in the bone, but we're all on rock. Around this area.
Matt: So, it's just around all of you guys or underneath everybody?
Marisha: Underneath us.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: I'm making a dance floor.
Sam: That was an excellent move by a strong, independent woman who doesn't need a man to tell her what to do. Or to validate her in any way.
Marisha: I want everybody--
Matt: You might not be able to get Pike.
Marisha: I can't get Pike?
Matt: No, because there would be a weird loop there.
Ashley: I can maybe try to Sprinter's Boots my way up.
Marisha: Well, as much as I can do, but I want to make a nice hole to where he's still--
Matt: I would say you can either get Pike or you can get these guys here. That's about where you're going to call it.
Ashley: No worries. Do some damage!
Matt: What are you going to do?
Marisha: I'm going to boost up Pike. She's halfway underground.
Matt: The wall comes out and it stops there. That's as far as you can get it. This whole area now is a wall. It pops you out of the stone as the stone lifts you up. You have to catch yourself for a second, but it's not so abrupt to the point where you get knocked off the side. You're all lifted up about ten feet. So just mark that area as stone wall. Got it.
Marisha: Except for douchebag.
Matt: Except for douchebag.
Sam: Now that I'm within range, may I go?
Matt: After Percy, and then it's your turn. You all get to hold at the same time, so. Percy.
Taliesin: Does he get an attack of opportunity if I run?
Matt: You don't know.
Taliesin: How close am I? I can't see.
Matt: It took one reaction against Clarota.
Liam: You're further than five feet away, because had you been five feet away I could have sneak attacked.
Taliesin: Oh. Well, all right. The first thing I'm going to do is shoot twice in the face of this asshole.
Matt: Okay. Go for it.
Marisha: Shoot twice into the face of the asshole, Percy.
Taliesin: 14?
Matt: 14 does not hit, unfortunately.
Taliesin: But 28 will.
Matt: 28 will. So the first shot, you shoot, the body just goes (sound of air splitting speed) and totally unnatural sense sees where the aim is and is already out of the way before the bullet gets there. Returns, but you catch it up with the second shot from the Pepperbox, and blast in the side of its chest. Go ahead and roll damage.
Taliesin: Oh my god. This is awful. Six.
Matt: Six points of damage. All righty.
Taliesin: That's just embarrassing.
Laura: That's something, that's something, Percy!
Ashley: Hey, you know what? We're getting close!
Laura: That's better than a one.
Marisha: Pike is just an inspirational poster today. Like, it's okay, we can do it!
Taliesin: Thanks, mom. All right. Thanks, mom. I'm going to try to make a run for it to the stalactite by your hand.
Matt: Right here?
Taliesin: If I could even climb up on it, that would be very cool.
Matt: That's going to, with your run speed, you're going to have to do that next turn.
Taliesin: Okay, that's fine.
Matt: You don't have enough action to do that, but you get to it. Scanlan, you're up!
Sam: I'm going to blind him. With Blindness in his eyes.
Taliesin: Try blinding him with science, that usually works.
Matt: Are you using your hand cone?
Sam: I am using my hand cone.
Matt: I assume you do, for the most part. So what's your DC with that?
Sam: 19.
Matt: Good. All right, fails its roll.
Orion: Yes!
Ashley: Yes!
Matt: As you release the arcane essence, you can see this darkness spill up and completely cascade over the white, almost soulless, freaking out eyes of this creature. It's very Silent Hill in the way it moves. Suddenly, its eyes (shhh noise) fill over with darkness, and you can see it beginning to writhe and move around like it's unable to truly grasp the full surroundings. It appears to have taken effect.
Orion: Nice!
Sam: And then I give a little inspiration to Pike. I look over to her, give her a little wink, little smile...
Liam: Spirit her on with anger. Good job.
Matt: Take your 1d8 inspiration.
Ashley: 1d8? Okay.
Sam: That's all it takes.
Marisha: That's all it takes. (laughs)
Matt: All right. That ends your turn, Scanlan?
Sam: I think so.
Matt: You're going to stay right there?
Sam: Where am I?
Matt: You're on top of the wall, right here.
Sam: Yeah, I'm staying on that wall, yeah. I don't want to go anywhere, yeah.
Matt: Okay. Pike, you're up.
Ashley: Okay. So, from where I'm at--
Matt: Yes, on top of this wall here.
Ashley: I'm on top of a wall? I'm going to Guiding Bolt the whatever-it-is. (all laugh)
Sam: The whatever it is.
Ashley: And then-- okay, wait, hold on. Let me cast that at-- So what do I roll for?
Matt: You roll and add your spell attack modifier to it, I believe it is, to hit for Guiding Bolt.
Ashley: So I roll the d20 to see if I hit?
Matt: I'm pretty sure, yeah. It should be in the description.
Ashley: Okay.
Laura: That's good, that's good!
Ashley: 15.
Laura: Plus anything?
Ashley: Oh, plus-- wait, what am I plussing? I'm so sorry!
Matt: Your spell attack.
Laura: It's on your spell page.
Matt: It's on your spell page, top of your spell page.
Ashley: Okay.
Matt: You haven't used it in a while. Yeah.
Ashley: 23.
Matt: 23 does hit!
Ashley: Yes!
Ashley: Okay, so then we do--
Matt: 4d6 points of radiant damage to it.
Sam: It's also blind.
Matt: Yes.
Ashley: 15? And I'm going to add my inspiration from him.
Matt: You can't add that to damage. It's only to hit.
Sam: Save it for later.
Ashley: So, 19.
Matt: 19. So, as you look down, you grab your holy symbol, and even though it is cracked, you still feel the presence of Sarenrae looking down upon you. The divine energy coalesces in your hand, and you throw it forward with a divine wrath as it streaks across the air. It slams into the side of this weird twisting abomination, and as it blasts into it you can see its tentacles reel back and pull back in severe pain and it roars this horrible, screeching (bleeegrh screech) scream into the cavern around you, echoing down the hall. It's looking a little rough.
Ashley: Okay. And then there's nothing I can do from there, right?
Matt: That's your action. You can move if you'd like. Move along the wall, or hop off it, or whatever you want to do.
Sam: Come closer to me!
Ashley: I'll stay! (all laugh)
Matt: All right.
Marisha: Because she's an independent woman.
Sam: That's a proud choice, and I honor and respect it. I love women!
Matt: So currently, because it's--
Marisha: Pike's not the only one cashing karma points.
Matt: So technically, I should have remembered this, but you hit anyway: while it's blinded, attacks against it have advantage.
Laura: Oh, okay.
Matt: And its attacks have disadvantage. So, as a note. Top of the round, now, the monstrosity goes ahead and gets its round. It's going to go ahead and lash outward. Thinks people are around it, seeing the wall go up, it's going to swing out towards you. All right, that is a 16 versus armor class. Nice! So, as it swings out towards you on the wall, you duck out of the way just in time. A second tendril (whoosh, swish) reaches out and is going ahead and head forward... let's see. This one's probably going to make its way either between your foot or Scanlan on the wall. I'm going to roll to see who it goes for. Goes for Tiberius. That is 16 versus armor class again.
Orion: No. 17.
Matt: 17? Nice! Let's see...
Laura: On the ground, you look up like...
Orion: No! My big toe! Bah!
Matt: Third strike is going to whip around and attempt to grab... roll between both... Okay, it's going to go for Lady Kima. And that's a natural 20.
Laura: Oh.
Taliesin: She's a magnet.
Marisha: Even with disadvantage?
Matt: Well, actually, no, technically it would've still been a 15, so it's not a critical, but it still hits.
Marisha: That's good.
Matt: Unfortunately, without her full armor, her AC is not that crazy. So it's not a critical. That's nice. That brings it to a total of 18 points of damage with an additional six acid damage to Lady Kima.
Laura: Oh. Acid. None of us have gotten hit yet.
Matt: And the tentacle (whoosh) wraps around her and grapples her in place, and she's currently held in place by its tentacle. She stays where she is. It is now going to attempt to leap away. It brings all of its tentacles to the ground and (whoosh) leaps up into the air.
Liam: Attacking before it goes.
Matt: You get one attack of opportunity against it.
Liam: 27.
Matt: 27 does hit.
Orion: I swing at it with my cane as I'm on the floor.
Matt: No.
Sam: Do I get an attack?
Liam: 11.
Matt: 11 points of damage? All right. It takes 11, and it leaps away, (whoosh) taking her with it, and here, it's actually going to land about there, and you can see as it leaps away and lands, the wounds you guys have left on it are slowly healing.
Marisha: Son of a bitch!
Matt: Vex, you're up.
Laura: All right. I don't want to hit Lady Kima with any of my attacks, so I'm just going to have to do... I'm going to do the Blazing Bowstring again.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: And I'm going to attack it twice.
Matt: All right. Go for it. Roll for strikes.
Laura: Ooh! That was a 30!
Matt: You have advantage on these strikes, by the way. Well, actually, let me see, because I think it gets a save each turn to try to get rid of your blindness, which it does not make.
Orion: Nice. Is he blind?
Matt: Okay. So still blinded.
Laura: 29.
Matt: Hits. Definitely.
Laura: And 23.
Matt: Both hit. Go ahead and roll damage on both attacks. First one with the extra d10 for Blazing Bowstring. This arrow: once again, you pull out, burst into flame (whoosh). The heat is a bit strong for your face, but you release it forward; it actually impacts into your damage. Streaks across with an arc of fire, and slamming into its side, dealing?
Laura: 14 points of damage on the first one.
Matt: All right. Second one?
Laura: (laughs) What did I do on that? That was weird. 14 on the second one as well.
Matt: Nice! All right.
Ashley: And can I cast War God's Blessing on her and give her a plus ten? For an attack roll?
Matt: She's already attacked, but to other people, you can. And you can do it after they roll. If somebody rolls and you're like, that's a really bad roll, you can be like, plus ten! and it might give them enough to push them over the edge. It's not for damage.
Ashley: It's not for damage. It's for--
Matt: Attacking, to make sure you hit them.
Ashley: I understand. Okay, great.
Laura: But with Hunter's Mark-- she's still Hunter's Marked!
Matt: Correct. Oh, did you not roll that damage?
Laura: Four.
Matt: All right. Extra four damage from the Hunter's Mark. Tiberius.
Orion: Yes.
Matt: So, do you get up? You're currently lying on the top of the wall.
Orion: I look around, and I don't like what I see, and I try to get up.
Matt: Okay. You (grunts) stand back up. You're currently at the top of the wall; it's ten feet up.
Orion: Really? Okay, where's he again? All I see is mountains. Oh, I see, you put the yellow ring around him? And Kima's to the right of him?
Laura: Kima's being held by him.
Orion: Oh, okay. Great. I look at him, see what's going on. I (ping) my Ioun Stone, and I conjure out Telekinesis from it, and I guide it towards the monster's tentacle to unwrap it off Kima, and I attempt to pull it off her.
Matt: Go ahead and make an arcana check.
Liam: That's Telekinesis, Kyle! (all laugh)
Orion: Sweet! 20.
Matt: 20? All right. As you focus your Telekinesis, the tentacle begins to shake and is pulled off her body. Kima wrenches herself free. She is not currently grappled.
Orion: Can I also go like, (bash) Stop hitting yourself! (all laugh)
Matt: The tentacle starts slapping around its body, and it looks confused. It's not enough to do any damage, but it looks unsure as to why it's having a hard time controlling its own limbs.
Orion: I give a nod to Kima.
Matt: (laughs) Well done.
Orion: That's my turn.
Matt: All right, cool. Vax, you're up.
Liam: I'm still hasted, so I'm going to use a bonus action to go stealth.
Matt: All right. It can't see you, by the way.
Liam: What?
Matt: It's blinded.
Liam: Oh, it's blinded? But do I still need that to sneak attack, though? Or does it matter? Never mind. I'm running at it, and since Kima's right there, I'm going to stab the bejesus out of it.
Matt: Go for it!
Liam: I'm going to use Luck on that roll.
Matt: Okay. Well, you have advantage, remember, because it's blinded.
Liam: Okay, great. So that is a 29.
Matt: 29 hits.
Liam: Okay. (incoherent mumbling)
Liam: Which part gets doubled? I always forget.
Matt: It's the dice.
Liam: So 19 goes to 38, and then the damage gets added to that, right?
Matt: Correct.
Liam: With the sneak attack, and the damage gets doubled--
Matt: Correct, and then the bonus at the end gets added on to that.
Liam: The bonus at the end. Okay, all right. So what that is is 47.
Matt: 47 points of damage. Oof. So as you rush past, you (swoosh) slam the blade into the side. You see where part of it seems to start and open, but it's starting to close up again. You reopen that seam and drag across, leaving a giant wound across its side.
Liam: Okay, and then with that knife in, I'm going to stick the other knife in and attempt to attack it and then drag it to the ground. Grapple it to the ground with my body as I attack. Second attack is a 25.
Matt: 25 hits.
Liam: Okay. That's seven.
Matt: Are you doing damage, or you grappling him?
Liam: I'll grapple.
Matt: Okay, so there's no damage on this. Go ahead and make an athletics check.
Liam: Okay. 20. Natural 20. (all cheer)
Matt: Nice! So you grab it, and you pull it. You have it currently held. Its physical body is pulled to the ground, and you can see its arms are trying to pull it up off the ground, and (slurpy noises) flipping around. Complete chaos in the air. You imagine you'll probably have a hard time holding it down, but for now it's currently blinded and grappled.
Liam: With haste, I have a third attack.
Matt: You do.
Liam: I'm going to drag across its throat. That is a 25.
Matt: That hits.
Liam: And that's seven.
Matt: You don't get the bonus-- oh, for the extra attack you do, because it's with your main arm. So, seven damage? All right. Cool. You bring the blade across, and you can see the blood begin to pour out from it, and as it does, you can see the throat opens up, and where you cut on the throat you can see what looks like white gleaming teeth on the inside of its throat. The entire interior of its trachea is coated with teeth.
All: (noises of disgust)
Sam: It has a maw?
Matt: Kima's turn. Kima sees you holding it down. Takes the sword, swings it, and is going to come on down, spending a level-three spell as a Divine Smite against it. That hits with a 22. This advantage is kicking its ass. Second attack.
Laura: Nice Blind, Scanlan.
Matt: Oof. Yeah. Both hit. All right. 36 points of damage, and a divine strike. And 12 points on the second blow. As she comes down and slams it with the big sword twice, the first one arcing down with divine energy, streaking across the barely-lit cavernous area. It hits the ground, and it splatters blood across. You can see one of its tentacles is barely hanging on by just a section of muscle and sinew. However, she looks down real fast, and you can see now these skeletal hands are reaching up and grabbing her legs and starting to pull her down. She's going to attempt to try--
Orion: Kima?
Matt: Kima.
Laura: Kima.
Laura: Oh, I wonder if that's going to happen to all of us.
Matt: She's unable to break from that. She's now being pulled down into the ground beneath her. That brings us to Clarota's turn. Clarota is going to move--
Marisha: Who all is on the dance floor?
Matt: Ugh, can't do this.
Laura: All of us except for Percy, I think.
Matt: Clarota's going to stand here and pull back and begin to coalesce this bluish crackling energy in Clarota's hand. The tentacles of Clarota's face begin to swirl and pull back into this horrible grimace as it releases this bolt of lighting energy that arcs past, just overhead of where Kima is, since Kima's been pulled down below. Lightning Bolt. Two ones in a row, are you fucking kidding me? I'm rolling terribly tonight, guys, by the way.
Liam: It's mostly in our favor.
Matt: Yeah. So that Lightning Bolt would do 15 points of damage. With disadvantage on its save. Still makes it, so (laughs) with a Lightning Bolt that does a grand total of seven points of damage--
Laura: It's better than one, Clarota! It's better than one!
Matt: Clarota looks away dejectedly. "It was the best I could do." All right. Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: All right. Seeing Lady Kima slowly getting taken under, I make eye contact with her.
Matt: All right.
Marisha: What?
Matt: No, continue.
Marisha: Okay. And I make a Grasping Vine from that stalactite over there.
Matt: Here?
Marisha: Yes. And I'm going to take it and wrap it around Lady Kima and try to yank her out.
Matt: Okay. All right. So as the vine pulls out of the side of this rock (whoosh), it reaches out and wraps itself around her body and begins to pull.
Marisha: Around her waist. Not her neck, again.
Matt: Right.
Marisha: Yeah. (all laugh)
Matt: Good distinction. All right.
Marisha: Just wanting that out there.
Matt: Yeah. It's a good thing. So, Grasping Vine... yeah, okay. So it pulls 20 feet; she gets pulled 20 feet. I'll go ahead and say, make a wisdom check.
Marisha: I'm trying not to hurt her.
Matt: Right, I understand. This is more your strength of will versus the strength of whatever--
Marisha: Just adding my wisdom?
Matt: Yep.
Marisha: 20. Total.
Matt: 20. So, as the vine wraps around her and begins to pull, she reaches over and grabs the vine for extra strength, and (fwoomp) it pulls her out of the wall. She goes flying over and lands at the side of the stone with a vine that's still loosely wrapped around her, but it's definitely pulled her free of the floor.
Marisha: Can I leave it to where it's holding her up, to where it's not touching?
Matt: Sure! Yeah. She's currently held aloft by this vine that strapped her. She's looking confused. Thankful, but also wants to be let go.
Marisha: Can I take a bonus action to shout at her? Be like, "Calm down Kima! Jeez!"
Matt: Sure. Is that the end of your turn?
Marisha: Yes!
Matt: Okay! As you finish casting the spell and shouting at her, you look down and notice the ground. (swish, shoosh) Begins pulling you down
Marisha: No, I'm still on the stalactites. I haven't moved off the stalactite! I'm straddling it.
Ashley: A little straddle action!
Marisha: I'm riding that stalactite
Matt: Go ahead.
Marisha: Riding it side-saddle.
Matt: It's really hard to be on top of that and cast spells and talk about this. (chuckling) It's a giant piece. I'm going to say, go ahead and make an athletics check.
Marisha: All right. Ooh! 24.
Matt: Okay! You manage to precariously stay on the top of this stalactite, holding on to it, casting spells and shouting out. All right.
Marisha: Jeez, Kima! Stop! This is hard already!
Matt: Percy!
Taliesin: I'm going to crawl and find myself a seat on top of that stalactite. That's my first thing I'm going to do.
Matt: Okay, well, at the start of your turn, make a dexterity check.
Taliesin: 20!
Matt: All right. You manage to pull out. Now make an athletics check to try and make your way up to the top of this rock.
Taliesin: Athletics or acrobatics?
Matt: This would be athletics, just to pull yourself up on the side.
Marisha: Rock climbing check.
Taliesin: 13.
Matt: 13. Okay! You can decide whether or not you want to attempt to ascend this or make any attacks this turn, because right now it's going to take your full round to get to the top of this. It's a very thin, jagged, almost vertical wall you're trying to climb up and hold onto.
Taliesin: How far away am I from the stones? From the platform?
Matt: From the platform here?
Taliesin: From something I can stand on that's not sand.
Matt: You're probably about 35 feet.
Taliesin: So I could make it in a run?
Matt: You could make it in a run, yeah.
Taliesin: All right. I mean, in a standard movement action?
Matt: No. You'd almost make it.
Orion: What's your movement?
Taliesin: My movement is 30. Just almost make it?
Matt: Yeah. Right now, this wall's blocking you from even seeing the creature. As far as you know, you see a giant wall and you hear fighting on the other side of it.
Taliesin: I'll make it to the top of the stalactite, then.
Matt: Okay, so. (grunts) You get up to the top. I'll put this here as a reminder. But that's where you are right now. Okay, that ends your turn. Scanlan!
Sam: Is there anywhere I can stay on the dance floor and get a line of sight with the creature?
Matt: I'll say you'll be able to get right up next to Tiberius, right here, and be able to get line of sight.
Sam: And can I throw lightning and not hit Tiberius?
Matt: No.
Sam: (nervous laugh) Okay, then. Then I don't do that. Instead, I will-- I've got nothing to do! Let's say I will try to-- is she-- it's a he.
Matt: It's a he.
Taliesin: It's a he! God!
Sam: I have no ranged attacks. Except I can Viciously Mock it, so that's what I'll do. I'll say, you know what? Your tentacles make you look kind of fat, and the elf thing is played out. It's sort of 1990s. Orlando Bloom. And the whole bone thing is just really tacky!
Orion: I look at Scanlan curiously. (laughs)
Matt: Tiberius looks over. You look over your shoulder at at Scanlan with a curious look. Rolled a four. So essentially, being blind, all it can rely on right now is audio sensation around it. And it picks up ringing through the air. What hint and shred of humanity is within its psyche understands the Common you speak in its direction. And for a moment, it seems to sag all its tentacles. Go ahead and roll damage for your Vicious Mockery.
Sam: Three! Yes! It's the only ranged attack I have. (all laugh)
Matt: I was just seeing if there's another effect of Vicious Mockery.
Orion: He's sad for a while. (laughs)
Matt: Is there anything else it does?
Ashley: He's dead!
Marisha: Yeah, he just dies!
Orion: Negative two to self-esteem.
Matt: Vicious Mockery-- has disadvantage on-- okay! So it has disadvantage on disadvantage on its next attack. Got it!
Taliesin: Does that mean it has triple?
Matt: Nah. If it did, that would be awesome. Pike, you're up!
Sam: Oh! And as my bonus action, I'm going to inspire somebody. I don't know. Who? I look over at Liam and I do-- sorry, Vax. And I do one of these. (all laugh)
Matt: All right. You are strangely inspired by that.
Liam: I giggle-snort.
Matt: Okay. That brings us to Pike. You're up.
Ashley: Okay, so where are we at? I'm so sorry. I can't see.
Matt: You're right there, on top of the wall, on the far back end. You can't even see the entity. It's way off to the side and a bunch of people are in a row on top of a wall that Keyleth created.
Ashley: Okay, so I'm going to use my Sprinter's Boots and get over. Everybody's healed; everybody hasn't really taken too many hit points?
Matt: You've guys rolled really well and it has rolled terribly.
Ashley: So I'm going to go around here. Oh, I don't know, can I have--
Matt: It's a very thin wall. Make an acrobatics check to try and move and tumble through the people. With disadvantage because you're in heavy plate armor.
Sam: But you've got inspiration.
Matt: You do.
Liam: You can add that to your roll. So add inspiration.
Matt: Roll twice. You're at disadvantage.
Laura: 13.
Ashley: What, plus eight?
Sam: You can roll a d8.
Liam: It's advantage, so pick the higher.
Matt: No, disadvantage, because she's in heavy armor.
Liam: Oh oh oh.
Ashley: 16.
Matt: 16? You just manage to barely squeeze through people without falling off of the top of the wall, finding yourself right there.
Ashley: Okay. So then, since I'm there, I'm going to cast Guiding Bolt again.
Matt: Okay.
Ashley: And then I'm going to cast it at 4th level again. And then, which is--
Matt: Roll to attack twice. You have to roll to hit it first. Roll twice, because it is blinded and has disadvantage. You have advantage on it, I mean.
Ashley: 18.
Laura: Plus your spell thing?
Matt: 18 plus your spell.
Ashley: Oh, which would be 26.
Matt: That does hits. Go ahead and roll damage. You are at 4th level, that is 7d6 damage.
Orion: Nice! Holy crap.
Sam: Pike, perhaps you should spare it for your god, or offer it in sacrifice to your god?
Ashley: Sorry, guys.
Taliesin: That's a lot of math.
Sam: You know what? Women are good at math.
Orion: They are.
Taliesin: They are.
Sam: Probably better than men.
Orion: I would say probably.
Ashley: And then do I add anything?
Matt: No, that's just the 7d6.
Ashley: 26.
Matt: 26 damage, nice!
Sam: Good adding.
Ashley: Hey, thanks!
Matt: As you pull through the rest of the crowd, you stand next to someone, you grab your holy symbol again. This time, looking up to your hand. This divine energy materializes and shines down in a god ray onto your hand as you gather it with your fingers, it seems to formulate this actual thick rock feeling sensation. You swing it underhand softball pitch with absolute furious anger that slams into the side of the creature, bursting with the divine energy, doing a very sincerely impressive amount of damage for a small Guiding Bolt. It's currently still trying to get back up after Vax has been holding it to the ground. You can see it blast its side. You are almost pulled over on top of it by the sheer force of the impact.
Ashley: Sorry, Vax!
Matt: That brings us to the top of it now.
Sam: It's still alive?
Ashley: It's still alive?!
Liam: It's got that healing factor.
Sam: Can we undo its healing factor?
Matt: After all the impact, all the sounds it's hearing, it moves over to this vicinity.
Liam: Ain't he grappled?
Matt: Oh, you're holding it here.
Liam: I'm holding it.
Matt: It's going to attempt to break from your grapple.
Liam: Good luck.
Matt: So you make an acrobatics check.
Liam: Do I get advantage on this?
Matt: For this check, you do, I believe.
Liam: Okay, good. 27.
Matt: 27? 29. It slips out of your grasp, moves over to this vicinity here. And you can see now, the tendrils open up, even though its eyes can't see. You can see what looks like a bunch of gills across its body, slits in its torso and it almost looks like all of them open up into these tiny little mouths. You can also see teeth rippling through them and expels this cloud of green gas that (fssh) around everyone within ten feet of it. Everyone on the wall, right here. Clarota-- you are just out of range of it-- and Kima are affected. So that would be Pike, Vex, Trinket, technically. Clarota. So I need you guys to make a constitution saving throw.
Marisha: What?
Sam: (garbled) Make a constitution saving throw.
Matt: Pike? Whenever she comes back.
Sam: Who has to do this? Pike, Clarota?
Matt: Pike, Clarota, Trinket, Vex.
Laura: Should I roll for Pike?
Matt: Wait until she gets back. What did you roll?
Laura: 19. Oh, 19 and then for Trinket-- oh no.
Matt: Clarota does not make it. Kima does not make it.
Sam: I can roll for Pike.
Matt: All right, go for it.
Laura: No!
Sam: I've got this, guys. We're connected in a special gnome way that you have no idea how pure this bond is.
Liam: Here comes the one.
Sam: 16, plus whatever.
Laura: Oh, plus her-- wait, I'm looking up her constitution. Plus one. 17.
Matt: All right. Trinket rolled a...?
Laura: Seven.
Sam: (singing) And that's the power of love!
Laura: But I rolled a 19.
Matt: Right, as this cloud of greenish gas bursts out from all these strange slits in its body, you feel this acidic fume fill your lungs and touch your skin. You manage to duck out of the way and resist a lot of the damage, as does Pike, pulling up her cloak in front of the way. You guys take 14 points of acid damage. However, Clarota and Kima and Trinket all take 28 points of acid damage.
Laura: (gasps) 28 points?!
Matt: Yes.
Sam: For Trinket?
Matt: Yep.
Sam: Is Trinket still a cat?
Matt: Trinket's kitten form is taken away as the Polymorph wears off--
Laura: Oh, shit. Boom!
Matt: (boosh) This bear bursts out from your chest.
Sam: Oh, no, your shirt is ripped.
Laura: All of a sudden, my bosom comes flying out.
Matt: So Trinket's at full health again. Hold on, the kitten form, I'm going to say, would have about five hit points, so taking five from 28... Trinket has taken 23 points of damage.
Sam: Pike, you just took 14.
Matt: 14 points of acid poison damage, as this entity vented its torso into this giant fume of acidic gas.
Sam: It would have been much more if Scanlan hadn't been around, that's all I'm saying.
Ashley: Oh, wow. Okay.
Matt: At which Trinket bursts out of Vex's torso, landing into the bones below. (growls)
Laura: No, in the bones?
Matt: Yeah, because on the wall (fwoosh) out in front of you.
Taliesin: Now we know how many hit points it takes to kill a kitten. That will actually be useful. Five. Five hit points.
Laura: Five hit points. That's good.
Taliesin: Five hit points, everyone.
Matt: All right. It's going to finish its turn. That brings us to Vex.
Laura: That's me!
Matt: Yep.
Laura: Is there anything-- what's nearby? Is anything within five feet of it?
Matt: Oh, actually, I should see if it-- it does resist. It is no longer blinded.
Sam: Oh, snap.
Matt: You can see the darkness fades from its eyes and the whiteness bursts from its face. It's intent now, as each eye individually darts around and takes reference of all the points of possible attack that are now before it.
Marisha: Wait, its blindness wore off? Oh, poop.
Laura: Is anything within five feet of it?
Matt: Trinket is.
Laura: Trinket's going to be affected. Oh! I command Trinket to move, then. Can he?
Matt: Okay. Trinket can, yeah, if you want.
Laura: Can he try to climb up and get away from it? Oh, no. He'll take a hit, won't he.
Matt: He will.
Laura: Do it.
Liam: If it hits. It could miss.
Laura: Oh god, but he's so low on health.
Ashley: Where's he at?
Laura: He's right next to it! Get up, Trinket, get up on the wall. And I'm going to cast Hail of Thorns on the thing.
Matt: What's the radius on Hail of Thorns?
Laura: Five feet.
Matt: Five feet. Okay. Trinket is going to attempt to get up the wall. Make an athletics check for Trinket, (laughs) who's going to try and climb a ten-foot solid stone wall, which is--
Taliesin: Bears can climb trees.
Matt: Trees, yes. Solid, smooth stone walls? Little more of... but--
Laura: What is it, is it an acrobatics?
Matt: It's going to be athletics for Trinket.
Laura: Athletics. I don't know what to add, but it's 19 plus whatever. Strength?
Matt: 19 plus strength.
Laura: 23.
Matt: Okay, Trinket scrambles up the side of the wall. As it does, one of the white eyes is looking around like an iguana (tchh) focuses on Trinket, (whoosh) goes to whip toward Trinket. That is going to be a 24 versus his armor class.
Laura: Oh, it hits!
Matt: Trinket takes 17 points of damage.
Laura: Oh no!
Matt: Plus an additional five points of acid damage.
Laura: Trinket's unconscious!
Matt: As Trinket climbs up the wall, (shh, groan) and then streaks and falls back down onto the bone, unconscious.
Sam: Bear down!
Ashley: We'll heal him!
Laura: Oh, no! He's lying in the skeletons.
Matt: So you're now there up top. What are you going to do? You watched Trinket fall and hit the ground.
Ashley: Kill him!
Sam: Not Trinket.
Laura: Do I get to-- can I move if I attack, or is that it?
Matt: You gave Trinket your move on this turn, so you can still attack from where you are.
Ashley: Attack him!
Laura: Will somebody save Trinket?
Marisha: I'll save Trinket.
Laura: Okay, then I still attack him. But wait, will I do damage to Trinket, then, still on the ground, unconscious?
Matt: What are you doing?
Laura: Well, I was going to do Hail of Thorns, but I shouldn't because he's within five feet?
Matt: Within five feet.
Liam: You could do a regular arrow.
Laura: All right, I do a regular flaming arrow.
Matt: You've used your flaming arrow twice.
Laura: No, I only used it once.
Matt: No, you used it at the top of the round, too.
Laura: Shitballs. Okay, then I'm-- I have regular arrows. I'm going to use Bloodseeking Bow, then.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Oh god. I'm freaking out.
Matt: Make your bloodseeking strike, now, with the fury and anger and frustration--
Laura: 26.
Matt: Hits.
Laura: Okay.
Ashley: Roll for damage.
Laura: 11, plus Hunter's Mark. 15. And then the Bloodseeking Bow does ten bleeding damage each round.
Matt: Nice. Okay, when we get back to its turn, it'll have ten bleeding damage on it. You have your second attack, too.
Laura: Okay. 24.
Matt: 24 hits.
Laura: That's 12. 13.
Matt: Okay. So both arrows (zoomf zoomf) sink down. You can see your jaw's tense and you can feel the tear running down your face, but you are intent on taking this son of a bitch down. That brings us to Tiberius. Actually, at the end of your turn, go ahead and make a death saving throw. For Trinket.
Laura: Oh god.
Sam: Death saving throw?!
Liam: Three successes or three fails. That's first fail.
Ashley: Wait, what? No. I can add a plus ten, right?
Matt: To a death saving throw?
Laura: Not so much.
Matt: It has to be attacks for you, unfortunately. So that's one death saving throw on Trinket. Tiberius, what are you doing?
Sam: This is a grizzly situation!
Orion: Okay. I assess the situation, and I don't like it.
Sam: The end.
Orion: No. I cast Watery Sphere on him, and try to capture the guy in my sphere. That is-- oh, plus this! (gasps) Oh my god, I always forget it's that number. It's 27.
Matt: 27? All right.
Orion: 18 plus nine?
Matt: I'm just trying to get familiar with this one real fast, guys.
Marisha: So he uses his spell attack bonus, I'm assuming?
Matt: Watery Sphere, you said?
Orion: Yeah. I was looking that up, too.
Matt: Watery Sphere. Got it here. Okay. Over the edge, and ten feet-- okay, it's not an attack roll for you. It has to make a strength saving throw. Saving throw. That is a 21. What's the DC for your spell?
Orion: 17.
Matt: Okay. So yeah. The sphere appears. The creature is ejected from the side right there. So the sphere is still there, but the creature is un-grabbed by it.
Orion: Does it do damage?
Matt: As far as I know, it just grabs.
Orion: Ugh. All right. That's my bad, I shouldn't have--
Matt: It restrains and grabs things inside when it has them. It works more as control than as a damaging spell, but the sphere is still there.
Orion: Well, fine. I can still move it, yes?
Laura: Can you pick Trinket up and bring him up on the wall?
Orion: She's got this. I'll move it over just to make him all soak-y in it anyway. It's not going to-- I can't move him. It doesn't control him, right?
Matt: No, not if he makes the save. If he fails the save, then yes, you have them trapped in the sphere, but currently basically (sploosh) pushed his way out of it.
Orion: Well, fine. I don't do that. I spend-- I don't do anything, actually. That's my turn.
Matt: Okay. Vax, you're up.
Liam: Okay, so Clarota's right by it, so I'm going to roll along the back of the thing and sneak attack right into its back.
Matt: Right here?
Liam: Right there. Yeah, roll around next to him, one dagger in. That is a 29.
Matt: 29. Yeah, that hits. Damn.
Liam: (counts quietly) Okay, that is 33, plus sneak attack damage, so three, seven. Shit. 18, 20. That's 40 plus four. 44.
Matt: Rogues, man.
Liam: 51. I want to carve his shoulder blade out and away like a piece of turkey--
Matt: It's not a critical.
Liam: No. Critical's the double. Oh, sorry, scale that back to--
Matt: That's a lot for a non-critical. Holy shit. (laughs)
Liam: 20. It was 20 plus two, 22. 29.
Matt: 29 points of damage. Still nice. So as you reach back and you angrily take the dagger and drag it down, you actually find one of those seams of its arm, and you drag it across the front as the arm actually (floop) falls off on the ground and it squirms on its own.
Ashley: What's taking this thing so long?
Matt: You've managed to pull one of its tentacles off.
Liam: Next dagger's out. That was a bad roll, but I'm going to use one of my Lucks to do that again. That hits. That's 27.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: So that is seven points of damage.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Last dagger out. That's 26, for eight points of damage.
Matt: Nice. Eight points of damage, got it. Great!
Ashley: How is this thing not dead?!
Matt: Kima is going to rush around here.
Marisha: Don't be stupid, Kima!
Sam: What is it with you and Kima?
Marisha: She's been stupid, all right?
Laura: What are you talking about? She's a paladin!
Sam: She's fighting with us! Don't dispirit her while we're fighting!
Liam: This is really awkward for the rest of us, just so you know. We really like her.
Matt: Kima's going to attack twice with her greatsword.
Marisha: I don't like her.
Sam: I don't like her either, but I'm not openly hostile to her.
Matt: Kima goes to strike twice, but with each blade strike, the head glimpses over, sees the attack and the body bends out of the way of the first strike. The second one, a tentacle actually slaps the blade out of her hand and she has to reach over and pick it up again off the side of the ground. The blind was very effective these past couple of rounds, but now it's back to its full strength and can see, and you can see now that it can see where everyone is, it's going to be much harder to hit. Unless you're this guy and this girl. That brings us to Clarota. Clarota can't use what Clarota wants to do, unfortunately. Instead, is going to--
Ashley: What does Clarota want to do?
Taliesin: Dance.
Ashley: Dance!
Laura: Dance!
Matt: You've had it used on you before. It's called a Mind Blast that the mind flayers did before in a cone attack that can stun things in front of it. But everyone's been clustered around it, so Clarota can't quite get a place that doesn't affect somebody else. So instead he's going to do a tentacle attack against it. That is-- oh, wow! That's a 26. That hits! Takes 15 points of damage and is grappled by Clarota. Clarota currently has his tentacles wrapped up onto it and is trying to pull it down with a combination of psionic energy and its tentacle grab. Keyleth, you're up!
Marisha: Seeing that Clarota just grappled him, I'm like, "All right, cool. That's good." And I'm going to use a Grasping Vine from the other stalactite and grab Trinket and see if I can--
Laura: Around his waist!
Marisha: Okay. Around his waist.
Matt: All right. You use another 4th-level Grasping Vine?
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: Okay. So the Grasping Vine-- from this one here?
Marisha: Nope, that one.
Matt: Okay. The wall is here, so it's going to have to curl around the side, wrap around the body. As it begins to pull, you can see the bones have already begun to reach up and begun to start pulling Trinket's body down. Go ahead and make the check for that again which is...
Marisha: What is it?
Taliesin: Will.
Marisha: Oh, will?
Matt: For this one I think it was to try and-- wait a sec, I'm just making sure. I think it was wisdom for the-- Let me check it real fast, just to make sure. This is starting to get down to the heavy. "Creature must make dexterity saving throw to resist pull." Yeah, so go ahead and make a willpower check. Wisdom check, sorry.
Marisha: 20 again.
Matt: The vine wraps around Trinket and begins to pull. The bones hold tight and the body is not moving from its position.
Laura: No!
Matt: It's a standoff between the vine holding the unconscious body of Trinket, who you can see is still moving and shifting in unconsciousness. The bones are beginning to rise up almost like this slow tide to begin to wrap over the body. All right, that brings us to Percy.
Ashley: Wait, so we don't know?
Matt: It's at a standoff right now.
Marisha: It's a standoff. It's tug-of-war.
Matt: Yeah. Not sinking, but not being pulled out, either. It's this stalemate right now between the two. The vine is taut and holding Trinket level.
Taliesin: Okay, I'm going to spend my movement to get nice and firm, sit myself down, pull out the big gun.
Matt: Okay. Bad News. You see it over this wall now. The top of this stalagmite-- it's about 50 feet to the top. You get to the top, you pull the Bad News out. You have a pretty clear shot down towards the entity.
Taliesin: Taking a sharpshooter shot. Natural 20 on the first shot. (all cheer)
Matt: Go ahead and roll damage for this one.
Taliesin: This is going to be so much fun. (counts out loud) 42 points of damage.
Matt: How do you want to do this? (all cheer)
Taliesin: I take a bead and I want to wait until the eye is looking right at me, and I want to take it right through the eye.
Matt: Okay. So as the entity turns around, its head cocked to the side, its tendrils (sucking noise) flailing around it, one lifting it up. You can see, it begins to reach up to bring a lash down upon the bear that is being clasped on the ground, its eye streaks around and catches yours. You release, pull back on the trigger... (gunshot) The impact blows you off the top of the stalagmite. You fall in the air, but in that split second, you keep your vision on as you're floating back and this whole-- this moment as time slows, not wanting to lose this moment, you see the bullet (ssst) into the head. One of the eyes now goes dark from the crimson impact. The jaw opens slack (groaning), with all the teeth exposing as the back of the head (explosion).
Taliesin: (maniacal laughter)
Matt: Explodes. All across Vax. Who was standing behind it, just (vrushh)
Liam: I love it! (all laugh)
Matt: The giant hole now, which is like you can see portions of its lower jaw are still visible, but the entire top of its head is gone. You can see parts of its flesh trying to reach up and re-form, and then starting falling limp as its form begins to quiver and eventually fall apart. The seams all begin to unravel and its entire body begins to fall apart into chunks. Eventually what's left is this elven torso that slinks to its knees (boof), takes a step,takes another step, and then falls onto its back, completely destroyed. The bones begin to reach up and take its body. Trinket is still currently being held aloft.
Orion: I see what's going on. I cast Telekinesis (fssh) and start pulling it up.
Matt: Okay, make an arcana check. You have advantage on this because the Grasping Vine is also helping.
Orion: Oh my god. Arcana? 12.
Matt: 12? You (strains) you're pulling, you're pulling, you're pulling, but unfortunately whatever cursed force holds this land is keeping the body--
Ashley: Okay, I run up and take the Mace of Disruption, which also has the holy oil on it, which fights against undead! So I take it and I go (ffff) right underneath.
Matt: All right. Pike, you're on top of the wall. You look down and see this happening with the effort of both of them unable to do so. You leap off the top of the wall, swinging the Mace of Disruption down in a giant arc. You slam it into the bones on the side of Trinket's body. As you do, you see the actual stone and bones around it cave in and shatter into dust at the sheer force of your Mace of Disruption, leaving this big old cavernous space where there once was ground. As you bring it up again, you begin swinging it around the outside of Trinket, releasing all of the bone in the vicinity. As you do, you also notice that the bone at your feet that's beginning to grab onto your legs as you landed begins to give away and slowly back away from you.
Marisha: Grab onto the vine!
Liam: It's scared of her.
Ashley: It's scared of me. Yeah, that's right!
Laura: Get Trinket out, and I'll pull Pike up.
Marisha: Okay, I pull the bear out.
Matt: Between the two of you guys, you manage to, now that it's been released from the bone, as Tiberius (strains) lifts up and the vine grasping, you lift Trinket up onto the wall, and Tiberius you (thud) release Trinket on the top of the wall.
Laura: I'm healing! Giving a healing potion.
Marisha: Can I take my Grasping Vine and I want to reach out and grab the elven man real quick.
Matt: You reach out the Grasping Vine and you lift up the remnants of the elven man.
Marisha: Yeah?
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: And I want to throw his remnants back onto our dance floor.
Matt: Okay. Well, the dance floor-- the wall here? So you chuck the corpse up onto the stone wall. All right, so you've all gathered around, you administer a potion. Trinket heals-- which potion are you using?
Laura: The minimum, because someone else can heal him, right?
Ashley: Yeah.
Matt: Yeah, yeah. That'll be 2d4 + 2.
Laura: Seven. He's only got seven little health points!
Matt: All right, so Trinket comes to consciousness. (bear moan)
Laura: Trinket!
Matt: As soon as it opens up and the first thing Trinket sees is your face, Trinket begins to lick the side of your face.
Laura: Oh! (sobs) Buddy! I'm crying and I'm petting him and I say, "It's okay."
Matt: Kima, Clarota, and Vax. You guys are still on the ground. You can feel the stones and bones beginning to pull up against your feet. Clarota immediately begins to lift off the ground using his Levitation ability, and pulls free of the bones, lifts there for a second. Yes?
Ashley: Can I keep propellering my Mace of Disruption as I walk? On the ground?
Matt: You can. As you're walking along, you're just (kssh) hitting bits of bone. As you are, they just disintegrate and turn into dust. It's leaving a track. A little bit of a groove in the ground as you do so.
Ashley: Follow me! Follow the track!
Marisha: I'm going to loot this corpse real quick. See if I see anything with this.
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Marisha: With this corpse. Does anyone want to help me? Who's got better investigation?
Taliesin: Sure.
Sam: Sure.
Laura: I've got it, but I'm busy with Trinket.
Marisha: Ugh, yeah.
Taliesin: Yeah, never mind.
Sam: I've got it. 24.
Matt: 24? All right.
Marisha: Scanlan!
Matt: You start looking at it, and the clothes that are on it are soiled and destroyed and are just ruined by whatever process it went through. as you inspect the shoulders where the tentacles are, you start seeing these strange little fleshy nubs, and as you pull away at where the wounds were taken from pulling off, you can see there are arms inside the torso that were pushed inside to attach this entity.
Ashley: Can we--
Matt: Can you what?
Ashley: Go ahead. Sorry.
Matt: You can see a couple of fingers poking out of each side.
Ashley: Should we take the body?
Sam: Do we see any ligatures? Is there sewing? Or has it been stitched together?
Matt: The tentacles were stitched to it, and you can't see any actual stitches, like it's this weird thing where it's actually bonded to it, but it looks like some sort of strange--
Orion: I'll do an arcana check on that, and I already got 22.
Matt: Okay. There is a magical essence from somewhere in the torso, but you can't quite ascertain--
Marisha: From somewhere in the torso?
Matt: Yes.
Laura: Do we recognize this elf at all?
Matt: (laughs) You don't recognize any of its face because it's gone. Bad News disintegrated its head. Unless you want to piece all the pieces that are currently on Vax together and try to reform the face, but from what you can tell it wasn't anything you could recognize necessarily.
Sam: I'll take out my dagger and dig into his torso.
Matt: As you (squishy flesh sounds) begin to pull out bits, the rest of you guys manage to make your way up to the top of this stone wall now. You're all for the most part safe, for the time being.
Taliesin: Thank you for that.
Matt: Sorry. You cut through the body. You start seeing there are just layers and layers of teeth growing out of all portions in the interior of it. You find the fingers are attached to a hand, which are attached to a wrist. You pull a little bit, and with this horrible sickening (fssht) sound you manage to pull an arm out from inside the torso, covered in its own blood and fluids.
Orion: Prestidigitation! Clean that up.
Matt: You clean it off. The magical essence you were seeing earlier actually is coming from a set of metallic bracers that are on the wrists.
Sam: Take them! I take them.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Don't put them on, though. Don't put them on.
Orion: I'll inspect them.
Liam: They're cursed.
Matt: Okay. Make an arcana check.
Orion: Let's see. 13.
Matt: 13? It takes you a while, but you manage to get an idea of what the essence of the magic is.
Marisha: I think it's for you, Vex.
Laura: Oh, really? Let me see it.
Orion: Translated, it's Bracers of Archery. You should check it out.
Ashley: Can I cast Cure Wounds on Trinket? And I cast him to 20. Second level. I rolled.
Matt: You rolled a 20 total?
Ashley: Yeah. 20 total.
Matt: Okay. So Trinket heals 20 more hit points.
Laura: Oh, yay! Really?
Matt: So keep tabs on that because that will carry over into the next session. All right. So you guys are now standing aloft, on the wall. You can barely see past, about another 120, 150 feet ahead of you, the sea of bone chips and glass seems to eventually fade into more stone.
Marisha: Let's get out of here.
Sam: Hey, will you lead the way, Pike, with your crazy mace path?
Liam: Air guitar us out of here?
Ashley: Can I keep on? (guitar noises)
Orion: Actually, wait a minute. Hold on a sec. My water sphere is still there, isn't it? I'm going to take it and push it along our way as well, in front of her who's swinging it as well.
Matt: Okay.
Orion: Push it up to 30 feet.
Matt: So you're pushing this behind her?
Orion: In front of her. Just a nice little (pssht) like 30 feet from where we are.
Matt: Okay. So the sphere crests ahead as you guys push forward. Pike, you're taking your mace of disruption with your shield up and you're slamming it before you. As it does there's just plumes of dust that are being cast in the air behind you guys. You cough a little bit as it's lifting the small spray of dust. You begin to make your way across this open field of bone and glass to the other side, finding for the first time in a little bit of time solid stone ground. You all take a moment and gather your breath, and as you're taking a moment, you look over and you can see in the darkness ahead of you what looks to be a faint source of light around another large pillar or cluster of stone in the distance.
Ashley: Is it a color?
Laura: Do I see any tracks around?
Matt: It's reddish-orange and appears to have a flicker to it.
Laura: Do I see tracks? Can I sense goliath tracks?
Matt: Go ahead and roll a survival check.
Sam: How far away is it from us?
Matt: It's probably about 70, 80 feet.
Laura: 25.
Matt: 25? You see more duergar feet patterns, and you see those same singular tracks.
Liam: And you said it's flickering, the light?
Matt: Yes.
Liam: Probably a campfire.
Sam: Let's go kick some ass.
Marisha: Want to go see?
Liam: I'll go take a look.
Matt: Roll stealth.
Marisha: Take a short rest there.
Sam: Do we need it? Is anyone hurt?
Marisha: Just a short one.
Liam: 25.
Matt: 25?
Liam: Everyone rest while I go peek, because I'm fine.
Sam: We don't need rest for spells, we just need rest for health, right?
Marisha: Just a short rest, yeah, so I can recharge my animal changes.
Ashley: If we take a short rest, do we get any spells back?
Matt: No spells back, unfortunately. You guys stay back while you go ahead and stealth your way up. Did you roll disadvantage on that one?
Liam: Disadvantage?
Sam: Your foot.
Laura: Because of your foot!
Liam: But the cloak then cancels it out.
Matt: That's right, yes, so you're fine. It's a natural roll.
Liam: So 25.
Matt: 25, okay. So you make your way through the darkness, around the side of the stone platform and as you crest your vision, you can see the flickering is indeed a small campfire. Not used for light, but apparently used for cooking as the scent also hits you. There is some sort of meat currently being cooked on this flame.
Liam: Does it smell good?
Matt: It smells pretty good. You're not quite sure what the source of the meat is. You worry for a second because you see the two duergar that are sitting there, currently holding the meat in the center of this, are staying next to a giant troll who has his hand on the side of a rickety wooden cart. On this cart, which you can see, there are two sets of wheels on each side, there is a large lumbering goliath individual currently held down with bands of iron. Your mind for second thinks, "Oh god, are they eating him?" but you see he appears to be intact, though with a quick glance as you peer around the other side of the stone column, you can see his body is riddled with scratches and small wounds and incisions, and you can see where streaks of dried blood are across his entire body.
Laura: They're going to try to make him into one of the stitch monsters!
Marisha: Yes, they are.
Laura: We're not there.
Matt: You also do see, across the way there are three tents set up around this area. One of the tents opens up and you see a duergar female step out: silver circlet across her forehead, long robes. Queen Ulara walks up and starts talking to the other duergar, pointing to your goliath friend, to Grog, on the front of this. Motions to the other two and steps back into the tent, closing it behind her as the two other duergar grin. One reaches into his pouch and begins to pull out small, looks like metal hooked utensils, possibly to go in for another round of whatever they'd been doing.
Ashley: I'm going to kill that bitch!
Liam: Into my earring, (whispers) Come, now.
Orion: Ooh! Vax just said we should go!
Laura: (whispers) We should go!
Matt: And this is where we're going to end today's session. (all groan)
Sam: Wow. That was exciting, and I feel empowering to a lot of the female-- (all laugh)
Orion: Female viewers, absolutely.
Sam: Pike did a lot of important things.
Orion: Absolutely, I would agree.
Zac: Hola, everybody!
All: Hola!
Zac: (sighs) That was intense again! You guys are giving me anxiety attacks, you guys and Felicia being in the chat room the whole time. So I wanted to shout out some thank yous.

Zac: Yeah. SilentKagosha. "Critical Role  adding a cave-effect to the audio when you are in the cave adds an interesting atmosphere to the show."
Matt: Awesome! Thank you!
Zac: That's what they did. He kept saying that in the chatroom and I was like, "I wish I could do that for you but I can't do anything about that." Too much work! BrrCold donated. "For Zac Eubank and all that he does." Aw, thanks, Curt! Appreciate that.
Ashley: Thanks Curt!
Zac: G1BigDaddyHef. "Working retail can be draining and I want to thank you so much for inspiring me and brightening my day. Currently working on creating a new campaign to try and get my coworkers involved in. I'm happy to lend some money to help out the 826LA charity."

Tune in tomorrow. We have Felicia Day stopping by to play Lady Games, so everyone will be dressed up in suits.
Sam: I'll be watching that! It's my favorite.
Orion: Absolutely. He watches it all the time.
Zac: We're playing Ladies and Gentlemen, and there might be some gender reversal going on in that, and we're also going to be doing a new card game that was just Kickstarted with Indicade, and we have musical guest Echo Sparks coming by, as well as So You Don't Have To with Hector and Becca. We will be doing some things to them that are not very polite, and making them play pony games because we have a lot of pony Steam keys to give away.
Marisha: Interesting.
Ashley: Ponies!
Marisha: Everyone, Matt and I recently did another Hot Pepper Gaming video. Another Hot Pepper Game review, so, go check it out on Youtube at HotPepperGaming. They're super fun.
Laura: They completely keep their composure.
Matt: Oh, totally.
Taliesin: They don't break.
Marisha: Chat room should start pressuring these guys to all do one.
Taliesin: What? No.
Orion: I've already put my request into Hot Pepper--
Laura: I want to do it!
Marisha: He's done one before.
Orion: I've done one before. I think I had the grossest HotPepperGaming.
Laura: Just snot running out of my face. I want to do it!
Liam: I do not.
Zac: They want me to show you while we're live, Ashley, the emote that they made for you.
Laura: I saw it! It's so cute!
Ashley: You guys made me an emote!
Marisha: They made an emote for Ashley?
Zac: Start post. She's watching the chat room guys, so just start...
Marisha: What is it? Wait, I want to see it! Pull up the chat room!
Laura: Is she an astronaut? That's what it looked like.
Liam: Is it a pony suit, is it Spider Gwen? What's she wearing?
Zac: It's an astronaut.
Laura: It's an astronaut, Ashley!
Ashley: Oh! Come on guys! That's awesome!
Marisha: Astronaut Ashley!
Ashley: Oh, what the heck!
Taliesin: There it is. Oh my god! That's so cute.
Marisha: (laughs) Wait, there it is! Oh my god, that's amazing!
Taliesin: They're like little Buzz Lightyears!
Matt: That's fantastic! Well done, guys.
Zac: Thank you guys for tuning in.
Matt: Thank you guys so much. Have a wonderful night. We'll see you next week!
All: Bye!

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Welcome to Critical Role! Tonight, we return from last week's rather tense cliffhanger of a game. Really excited to get that underway. But for those who this is your first time watching, this is a show where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors play Dungeons and Dragons. We roll dice, and it's fun. So yeah, we're excited to have you. Let's take it off with some announcements at the top of the show for everyone. First and foremost, we have under an hour until the sale for the temporary special edition #IsItThursdayYet shirts are no longer available. We're pushing in the mid-900s, and see if we can hit a thousand before the hour is up, guys. So if you haven't got one and you're interested, we'll have information in the chat for it. That's our hashtag Is It Thursday Yet shirts soon will be gone forever. So grab one if you want. Also, this marks the anniversary of Team Hoomanism. You guys have been amazing since the beginning of the whole community, through Felicia and starting the whole stream thing. It's been amazing to watch this whole community come together, and part of that celebration for today is go out there and tweet hashtag-- What's the hashtag on this one, Luke?
Lucas: Hoomanism.
Matt: Look at that. #Hoomanism. That's pretty easy to remember if you're not me. Write a story about a good deed you did this week. Something that you felt really good about, that you brought a little more joy and positivity to the world around you, or saw somebody else do. Just go ahead and tweet with that hashtag, and at some point during tonight's show we're going to be giving away one of our Critical Role shirts that I'm modeling for you, strangely, accidentally for this, but I figure now you know what it looks like on a relatively unfit male.
Taliesin: Bear not included.
Matt: Bear not included, for now. So go ahead and guys, take a look at that, go ahead and put some positive vibes out there in the twittersphere about what you've experienced this year or done this week, and see if you can get yourself a shirt. I think it will be a lot of fun. Also, wanted to remind everyone that we will be at New York Comic Con, which will be October 10th and 11th. We'll be doing some cool events on Saturday as Critical Role, doing some signings, and we're trying to see what logistics we can do to have an opportunity to see some of you guys who weren't able to get passes. We'll have more information coming up soon, hopefully. Because we'd love to be able to see you guys who couldn't make it in the actual convention. We'll figure something out. So keep your eye on the Internet as things progress. Also, let's see. Liam, if you want to go ahead?
Liam: Yeah I just wanted to, I talked about this last week. I'll probably talk about it next week, but I wanted to encourage you guys if you haven't already to go over to Joe Madureira's Kickstarter for their Battle Chasers game, Battle Chasers: Nightwar. Joe's a friend of mine; he's a comic book legend, and is also a game developer and artist, and I'm just a big fan, and so they're a friend of the show, a lot of us here are in love with Joe-- physically, not his art, just him himself. He's a handsome man.
Laura: He's got a hashtag thing going. Right. Now. So #BattleChasers, too, that's an awesome thing.
Liam: And they, they, hit their goal almost immediately. They're just now making the game that is going to be shinier because they're climbing higher. But just go take a look, his art style is unmatched, and the game is based, is an RPG based in the JRPGs of our youth, and it's going to be great. Go take a look.
Matt: Yeah. Thank you, Liam. Also, while our esteemed Ashley Johnson has been away for some time, and our cleric has been missing, she's been doing cool stuff in New York, filming for the new show Blindspot. Which just aired earlier this week. So for those of you who want to catch our awesome gnome cleric on the fancy big screen you can go ahead and check out Blindspot, that airs Monday nights on--
Laura: NBC. At I think ten our time?
Matt: Probably. I should know this by how much they've been promoting it everywhere. You can't avoid the posters, so I should know. So yeah, check that out. We're hoping that maybe she manages to scoot some Critical Role references or memorabilia onto the screen sometime. Fingers crossed. Also, we're going to have at the intermission today a really cool video that is a presentation of when we visited and delivered the esteemed check donation to 826LA that you guys made possible. We'll have that shown at the break today. It will give you a really clear idea of the charity 826LA, what it looks like, the people that are there, and a lot of the kids that are involved, and what you've helped continue to promote and help grow. So look forward to that at the break. It's going to be good. Does anyone have anything else they want to announce?
Orion: I have two quick announcements. Hello, everyone. Greetings and salutations. My first announcement is that I will be sitting on Zac's face this whole game. I have found the pillow.
Marisha: I'm sitting on his unicorn stomach.
Taliesin: I've got the feet.
Laura: Oh, is that what you've got?
Matt: I couldn't tell if he was blushing before or after you revealed you were sitting on his face. It's hard to tell.
Orion: I think it's after.
Matt: Yeah, probably. He's pretty cute.
Orion: I know this is because I farted already. And everybody check out my Twitch channel with my name.
Matt: There you go. All righty. We're waiting on our esteemed gnome bard to arrive, due to traffic, and when he does, we have a little present for him, which we will reveal when he arrives. But in the meantime, let's go ahead and kick things off for tonight's episode of Critical Role.
Taliesin: I'm not ready! [dramatic music]
Matt: And welcome back. (laughter)
Matt: Oh, it is a well-oiled machine, Critical Role.
Taliesin: We all trade seats and then come back really quickly.
Matt: It's pretty good. We started doing burpees in between. No, I mean, we just burp.
Laura: Basically, just burp a lot.
Liam: Hey, the gnome is at the door. Can someone let the gnome in?
Matt: Bring in the gnome!
Travis: Do you desire a gnome, sire?
Matt: I would like the gnome brought before me.
Travis: Bring the king a gnome! Make sure he is of foul mouth and many a song.
Liam: Oh, fetching the gnome!
Travis: I assure you, sire, this gnome has many songs, a very tiny instrument, and--
Taliesin: I feel so dirty sitting on this pillow. So comfy.
Orion: I like it.
Laura: Does somebody have an extra pencil?
Taliesin: Yeah.
Laura: All I have is this broken one from Grog.
Travis: In solidarity.
Matt: I appreciate that you brought it back.
Travis: Nothing's changed.
Matt: No, it's a reminder. Yay! (cheering)
Travis: Sam, buddy! You made it.
Sam: Oh my gosh. Okay, I'd like to plug a few things. No.
Matt: However, we do have a present for you. Because there have been periods of time in which you've complained about not having a proper stein or mug to match the rest of the group, we figure--
Sam: I've got a Google one.
Matt: Google one works fine. But thanks to some of our wondrous, illustrious campmates we were with at Burning Man, they gifted this unto us to gift unto you, as we felt it was fitting and size-appropriate.
Sam: Oh, yes! Yes, it makes me look cute! (laughter)
Liam: You have to measure that out in a regular cup first, and then pour it in.
Travis: You could pour two whole drinks in there, and it would be half an inch of liquid.
Sam: Wow, this thing's amazing!
Marisha: So thanks, post-nuclear family.
Matt: Well done.
Travis: (laughter) That is amazing.
Sam: It's a hotel ice thing.
Marisha: Yeah, it's technically an ice bucket.
Sam: I want to fill it up right now.
Laura: It's hiding your face.
Matt: All righty, so to get caught up on what has transpired: the party, after traveling abroad in the distant city of Vasselheim and the surrounding lands, eventually returned to Emon, their central hub city where they had their Greyskull Keep constructed, to relax and take in a brief moment of respite before learning that the Briarwoods, two individuals responsible for much darkness and sadness in the history of Percy, were coming to court in a week to feast and talk with Sovereign Uriel Tal'Dorei. What are you doing?
Travis: Lock it up! Jeez.
Sam: I poured a whole glass in there and it looks like nothing!
Matt: You got to keep pouring. Upon hearing of the Briarwoods' arrival within a week to discuss political matters and enjoy a feast, of course the members of Vox Machina, who are part of the council in Tal'Dorei were invited. Within that week, they made their various preparations, made the various beard checks, made the various beard shavings. It happened! And made their way to the central palace at the Cloudtop District of Emon. The Briarwoods arrived, a feast was put out. However, Percy went in under an illusion to look like Vax over here, while Vax went invisible. Everyone had formal attire on, weapons left at the door, unarmored, dressed for the occasion.
Sam: Is that true, no armor?
Matt: Yeah, you guys were all dressed in formal attire.
Travis: We don't even have any weapons.
Sam: Do I need to subtract things from--?
Travis: The recap makes it so much better. Just lay it out.
Matt: So your weapons are at the door. They're not on you at the moment.
Laura: They're at the door? We left them at the door?
Matt: Yeah, as part of the check-in process.
Liam: Question, mine are on me, right?
Matt: Yeah. Because you went invisible and you were under the approval of Seeker Asum.
Liam: You just increased my chances by 2%. Thank you.
Laura: And Percy, your weapons are still on you because you already had an illusion on you, right?
Matt: Correct. The List is on him, his Pepperbox. Bad News would be a bit difficult for you to bring in here.
Taliesin: Diplomacy would work out well, though.
Matt: Yeah, I think so. During the feast, conversations were had, questions were raised and information was extracted. Seeker Asum had requested to have been met in the foyer by our rogue here, who forgot and then decided to go on his own upstairs following the Briarwoods to the second floor where their guest room was set. He distracted one of the guards with his serpent belt, knocked out the other, entered the room and found himself face to face with the Briarwoods themselves.
Liam: That did not lead to further hallway, in fact that just led to a bedroom. It ended right there.
Matt: Yeah. It went right into their guest room. So after a brief discussion, a little bit of awkwardness, you attempted to leave, but were placed in a holding pattern by a Hold Person spell, and had the two Briarwoods come up to you, whisper in your ear that you had nothing to worry about, you look delicious.
Sam: Yeah, there's nothing to worry about.
Liam: They're kind of hot.
Laura: Right? I mean, they are hot, right? So at least there's that.
Travis: What are we doing while this is happening?
Matt: You guys are just now leaving the feast hall at this period of time.
Orion: Where are we entering to?
Matt: A large foyer area. There's the main foyer of the palace that splits off to two smaller meeting chambers and the chamber to the right is what leads to the Grand Hall. That's where you guys were feasting. So you're making your way into this--
Taliesin: Hasum?
Matt: Asum? Seeker Asum, yes.
Taliesin: Seeker Asum. Is he around? Do we see him anywhere?
Matt: No.
Sam: Tell me this, DM. When my Invisibility spell is broken, am I alerted? Do I know that? Do I sense it?
Matt: The spell itself would dissipate, as it is a concentration spell. It would be a, oh, spell's gone. However, before we get to you guys. We have more immediate business to attend to.
Liam: Let's play, Matt. Let's play.
Matt: Vax. Your muscles lock in place, sweat beginning to bead down the front of your forehead. The realization of the immediate danger you put yourself in washing over you. You can see across the way, in the dark candlelit area of the room by the canopy bed, is Lady Delilah Briarwood, hand still out, smiling at you. Immediately to your left shoulder is Lord Sylas Briarwood, who has leaned in. He's actually pulling you away from the door now. You're skidding across the ground (dragging sound) as he shifts you, your legs unable to actually move. As he pulls you forward, the Lord whispers in your ear, "You are a curious one, though not quite gifted with the silver tongue. Foolhardiness is not becoming of a guest of the Briarwoods." For a moment, there's this pause, this tension, the silence, and Delilah, Lady Briarwood, puts her hand out further and says, "Yet, my love, we are not here to make enemies, nor raise suspicion. We are merely protecting ourselves from intrusion. Isn't that right?" As she looks at you, and looks immediately to your right, where you can feel the general presence of Lord Briarwood. I need you to go ahead and make another wisdom saving throw.
Sam: First roll. Not an unimportant one.
Orion: Not at all.
Sam: First roll of the night. Could kill Liam.
Laura: No. That's good!
Liam: That's 18.
Travis: What was that? How much?
Liam: I'm frozen!
Laura: 18, he said.
Matt: You feel your muscles lax, and the sweat that is still brimming across your face you feel for the first time in these moments that seem to stretch on forever. You have control of your body, though you do feel the hand of Lord Briarwood right on your shoulder, who, as you become conscious of the fact that you are in control of your physical form, his voice comes very heavily, the bass kicking into your left ear. "Indeed. We do require allies. I would have you prove friendship." And as he takes and moves the shoulder away, you find your torso moving towards him. You lock eyes with him, and he has this knowing grin, his lids taut slightly with this condescending sense of knowing. I need you to go ahead and make another wisdom saving throw. This is technically a charm effect, and you being a half-elf, you do, I believe, get advantage on those.
Liam: That is a 21.
Matt: 21. You feel an extension of the sheer unnatural force of charisma that attempts to penetrate beyond the usual slippery mind that Vax holds to such a high esteem... However, you manage to resist it and feel it wash over you as the slight tingling vanishes and the effect has left you unaffected by whatever he was attempting to try.
Sam: Ooh. What was he trying? Who knows?
Matt: There's a brief moment as he looks you over.
Liam: What do you need?
Marisha: Yes. That's so smart.
Matt: "There now. Be a good boy." Looks over. I need you to make a deception check.
Liam: Deception check. Okay, I'm using Luck to go again.
Matt: Now you used a couple Luck points last time.
Liam: Yeah, I used one. I did a lot last game, but we were over multiple days. I used one this day. I'm about to use my second. (gagging noise) Okay, this is deception?
Matt: Deception, yes.
Liam: Ooh, that's not as great. That's a 15.
Matt: 15, okay. Gives you a look. "Very well. Apparently, the help was not very helpful." At which point, you hear this fast knock at the door, and you hear a voice go, "Are you all right? Is everyone all right?" Behind the door. At which point, Lady Briarwood just does this with her finger, and the door swings open (creak) on its own. The guard that ran after your belt is standing there holding the groggy, just slightly coming to second guard that you knocked out, and as he pulls him towards the door, he looks over and sees this, and he goes, drops him, and goes for his weapon, and Lord Briarwood puts his hand up, and goes, "Do not worry. We're just having a conversation. Close the door. And get him up." "Yes, not a worry sir." And he closes the door, and you hear the scuffling behind the wood of him, adjusting and waking up the guard who you had clobbered in the side of the head, getting him to consciousness. So they're both just looking you over. Lord Briarwood's just walking back and forth, keeping a very keen eye. He walks between you and the door. As you stand there. Almost like he's waiting for a reaction of some kind, for you to initiate something.
Liam: Thank you so much. Thank you so much! What can I do to help? I'm pretty meager a servant, but anything you need, whatever you need! Gosh, you guys are good-looking. (laughter)
Liam: It isn't that, is it?
Matt: You hear a throaty chuckle from Lady Briarwood across the way. (chuckles) "No, but what do you think, my love?" Lord Briarwood comes up from behind, his hands on the back of your shoulder, and says, "Like we said, you haven't the gift of the silver tongue. But I applaud your effort."
Liam: Well, my mom and dad said I'm a real good speaker. They paid for a tutor? To teach me how to talk. And it's worked out really well for me in my life. So if you need an ambassador, or a butler who talks? I could do that for you.
Matt: Lady Briarwood at this point steps a couple steps closer. She's still about 15 feet from you. He's right behind you. Right between you and the door. She steps forward and looks over at her husband again, and goes, "What do you think? Can we trust him?" And Lord Briarwood leans forward, and you can feel his chin peeking into your peripheral vision. "I'm afraid not. It seems--"
Liam: Well, here's the thing you need to know about Uriel. And I take a step back.
Matt: Into him?
Liam: No! Away.
Matt: He's between you and the door.
Liam: Well, does he hold me if I turn? Well, I just said that, right? Here's the thing about Uriel.
Matt: As you go to move away, his arms that are on your shoulder, tighten, flex, and hold you in place.
Liam: Oh, you don't want to know? Okay, I'll just save that for later.
Sam: Roll for coy.
Liam: Roll for what, Matt?
Matt: Since I don't know what you're going to say, I'm going to say persuasion for this. Because I don't know if it's a deception or not.
Travis: Is the power out of the DM's hands for a moment?
Liam: Oh, I'm going to use my last Luck of the day!
Travis: The last one?
Liam: Last Luck of the day.
Laura: Oh my god.
Liam: Okay, this is persuasion? That's 17.
Travis: That was a big die.
Liam: You could give me a-- never mind.
Matt: You want an inspiration?
Liam: Huh? No.
Matt: (laughs) What are you asking for? What are you begging from the DM?
Liam: Yeah, no, that's why I said never mind.
Travis: Is it begging or is it praying, at this point?
Matt: No, I'll give inspiration when you've goddamn earned it. As you say that looking at them with this coy look of information about Uriel, they both chuckle in unison. (chuckles) "Shall we?" And she gives a nod and goes, "I think we shall."
Liam: Can I roll for initiative?
Matt: We're now rolling for initiative.
Marisha: Fuck!
Travis: Does he have an earring?
Liam: Yes.
Matt: So. Here you are, right there. Lord Briarwood is behind you. Lady Briarwood is over here by the edge of the bed. These are the two windows, this is the layout of the room here. As far as you are aware, there are two guards outside the door, currently.
Liam: My initiative can only be described as fecal.
Matt: Oh no.
Laura: It wasn't a one.
Liam: Wasn't a one.
Matt: One adjacent, is what you're telling me.
Liam: Six, it was six. It comes close.
Orion: I thought you were out of there, man.
Matt: All right. So. For this, Delilah steps forward, and you can see there's a slight flash of bluish-purple arcane energy in her eyes and her fingers, coalesce around, as she does, she draws her fingers up and you feel this sudden cold pressure around your body. I need to pull out my spells. I don't know what I'm doing here.
Liam: Should I check my iPhone, too?
Laura: He's pulling up his spells.
Taliesin: He hasn't had time to memorize all the ways he's going to fuck with you. There are that many ways.
Matt: All right, so I need you to go ahead and make a constitution saving throw, Vax.
Liam: 19.
Matt: 19. All right. So as she does this you feel all the flesh on your torso and around the neck part of your body all of a sudden begin to dry and crack as if your life force itself is beginning to wither and be drawn out. It's the equivalent of a plant drying out and dying very fast, but it's your flesh instead. You go ahead and take--
Marisha: Sounds like Blight or something.
Matt: You take 21 points of necrotic damage, and she's going to go ahead and step this way. After that she backs up and grabs the edge of the post at the side of the bed and looks at you with this grin. At that point as you tense from the pain, Sylas immediately whips to one side and with an unarmed claw attack, a giant fist is going to hit you on the side of your torso. That is going to be a 21 to hit.
Liam: That hits.
Matt: All right. You take eight points of bludgeoning damage as his fist socks you on the inside of your chest area hitting the sternum, and you feel like a slight pain crack sound as it hits and impacts against the leather. As you pull forward, with unnatural speed (whoosh) the hands are back on your shoulder and you hear this little voice say, "Bon Appetit." That is going to be a 25 to hit. All right. Okay, you take six points of piercing damage as suddenly you feel two extremely sharp, warm prongs jut into the side of your neck, and that same cold sensation you felt across your torso all of a sudden begins to pull from the neck, and you feel as if the very warm blood around your throat begins to drain from it. You take an additional 12 points of necrotic damage, and your maximum hit points are currently reduced by 12.
Marisha: Oh ho! They're sucking the life out of you.
Matt: It's your turn.
Liam: He's holding me, right?
Matt: Actually, this will be part of his unarmed attack. No. He does not have you grappled, currently. He's over the shoulders.
Liam: Okay. As a bonus action I'm going to use rogue's cunning action to disengage, which means nobody can swipe at me if I run, okay.
Marisha: (whispering) Jenga!
Liam: There's a window. Last week, you said there was a window to the courtyard.
Matt: There are two windows on each side of the room there.
Liam: Okay. I'm running straight at the window, and as I run-- yeah, past them, and I don't go anywhere near her, and I'm using dash, and I'm leaping out the window and saying, jenga.
Travis: Jenga!
Matt: (window breaking) As you run past, you can see there's this moment where it's almost like they are letting it happen. There is no momentary aggression or frustration to this as you dart and (crashing) out the window falling from the second story. Go ahead and make an acrobatics check.
Liam: That is a 32.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Do I even stop running?
Matt: (chuckles) You hit the ground with a tumble, and you get up and you continue to move forward. So at this point you've pushed into the courtyard now. You can see the cobblestone road that surrounds the outskirts of the palace. There are a few bits of light and you can see there is the carriage they came in, horses still attached, and the younger man who led them inside who was driving the coach is napping on the front, who is now looking over, spooked, at the sound of shattering glass as it clatters onto the ground around you. And that ends your turn. Everyone else, you hear jenga whispered through those of you who have the earrings on.
Sam: He's in trouble! Let's go!
Marisha: What's going on?
Taliesin: Now we hear shattering glass, don't we?
Matt: Not from this part of the palace. You're too far away.
Laura: I start running towards the door to grab weapons. And I'm saying into my ear, where are you? What's going on?
Sam: I'm by the bartender saying, I ordered a large. Please, can I have a slightly larger one please? What? Oh! Oh shit!
Marisha: I'm going to go eagle, and I start scouting the halls looking for him.
Taliesin: I'm running with them towards the doors
Liam: I don't know. Am I able to talk further?
Matt: That's about as much as you got out this combat round because it was a very quick series. It took all your effort to even get out of that situation.
Travis: She and I are booking it for the door.
Matt: So you guys go forward. You run towards the front and the weapons are being held in this storage area off to the side that is used for storing weaponry and armor for people who arrive and shouldn't be wearing them in very social events. So you guys head that way. You're getting a big drink.
Marisha: I'm heading to wherever I saw the Briarwoods taking off whenever they were leaving.
Taliesin: Actually, did you turn into an eagle? Can you carry me?
Marisha: No, you're big. I can take the gnomes.
Taliesin: That's fine; I need to get my gun. anyway.
Matt: You burst through the hall and head up the way. As you do, you can see some of the other servants glance around, suddenly.
Marisha: I poop on one of them as I go over.
Matt: As you you're gliding up the staircase and onto the second floor, there are two servants. One darts out of the way.
Marisha: It's one of the Briarwoods' servants, right? Oh, no. I want to save it for if I fly over one of the Briarwoods. Never mind. It's fine.
Matt: We'll let it go. So as you coast up, releasing your avian payload on the stairs, you can see, looking jarred and confused, a human woman, brown hair, freckles, mousy-looking servant looks up and reaches up as you spatter the side of her shoulder.
Marisha: (caws) That's me saying sorry.
Orion: I see what's going on. You're flying? I cast Fly on myself. I follow suit behind her, and as I'm passing by the person she shat on, I cast Prestidigitation on her. Sorry about that!
Matt: Okay, the Keyleth spatter vanishes through arcane means. However, the servant begins to give chase up the stairs after you guys. Not angrily, just following to see where the action is going. All right, you head over to meet up with them to grab your weaponry. Although your weapon was probably on you.
Taliesin: Bad News.
Matt: So you go ahead and grab Bad News and pull it off the side. That's your guys' action now, so as you are out front, Lady Briarwood is going to right at the window. Looks down for a second, and I need you to make another wisdom saving throw.
Liam: That's a 13.
Matt: 13? So as you get up and you say jenga. A familiar feel comes over you as your muscles once again lock into place and you fall over from the momentum of the run, going face-down into the cold, dew-covered grass in this courtyard area, unable to move.
Liam: (muffled) Fucking bitch!
Matt: In a similar dash fashion and leaping out of the broken window that you left, Lord Briarwood (impact) onto the ground next to you. Three-point landing, stands up over you with this grin. That will be his turn though. At this point in time, one of the bookcases-- you hear this sound real fast, this sound of wood being slammed open, and a surprised noise. That's all you hear from your perspective in the distance. All right, so as you guys get your weapons you begin going where?
Laura: I guess running towards the Briarwoods' room.
Matt: Where you saw them leave? You head up the stairway, following behind where you saw Keyleth and Tiberius rush off to. Are you following the rest of them?
Sam: Yeah. I put my mug down and I start little leg waddling towards them. As I go, I'm going to send a message. I use Message to-- who's the guy who likes us?
Liam: My name is Vax.
Sam: No, not him. Sylas? No, not Sylas! Seeker Asum?
Matt: Seeker Asum, with Message? I believe the person has to be within visual range. Wait, no. You can cast through solid objects if you're familiar with the target and nobody on the barrier. It's 120 foot, though. You don't know how far he is. You could give it a shot.
Sam: Okay, I say, something's gone awry. We may need you right away.
Matt: The message is delivered out into the space. Hopefully, it found its recipient.
Laura: As I'm running towards the Briarwoods' room, I start shouting Uriel! and grab a servant and say, go find Uriel. Tell him there's enemies within the gates, in the castle. Now!
Matt: "Yes, Lady Vex. Right away." Runs off. You guys coast up the stairs. Right as you reach the top of the hallway over here, you can see there are two guards that are currently standing at the door.
Travis: I stay at the front door.
Marisha: Is the door open?
Matt: The door is currently closed, but you're in eagle form, so you're going to be doing like eagles do. I'll say, you're about there because you were a little bit ahead of them. Those are the two guards right there. At this point now, as this is happening, I need you guys to go ahead and roll initiative.
Marisha: That's okay. Thanks, Percy. Ten.
Orion: 17.
Matt: And Keyleth? Keyleth, you got ten, you said?
Marisha: Yes.
Matt: Okay, so after that current circumstance, that brings us-- as they're rushing up, you would be finishing off the last round, so you can make another wisdom check.
Liam: I failed it.
Matt: Okay. You can just see the little bit of moonlight up in the sky. It is this ominous image of not knowing if your friends are coming, not knowing what's happening. All you know is you cannot move your physical form, and looming over you is Lord Briarwood, standing and beginning to move in to kneel. That will end your turn. All right, that brings us to the top of the round. This will bring us to Lady Delilah, who is now going to step out of the glass, leap down, try to catch herself. And falls flat on her ass. Smacks down, (grunts). Gets herself up from the ground. Yeah, she has to use the rest of her movement getting back up from prone, at that point. She's right there, but you see now, in the window above her, a small humanoid figure. A familiar one that was waiting for you earlier in the foyer, who apparently was hiding inside one of the dressers inside the room.
Laura: Seeker!
Matt: He's there. Lady Briarwood is going to take the rest of her turn. She has one action left. With this, she looks over to you and says, "When we mark a target, he does not escape, I'm afraid." I'm going to see what this does. All right, I need you to make another constitution saving throw.
Liam: Nine.
Laura: Start rolling different dice!
Liam: The universe is random and doesn't care about you and me.
Marisha: Life lessons by Critical Role.
Sam: Stay in school, kids.
Matt: You take 34 points of necrotic damage.
Liam: I'm unconscious. I haven't been knocked out in ages.
Matt: You go unconscious, then when it comes back to your next turn, you have to make a death saving throw. If you fail three--
Liam: Right, so it's only if it exceeds my hit point maximum that I'm killed outright, so I'm unconscious.
Matt: You are unconscious.
Liam: Hey, guys. I'm unconscious.
Marisha: So that means he never got his "I'm right here" message out.
Matt: Nope.
Laura: But we know he's in the room. That's where we're all heading.
Marisha: Well, he's not in the room. He's in the front yard, at this point. So we are heading to the room.
Liam: Wait. As that happens, and as my consciousness fades away, I don't say anything, but here's what I think in a split-second. I think of my friends that I have spent so much time with. I think of Keyleth, beautiful, walking under the trees. I think of my twin sister as a young girl, folding up linens with our mother. I think of my sister as an adolescent in lessons, smarter than me. I think of the woman she grew into. Hiking over many, many, many miles together. My best friend. My best friend, Vex'ahlia. And before I can think no more, I say a prayer to Sarenrae to watch over my friends and keep them safe.
Matt: Go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw.
Liam: Eight.
Matt: With that thought cast out, the darkness swallows your vision and unconsciousness takes you into the cold, wet grass on the floor of the courtyard surrounding the palace. A small shiver runs down your spine, Vex: a feeling you haven't felt before. A feeling of sudden and immediate sourceless dread, and in that instant you know that there is almost no time.
Laura: Can I use Hunter's Mark and sense where Lady Briarwood is at that moment?
Matt: Yeah, she is actually at this point, beyond the palace walls. You can sense and knowing the palace walls. You were expecting a second floor, it's that direction but just outside the walls of the palace. And you guys just got your weapons.
Laura: I take off running in that direction.
Matt: I'm going to have people who haven't rolled initiative yet, go ahead and roll initiative so I can put you on the timing chart here. Grog?
Travis: 17.
Matt: 17, nice.
Sam: 17.
Matt: 17? Look at you guys.
Taliesin: 16.
Laura: I hadn't rolled, actually, for that. I hadn't rolled initiative yet. 18.
Matt: You guys are coming up into the hallway at this point. Let's see. All right, Vex and Grog, you rush out into the courtyard area, making your way out of the front. Some of the guards can see you dart out and they go to stop you, but they see you going where they're going, they recognize you and let you pass. So that will be for Scanlan, Grog, and Vex'ahlia, your turn is making your way around the outside, using a full run action. You haven't crested the outside of the palace yet. You don't see anything, but you are starting to make your way around the corner.
Laura: Can I use my earring during that? I tell Keyleth and Tiberius that I think they are outside the palace walls.
Orion: Copy that.
Sam: Did I hear that?
Matt: Do you have your ear pieces on? Then yeah, you would.
Sam: Then I don't run. I Dimension Door outside of the palace wall.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and make an intelligence check. Roll a d20 and add your intelligence modifier.
Sam: Not good. Oh, wait.
Travis: Seeing how fast she's running, I go into a rage.
Sam: Oh, wait. It says I have advantage on intelligence saving throws. This is not a saving throw. Then no, eight.
Matt: Eight? So you manage to Dimension Door--
Sam: Into an outhouse!
Matt: As opposed to being directly outside, because you haven't seen this part of the palace, you're not really 100% visual range; you haven't visited this side. You end up trying to come over in this area. You end up appearing right up here inside the room, looking at the window and you can see down. Suddenly you look about this room. To the left of you is Seeker Asum, who doesn't even notice you are there. He is currently putting away a crossbow. Looking out the glass window, you can see down with the little bit of light that's in the courtyard. You see Lord Sylas Briarwood looming over what looks to be the currently unconscious body of Vax'ildan.
Marisha: That's right, it's dark outside.
Matt: Yes, it is. Bringing us to this point now, that's your guys' turn. Tiberius? You're up.
Orion: Does anyone have eyes on Vax? Anyone?!
Sam: I do! Do I?
Laura: Yeah, you do.
Sam: I think I do.
Orion: Where are you, Scanlan?
Sam: Inside a room. I don't know where I am. It's a nice-looking room.
Orion: I assume you're in their chambers. I'll be right there. Fireball to those guys right there! (explosion sound)
Matt: Right there? All right, go ahead and roll damage! Yeah, they did not make their saving throws.
Orion: I wanted to say real quick, right before that, I got to my decanter of water and I start charging it, and then I do Fireball.
Matt: So roll your damage on that.
Orion: How much is that?
Taliesin: Will that also widen up the hole into that room?
Marisha: We'll see, I guess.
Sam: Or you could make a wall of fire.
Orion: How much is that? 35!
Matt: 35? Okay! One of them gets blasted and thrown almost off his feet and pushed back from the sheer force five foot in that direction. The one that's this side of the doorway, who was already at one hit point, barely brought from already being knocked unconscious by Vax, you hear a scream, and is turned to ash, his charred armor left clattering across the ground.
Orion: What about the door?
Matt: Both doors are blown open from the force of the explosion. A large portion of the room is currently singed with black. What's your fly speed?
Orion: 30 feet.
Matt: That's as far as you can get.
Orion: Can that dude see me from where I am?
Matt: He can currently see you, yeah.
Orion: Good. I turn to him and I'm like, you better get the hell out of my way! And that's my turn.
Matt: Okay! Make an intimidation check.
Liam: Yeah!
Laura: Yeah!
Travis: Yeah!
Orion: 23!
Matt: From what you can see, the helmet itself guards part of the face, but you can see from the charred, slightly angered, gritting expression on his mouth as he looks at you as you shout that, the grittiness goes away, the jaw opens slack, and takes two instinctual steps back into the hallway. Does not appear to be interested in threatening what just blew his friend into ashes.
Travis: Cremated him!
Matt: From behind you, as you're flying over you see this servant come rushing up, the female one that you saw earlier on the stairway. Rushing forward, seemingly with an intense look of what went from curiosity to now engrossed in this current circumstance. Kit, do you want to go ahead and take your place?
Sam: Wait, what's going on? What do we see?
Orion: This is where she comes in?!
Liam: You can sit right here!
Marisha: Oh, I'm really sorry I pooped on you! I didn't know I was shitting on you!
Orion: I cleaned you up. Don't worry!
Laura: Can I ask a question? Trinket. I didn't say I left him at home. Did he wait outside of the palace during the formal dinner?
Matt: Trinket would not be at the dinner, per se.
Laura: But he would have stayed outside at the palace, right?
Matt: Trinket would probably be kept somewhere near the stables, where the people can watch over your animals.
Liam: He eats at the table with us all the time!
Matt: Not in the middle of the grand hall of the palace of Tal'Dorei, sorry.
Liam: She taught him to sit in a chair.
Matt: As you rush in, you see this giant fireball blast through the middle of the hallway. Two of the guards are sent off to the side. There's this hurried look and this shout. You've seen these individuals throughout the palace before, and they're part of the council. You've always kept a distance from them. You're a servant of the palace; you want to keep up appearances for many reasons. However, there's this rush of energy and this general sense of dread in this corner of the palace. And for the most part, judging by this, you didn't like the Briarwoods when they arrived, and you think things are going wrong here. What are you going to do with your turn?
Kit: Can I join in the fray?
Matt: You're right over here in the hallway. It's hard to see from this perspective here, but you're right over here.
Kit: Okay.
Sam: DM, who is this person who's just joined us? For the audience.
Matt: This is Kit Buss, who's our official artist for Critical Role. (cheering)
Matt: In from the UK to join us for one session of awesomeness.
Orion: That's the United Kingdom.
Taliesin: Where the real accents come from!
Sam: She's going to be doing the worst American accent possible.
Liam: What's going on around here?
Matt: You're over here. There's this guard here, and these doorways are blown open and seems to be where all the energy's going. You have a good sense for the flow of energy and emotional tension, and right now everything is pushing in that direction.
Kit: Okay, can I use my turn to dash to get through the doors?
Matt: That'll get you right there. You can just look past the doors, and they're blown open. That'll be your turn there. As you glance inside, you can see the gnome member of Vox Machina is there currently at the edge of one window. The left window is shattered on this side. Seeker Asum, another part of the council, is right at that. He looks over his shoulder, looks at you and goes, "Shoo!" You see him look like, what are you doing, no go! Go, stupid servant! That's your turn. All right. That brings us to Percy.
Taliesin: Where am I?
Matt: You were rushing outside with them or rushing up the stairs?
Taliesin: Rushing outside with them.
Matt: Okay, you'll just catch up with them. They're on the outskirts, just cresting around the side of the palace here. All right.
Taliesin: Am I just there, or am I off the map?
Matt: You're, in theory, off the map on this side. I'll get to that shortly. You're rushing as fast as you can. You exited the front of the palace and spent your whole turn rushing as fast as you can around the side. It's a long distance, putting all your energy into it.
Taliesin: I have a very long range.
Matt: You have no visual, unfortunately. That brings us to Sylas.
Travis: That dick!
Matt: All right. No, sorry. Before Sylas is the Seeker. Seeker Asum.
Laura: Seeker Awesome?
Matt: Asum! He's pretty awesome. He's going to leap down here. He's going to make his own acrobatics check, which he does with flying colors because rangers are cool like that. Lands immediately and angrily rushes forward going, "No!" and attempts to feint into an attack, and Lord Briarwood puts up his hand to attempt to deflect with preternatural speed just (whoosh) out of the way. Asum, instead, reaches down to grab the unconscious body of Vax and is going to attempt to move you away from here. Sylas does get an attack of opportunity against you. That's a 16?
Liam: Do I make a death saving throw?
Matt: What's your armor class?
Liam: 17.
Matt: 17. Unconscious. I'll say there's no dex bonus to that because you can't move out of the way, so that would be 15. I'm sorry, 12. It hits you; I rolled for that. You immediately take a death saving throw. Instantaneously. You failed one. Now, it is Sylas's turn. That was Seeker Asum, now it's--
Laura: Seeker's turn and Sylas got to take a turn!
Matt: He got a free attack because he moved out of range to try to hit him. Rushes up to join the fray there. He's going to look towards Seeker Asum and say, "This quarrel is not with you." Asum looks over his shoulder. Asum relaxes his grip on Vax's body and stands at attention. And you hear him say, "My apologies, I did not mean to meddle." He seems to be stepping out of the fray.
Travis: Seeker Asum is?
Matt: Yes. That's a charm action to get him out of that. That will be Sylas' turn. That brings us to Keyleth.
Marisha: I'm going to go double my speed. My fly speed is 80 feet right now. I'm going to head towards and pick up Scanlan.
Matt: Make a general dexterity check. You're flying in very tight quarters as a giant eagle flowing through.
Marisha: Dexterity saving throw, you said? As my eagle form, right? 12?
Matt: 12? Okay, that's fine. You clip a wing. It hurts, and you wince at the impact, but you manage to make your way in there. As you come down, you grab Scanlan, but there's not a lot of room here to get much lift or air, so you're now clutching your gnome.
Sam: Do I get a save?
Matt: Do you not want to be grabbed by her?
Sam: Well, I don't know she's there. I don't know what's grabbing me.
Marisha: You've seen me turn into an eagle.
Sam: I'm not even looking at you.
Matt: Make an insight check.
Sam: Insight check? Okay. Not good. Five.
Matt: Five. Okay, you see this giant eagle come screeching into the room, talons out, and starts coming at you with talons. Be mindful of that. It's technically now a grapple contest, so go ahead and make an athletics check.
Marisha: An athletics check with my eagle. Is that dex or strength?
Matt: It would be strength.
Marisha: 19.
Matt: 19. Go ahead and make an acrobatics check to avoid it, or athletics. Athletics or acrobatics, your choice.
Sam: 15.
Matt: 15. As much as you try and fight, the eagle grabs you and your tiny gnome form is grasped in its claws. Oh, woe is this evening.
Sam: First, I got a small drink, and now this?
Matt: All right, that finishes Keyleth's turn. I need you to make a second death saving throw.
Liam: I succeeded.
Matt: Okay, so you stabilize.
Liam: Wait, I'm at one?
Matt: You didn't die. Sorry. My apologies. Vex, you swing around the corner, just getting to the outskirts.
Laura: Right as I get outside-- I would whistle, but Vex can whistle, and she whistles for Trinket.
Matt: You're not sure where Trinket is.
Laura: No, but I whistle for him. He knows to listen for it.
Matt: Do you want to get as close as possible to the fray?
Laura: Yes.
Matt: I'd say as you turn the corner, that will get you about there, and you can see now, there is Seeker Asum and Lord Briarwood both standing over what looks to be a small cluster of cloth, the source of the dread.
Laura: I scream. Can I attack?
Matt: You can, yeah.
Laura: Okay, if I did something that did five feet-- ten feet... I've got to look at this. Yeah, ten feet. If I hit Lady Briarwood, would that hit my brother, or would that just hit Bastard Briarwood?
Matt: No, that would just hit her. Oh, within ten feet? It would hit Seeker and Sylas, yeah.
Laura: Fuck it, I'm doing it. Lightning Arrow right at her face.
Matt: Okay, go for it. Roll for it.
Sam: Don't miss.
Laura: Well, that's wedged.
Travis: Yeah, it's a weirdo roll.
Laura: Natural 20!
Matt: The fury pumps through your veins in an attempt at vengeance at what appears to be your twin brother at death's door. You pull the arrow from the back of your quiver. As you feel the energy gather from the atmosphere around you, while the energy itself is a blue crackling energy, you see it as bright, vibrant crimson red. You release it with a scream towards Lady Briarwood. Go ahead and roll damage on that.
Laura: What do I do, times two?
Matt: Yes, times two.
Laura: So it was 32 damage on her, and then everybody within ten feet has to make a dex save.
Matt: All right, he doesn't get one.
Laura: Not him. He's not in it. And I Hunter's Marked her.
Matt: Right, so it does additional damage.
Laura: Fuck. One.
Matt: One. Okay.
Marisha: Every little bit counts.
Matt: The lightning hits her. It shocks her, and you see the pain come through, but for the sheer force that should have been, it seems almost like it wasn't as impactful as it should have been. However, Lord Briarwood and Seeker Asum both fail, so they both take the additional damage.
Laura: Oh, good. Then 2d8 for them. Nine, and then times two because it was critical? 18.
Matt: Sure. I'll allow it.
Liam: Haggling.
Laura: And I get another attack, though. Yes? Okay, then I'm going to attack her through my Blazing Bowstring. Natural 20 again! (cheering)
Laura: Inspired by my brother!
Matt: You've certainly invoked the fury tonight. All right, go ahead.
Liam: She loves me.
Matt: Against Lady Briarwood to follow up on that?
Laura: Yes, of course it is! Okay, eight plus seven is 15 plus two for bracers, so that's 17 times two is 34.
Sam: Hunter's Mark.
Laura: Plus Hunter's Mark damage, which is another fucking six! 38 damage. No! No, it is 40 damage.
Matt: Well, no, she's not concentrating because he's unconscious. I was saving for the Hold Person spell, but she's not concentrating on that, currently.
Laura: She's on fire!
Matt: She is actually lit on fire.
Laura: I should say what the Blazing Bowstring does, huh? An additional d10 of damage for that. Would that have been part of the part that was multiplied by two?
Matt: No.
Laura: Another six for that.
Liam: Does Seeker Asum get a save now that he's been hit, to shake that charm?
Matt: It has to be damage from the allies of the person who charmed them, so no. You guys are currently considered a threat to him. All right, so that ends your turn. That brings us to Delilah. Delilah, who's now on fire. Laura, the Blazing Bowstring, does that ignite her? Does she take continuous fire damage, or is that just one-time fire damage? No, it's an additional 1d10 once. She shrugs off the flames. I remember that. Angrily.
Kit: At least you messed up her dress.
Laura: Yeah, fuck that dress!
Matt: As the electrical energy and the flames dissipate, she puts her hands out like this, and she looks at you for a second and she extends one cruel finger towards you with a look of intense hatred. I need you to make a constitution save.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: I don't know if she has to aim it or not. Let me check. Nope! I need you to make a constitution saving throw.
Laura: Okay. Yeah. Okay, cool. 15. No, wait. 17.
Matt: 17. That's not enough, unfortunately.
Sam: Oh man. That's a lot of rolling.
Liam: Carry the three...
Matt: You take 66 points of necrotic damage as a sickly beam of black energy streaks out from her finger, plows into your torso, and you feel as if your soul is temporarily pulled from a portion of your body. For a second there, your eyes glance past the threshold of death, and you manage to pull yourself back in. The cold resonates through the rest of your body, and all of a sudden the temperature outside, which was already pretty chilly, feels freezing cold. Brush with the Finger of Death. All right, she is going to move over towards Sylas right here, getting into a protective standpoint, glancing down at the unconscious body of Vax. That brings us to-- we have Grog, Tiberius, and Scanlan.
Sam: I'm going first. Fucking shit. I know she's got me in her fucking claws.
Matt: You've figured this out now, after this whole (yelps). Keyleth, of course.
Sam: Can I still see through the window?
Matt: You can see through the window right there, yeah. It's hard, at this point.
Sam: Okay, I'll use my bonus action first to cast Healing Word on Vax. (singing) Oh, that Vax elf--
Matt: What's the range on Healing Word?
Marisha: 30 feet.
Matt: He is not close enough to reach. You'll have to move first.
Laura: Then maybe you don't want to go first.
Marisha: I can take you over there.
Sam: Would I know that?
Matt: You would know the range of it. You'd be like, "Ugh, he's too far."
Travis: You can move first, can't you?
Sam: I can't move. She's holding me.
Laura: You can wait.
Marisha: I'm trying to give you a fast way down, motherfucker.
Sam: I know. I guess I'll hold my turn.
Matt: Okay. All right. Tiberius?
Orion: Okay. Move me an additional 30 feet because my flight is 60 feet, so that was from the last turn.
Matt: Okay, 60 feet flying speed. Good to know.
Orion: Let's swoop in that room. Another 60 feet. How far can I go? Can I go all the way down?
Matt: That's as far as you can get, right there.
Orion: Crap, balls. Can I see anything? I can't see anything. Outside?
Matt: That's the 60 feet for your movement.
Orion: I'm still flying, so can I see?
Matt: Right, from an elevated standpoint, you would probably just barely be able to see the edge of Lord Briarwood down there, below. He would have three-quarters cover, but you can see him.
Orion: I can't see Vax?
Matt: No. Not from the angle of the window.
Orion: I charge my decanter. That's my turn.
Matt: Okay. All right. You can use your action to move, if you want to get closer to the window.
Orion: Oh shit. Yeah. Can I do that?
Matt: Or you could go outside, if you wanted to.
Orion: Then I can't do anything else after that, right?
Matt: This would be the end of your turn, regardless.
Orion: Okay, then get me right where I can see Vax.
Matt: Right there?
Orion: Actually, skootch me one over. I can still see him from right there, yeah?
Matt: Yeah, you can see him there. Cool, so you're floating in the air, currently, looking through the cracked window at the cluster of mayhem that's below. That ends Tiberius's turn. Grog.
Travis: Raging, I see Vex take off so fast. I try and catch up to her and see what's freaking her out so much. My speed is 50.
Sam: Wait, no. Healing Word has a 60 feet range. You said 30!
Travis: You're after me. It's okay.
Matt: It's all happening simultaneously.
Travis: I take the Firebrand Warhammer with the Chain of Returning attached to it. I activate it, and I throw it at Lady Delilah.
Matt: Okay. What's the range on it?
Travis: It doesn't have a distance. It has a DC to pull it back.
Matt: Here's what we'll do. It's the warhammer or war pick?
Travis: Yeah, the warhammer, but the Chain of Returning doesn't have a distance.
Matt: I know. It's the distance of the weapon, is what it is.
Travis: Okay.
Matt: Looking it up right now for you.
Taliesin: What did we do before iPhones?
Travis: How is it 150/120?
Laura: Yeah, because you used it when we were fighting that manta ray.
Matt: I don't have a Player's Handbook. If somebody could look up the equipment section right now?
Marisha: What are you looking for?
Matt: Excuse the sound change here, as I have to move the mic. There we go. I got it. There is a range on thrown weapons, unfortunately.
Taliesin: Does it count as a mace? Handaxe?
Matt: Warhammer... this one is not considered an actual normally thrown weapon, so I would give it the same distance of a handaxe, which is 60-foot max, but you would be at disadvantage on the throw, anyway. Pretty heavy disadvantage on this, so we'll give it a shot.
Travis: That doesn't even make 60 feet, though, does it?
Matt: No. As you lob--
Travis: If I know how long it is, can I do something else instead of throwing it? If I'd known the distance--
Matt: Yeah, if you know the distance, then I'll say sure.
Travis: Can I try for Intimidating Presence?
Matt: Sure.
Travis: There's a DC saving throw--
Matt: Against her?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: Okay. She glances over at you as you come running around the corner, this giant engine of muscle and death. You growl at her, screaming--
Travis: (roars) No!
Matt: What's the DC on it?
Travis: 13.
Matt: 13. She glances over at you and you see her head turn to the side with a curious chuckle.
Travis: So low! God!
Matt: Yeah. Sorry.
Marisha: Bring it back to Sam.
Matt: All right. Kit, you're up. Oh, that's right. You're doing your turn. Continue.
Sam: Will 60 feet hit him?
Matt: Yes, it would.
Sam: Okay, then I will heal Vax. (singing) Oh, that Vax elf, getting bit by vampires, and his skin's turning pale and white. But don't worry, because around the corner, here comes Scanlan. Everything's going to be all right.
Liam: I feel like I'm going insane!
Matt: All right, so roll for how much you heal him.
Sam: Even though that's a bonus action, I'm going to do it as a 5th-level spell.
Matt: It's an additional 1d4 for each, so it would be 5d4 plus five.
Sam: And I roll it?
Matt: Yes, you do.
Sam: Okay. Well, then give me a bunch of d4s.
Matt: Kit, you're on deck, so imagine what you're going to do next.
Sam: I need one more. Great. Okay. Whoa, what the hell is that one? Ah, shit! What are these? I can never add d4.
Orion: 12. Plus?
Matt: Five. So you heal 17 hit points. From the darkness--
Sam: Wait, is it plus five, or is it plus five, five, five--
Matt: No, it's plus five. Consciousness comes to you. Breath comes into your chest, and you can feel the cold, wet grass against the left side of your face. Your vision begins to clarify for a second, and you look up over you. You can see immediately to the right of you both Lord and Lady Briarwood standing over you, looking down with one half of their gaze, the other paying attention to--
Liam: They're looking at me?
Matt: They're looking down at you and glancing at this slowly encroaching circle of assailants. That was your bonus action.
Sam: That was my bonus action. As my action action-- oh man, this is stupid. I lift my Hand Cone of Clarity, and I sing to Lady Delilah, (singing) Hey there, Delilah, won't you listen to me because I'm about to cast a spell on you. Ooh! Oh! (speaking) Okay, so I'm going to use Suggestion on her. This is so stupid!
Matt: So what's the DC on that?
Sam: Well, it's 19.
Matt: With that. Okay, good to know. What are you suggesting to her?
Sam: I'm suggesting that she has an unquenchable urge to make out with her husband.
Matt: All right. And what saving throw is it? Is it a wisdom saving throw?
Sam: It is wisdom.
Matt: Wisdom. Okay, good to know. Rolled an 18. She has advantage on it, anyway. All right. Yeah, she rolled a natural 18, plus her wisdom bonus of two. That puts her at a 20. She just crested over it. You can see, she glances up for a second at you. The presence of the actual shouting and the Suggestion echoing through the glass and out the other broken window. She looks up and you see parts of the shards of the glass are actually shaking from your singing. The harmonic resonance of the glass catching your--
Liam: She doesn't feel even a little bit horny?
Matt: You gather that probably at all given points of time, she probably enjoys being close to her husband, but not overcome with an uncontrollable urge.
Sam: She has a headache.
Matt: Right. All right, so that ends Scanlan. Kit.
Kit: Okay. Am I within 120 feet of either of the Briarwoods?
Matt: You are, but they're not currently in visual range because they're outside and down below, so if you want to try and move over this way, you can try to get a visual.
Kit: Am I able to move somewhere where I can see them?
Matt: You would have to leap up onto the edge of the canopy bed. You can just see them past the broken window, down into the courtyard there, as Tiberius, the dragonborn you saw coast through, is hovering in the air about five feet above you.
Kit: I would like to -- oh, there's lots of excitement going on, isn't there? I would like to use Crown of Madness, if I may.
Sam: Wait! I thought she was just a common guard!
Laura: Servant.
Kit: I would like to use Crown of Madness on Lord Briarwood.
Matt: All righty. What is the DC on the spell?
Kit: My DC would be eight plus my spellcasting modifier--
Matt: It should be at the very top of your spell sheet.
Kit: Okay. 17.
Matt: 17. All right. Against Lord Briarwood... (chuckles) Even with his plus seven--
Laura: Yay!
Taliesin: Oh my god, is something actually going to work?
Matt: He is going to use his legendary resistance to succeed the saving throw. So as you do that, you see the magical energy form around his head and this crown of darkened arcane energy forms and begins to clasp around, and he looks up for a second and shrugs his hair like that, and it (crash) dissipates, and you can see for a brief second his vision come up and find your gaze.
Marisha: But Matt, she's our guest!
Matt: I understand! As it was a concentration spell, also, the illusion that you currently were holding fades away. What was once the demure, mousy-looking human guest suddenly appears as a pale, white tiefling, currently now existing at the edge of the bed. Her image shimmers and disappears as you see her standing before you on her hoofed legs, holding what was previously a non-visible staff in one hand.
Orion: And I'm right above her?
Matt: You are right above her, yeah.
Orion: I go, ooh! Nice horns!
Matt: Looking over your shoulder, you're a little bit in front of her, but yeah, you see her. All right, so that will be your turn there.
Laura: Our friend is in mortal danger right now, you maybe wouldn't want to hit on somebody, at that moment.
Kit: I would have to agree.
Matt: Percy. Following suit, you begin to move around the corner to the others. You are now within visual range of both Briarwoods-- at a far distance, though-- too far for the Pepperbox. No, its range is 150, so yeah.
Taliesin: Pepperbox range is 150, but the Bad News range is disgusting.
Matt: Nah, they're within range for both.
Taliesin: So I'll start with Bad News.
Marisha: Nothing travels faster.
Taliesin: (sighs) All right. First shot.
Matt: Against who?
Taliesin: (yelling) Sylas!
Travis: Yes. I got little goosebumps from that.
Taliesin: That's a 30 to hit.
Matt: Yeah, that'll hit.
Travis: Rock. His. Shit.
Taliesin: (sighs) This is about to feel so good.
Travis: De-cleat this motherfucker.
Marisha: These are the worst people we've ever faced.
Taliesin: I hate them, I hate them so much. Where's my other d12s?
Marisha: d12s? 12, 12 away.
Taliesin: That's 17 points of damage.
Matt: Okay. The first shot. As you (gunshot), the shot echoing out across the night sky of Emon, Lord Briarwood, who is currently staring down at you as you come to consciousness, and you can see under his breath, he says, "Oh, there's no way out tonight, friend." And begins to lean forward before (impact) the back of his shoulder is wracked by a sudden impact. You see dark material just (spray) spatter out with some sort of dark crimson, and he (grunts). Looks over his shoulder with anger, and you can see at that point, glistening across the moonlight, the sharpened fangs visible at the edge of his mouth. As he looks over--
Taliesin: Is he looking at me? Okay, good, I'm taking another aimed shot at his face.
Matt: Okay, so you use your second attack to reload.
Taliesin: Third shot, aimed shot at the face, while he was turning around.
Liam: As he reloaded, weakly, behind him, I go, hi, Percy.
Taliesin: That's 24 to hit.
Matt: 24 to hit will hit.
Sam: Skadoosh!
Taliesin: (laughs) That's 28 points of damage, and he has disadvantage on all attacks for this round.
Marisha: Yes!
Matt: Okay. That was using the arm shot? Good. So as he turns around and glares at you, there's like a moment of clarity, and you can feel that familiar stare, that horrible glare, and the cowardice in you fights the moment of tension that you've been waiting for this sequence. As you load the weapon, he says it loudly enough for you to hear, but this voice now, you see Lord Briarwood says, "Would you look at that, dear? The pup yet lives." (chuckles, gunshot) (laughter)
Matt: A big chunk of flesh is just blown off and you can see the bone beneath. (grunts, growls)
Kit: No mercy Percy!
Taliesin: Is that as far as I can make it?
Matt: It's as far as you can get. You still have your heroic action, if you wanted to do that. Holding onto it? Okay. All right. So that will end your turn. Seeker is then going to turn this way, step towards the side and pull his crossbow out. It was already loaded with a bolt into it, and he's going to take a shot at Grog, who's currently the biggest target right now. That's going to be-- rolled a two. That's going to be a 13 against armor class.
Travis: Misses.
Matt: Yeah. Goes and for the bonus action reloads and gets the second shot at you. That will be a 19.
Travis: Hits.
Matt: All right. You take seven points of piercing damage, halved because of your rage. And with the rest of his movement, Seeker Asum's going to go ahead and step back in the shadow beside there. Ending that turn, now it comes to Lord Briarwood.
Marisha: Wait, I didn't get my turn?
Matt: Keyleth, you're up after him.
Liam: And I have a question. At some point I'm in the mix?
Matt: Yeah, you're coming up. Don't worry. You guys rolled the lowest initiatives.
Orion: Oh, he's prone, still.
Matt: He's still prone, yeah. So Sylas is going to, seeing the circumstance, reach down and attempt to grab you.
Sam: Get out of there.
Matt: He has disadvantage because of that. (laughs) All right, that's going to be a total of 11.
Liam: To do what? To grapple check? Do I have to roll, too?
Matt: To attempt to grapple you, yeah.
Liam: So I roll, as well.
Matt: You don't have to.
Liam: Yeah, fuck that guy.
Matt: Yeah, so it missed entirely. All right, so that's with his first strike. Second one, he's going to go for another attempted grapple on you. With disadvantage, that comes to 18.
Liam: For hitting?
Matt: For hitting you. All right. And now he's going to make an athletics check to attempt to grapple you. That is going to be a 13.
Sam: As I see this going on, can I call out with Cutting Words to distract him?
Matt: You could, yes.
Sam: Okay. (singing) Distraction, distraction! Distraction! Distraction, distraction!
Matt: Go ahead and roll a d10.
Sam: What do I roll?
Matt: d10. And subtract that from his attack modifier.
Sam: Six.
Matt: Okay. With that, as he reaches down in an attempt to grapple you and grab you by the throat, the fingers are coming towards you and you try and attempt to roll out of the way. All of sudden, you hear, "Distraction!" and Lord Briarwood's, (annoyed sigh). You see his massive eyeroll and then goes in for the attack, but that's given you enough time to roll out of the way his hand only meets the ground. He's then going to step back and get adjacent to Lady Briarwood. That ends his turn. Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: Okay, I'm going to fly out the window with Scanlan.
Matt: Out the broken one over here or the non-broken one?
Marisha: The broken one.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: What are you doing to me?
Matt: So you're coasting over here.
Marisha: I'm going to go ahead and drop him off.
Matt: Okay, so as you swoop down and leave Scanlan right there in front of them, that'll be there.
Marisha: So Seeker Asum, he's against us?
Matt: You have no idea, you just swooped out there and he's there like hiding in the shadow.
Marisha: But he just fired at Grog.
Matt: You didn't see it, though, from your perspective there. You just saw a bolt go.
Marisha: Oh, I didn't see that. Do I still have enough movement to make an action?
Matt: Yeah you do, yes, that was just your movement as you swooped down.
Marisha: Where's Lord Briarwood?
Matt: Right there.
Marisha: I'm going to go and try and peck his eyes out.
Sam: Are you dropping me?
Marisha: Yeah, I dropped you off, I'm going to go and swoop over--
Matt: Okay. You've already used your movement to get there and drop him off and go all the way around.
Marisha: That's what I was asking.
Matt: Yeah, you used your full movement to get there and drop off Scanlan.
Travis: Do you still want to be an eagle?
Liam: Yeah, because it's a hit point sponge.
Marisha: Yeah, you know what, I'll drop eagle form.
Matt: Okay. Keyleth, all of a sudden the eagle condenses down and forms back into Keyleth in her half-elven form.
Marisha: And I will also use my bonus action to cast Healing Word on Vax.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: And I will also cast it at-- actually, I'll cast it at a 3rd level because I want to be safe.
Sam: Here are some d4s.
Marisha: Thank you.
Laura: She cast it at Vax.
Sam: So you need one more, right? At level three?
Marisha: Oh, and it's plus my spell modifier? Is that what it is? Plus ten, so yeah, I need one more, so that's 17 points.
Matt: 17 points of healing.
Orion: Hers is different.
Marisha: Oh no, wait. No, 15. Sorry.
Sam: You're back.
Laura: You're back, baby.
Matt: And with that, Vax.
Liam: You have to tell me what's possible. I'm prone, right?
Matt: You are prone on the ground.
Liam: This is what I'd like to do. You tell me if it's possible. I'd like to click my boots of haste together and then get up, which takes my full movement? What does it take?
Matt: Half your movement.
Liam: Half my movement. This is what I want to do, you tell me if it's possible. Click my boots of haste, get up, use disengage again, and then run like a motherfuck straight towards--
Matt: Yeah, you could probably do that, yeah.
Travis: Do it!
Liam: That's what I want to do.
Sam: Straight towards what?
Liam: My sister. And as I run past, I share a very awkward glance with Keyleth and keep going and just run and lock eyes with my sister and run at her.
Matt: Okay, and what's your full movement then? It would be 30 times two, which would be 60, half that, so you can run 30 feet because it takes half your movement to get up. So yeah, you disengage. There you go.
Laura: There you go.
Sam: Well good, I'm glad I'm tip of the spear now. Jesus. (laughs) How did that happen?
Laura: Dimension Door!
Matt: All right. That ends your turn. At the top is Vex.
Laura: All right. I'm going to--
Travis: Kill some people?
Laura: Okay, yeah, I'm going to take a healing potion. A superior, which is what?
Matt: Superior would be 8d4 plus eight.
Laura: That's so many fours.
Travis: It's not like you don't have 30 dice anyway. So many dice.
Marisha: These fuckers, I'm so angry at them.
Laura: 20. Oh, 28. That's good. And then I'm going to cast-- I'm sorry, Hunter's Mark. I'm going to cast Hail of Thorns right at the one in the middle. They're right next to each other, right?
Matt: Yeah. You would be scooting right over Scanlan's head with your arrow.
Laura: Let's stick it to Lady Briarwood again. Cool. Balls. Oh wait, do I, I don't need to roll to hit on that, right?
Matt: It would say on the spell.
Laura: Oh wait, that's wrong. Oh, the next time I hit a creature. Oh, so I don't think I hit her. That was 15.
Matt: 15 would not hit, unfortunately.
Laura: Okay, then I try it again. I didn't hit her again! It's because you're safe now, buddy.
Matt: So as she stands there grinning, looking over all this, they're both amused by this whole circumstance, there isn't really a glimmer of fear. As the first arrow comes by, she leans to the side, just dodges it a little bit. The second one comes towards her, and Lord Briarwood deflects it out from in front of her and gives you a look of like, don't you dare touch my woman.
Laura: Where's Trinket?
Matt: Trinket is somewhere.
Laura: Okay, did he hear? I whistle again.
Matt: You whistle again, okay. That's your turn.
Matt: All right, so. With that, you see the dragonborn comes flying up through the window, and Delilah looks back at everyone and sees everyone rushing forward and says, "Honey, we'll deal with them. Worse comes to worst." And she glances up at you. "But you."
Orion: I'm Tiberius Stormwind!
Matt: "Yes, indeed you are." As she looks at you for a second, and there's this sparkle, this prismatic glow of light in her eyes. I need you--
Orion: 4th-level Counterspell. Were you saying something?
Matt: Hold on.
Marisha: Hold on. (laughs) I think distance makes a difference with these people.
Matt: All right, so you're going to attempt to counter. Let's do this.
Sam: Dice versus dice. Wizard versus wizard.
Matt: Go ahead and roll a d20, add five.
Orion: Seven.
Matt: Yeah, that's not going to do it.
Liam: But that's a lucky number.
Matt: At that point, all of a sudden, you feel a surge of arcane energy suddenly burst, not visually, but on this coursing connection, almost like two nexus points of energy. There's this tidal wave of arcane energy that blasts into your mind. I need you to go ahead and make an intelligence saving throw.
Liam: Are they Superman and Wonder Woman? What the heck?
Laura: Yeah.
Orion: 18.
Matt: 18? 18 would unfortunately not succeed. Yeah, you take 21 points of psychic damage--
Orion: (yelps)
Matt: And your intelligence and charisma scores become one.
Sam: What?
Matt: Suddenly, language leaves you. All the spells, the nature of spellcasting, is robbed, and you know where you are, but everything is instinctual. From this point, you are essentially, from a communication standpoint, a giant lizard.
Orion: (lizard noises) Am I still flying? I'm assuming I fall.
Matt: At this point, actually, yeah, you do, because you can only maintain concentration. And you land on the ground. She then steps--
Orion: Wait! Is it permanent?
Matt: You don't know.
Marisha: I can fix it. It's okay; don't worry about it right now. I can't fix it right now!
Matt: Tiberius. It's your turn.
Orion: What the fuck can I do? Is there a saving throw?
Sam: There is no save.
Matt: At the end of every 30 days.
Sam: 30 days?! He doesn't even know what a day is!
Marisha: I can fix it. I can fix it after I sleep. Just not right now!
Matt: Which is what she would be saying if she was knowing this was happening to you. So anyway. You still know your friends. You know you have friends here. You know there's something to protect. You know that people need protection. You must protect! And that's the extent of where your drive is right now.
Orion: Well, I guess-- and I'm confused as hell, I assume?
Matt: It's hard to say. You're still you, you're still present there, you just know that suddenly, "Spells? I don't know spells. (growls) Anger. Frustration. Protect." It's all base instincts right now.
Travis: Does he know friend from foe?
Matt: You don't know.
Orion: I mean, I'm not going to do shit. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to leave. I'm going to go out the door and back in the hallway. And I'm going to whip around to that guy and go, (aggressive lizard noises).
Matt: And he goes, (scared noises).
Orion: Because I know I don't like him.
Matt: Right. And takes another five foot step back from you. Unexpected feral reaction from Tiberius!
Orion: And I'm going to dash.
Matt: Yeah, I moved you double. Okay, that ends your turn? Grog?
Travis: Me? I would like to run towards the fucking Lord Sylas. Can I reach him?
Matt: You can't get all the way there, but you can get within throwing range.
Travis: Throwing range only? Yeah, I'm going to throw the hammer again.
Matt: All right, so now you (whoosh) lob it, the flames arcing in a circle towards him.
Travis: 23.
Matt: 23 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
Travis: 17.
Matt: 17, all right. So (smash) the hammer hits him in the front, the flames burst from the impact, you can hear the metal clang of metal against the armor he's wearing under his outfit.
Travis: Oh, yeah, sorry, d6 of flame damage! Shit. One.
Matt: All right. You did 18 damage, then, good to know. All right, so go ahead, and if you want to try and retract, it's a bonus action.
Travis: I succeed.
Matt: You pull in the chain. It whips back. Like Thor, you catch it mid-air, prepare yourself for the next round. That'll be your turn. Scanlan?
Sam: Oh. Hi.
Matt: You're now there, face to face. You are essentially the shield of the group between the Briarwoods.
Sam: Oh. Hello. What a lovely dinner we had-- Lightning! (laughter)
Matt: All right. You go to release the spell. She immediately begins to mutter something in between. You immediately feel this counteractive arcane energy. If she hadn't rolled a natural one on her Counterspell, that would've been pretty bad. But through the sheer force of frustration and anger at this point now, the lightning bolt presses through her counter, and the bolt is released in that direction, arcing towards both of them.
Sam: Wait, she rolled a one?
Matt: She rolled a one to try and counter your spell.
Liam: Please make it funny.
Sam: Oh, so wait, I get to roll for damage now? It's a bunch of d6s right? 8d6.
Matt: 8d6. And for their saving throws--
Sam: Can I arc it so it hits both of them?
Matt: Yeah, it would hit them both.
Sam: Would it also hit Mr. Awesome?
Matt: No, he's off to the left.
Sam: Okay.
Matt: All right. So they do both make their saving throw, so they both take half damage.
Laura: Of course they do. Hate them!
Sam: 32?
Matt: 32, okay. That's a 16 to Sylas and eight to Lady Delilah.
Sam: Wow, she can take half of half?
Matt: Apparently.
Laura: Magic resistance.
Matt: Both of them (impact sounds) take the blast from the-- and you see this look of: okay, things are getting a little weird now. They both look at each other with a realizing they're now a front of two against many swarming individuals. Do you want to move or stay where you are?
Sam: I will move backwards. By a lot. And have I seen the tiefling?
Matt: You have not. Oh no, you did. You flew past as you went and you were like: what the heck is that? And then you pulled out.
Sam: But I don't have eyes on her? So I can't inspire her?
Matt: Unfortunately, no.
Sam: All right, well then, I will inspire Keyleth. (singing) Can you feel the blood tonight? That's it, that's all I got. (laughs) All right. So you're inspired.
Marisha: Thanks. I get a d10 right? Ha! Okay.
Matt: All right, so that ends your turn. That brings us to you.
Kit: Okay, I'm starting to get a bit pissed now. My tail is whipping, and I would like to use Phantasmal Killer.
Marisha: What is that?!
Kit: To Lord Briarwood. Again.
Marisha: That sounds awesome.
Sam: Her accent is so fake.
Kit: (exaggerated American accent) I know, right?
Matt: So are you staying at the edge of the bed, or are you going towards the window to have a clear view?
Kit: I'll move forward a bit.
Matt: All right, so you leap off the side of the bed, come up to the edge of the broken window, looking down towards it. All right! Let's try and make this wisdom saving throw. Chose to make his save, using his legendary resistance.
Laura: Wait, how many times does he get that damn thing?
Travis: He's like a dragon!
Kit: It's fine, I'll wear him out.
Matt: Remember, the target still becomes frightened for the duration. So now, as you do this and look up, Lord Briarwood has had this cocky grin the whole time, sees this sudden albino tiefling in the window glare down and send this shimmering wave of arcane energy hissing from above. The echo of the hiss hits Lord Briarwood and for the first time, you see him recoil in strange momentary terror and seems to almost step back into the side of his wife. Glances over his shoulder towards her and she gives him a look of misunderstanding and acknowledgement. So he cannot get near you, currently. Cannot get any closer to you and has disadvantage against anything against you.
Travis: Just her or us?
Matt: Just her.
Travis: Clap hands.
Matt: All right. Very cool. So that's your turn on that one. Percy.
Marisha: Percy!
Taliesin: I'm going to take a standard walking speed 30 feet straight ahead. Swinging Bad News back onto my back, pulling out Pepperbox. Sylas! I'm getting his attention again. I'm going to start shooting with--
Sam: Are you still in disguise?
Taliesin: No, I don't think anymore.
Matt: No, the moment you fired, the illusion dissipated.
Taliesin: Yeah. So I'm going to be using my sharpshooter for this.
Matt: Okay, go for it.
Taliesin: That's 26 to hit.
Matt: Yeah, that hits.
Taliesin: So that's, let's see. Oh, I need one of these, too. That's 22 points of damage and one point of fire damage.
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: Same thing again.
Matt: So you've shot, reload, shot. And this turn--
Taliesin: No, I put Bad News away. Bad News is empty.
Matt: Oh, so Bad News is empty. That's the first shot. You got this. Cool. Sorry, I misunderstood.
Taliesin: Ain't going to be a dick about it.
Matt: All right, so this is the first shot. Second shot.
Taliesin: 25?
Matt: 25 hits.
Taliesin: That's 21 points of damage.
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: Shooting again.
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: 18.
Matt: 18 does not hit. The first shot (impact) off the shoulder and the second one (impact) hits the same point where Bad News hit the arm, blasting off another portion of the flesh. And the third one, this time, you can actually see the shadows coalesce around him and the shot just misses through the darkness and reforms into the physical form of Sylas. As you're finishing your turn, that, you can see, Sylas' flesh is reforming and healing rapidly from the damage he's taken. The actual tendons are forming back up from the blast damage. He's looking at you with a slight grin but then nervously back at the tiefling in the window. Back and forth. At this point in time, Asum is going to go ahead and back up this way and is going to use an action to hide. Rolls a three. Terrible. Absolutely useless. All right, so Sylas now is going to angrily look around and pulls off from the back, you can see this shimmer as there was an illusion dissipates and what previously looked like it was an empty back, a large scabbard appears. Pulling this giant dark, slate-gray greatsword from the back and lunges forward towards you, Grog.
Marisha: Sylas?
Laura: Did someone ever get Uriel?
Matt: You have not seen Uriel, no. All right. Is going to then make a strike at you. That's a 26 to hit.
Travis: Hits.
Matt: All right. You take 12 points of slashing damage. Reduced to six. And I need you to go ahead and make a constitution saving throw.
Travis: Do I have advantage on those if I'm raging?
Matt: No, you just have a high constitution.
Sam: He still has disadvantage on attacks, right? That wore off?
Travis: 18.
Matt: 18, all right. You feel like the actual wound from the blade is attempting to draw some force from your body, but you just (grunts) and flex and whatever arcane enchantment is resisted. Turns around for a second swipe, that is going to be a 19.
Travis: Hits.
Matt: Hits? All right. You take 15 points of slashing damage. Half that to seven, or be eight. Round up for use. So eight. And make another constitution saving throw.
Travis: Damn it. Ha! Even better. 21.
Matt: Yeah, once again. There's some sort of enchantment that's trying to pull from the wounds as it hits you and you just grin them off with this chuckle. So he's going to use the rest of his movement to step back a little bit. You get an attack of opportunity.
Travis: I do?
Matt: Yes, you do. With the hammer.
Travis: Yes! That's 24.
Matt: 24 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
Travis: Awesome. That's 11, plus four points of fire damage, so 15.
Matt: Okay, 15. Cool. That ends his turn. Keyleth.
Marisha: My turn? Okay. Wait, where did Briarwood go? Lord Briarwood.
Taliesin: Right there.
Matt: Right there.
Marisha: Oh, he backed up. Beautiful. So I take my staff and I crack it on the ground. Where I cracked it, little ice crystals start forming against the ground and start making ice and I'm going to cast Sleet Storm. I need a thing.
Sam: I have a 20. What do you want?
Marisha: No I need a--
Sam: What do you need?
Marisha: A laser pointer! There you go. So it's a 40-foot radius. Starting where Briarwood is.
Matt: All righty. A 40-foot radius.
Marisha: Right. Starting in this line. Grog's not in it.
Matt: This way, you mean?
Marisha: From here back.
Matt: So Sleet Storm (boom) right in that area right there. So as you slam the ground, the ice begins to move around and all of a sudden the cold air begins to form this almost like mist as the temperature shift suddenly impacts the surrounding vicinity. The grass freezes in place, and you can see bits of ice and sleet begin to rain down in the vicinity.
Marisha: So the ground in the area is difficult terrain. It is covered with slick ice. When a creature enters the spell's area for a first time or on its turn starts its turn there, it must make a dexterity saving throw or else it's knocked prone, because they slip and fall. If a creature is concentrating in the spell's area the creature must make a successful concentration saving throw against your spell's DC or lose concentration.
Matt: Good to know.
Sam: And you have inspiration.
Matt: Cool. All righty. So?
Marisha: And then I move back.
Matt: That ends your turn. Vax.
Liam: Okay, I'm going to throw one dagger at Briarwood's face.
Matt: All right. Go for it.
Liam: That's a one. If I'm hasted, can I do two potions? Instead of attack, attack, attack.
Matt: No. The additional action is not so much a potion.
Liam: All right, so I'm taking a potion of greater healing and walking backward. Walking distance. And greater healing is 4d4, right?
Matt: Greater healing is 4d4 plus four, yeah. All right, that ends your turn. Vex, you're up.
Laura: Yes. Knowing that they seem to be vampires because they've fucking creepy teeth, I'm going to pull out one of my holy arrows and shoot it at-- Lord Briarwood's in the way of Lady Briarwood now, isn't he?
Matt: You can try and shoot either if you want to move over to the side and get a better view.
Laura: Well I'm going to cast Hunter's Mark on him.
Matt: On him? Okay.
Laura: And then I'm going to shoot my holy arrow through my Blazing Bowstring one more time.
Matt: Okay go for it.
Laura: Come on! Hold on! 28.
Matt: 28 does hit.
Laura: Okay, good. Do I do any additional damage with my holy arrow?
Matt: Go ahead and roll damage for the arrow. And you do an additional 2d6 radiant damage to Lord Briarwood.
Laura: Oh wait. 15, 19. Plus ten for the Blazing Bowstring, so 22, and then what did you say?
Matt: 2d6 radiant damage.
Laura: Seven more, so 29 damage.
Matt: Okay, good to know. So as the arrow impacts, (impact sound) he puts up his cloak to guard in time, as it goes (whooshing) through the cloak, you hear this (grunts) in pain as the arrow bursts, and as the cloak comes back, you can see this burning sensation across the front of Lord Briarwood. Where the flesh was healing and sewing itself up, that has been halted immediately by the impact of the holy water, which is beginning to pockmark and burn his flesh.
Laura: Awesome. Then I'm going to hit him again! (laughs) So yes, I'm going to do the same thing! Except I'm out of my Blazing Bowstring; it fizzled out.
Matt: Yes.
Laura: Okay that's a 29 to hit.
Matt: That'll hit.
Laura: Okay. That's good. Plus two radiant damage.
Matt: That's your second holy arrow, right?
Laura: Yeah.
Liam: What was it before that?
Laura: 17. 28. And then another d6 for my Hunter's Mark. 32!
Matt: Nice. Second one (impact) shatters and you can see now, like part of the jaw is hurt and wounded. (panting) There's this wild frenzy to his face as you can see Lord Briarwood is starting to look a little ragged. All right. That ends your turn.
Laura: Yes.
Matt: Lady Delilah Briarwood steps forward up to the back of her husband.
Marisha: She's got to make a dex throw.
Matt: She does. And against the spell, 'cause it's magic, she gets advantage. That would be an 18. What's the DC?
Marisha: It just says they just have to make a dexterity saving throw or they're knocked prone.
Matt: Right, but it's against your DC of your spell.
Marisha: Oh, is it? 18.
Matt: So yeah, she makes it. So she steps forward; almost slips, but catches herself on the shoulder of her husband and says, "My dear, I fear it's time that we make our leave."
Sam: Make our leave?
Marisha: No, they're going to bamf!
Matt: Casts Dimension Door. Both of them (whoosh) out of visible range.
Sam: Wait! I turn to Vex. Vex, does your Hunter's Mark tell you where they went? They just disappeared. Where'd they go?
Laura: They fucking disappeared?
Taliesin: They Dimension Doored out.
Marisha: They Dimension Doored out.
Laura: I do have Hunter's Mark on him.
Matt: On him, yes. You sense that they're not that far from you. They're around the corner where you guys came from.
Laura: They're right there! Do we want to keep fighting them?
Liam: He's ragged! Go! If we're ever going to get them, we need to get them now! Lead the way, Percival!
Laura: They're around the corner.
Marisha: I can probably teleport us through a tree, right?
Sam: That's okay, we'll just run.
Laura: They're right there.
Matt: As you guys rush around the corner you can see on the very edge of the cobblestone walkway, the carriage that they came in is now gaining speed--
Taliesin: Sharpshoot right now. I'm going to try and take out a wheel.
Travis: (yelling) Close the gates!
Taliesin: 27.
Matt: 27 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
Orion: Nice.
Taliesin: 20 points of damage.
Matt: 20 points of damage, all right. The wheel splinters and (grinding sound) is now coasting on the ground. The young gentleman who is currently on the top is looking over his shoulder, trying desperately to usher them away.
Marisha: How, roughly, far away are they?
Matt: Right now, they're about a hundred feet--
Laura: Is Trinket anywhere near them?
Matt: Trinket was over at the stables on the far back of the palace, unfortunately.
Marisha: I still have my Sleet Storm up. It's a concentration spell. I'm going to move it over there.
Matt: Can you just shift it over there?
Marisha: Yeah. It's a concentration spell. It lasts a minute.
Matt: Oh well no, it's concentration to keep it in the area.
Marisha: Well, then I cast it again.
Matt: So you're casting Sleet Storm again. What's the range on it?
Marisha: 150 feet.
Matt: 150 feet. The sleet storm lands down. The cobblestone becomes sleek; the carriage begins rocking back and forth. However, it does manage to keep on its course, currently; it does not get knocked prone. It's hard to knock a carriage prone, but it is sliding out of the way.
Taliesin: Is that a disadvantage because it only has three wheels?
Matt: Good call, actually.
Marisha: And it's rough terrain?
Matt: That is a two. (cheering)
Matt: At this point, the carriage (crash) slams onto the side of the ground and skids (creaking) to a halt in the middle of the ice, the sleet still spackling down as you guys all turn the corner now; as you approach. The gates have closed (slamming) as the guards have slammed it, listening to Grog on the far side. The door pops open on the side of the carriage. Tiberius, as you've made your way back around and you're at the front now, (panting) and you can see now, about 60 feet in front of you the carriage is overturned in the middle of this sleet storm, on the ground.
Orion: Where is it?
Matt: From a visual standpoint, you're about 60 to 70 feet from the front of this. The doors slam open and you can see Lord and Lady Briarwood step out.
Laura: Can I shoot my exploding arrow?
Matt: Hold on. As you've guys are just turning the corner. You can see now Lord Briarwood stands up and is trying to compose himself, ruffles himself up angrily, looking at his damaged circumstance. Lady Briarwood's against his shoulder and she goes, (clicks tongue) "Well, (sighs) at the very least, I think you should come visit us sometime, Percy. You're always welcome back home. It'd be nice of you to visit your family once in a while." Roll initiative. Just you. As you were the first action to take.
Laura: 19.
Matt: 19? Go ahead and roll. Roll the attack for the exploding arrow. This is against Lady Briarwood?
Laura: 29. It's against her.
Matt: Yeah, 29'll hit.
Laura: What do I do damage for the exploding arrow? That Percy made, by the way.
Matt: Yeah. Roll for your--
Laura: 16.
Matt: So 16 regular arrow damage? Okay, against Lady Briarwood. Cool. All right, and then for the additional blast that blows up it's additional 4d6 blast damage to her and they both get saving throws to try and halve it.
Laura: Okay I'm rolling one of our Critical Role dice.
Matt: So half damage to both of them.
Sam: Trademark!
Laura: Damn it.
Sam: Critical fail!
Laura: 11.
Matt: 11? So half that, six damage to each. She needs to make a concentration check. Advantage on that for war caster. Yeah, that's a 19. Okay. So (explosion), a portion of the outside of the carriage just blows apart. Wood shrapnel goes flying to each other side. As the smoke settles and the explosion, you can see, both Lord and Lady Briarwood are still standing there, seemingly unscathed by the event. She wraps her arms around him and whispers in his ear, "It's all right." And they both (whoosh) vanish in a swirl of arcane energy. You don't recognize it because right now you don't have the intelligence to really--
Taliesin: I want to walk over to the carriage driver.
Matt: You walk over to the carriage driver, who is currently on the ground, this young man who's horribly hurt, part of his torso is burned, and he's like, (coughs, grunts). Trying to climb away. (gasping) "Please, please spare my life, please. What do you want from me?" (labored breathing)
Taliesin: What do you know?
Matt: "About what?"
Taliesin: I shoot him in the right hand.
Matt: (gunshot, screams) It's an easy enough hit, he's prone before you. Three of his fingers are blown off, and the bloody stumps. (gasps, grunts) Shaking. (panting) "I'm sorry. I don't-- look-- "
Taliesin: You're from Whitestone, yes?
Matt: "I am. You don't know what it's like. I had no choice."
Taliesin: Well, you do now. I reload again and put it on his left hand.
Matt: "Please don't, please." The rest of you are gathered, and you step out from the edge of the window and make your way with the rest of the crowd, and they're watching this display on the front of the palace.
Taliesin: Frederick de Rolo.
Matt: "Yes?"
Taliesin: Where is he?
Matt: "He's gone. He's gone, sir. I'm sorry."
Taliesin: Lady Johanna.
Matt: "They're all gone. Sir, they all--"
Taliesin: Julius de Rolo.
Matt: "I don't know."
Taliesin: Vesper de Rolo.
Matt: "I don't--"
Taliesin: Whitney de Rolo. Ludwig de Rolo. Oliver de Rolo.
Matt: "Your family is gone, sir. They were taken. They were killed. I'm sorry."
Taliesin: You will tell us everything you've seen.
Matt: "They'll find me, sir. They'll kill me."
Taliesin: No, they won't. Because I will kill you first. Tell me what you've seen.
Matt: And with that we're going to go to break. (yelling)
Liam: Wow.
Laura: You're not dead!
Kit: Yay!
Taliesin: Thank you for not dying!
Laura: Hopefully, you won't turn into a vampire. You did get bit.
Orion: I think that works, is like, if it goes all the way down to zero-- [break]
Matt: Welcome back, guys. Couple of quick things before we jump into this. One, we are 38 subs from our next giveaway. Giveaway is for those who are active in chat, get a signed photo of the cast of Critical Role, as well as a signed piece of art, wonderful piece of art from our Kit Buss who's right here with us.
Marisha: Have you guys seen them? They're awesome.
Matt: It's pretty awesome, it's a wonderful piece of art of Keyleth transforming into an earth elemental and attacking K'Varn in the K'Varn fight. So yeah, we have that coming up. Also we have the winner of our shirt giveaway tonight. The winner is one Blair Beverage! (cheering)
Matt: Free shirt. We'll get this to you, so congratulations and thanks for watching tonight.
Liam: Real talk, the winner here tonight is me.
Matt: I was so scared.
Taliesin: You win another day.
Marisha: It's been one of the most emotional nights of my life.
Matt: So. As you all begin to gather around on the front of the courtyard of the palace, you can see some of the guards start rushing out amongst the splinters of this carriage that has been royally destroyed by many of you.
Orion: Do I see that everybody's safe?
Matt: Yeah, you get the sense that there is no immediate danger.
Orion: Okay. I'm going to use my lizard-brain and sniff out immediately Allura, and I'm going to go find her.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Do we see him go find her?
Matt: You guys currently are too engrossed with Percy currently pinning a young boy on the ground and shooting his hand off.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: He's currently like, "Please. What do you need? Just let me go. Please."
Taliesin: I want you to spend the rest of your life making up for the things you've allowed to happen. I now take the butt of my gun and I'm going to knock him unconscious.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: I don't quite know. I'm just rolling, but I'd normally get 21.
Matt: 21, at the point of life he has left (whack). Yeah, he just (impact) falls and crumples to the ground unconscious, pool of blood forming.
Taliesin: Are there soldiers coming?
Matt: There are guards coming now from the palace.
Taliesin: Put him in a cell.
Marisha: Wait, we can put him in our cell.
Laura: Yeah, put him in our cell.
Marisha: We'll bring him to Greyskull Keep.
Laura: But make sure he doesn't bleed out first.
Marisha: He's fine. He's not bleeding. It was non-lethal damage, right; he's not bleeding out.
Matt: Well, not from the head but he is missing three fingers from one hand and is currently pooling.
Marisha: All right, I'll solder up his wounds a bit, make sure he doesn't die.
Matt: Okay, so taking care of that. He's unconscious. You guys all take a moment to breathe in and realize the danger that just transpired. The Briarwoods got away. God knows where they're off to. You gather somewhere back in their territory, on their own turf. And you all look about at the guards gathering, making questions, and there are now two guards very intensely harrying this tiefling that showed up out of nowhere and began aiding the battle. You see now, one guard has an arm going to your shoulder and says, "You, what's your name? What's your business here? You do not have approval to be here at the palace."
Kit: I have been working here for months. You did not notice?
Matt: "I think we would notice a tiefling in our midst. You're under arrest. Throw her in the cell."
Liam: I walk forward and slap my hand on the guard's arm and say, we saved Uriel, you will stand down now. Uriel would not be alive if not for the people around you now. She's fine. Walk away.
Matt: The guard gives you a look and says, "As far as we know right now, you both, all of you, attacked two of our guests in the center of our own palace. They managed to flee. We're going to investigate this. Currently we're holding no one at immediate prison sentence for this, but--"
Liam: You realize your lord would not be alive now were it not for us, don't you?
Marisha: Also, you're a common guard. I'm speaking because Tiberius would say this, and he's not here right now because he's a little stupid at the moment, but do not interfere with the businesses that we have already arranged with people who have higher authority than you. Back off.
Matt: Make an intimidation check.
Marisha: Oh, I'm not good at this shit. I'm going to train in it. It's coming.
Matt: You do get a d6 inspiration dice.
Marisha: I also still have Scanlan's.
Matt: Well, if you already have Scanlan's, then that's all you need.
Travis: And I walk over and stand behind her.
Marisha: I'm going to add my Scanlan. 15.
Matt: All right. The guard looks at you for a second, then steps away. "I mean no offense, understand we've had--"
Laura: What's up? What's good?
Matt: He relinquishes the hand on the side of the tiefling and says, "We're going to investigate this. I mean no disrespect to you. You've been much aid to Emon. Just understand, this is a very peculiar circumstance. Please, we'll call you when it's time to get your opinions and your perspectives on the evening's events."
Marisha: No, we'll call you.
Matt: "We need to go ahead and notify--" at this point you can see now, Tiberius, you've stepped up in front of the stairs as Allura comes rushing out to inspect everything and sees you.
Orion: (groaning, fumbling) And I go to Lockheed, and I use my telepathic bond that I have with my pet. And I convey to him, to tell her, I emote to him, with my telepathic link with him, and I (foreign words).
Matt: You can't even form language thoughts.
Orion: That's what I emote to him.
Matt: You can give him an emotion. That's the most you can get to him right now
Orion: Right, and I try to have him telepathically tell her.
Matt: Tell her what emotion?
Orion: Help.
Matt: Okay.
Orion: I do this.
Matt: She steps forward and says, "Tiberius--"
Marisha: The universal symbol for I'm choking.
Orion: (frustrated noises)
Matt: And you just breathe flame out and Allura steps back for a second, "Tiberius, are you all right? You've been cursed by something. Hold on." She takes your head and holds you in place to calm you down. "Tiberius, calm yourself." And begins to inspect you, running her fingers up the side of your snout and like, "This is not good, this is very powerful magic. I don't know if I have capability of doing this really, you need a cleric. Please, sit tight, stay right here." The rest of you, as the guards back away, you're left alone and the rest of the group are looking upon you in a curious way.
Laura: Vampires!
Sam: And a tiefling.
Taliesin: I want to inspect the carriage to see if there's anything interesting about the carriage.
Laura: Are you hurt? Did they do anything to you? You were unconscious.
Liam: They bit me.
Laura: I search him and look for any mark.
Liam: I don't feel right. I think I need to go to a temple.
Marisha: Can I do a health check on him?
Matt: You can make a medicine check, sure. Percy, go ahead and roll an investigation check
Liam: I think I'm dangerous.
Marisha: 18.
Matt: Okay, yeah, there are definitely two puncture wounds on the side of his neck
Liam: You need to put me in the dungeon very soon.
Sam: I've read about this. We bury him under the ground for five days and five nights, all will be better.
Orion: That's kimchi.
Sam: Well, it could be. Could be kimchi. Either way, it will be very tasty.
Taliesin: Eight.
Matt: Most everything that would be of interest has been destroyed in the sheer force of the explosion. The carriage is in tatters. There's not much you can really glean from it, unfortunately.
Marisha: What time of day is it?
Matt: Time of night. Right now, it's probably cresting close to 10:00 or 11:00PM.
Marisha: Would the Sarenrae temple still be open? It's a church. They're 24 hours, right?
Matt: I mean, (laughs) the temple is always there, per se. I mean, there are multiple temples in the city as well. The Sarenrae temple is the one you know best.
Laura: I turn and look. You.
Sam: What's your name?
Laura: You helped us.
Sam: Your real name.
Kit: You have interesting taste in enemies, almost as interesting as mine. My name is Lillith.
Marisha: Lillith? That's so pretty.
Kit: Thank you, as are you also, might I add.
Laura: Interesting taste in enemies. Do you know anything about vampires?
Kit: Regrettably, not as much as I would like. But your brother? He does look, not as healthy as I imagine he may usually.
Sam: Are you a healer of some sort?
Kit: I am not.
Travis: Oh, what do you deal in?
Sam: And why did you infiltrate the castle? That's how the British people say it
Kit: Oh, really? Well.
Sam: Aluminium.
Laura: Laboratory.
Orion: Astronaut.
Marisha: Let's just keep listing words, guys.
Kit: Lift.
Marisha: Lift!
Kit: I think you have currently more pressing matters than my concerns, my presence here in the castle.
Laura: Then you'll come with us?
Kit: If that is what you wish.
Laura: Yes.
Marisha: Where are you from? Your accent's so--
Laura: It's wonderfully interesting Keyleth, but we need to get my brother to a cleric.
Marisha: Oh, right, yeah.
Matt: At this point, as you guys are discussing, and you're already nervous that you're out in the open anyway. You're not under one of your various guises. You feel this warm bolt of heat in your upper torso area. And you guys watch as suddenly across the front of her chest, this strange, glowing, red eye-like sigil (flame noises) emblazons across the front and then slowly fades.
Sam: I am just looking at the symbol, I am not looking at anything else.
Laura: What was that?
Marisha: Are you all right? Are you with the Briarwoods?
Kit: No, but I must leave. I must leave this place right now. Immediately. I drop a shroud of illusion over myself again, become the maidservant.
Matt: You guys watch her visual image shimmer back into that of a servant. And even through the illusion there is still this dull, pulsating red, glowing arcane mark of an eye, that's slowly shimmering on the front of her torso.
Laura: Can you come with us to a temple?
Kit: For not long. I cannot linger.
Sam: What is that mark on you?
Kit: This is the mark of the Broker.
Sam: The Broker?
Kit: The Broker. He has been seeking me and I have been hiding here, but no longer. He has found me. This mark, it means that I cannot hide any longer. I must leave.
Sam: You helped us in battle. Do you need us to help hide you?
Kit: I would not drag you into my troubles. I know who you are, you are Vox Machina.
Laura: How did you know about us?
Kit: Some of you traveled with my cousin Zahra. (gasps)
Laura: Oh my gosh, Zahra! She's so wonderful. I love her so much!
Kit: We are very close. She is a dear friend of mine, but she told me of you. I know you have your own troubles. I would not drag you into mine.
Marisha: Well look, we've got to make a pit stop at the temple of Sarenrae, anyway. Why don't you at least join us, and then we can at least go back to Greyskull keep for dinner, because we also have to drag this prisoner back there. It's along the way.
Laura: Yes. Any watcher that comes after you we'll fight them. We're very strong right now and full of health.
Travis: And we protect things with tails.
Matt: A voice rings out suddenly from behind you towards the palace. "All of you, stop your business." And you look and you see there in his robes, Uriel, which you summoned, standing at the front of the palace. "Am I to understand there has been a scuffle with my guests?"
Laura: Your guests are vampires. Look at my brother right now.
Marisha: And Tiberius is--
Sam: An idiot.
Marisha: He's an idiot. I don't know where he's an idiot right now. Damn it, we lost Tiberius.
Sam: He's even more of an idiot.
Liam: (calling out) Tiberius!
Matt: You see now on the front steps sitting there next to Allura, who's cradling him, as he's unsure of what is happening.
Liam: Oh, do we see them?
Matt: You do, yes.
Laura: Look at his neck.
Matt: Uriel looks and says, "I'm certain there is some sort of explanation for this."
Laura: You invited vampires into your palace.
Marisha: You invited them in.
Matt: "We will investigate. Look, the Briarwoods are esteemed guests of ours, and friends. So this is going to be taken very seriously."
Liam: You can have whatever mages you want cast truth on me. I was bitten. This threat is real.
Taliesin: The Briarwoods murdered the de Rolos and took Whitestone. I have proof. I was there.
Matt: "Then we shall have to have a conversation. For the time being, take care of this one. Tomorrow, when the sun rises, find yourself back to the palace. I would very much like to speak with you. This disturbs me."
Taliesin: I would recommend, Uriel, dis-inviting them for now.
Liam: We have earned your trust, have we not?
Matt: "You have. As have they."
Kit: If I may, my lord. I was present for-- please excuse me addressing your grace, but I was present for the battle, and I did see, oh! Quite a set of teeth he had. Oh, dreadful pale. And oh, terrible. Oh, flames everywhere and ripped dresses and heaving bosoms. Oh my lord! It was awful!
Matt: "All right." Go ahead and make a persuasion roll.
Sam: She's a common servant girl. She wouldn't lie!
Marisha: Yes. Look, she is traumatized.
Kit: 18?
Matt: "Very well, calm yourself, calm yourself."
Laura: It's all right darling. It's all right.
Kit: Oh! It were awful!
Sam: We'll take care of her for now.
Kit: Oh, I'm getting the vapors! Oh no.
Matt: "Take care of her. We'll talk tomorrow. Bring me what proof you have. This is a very, very serious thing you're discussing."
Marisha: We'll talk to him in the morning. We got to go.
Matt: You guys gather up--
Marisha: I turn into a horse and pick up Vax and Vex and take them to Sarenrae's temple.
Matt: Okay, you guys leap onto the back of Keyleth as she rides off.
Laura: I hold onto your mighty mane, and then him as well.
Matt: Allura takes Tiberius, takes you by the elbow, and leads you over the rest of the group as they ride off. "If you are, indeed, going to a cleric, perhaps you should take Tiberius with you. He's not well."
Sam: He seems totally normal to me. Seems like every day. Yep, that's pretty much basic him.
Travis: Is Seeker Asum still around?
Matt: Seeker Asum currently is nowhere near this situation.
Orion: I lick all of Vox Machina.
Matt: All that are present, because many are now riding away on a horse. (laughs) But the rest of them get a fine licking.
Travis: Oh jeez, no!
Orion: I lick Grog the most.
Travis: Smells like flies.
Matt: You all manage to make you way up to the temple of Sarenrae. The lantern light of the interior of the temple's main structure is low, as it is late in the evening. Nevertheless, the gates are always open. And as you enter, you are greeted by two clerics that are dressed in long, flowing yellow and gold robes, and there is one elderly cleric that you recall. The one that led the resurrection ritual on Pike. Not but almost a year ago actually.
Laura: I hop down off of Keyleth. (laughter)
Laura: I take you down, as well. And I say, please, please sir, I hope we're not disturbing you, but we need your help again.
Liam: I totally eat it and just hit the ground.
Travis: That wasn't my fault.
Matt: The two younger clerics step away as the older one steps forward. He's balding on top, this long straggly white gray hair that crests--
Orion: I go up to him and start sniffing him. (sniffing noises)
Marisha: He used to be a very intelligent sorcerer. This is part of the problem.
Matt: "There does appear to be arcane residue on this one. Yes, we could hope to cleanse him of this. Come, enter. Light the lanterns." And the clerics all start turning up various lanterns, and the magical light source of it as soon as you enter the temple. A cold ripple sensation begins to curl on the back of your neck as you step in. As you do step in, too, the two clerics give you a look, and are uncomfortable with the presence. And as it has, you guys, through your travels, you have encountered very few tieflings, let alone on this continent. In fact, most you have met were in Vasselheim. This one in Emon stands out like a sore thumb and everyone seems to be just a little put off by her presence.
Laura: I thought she was disguised.
Matt: That's right. Never mind, I retract that entire sequence.
Kit: He's still looking nervous.
Matt: As she comes out of this feverish daydream, none of that happened. (laughter)
Liam: I'm so glad that didn't happen.
Matt: Illusions. All right, so. As you guys enter the center of the chamber. He begins burning various incenses. As you step up, the cleric says, "Understand, these services are intensive in the costs required to present them to you."
Laura: We'll pay whatever cost you need.
Sam: No, we should haggle, don't you think?
Laura: No.
Orion: I lick the cleric.
Matt: (chuckles) The cleric  "Oh no, that-- that's, that's very--"
Sam: How much will it take to save our friends?
Laura: Sir, anything.
Matt: He says  "For this one, we require a donation to the temple of Sarenrae of a hundred gold pieces."
Laura: Oh, done.
Matt: He steps forward, and touches the side of your head on your temple and begins to focus. The symbol of Sarenrae begins to glow on the front of his clavicle. And suddenly, you can see these strange, gray veins that had wrapped around the sides of Tiberius's head retract, dissipate then fade, as intelligence swells back into your brain. And for the first time in at least the past half an hour or so, you are back to being Tiberius Stormwind.
Orion: (licking sounds)
Sam: Well, that's uncalled for.
Marisha: Could there be side effects or something?
Orion: No, I just wanted to really do that. That was really inconvenient. Let's help Vax.
Sam: Oh. You're with us again.
Orion: Yes.
Sam: Oh, well, welcome back. How was it, being dumb?
Orion: I was quite frightened, most of the time. I didn't know what was going on. I couldn't cast spells and I was-- Let's help Vax.
Liam: You didn't shit yourself, so you're a winner.
Orion: That's good, yes. You shit yourself, Vax? I cast Prestidigitation on his butt.
Liam: What the-- Oh.
Laura: You're clean; don't worry.
Matt: Okay. As you bring Vax forward, the cleric leans forward. "What is wrong with this one?"
Laura: He was bitten by something quite unholy.
Matt: "Oh. The good news is, if you're standing here, then most of the danger is gone. However, there might be some residual of the infection." He leans forward and inspects it for a second, reaches into his pouch and pulls out some herbs and presses them into it. It burns a little bit.
Marisha: Ooh, do I recognize what herbs he's using?
Matt: Make a nature check.
Marisha: Nature check?
Liam: Is it sticky?
Marisha: 19, so 29.
Matt: This is glissfoil. Glissfoil is used by many medicinal practitioners as a means of burning away infections and cleansing wounds.
Taliesin: He didn't even look down. He just said it.
Liam: Who didn't know that here, honestly.
Matt: As he presses in, he looks to you. "As long as this doesn't get infected, it should be all right. I assume, based on what you say, the nature of these wounds, that is some sort of--"
Laura: They drank his blood.
Matt: "Vampirism."
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: "From what I know of vampirism, it requires many tastes of your life force and bringing you to the threshold of death and beyond to truly turn you."
Liam: Listen, doc, I can't bite anybody here. Are you sure?
Matt: "Unless this is some unnatural thing beyond classic vampirism, you should be fine."
Liam: What do you mean, unnatural?
Laura: Well, any vampirism is a little unnatural.
Marisha: Excuse me? Do you actually have any extra of that glissfoil or any seeds that I could take with me? That way I can just keep up on his daily disinfection.
Matt: "Certainly." He reaches into a pouch and pulls out a handful of glissfoil. It's like a dried yellowish green leaf that curls in itself a little bit and gives it to you.
Marisha: Thank you so much.
Orion: As it happens, I reach for my decanter and I can control the charge; it's just charged, but I dissipate the charge. But also keep it for a little bit? No, I dissipate the whole thing. And I turn to the cleric and I go, oh holy man which cured my mind, would you be so graceful as to use the force of Sarenrae to bless the water in my canteen?
Sam: To what the water?
Orion: To bless it. I'm going to hold it up above my head way too dramatically.
Matt: "There are rituals, but they take some time. If you'd like to leave it here, we could make use of this and bless the contents of it, yes."
Orion: No, I thought you could like do a Hosannah and get me out of here.
Matt: "Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way. But should you require such blessing, we would be happy to oblige."
Orion: Wonderful! How many days, give or take, do you think it might take to accomplish?
Matt: "For that amount there? Two days."
Orion: Oh wonderful! We'll be here for two days, guys?
Liam: Probably will.
Orion: I'll leave it with you.
Matt: "For this volume--" He looks at it for a second and says, "This is an enchanted vial, is it not?"
Orion: Yes! Good eye!
Matt: "I'm curious to see how this will interact with the enchantment. We'll try. We'll put it at a 25 gold donation for the two days of enchantment."
Orion: I give you 50.
Matt: "Thank you."
Orion: Thank you for your service. The other 25 is for my brain.
Matt: "Well, is there anything else I can do to help you this evening?"
Sam: Thank you for all your assistance. Did he tell us a price for fixing Vax?
Matt: "That was a simple disinfection. There's no price for that. We're happy to heal here."
Laura: Thank you so much.
Sam: Our friend Pike would be much, much grateful for your service.
Matt: "Pike Trickfoot?"
Marisha: Yes, do you remember her?
Laura: She's in Vasselheim, restoring another temple of Sarenrae at this moment.
Liam: Spreading the good word.
Matt: This deep smile brings his face from this deep melancholy tentativeness to this warmth you hadn't seen before, and he goes, "I had not known that our lady had reach as far as Vasselheim." (offscreen thud)
Liam: Oh dear.
Matt: "It appears you've messed yourself."
Liam: Sorry! Is that blessed holy water? I'm sorry. I'll pay for that.
Matt: "I'm happy to hear that she has continued carrying her faith to distant lands, and that she has recovered well since our last meeting."
Laura: She has.
Liam: She's thriving.
Matt: "Good."
Sam: And one more thing before we leave. If you need any items, be they gear or blades, go to Gilmore's! Gilmore's Glorious Goods! Today!
Orion: You don't have to sell it--
Sam: We're supposed to plug him, right? I don't know.
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Liam: That was a little ham-fisted, but he does speak the truth. Gilmore makes a quality item.
Sam: 25.
Liam: That was very awkward, Scanlan, but it's true.
Matt: He goes "Gilmore? I think I've seen that shop around."
Laura: They're opening a shop in here-- just kidding. There's a shop here!
Sam: There is a shop here!
Matt: "Me and the clerics might have to go see it, then."
Marisha: Tell them Vox Machina sent you!
Sam: And you get ten percent off.
Liam: If you say Vax'ildan sent you, you might get 15.
Matt: "Good to know. Appreciate that. Nevertheless, sleep calls to me. I must get back to--"
Laura: Sleep calls to us as well, sir.
Matt: "Well, good night and adieu to you all."
Laura: Thank you for opening your doors.
Sam: Hey, oh, what was your name? For the next time we have a dead ally.
Liam: (laughs) Oh, tomorrow, you mean?
Matt: "Tristan."
Sam: Cleric Tristan? Thank you, Cleric Tristan.
Matt: "Of course."
Sam: Blessed be Sarenrae's name.
Orion: And I awkwardly bow out and say  See you in two days, oh mighty brain fixer.
Matt: He steps back. The lights dim on the inside of the temple as you exit. You guys step out into the cold night air on the streets of Emon.
Liam: (yelling) I'm alive!
Laura: That's loud. That hurt.
Travis: Sorry, headphones.
Liam: I am sorry to everyone watching at home for blowing out the mic, but gods damn it, I'm alive.
Sam: That was close.
Marisha: Yeah, actually, while we walk back to Greyskull, what happened?
Liam: I thought that I could get a peeky-poo at what they actually were, who they were, and let's face it, I fucked up is what I did. And Grog? You may shave off my pubic region, or draw a dick on my head, if you want, tomorrow. Vex'ahlia, I'm sorry for not staying close by. Scanlan, we're good.
Sam: I saved your life.
Liam: Tiberius, you are smart and I am very stupid. You are extremely handsome and I am ugly.
Orion: I don't disagree with any of that.
Marisha: It would have been true 30 minutes ago.
Liam: And I'm sorry. And Percy, I'm especially sorry. To you most of all. We weren't ready, you weren't ready.
Taliesin: We haven't failed. It's not over yet. I'm not done.
Laura: We'll hunt them down.
Marisha: They said your family was still there.
Taliesin: They're liars. My family is dead.
Sam: We'll track them down, we'll find them, we'll kill them, and seek revenge.
Orion: And then we'll loot their bodies.
Taliesin: I don't think we'll have to.
Sam: You don't think we'll have to?
Taliesin: I think they're going to find us.
Sam: They won't attack us! We're many, and they're few.
Travis: That we know of.
Orion: Just because we're in a keep does not mean we are safe.
Laura: We need to set alarms around our keep.
Sam: We also need to protect our new friend, Lillith fair, over here.
Liam: Is that your last name?
Sam: Well, she's white, so I thought maybe--
Kit: My family name is Daturai.
Marisha: How do you spell that?
Kit: (chuckles) In your tongue? D-A-T-U-R-A-I.
Liam: I lost track after the D.
Kit: You have had a rough evening, it's understandable.
Laura: I hope you've learned your lesson.
Liam: It'll be two weeks, at least, before I do anything--
Laura: Quite so stupid and reckless--
Marisha: We had a code word.
Orion: We had Jumanji!
Laura: Jenga.
Orion: Oh, sorry. Damn it!
Laura: Where's Trinket?
Matt: You look back at this point and you see, as you guys are reaching the outer wall of Emon, (galloping noise) behind you. (happy bear noises) Rubs up against you. (moans)
Laura: Your uncle almost died! I almost died. Did you know I almost died, darling?
Matt: Licks the side of your face.
Liam: I lean in, and I lick his nose with my own tongue. And then I let him lick me all over the place.
Matt: (sloppy bear noises)
Taliesin: Vax.
Liam: Yeah?
Taliesin: Thank you. Thank you for your risk. Yes, you were foolish, but thank you.
Travis: I walk up to Vax and I extend my hand, and I say, I'm glad you didn't die.
Liam: I love you, Grog. Would you like to draw balls on my forehead?
Travis: And I reach back, and I backhand him as hard as I can. (laughter)
Matt: Roll an attack.
Liam: I don't move at all. I just take it.
Travis: 22.
Matt: Go ahead and roll a d4, divided by two.
Laura: That's a six.
Travis: No, it's two.
Matt: Two plus your strength modifier, which I believe is four. So you take six points of backhand, bludgeoning damage as Grog (whacking). The echo from the impact.
Travis: And I say, no one kills you but me.
Laura: You deserved that.
Liam: Yeah.
Orion: Let's all get some rest, shall we?
Sam: Yes, but we'll have to prepare ourselves for an attack or perhaps stalk them and kill them?
Taliesin: Well, we're going to find out in a minute.
Marisha: And don't we have a prisoner?
Laura: Yes.
Sam: And we have a guest.
Marisha: Yes, and we still haven't found what the Broker-- who he is, or what he is.
Sam: Do you need to run from the Broker, or can you stay with us for a few days?
Orion: Do you owe some money? I don't understand.
Kit: How well guarded against scrying is your keep?
Sam: Not at all.
Liam: What about your room, Tiberius?
Orion: Yes.
Laura: You're guarded against scrying in your room?
Orion: Guards against scrying? Yes, of course!
Sam: Is that true?
Laura: Against scrying.
Marisha: I'm pretty sure we would have to have an enchantment on our keep that would guard against scrying.
Matt: As you guys are having this discussion, a voice rings out behind you and says, "Don't worry. It's not going to help you."
Travis: Is that little shitty Mr. Missing One Hand?
Matt: No. You turn around and look, and you can see a gentleman standing there about 25 feet away from you. You see dark brown and black studded leather armor with a cloak over one shoulder. Standing straight, with a grin. Deep dark red skin, burning yellow eyes and jet black, slicked hair between two horns that jut back. A tiefling stands there, looking forward, with two individuals flanking from side to side that are slowly stepping--
Orion: I don't know what they do, but I'm raising my arm up. Who goes there? Who are you? I've had a really bad day.
Matt: The tiefling, the male tiefling, steps up forward and says, "I've no quarrel with any of you. We've been scouring this city for a fugitive for a number of weeks. And as luck would have it, you guys happened to smoke her out of her hole."
Marisha: I go ahead and crack my staff on the ground and cast Anti-life Shell.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: And are they at the door?
Matt: You guys are walking from the outside of the wall to your keep.
Liam: Where are they?
Matt: Right now? They are coming from Emon. You guys are in this in-between section between your keep--
Liam: We're outdoors? We've left the temple?
Matt: You are, yes. And we're going to go ahead and have you guys roll initiative.
Marisha: Get close to me!
Matt: Keyleth started this.
Marisha: Get close-- what? Did I? But that's a spell I cast on myself.
Matt: Right. Casting spells, generally, for most people is a bad idea.
Kit: Natural 20! (cheering)
Matt: All right, so from a visual perspective here.
Orion: Yo, Stoneskin's up, dude. I didn't get to say that shit.
Matt: Stoneskin's up on you, Anti-life Shell. Who is where?
Travis: Tibs and I are in the front, right? Because we both took aggressive postures.
Marisha: The closer to me you are, the more you'll be guarded by the shell.
Travis: Who said I want to be guarded?
Marisha: You can still fight around it. They just can't get in.
Matt: All righty. Trinket is over this side here.
Taliesin: And we have a prisoner.
Matt: The prisoner was brought to your keep by the guards.
Travis: As close to the enemy as possible. Tiberius and I took the aggressive stance.
Matt: Yes, you guys would be up that way. All right.
Laura: Oh no, why is there more than one person?
Travis: He said two people are flanking him.
Matt: As you look at this point, you notice the two individuals. To the left there is a sickly-looking older woman with dark, verdant clothing that flows and drags behind her. To the right is a shirtless humanoid with darker, scarred skin, very muscular, shirtless torso, wearing a white, featureless mask over the face. And they both curl to the sides. The initiative was... What's the initiative order here? So who got 25 to 20? All righty. 20?
Laura: 20.
Kit: 21.
Orion: And 20.
Matt: And 20 for you, as well? All right... Okay. 20 to 15?
Sam: 19.
Matt: 19, nice. Grog, what did you get?
Travis: 18.
Matt: 18.
Travis: My magic, man.
Matt: 15 to ten?
Liam: 13.
Matt: 13.
Marisha: 11.
Matt: All righty. Percy?
Taliesin: 12.
Matt: What'd you say, Keyleth, you got 11?
Marisha: 11. Bringing up the rears.
Matt: All right. Is that everybody? Cool. We're good. So. As you (crash), how big is the radius of the Anti-life Shell?
Marisha: Anyone within ten feet of me. A decent amount right now. Not Tiberius, not Scanlan.
Laura: Not Trinket.
Matt: Not technically Grog, because Grog would be up front right there. So a ten-foot radius around you. And what does it do, Anti-life Shell?
Marisha: Nothing aside from undead and constructs can get into it. You can still cast spells, and fire bows, and you can still do stuff. We can go out, they just can't get in.
Laura: That's awesome.
Matt: The top of the round, the Broker goes. Rolled a very high initiative. High dex character.
Travis: That is the Broker.
Matt: Yep. "Sweet Lillith, you've been a very bad girl. Nefertiri, Nethspira, and Bellenore would all like to have a word with you. They've paid quite a bit of sum, and proven legally: you need to be taken back. Now, to your friends here, it's your choice: the easy way, or the hard way."
Kit: I use Minor Illusion, one of my cantrips, and I puff up like a cloud of nightmare, and I glow, and my eyes come alight. My tail whips, my fangs get longer. Oh, I bet you did. I bet they paid you so much. You tell my sister, I hope her face still festers.
Matt: "Choice is made." And with that, (whoosh) he vanishes from sight.
Liam: Ooh!
Matt: That ends his turn.
Orion: Wait, is he casting that? Did he cast Vanish?
Matt: There was a casting, yes.
Orion: Sweet. Counterspell.
Matt: All right. Go ahead and roll a d20.
Orion: 4th-level, too.
Matt: All right.
Marisha: Do you mean 6th-level?
Orion: No.
Matt: It's a spell.
Orion: (humming) What is this? What?
Matt: Oh no, it just fails. You don't have to roll for this one, this is Invisibility. So as he goes to vanish, you "Oh!" as a reaction, pull out your Counterspell, and his image shimmers, and then returns. "Oh, that's not even fair."
Orion: I haven't gotten to do much today. And you won't, either.
Matt: Very good. Well, he's then going to use his move action to shift over this way to there. All right, that ends him. Lillith, you're up.
Kit: Okay. I would like to...
Liam: Buy a vowel.
Sam: Come on, Kit Buss! Come on, fuck him up! Kit Buss!
Kit: Can I use Phantasmal Killer again, please?
Matt: If you'd like to, yeah. All right, against which one?
Kit: Against the Broker.
Matt: All righty, so he's going to go ahead and make his wisdom saving throw. What's your DC?
Kit: 17.
Matt: All right. Go ahead and roll 4d10 psychic damage.
Laura: 4d10? Holy shit! Do you need extra ones? Here's a gold one for you.
Kit: Thank you! Oh wow, I have so many pretty dice right now! It's lovely. Ooh, yeah! Ooh, so 29.
Liam: Little bit of Kit.
Matt: This is blending in, because the spell usually triggers on the start of his next turn. This is you both going at the same time, and conjoining your Minor Illusion fear into hitting him with this spell and working. It's this combination of everything hitting at once. All right, and as that hits, you see, he looks at you, and his expression goes from glee to terror. And he's immediately reconsidering his decision here. Do you want to stay where you are, or do you want to move?
Kit: I'll stay where I am.
Matt: All right, that ends your turn. Vex, you're up. Tiberius, you're up at the same time. We'll go with Vex first.
Laura: I want to tell Trinket to cannonball over the two lined up right there!
Matt: All right, Trinket (galloping sounds) rolls forward and (bear rolling sounds). Both of them try to move out of the way, they both get their dex save. All right, so Broker manages to pull out of the way just in time. However, the other, the big, thicker character doesn't quite have the dexterity to shift out of the way and takes the full impact. Okay. He suffers 14 points of bludgeoning damage as Trinket tears through.
Laura: Eat it! Go, Trinket!
Matt: He is knocked prone.
Laura: Good job, buddy! Little buddy!
Matt: That's Trinket's attack.
Laura: Then I get a move, still. I mean, I get an action. I'm going attack him! I'm going to attack the Broker!
Matt: For how that works for you and your bear, because that's his attack this turn.
Laura: I mean, yes. I'm assuming that's his attack, or was that his move?
Matt: Well, that's his attack. It's been a while since you attacked with Trinket.
Laura: I get to have Trinket attack, and then I get to attack.
Matt: Once, right.
Laura: Wait, attack action plus Trinket attack. It says one attack for me and two attacks for Trinket.
Liam: Trinket gets two attacks.
Matt: You can make one attack yourself while commanding it, so you get one weapon attack.
Liam: I think you should erase that and write seven.
Matt: As Trinket goes by, since it didn't hit him, he gets an attack of opportunity on Trinket. Does hit. Trinket does take seven points of slashing damage from the Broker as he misses him and he hits as he goes by.
Laura: But he's got armor on. All right, fine.
Matt: He rolled a 21 to hit.
Laura: Okay, and then I'm going to shoot an arrow. Okay. That would be 26.
Matt: 26 against the Broker? All right, go for it.
Laura: 14. I'm going to assume-- I mean, it's probably way too far, but I want to keep my Hunter's Mark on Lord Briarwood for the time being. So I'm not going to break that, even though he's probably far away, so it's just 14 damage to the Broker.
Matt: All right. The Broker's going to make a concentration check. Maintains concentration. All right. As the arrow (whooshing) moves out of the way, hits the armor, and splinters past, not dealing any physical damage, but you see the Broker is now visibly shaken by the two members of the party and sweat is starting to bead. His confidence he strolled into is quickly failing. All right, that ends Vex's turn. Tiberius.
Orion: Okay. Can I see the Broker where I am at now?
Matt: Grog's in the way. You can barely see.
Orion: I doesn't matter, I can see good enough. I'm going to spend three sorcery points and heighten my spell, which gives disadvantage on both those two rolls. I'm going to cast a 5th-level Fireball right on the cusp where it hits those two buttholes.
Matt: Here?
Liam: Don't hit Trinket!
Matt: Right there it would hit both of them and not hit Trinket.
Orion: There it is.
Matt: Okay, so they both have disadvantage on their saving throws?
Orion: That's what heighten spell does.
Matt: Okay, cool. As you arc around the side, you release the one single beam of flashing red energy, sparks at the end of the finger, lobs forward. (explosion) With a gargantuan explosion, red flames swirl into the area, sending the whole area, the dark part of the night, open field alight. You see all the green, dried grass is immediately burnt to a black crisp. Go ahead and roll damage. What's the DC?
Orion: 17.
Matt: Yeah, they both fail with disadvantage. Full damage.
Sam: All the dice!
Orion: All of them.
Liam: (laughs) Oh my god!
Orion: And then I'm going to spend one sorcery point to empower the spell. And then I'm going to use the six and I'm going to choose one, two, three, and four, and five, and six to re-roll.
Liam: Think of how handy that would've been against the Briarwoods.
Orion: Four, five, six. Okay, I'm going to roll these.
Sam: Much better.
Laura: That's amazing.
Matt: You can only use one metamagic option on a spell when you cast it.
Orion: Empower spell is the only one that doubles with any other metamagic. I can do it.
Matt: Oh interesting. Good to know. Thank you for the heads up. That's cool. I like that.
Sam: 38. 41.
Orion: 46.
Matt: 46.
Orion: (spellcasting sound effect)
Matt: As the explosion bursts forth, the flames dissipate. You can see the Broker there looking angry, frightened. Immediately takes some of the flame...
Orion: Before he does that, I go (laughing), I look over at Keyleth, and I use bonus action to cast Misty Step and I go right next to her and I vanish.
Matt: Okay. You vanish behind her, and as he pulls back the flames and then releases them they snake between everyone and go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw.
Orion: I make it. But it's fire?
Matt: It is fire damage.
Orion: Good, instead of missing it I'm going to (swoosh, gulps) swallow it. (grunts) That's 20. My dex save was 20. Sorry.
Matt: Oh, okay, good thank you for the heads up on that.
Travis: You swallowed it?
Matt: So you take half damage. The angry tiefling hits you with a Hellish Rebuke.
Orion: Blowing smoke through my nose (snorts).
Matt: It would be seven damage. You take half damage from fire, so that would be four fire damage as you take the Hellish Rebuke's burst of flaming, dark, arcane energy and (gulps) swallow it and take it in. You blow it out the side of your nostrils. And it burns, but damn does it look cool.
Orion: And that's my turn.
Matt: Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: Me? Shit. Is that the old lady over there?
Matt: Over here on this side, yeah.
Sam: Okay, I'll take a step towards her and I will try-- it's never worked for me, it probably won't work. I'll try Eyebite on her.
Liam: This is the time. Right here, right now.
Sam: What do I roll? I'm doing it through my Horn of Clarity or whatever.
Matt: All right, so it's a wisdom saving throw on her end. What's the DC on that? Is it 19?
Sam: 19.
Matt: Okay. So no, that does not make it. So what're you choosing?
Sam: Okay. I choose Sleep. (singing) Rock-a-bye, old lady.
Matt: So she turns around, she's holding this gnarled wand in her hand, as she comes around she gives you this strange look and goes "What?" And falls unconscious on the ground asleep.
Marisha: That's awesome.
Liam: "I didn't watch Matlock--"
Sam: And then I'll just inspire our new tiefling friend with a little sexy dance.
Kit: Is he always like this?
Laura: Yes, he is. Don't you feel so inspired?
Kit: Oh, you have no idea.
Matt: You take a d10 inspiration dice. It makes you laugh. It's less of an attraction thing and more of a, "Oh, gnomes. They're so small."
Kit: Oh, how special.
Matt: All right, that ends your turn. Grog, you're up.
Travis: All right, everybody's doing new stuff. With 50-foot speed, can I get to the far side of the old lady that's sleeping?
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: Can I get like behind her so I can-- I need the laser pointer.
Taliesin: You want to get right there, right?
Travis: Yes. Yeah, on the opposite side of her from where I am.
Sam: She's asleep. What are you going to do?
Liam: Kill that motherfucker!
Matt: You can get there.
Travis: That's what I'd like to do.
Marisha: She will wake up. Unless you cleave her in half, she will wake up.
Laura: It's Grog. He doesn't give a shit about that.
Travis: I take out the Javelin of Lightning. I whisper the command word, which is Penelope, and I throw it in a straight line, which will hit all three of them, in a five-foot-wide line that extends 120 feet.
Laura: You're so smart, Grog!
Taliesin: You just did math!
Laura: Look at you! When it comes to battle, he knows things.
Matt: All right, so that's five foot wide, so it'll hit him and one of these, or her and one of these two guys. It hits something in a five-foot line.
Travis: The guy that's standing.
Laura: Yeah, the Broker. Get the Broker.
Matt: So you pull it out and as you throw it downward. The javelin goes from a metallic blade into a bolt of arcing electric energy that slams downward. Penelope does not-- not Penelope. You keep shouting it at me. The old woman on the ground gets no saving throw because she's unconscious and she takes double damage.
Travis: Double damage?
Matt: So 4d6.
Travis: 4d6. 14.
Liam: Killed that old woman so good.
Travis: And if he makes a saving throw of a DC 13, it's halved.
Matt: The javelin arcs through and goes towards there, and then he does make his dexterity saving throw against that. He's a pretty dexterous guy.
Travis: It takes a little shock, though.
Matt: Right, so it takes a little bit of damage which was, what was it you rolled, was it a 14? So it takes seven points of lightning damage for that, and then make a ranged attack on the actual javelin.
Travis: What does that do? I don't even have that on here. I have no idea.
Matt: Oh, sorry. That was against the target, so since he was the target, he takes the impact. The lightning bolt arcs through the old woman. She (screams) shakes awake, screaming as the bolt arcs upward from the ground, and right before it goes toward the Broker, as he rears back in fear, it solidifies into the javelin as it once again slams into the front of his torso. He's like, (grunting, gasping). He pulls it out. Shakes it for a second, looking at it, confused.
Travis: I look at Tiberius and I go, I did magic!
Orion: It was very impressive. Good job, Grog!
Travis: Thank you! Penelope.
Orion: That's my mother's name.
Laura: Oh no, he got up.
Matt: The guy gets up and only has a half move.
Laura: Can he get that close?
Matt: On half movement, yeah. Runs up to you. As he does so you can see, holding on his side, gets up and goes bolting towards you, arcing around the side.
Marisha: He runs, he runs smack-dab into my wall. My arcane--
Matt: Anti-life Shell. The Anti-life Shell does--
Marisha: Blocks living things. They can't come in.
Orion: Unless you invite them.
Marisha: Like vampires.
Matt: It was a ten-foot radius you said?
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Vax'ildan flips him the double birds as he hits the wall.
Laura: From inside the wall.
Matt: So he's unable to, just runs forward, hits the barrier, skids past, hold his place there instead then.
Liam: That's unfortunate!
Matt: However, has a spear.
Laura: Oh shit. (laughter)
Matt: Still rushes around with it, both hands on it, arcing towards you with it. That is going to be--
Liam: Can I use Uncanny Dodge with it? Or is it too late?
Matt: Well, that's okay, it rolled a three to hit, plus eight, that's going to be an 11 so no. It just (whiffing) It swings wide with the spear. This is going very poorly for them. All right, Vax, it's your turn now.
Liam: Okay, so I look around at all these amazing people that I am so blessed to be with and barely even looking, I just go dagger, dagger, dagger over this asshole's head at the Broker. Yeah. The first one is, not that great, but it's all right. It's an 18. These guys are dickheads.
Matt: All right, 18 against the Broker just barely hits.
Liam: All right. That's ten points of damage. The second dagger hits him, I hope. 19?
Matt: All right, that does hit, yeah.
Liam: For ten points of damage. And then I'll throw my Dagger of Venom at him, see what happens. Oh, the same hit, same amount. The last one hit. This one hits. That is three, six, nine. Plus, he has to make a saving throw against a DC 15 for poison.
Matt: Constitution. He is going to fail that.
Liam: Yeah, go fuck yourself. That's not the right die is what that is. Let's see, poison damage is-- that's not great. Ten. Ten points of poison. You are awesome! (whooshing)
Sam: Wait, what if Lillith is the bad guy instead of the good guy?
Liam: Kit Buss is not a bad guy!
Matt: All right, so you're staying where you are?
Liam: Where I am. I'll stay where I am
Matt: All right. Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: Okay. I'm going to walk to the very edge of the spell right here, so I'm standing one closer to our friend there. Not just to you. I want to be close to the big strong schmuck.
Matt: Okay, so right there?
Taliesin: Is the Broker holding anything? Is he, is he using a weapon?
Matt: The Broker you see has like a shortsword out. He's currently tossing it and catching it.
Taliesin: Just a shortsword?
Matt: Or he's tossing it and catching it but like (grunts). He's having a bad day. The Broker was not prepared for Vox Machina.
Taliesin: Okay. Before I start to do anything I'm going to look at him, look him in the eye: What is wrong with you? Don't you see there is nothing here for you? Run away before you die! There is no option! And I'm just going to start unloading. Natural 20! (yelling)
Liam: Damn, son!
Taliesin: Pepperbox.
Marisha: What is wrong with you?
Liam: Percival de something something something de Rolo the III, you badass motherfucker!
Taliesin: That's 16 points of damage.
Matt: That's to the Broker?
Taliesin: To the Broker. I'm just shooting at the Broker.
Matt: 16 points? That is doubling the dice?
Taliesin: That is doubling both of the dice. Now a sharpshooter shot.
Matt: The Broker can't do anything. It already used its reaction.
Taliesin: Sharpshooter shot misses. And another shot, seven, 19?
Matt: 19 hits.
Taliesin: All right, cool. That's eight points of damage. Blowing an action surge and firing three more times.
Sam: Three more? That seems terribly unfair.
Taliesin: That's 25... that's ten points of damage, plus four points of fire damage. Sharpshooter shot. That's a 22. That's 21 points of damage. Another sharpshooter shot with ice fire. Finally, I get the breakdown on that one. The gun jammed. I put it away.
Marisha: But that was awesome. That was pretty dope.
Taliesin: How many fired shots did I get? Was that five shots or six shots?
Matt: That, that was five shots. Well, all in all, it was six shots, but five hits.
Taliesin: Okay, so I'm out of-- all right. I don't have any more actions.
Matt: Yeah. That's okay (chuckles). First and foremost, How do you want to do this? (cheering)
Travis: Did you see the nostril? His little nostril twitch.
Matt: I feel bad for him. (laughter)
Taliesin: Okay, I'm going to do something weird here and I'm going to hold you onto this. I'm going to get a little weird, and I'm taking straight chest shots and I'm just firing chest shots, and I'm just making a hole the size of a baseball in his chest. And as it happens, as I keep unloading, the gun still breaks and I'm still pulling the trigger.
Matt: (booming, gasping, coughing)
Taliesin: (yelling) You fool, your soul is forfeit! Die! Die! I'm going to look at the other two and start pulling out my bigger gun.
Matt: Make an intimidation check with advantage.
Taliesin: And putting on the fucking mask.
Matt: With a d6 inspiration dice.
Liam: Picked a bad day to do your job, son!
Taliesin: A d6 inspiration die?
Marisha: And advantage. With advantage and a d6.
Taliesin: Oh, this is embarrassing. 17, wait with intimidation, 19.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: Mask, gun, fuck it.
Matt: Standing there, smoking, giant hole, Tombstone style, in the center of his chest. There would be no dripping, except for the cauterization of the heat round that exploded in his chest and is a blackened, cinderous tube where once there was a chest cavity. The Broker (death rattle, thud) falls onto his back with a smoldering spiral of black smoke pouring forth from the chest wound on the ground. As you stare at the other two, screaming that out, you can see the old woman who's still on the ground. (panicked gasps) Looks extremely out of place and freaked out.
Sam: Sorry, Doris. You'd better just lie down.
Matt: The masked individual, from what you can tell behind the eyes of the mask, does not seem emotionally affected by this.
Taliesin: Also, just checking, does my glove still have a charge, by the way?
Matt: It may.
Taliesin: Okay. I mean, is there any indication, like it would have a slight glow to it.
Matt: There is a slight vibration. That ends your turn?
Taliesin: That is the end of my turn.
Matt: All right. The old woman gets up and is like, (panicked gasps).
Liam: (old lady voice) I feel happy. I feel alive.
Sam: You're in Atlantic City. Everything's okay.
Matt: As a bonus action, casts Misty Step and appearing 30 feet over here.
Travis: Do I get to swing?
Matt: No. Because Misty Step happens.
Travis: Damn Misty and her steps.
Matt: She stands up and vanishes in a swirl of vapor. She appears a little ways away in the field and immediately, (mumbles a spell).
Orion: Counterspell! 5th-level. Fuck it.
Matt: You would be able to, because it has been your turn, you would have your reaction back. So yes, you could. So go ahead and roll a d20.
Laura: Matt's like, damn you and your Counterspells. You're ruining my plan.
Orion: 23.
Matt: (laughs) So she (mumbles a spell, gasps). (laughter)
Travis: That's the best running I've ever seen! The little gait!
Matt: Tries to run away, the slippery wet grass, she slips a little bit as she's trying to get away now.
Laura: I feel bad for her.
Matt: That ends her turn. Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: Upon seeing Percy go absolutely insane and screaming "your soul is now forfeit," out of shock, my Anti-Life Shell dissipates, and I spend my action staring at him.
Matt: All right.
Liam: Wow. Going for the roleplay, not the damage.
Matt: The Broker's not getting a turn. Lillith, you're up.
Kit: Okay. I would like to use Animate Dead on the Broker, please.
Liam: (gasps) You nasty woman, you.
Laura: He's so happy about it.
Matt: You can begin using it, because it's a one-minute casting time. You have to get closer because you're probably a ways away.
Kit: Right. Okay.
Liam: You've got a naughty streak.
Kit: It's my family. I cannot help it.
Matt: We'll say, from there you begin concentrating on Animate Dead as you begin pulling through and speaking in guttural tones that have multiple layers of tonality and volume. It's this weird symphony of discordant voices as she begins to speak. You can see now the smoking, ruined body of the Broker begins to shift and twitch on its own. So that'll conclude your turn, Lillith. Vex and Tiberius, you guys are up.
Marisha: You've got asshole.
Laura: I'm going to attack him with a bow. I'm going to attack him with my Entangle arrow.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: All right.
Matt: The big guy?
Laura: Yeah. The guy in the mask. He's the only one left right? Oh, the old lady's still running away? All right, I'll attack the guy in the mask.
Liam: That old lady has to die!
Laura: That's a 28.
Matt: Yeah, that definitely hits.
Laura: All right, 15. Plus Entangle, whatever.
Matt: All right. Good to know. And so as you pull back the arrow and release it, there is that-- the way that you constructed it, there's just this pouch of very thick gooey-- is this the spell or is it the actual arrow constructed by Percy?
Laura: It's the arrow.
Matt: Right, the one that he built? So what happens is that the front of the arrow, it doesn't do any actual damage on the impact. Instead what it does is it, when it smacks into it, there's a pouch in the front that detonates from the impact and sends this very quick-setting tar, like glue substance. That just spatters across the body and lower torso, it expands like a foam. There's no damage on that one, but it's currently (grunts) grappled by it and cannot move from its place.
Laura: Awesome. And so I'll shoot another arrow at the other lady.
Matt: Okay. Go for it. Roll for an attack.
Laura: I know she's running away, but she's a bad guy. I didn't hit her, though.
Matt: What did you roll?
Laura: 16.
Matt: Heh. It's funny-- mages don't have a lot of armor. Even with mage armor, you manage to hit her square in the back. Go ahead and roll damage.
Laura: 16.
Matt: She goes (cries out) and stumbles, and catches herself and gets back up and you can see the arrow sticking straight up out of her back. Probably four inches into the back of her shoulder blade.
Marisha: This is becoming a Monty Python sketch.
Liam: (old lady voice) I feel fine. I feel happy.
Matt: Trinket growls (growls menacingly). She goes, (terrified shriek) and yelps out as the giant bear--
Travis: Will you start running for us again, please?
Matt: When we get to her turn. I'm saving it.
Laura: I'm going to command Trinket to run after her.
Matt: What's Trinket's movement?
Liam: This is like an afternoon at the gym for us.
Laura: I don't have any idea. I don't know.
Matt: Actually, I have it here. Trinket's movement is 40 feet. Okay, that's as far as Trinket can get right there. I have a little Trinket cheat sheet.
Taliesin: That is the tiniest cheat sheet ever.
Liam: Littlest character sheet ever. Can you hold that up again? Look how tiny it is! Aw, that big bear and that tiny piece of paper.
Matt: Okay, Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: Wait, the guy in the mask is prone?
Matt: The guy in the mask is currently grappled. His lower body is currently held in this weird tar-like substance. He's like, (grunts) trying to break free.
Sam: I only get one 6th-level spell but it says on Eyebite that every subsequent action, I can do it again.
Matt: You just choose somebody else to do it to, yeah.
Sam: I'm going to do it to her again. To the old lady again.
Matt: Let me see if you can. For another creature. But can't target a creature again-- oh, if it succeeded on a saving throw. You're right, so she can. So what do you want to do?
Laura: I think it's Tiberius's turn. He and I have the same initiative.
Matt: Oh, that's right, sorry about that.
Sam: Oh, are you going to hold?
Matt: So he waits for you to finish. But he can hold his turn.
Sam: I'll just run up, as far as I need to be within 60 feet and do it again to her.
Matt: Yeah, she's within range. And what're you doing?
Sam: Just fall asleep again. Back to sleep.
Matt: That is a 17. Nope. (panicked breathing) Falls asleep on the ground. With the arrow (arrow twang) right out of the back. And you acquiesce to Tiberius. It's your go.
Sam: Oh, and I'll inspire him. With a musical fart. (fart noise)
Orion: That was a wonderful toot, Scanlan!
Sam: Yes, thank you.
Matt: All right, d10 inspiration die. Tiberius, it's your go.
Orion: Where do I put this d10? Doesn't matter. Cool. I'm going to go as far as I can towards the old broad.
Marisha: We're focusing so much on this poor old woman and there's big intimidating--
Liam: Poor old woman? She's an evil mercenary. She deserves to be taken out!
Orion: He hasn't taken any damage, has he?
Matt: He's taken quite a bit of damage
Liam: Don't be ageist! That is an evil bitch! She needs to be killed.
Travis: Ageist?
Matt: All right, Tiberius, what're you doing? She's currently asleep on the ground. This guy's like, (grunts).
Orion: Am I within 60 feet of the old lady? That's pretty far still. Don't know whether I am or not.
Matt: Nope, she's just out of the range.
Sam: I've fallen, and I can't get up!
Orion: Okay. I am within 120 right? So what I'm going to do instead, is I'm going to look down and I'm going to pull out my Krull Blade and I'm going to throw it in the air and cast Telekinesis on it (spinning).
Matt: Okay. As you do it catches itself, spinning in the air up ahead of you, (spinning) this strange vibrating high-pitched whine sound as the blades are spinning in rapid circular motion.
Orion: And I'm going to go, (swishing) and I'm going to huck it at the chick.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and roll a spell attack roll.
Orion: That's 31.
Matt: Yeah. It's also a critical hit because she's currently asleep. So it's an auto-crit. So go ahead and roll 5d4. A d4 for each dagger on the spinning blade, spinning at high speed. Plus five. Or 5d4 times two plus five.
Marisha: 5d4 times two plus five?
Matt: Yep. So just roll 5d4 and then multiply everything by two.
Orion: Six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12, 13.
Matt: So 26 plus five is 31 points of damage. The unconscious woman face down on the ground, the blade tears through and grinds a large wedge out of her back. Spraying a bit of gore across the nearby grass. Thankfully, she was asleep, so she probably didn't feel it, it was so fast. But she is definitively gone.
Marisha: We are being sadistic today.
Orion: And I'll bring it back to me. I'll keep it hovering, maintain the spell. I'm going to bonus action Misty Step towards where Grog is. That's my turn.
Matt: I'll say for the sake of brevity at this point, because you have a glued guy, and the entire team pretty much at full health here, over time you all slowly gather around the guy who's glued to the ground. And he's fighting at first, (grunts) and you see he lowers his head, giving into his fate.
Orion: Smart to not test your fate, boy.
Travis: Lillith, can I go play t-ball with his head?
Liam: No. Let him live. Let this one live.
Travis: What, we're letting people live now?
Matt: At which point the head lifts he goes  "No. Kill me, give me honor. I have fallen."
Liam: Oh, I'm sorry I retract that.
Orion: Krull Blade in the neck.
Marisha: Oh you just elbowed me.
Liam: Did you just hit Keyleth's funny bone?
Marisha: Yes, right in the funny bone.
Orion: It's kind of funny.
Liam: Grog, will you kill this guy?
Kit: If honor is what he wants, do not give it to him. Let him live.
Laura: Ooh, I like it. I walk up and I take his mask off.
Matt: All right, you pull the mask off--
Liam: I know what to do-- Scanlan. This is your moment. Shit on his face.
Laura: No, that's disgusting!
Sam: Listen, that's not just something I can do whenever.
Liam: Who are you kidding?
Sam: I have to be in the mood, I need music, some nice lighting, I need to be wined and dined a bit.
Liam: My sister's right. Do it on his chest.
Matt: At which point, you pop the mask off, and from immediately beneath it reaches up and covers the face--
Sam: This is the Broker?
Laura: This is the masked guy.
Matt: You can the face beneath. It's humanoid, but right as you get past the nose and the mouth area, it's all melted, like a horrible acid burn. There's severe damage to the face. He looks at you and goes "Kill me. It's all I have."
Laura: Sorry, darling. You live.
Matt: (angry growl) And it's flexing and reaching out at you but it can't quite get the range. It's going to attempt to try to-- no it just cannot break free of that (strained grunts). As you're still concentrating on the spell, slowly the Broker steps up, the eyes rolled back and white, the giant wound in the chest, hobbles towards you.
Liam: It was almost my turn. Can I throw daggers at him?
Laura: No, she just reanimated him.
Liam: You reanimated him? Oh then, never mind. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Matt: As you pull your blade out, she commands and gives a hand motion, and the Broker hobbles towards her.
Kit: My sisters, they sent you? They are still hunting me?
Matt: You look down. The mark that was there on your chest has vanished. Upon the point of the Broker's death, whatever enchantment was placed upon you that was keeping you under his gaze was abolished.
Kit: Return to Palac Lusterka and present yourself to my sisters. Let them see what good it will do them to hunt me.
Matt: Turns around and starts shambling off.
Orion: Oh, wait a minute, hold on. And I as he's walking away, I'm going to loot that dude. Take shit off him. Come on. Hold on, let me take this.
Matt: There is a mostly ruined set of studded leather armor that is enchanted, plus one. It's basic, but it's need of serious repair as it currently has a large gaping hole in the chest area. And a shortsword. Plus-one Vicious Shortsword. As Tiberius is pulling everything off of the corpse as it's trying to shamble away into the distance. Eventually, this half-naked ruined body of this tiefling begins stepping off into the night.
Laura: What about the old lady? Do we get any loot off her?
Matt: (laughs) The old lady has mostly a basic wand. It's a plus-one wand.
Laura: Here's a wand. I toss it back to them.
Liam: Scanlan? Tibs? Who wants a wand?
Sam: I'll take it. All right.
Matt: Plus-one Wand of the War Mage.
Marisha: Plus-one Wand of the War Mage.
Matt: A simple Ring of Protection.
Laura: There's a ring. I take it, put it on. For the time being.
Matt: And about roughly 320 gold. Amongst the two of them. At this point in time, the other guy's exhausted himself now, just still in place. You see the Broker vanish into the shadows, heading southward.
Marisha: Shall we throw him in the pen with the other guy?
Orion: Hold on a second, why would we keep this one around to tell us now? What'd be the point? I will kill this man unless you give me a good reason not to.
Kit: I look at him and I ask, this? My sisters, they are responsible for this?
Matt: He gives you a look for a second. "I've been this my whole life. They gave me purpose. I follow them, and you've hurt the Mistresses."
Kit: That is true. I did do something similar to Bellenore's face. But they will not give you purpose. You are better out of their shadow. Trust me, I know. You should find better purpose for yourself. Go. Be free. I doubt that they will trouble you any more.
Matt: Make a persuasion roll.
Liam: Plus? Plus zero.
Sam: You still have my inspiration.
Laura: Inspiration! Plus ten!
Liam: (singing) Scanlan make you feel good.
Kit: 15?
Matt: 15. The tension in the muscles eventually relaxes, and the head hangs. "I know not for what reason I live."
Kit: You seem a capable fighter, yes? My cousin recently became member of the Slayer's Take in Vasselheim. Perhaps you would care to go find purpose in testing your skills there?
Laura: And if not there you can always fight in the Crucible.
Matt: (grunts)
Kit: They look for nothing but strength and honor.
Matt: At which point there's a large cracking sound as the hardened foam breaks from one leg. (grunts) Breaks the other leg free and stands there now before you.
Marisha: Your purpose in life is only what you make of it.
Sam: You can do anything. You could be President of the United States.
Orion: While this is going on, I'm writing on a piece of scroll right now. Which I give to him.
Matt: "I will walk, and I will think. Perhaps I will drown." And he turns and starts walking towards the shoreline on the other side to the west--
Taliesin: Lillith, does this mean you are free from those who are hunting you?
Kit: I'm very much afraid not. This is but one of the attempts my sisters have made to find me. However, I have no intention of returning to my home.
Marisha: And what was the name of your homeland again? It sounded very exotic.
Kit: Palac Lusterka is the seat of my family. We go back very long way. But I would not recommend that you visit there. It's not the most cheerful place.
Orion: Not tourist-friendly?
Kit: Not particularly welcome, no.
Laura: I've heard some terrible things about-- what is it, your father, is it? Or is it your uncle? Your uncle.
Kit: My family in general have interesting attitudes towards affection, shall we say. My sisters-- well, you see, I'm not particularly cut out for making a good first impression. However, my sisters did always tell me that what was inside was most important. They did tell me this as they were removing intestines to divine with them, so perhaps maybe not usual meaning of this phrase, but Zahra is perhaps the member of my family that I like best.
Laura: Understandably.
Marisha: We all have those.
Liam: All we care about is deeds. You've proven yourself to great depth today.
Kit: I believe in this circumstance I pale to my present company. I've heard many wonderful things about you from Zahra, and I'm honored to not only have met you, but also to have had your aid in this matter. I'm profoundly grateful. If there is ever any opportunity at which I can return the favor, I am not useful for much, but perhaps a little smoke and mirrors I can do.
Orion: I would actually like to know how you keep your horns so shiny and clean.
Matt: The cold wind picks up as the night air begins to darken, a distant storm blowing over the horizon to the northeast. The time draws late and cold.
Marisha: Lillith, would you like to stay the night before you move on?
Kit: If I would not put you at any--
Laura: Not even a little.
Marisha: Please, have dinner with us.
Kit: Then it would be my pleasure.
Laura: And we head back to the keep.
Marisha: And I go in the back into the garden, and I take the glissfoil out of my pocket that I was given, and I revive it from its dried state that it was given to me in, and plant it in the ground.
Matt: All right.
Liam: And as the twins are walking I say, clearly, I'm eating shit here today. I guess I'm going to make a promise not to stray from your side.
Laura: Remember that promise.
Liam: I promise.
Sam: I lick Tiberius. (laughter)
Orion: That's what that feels like.
Matt: That will be our freeze-frame credit high-five for the evening.
Travis: Nice job, Kit! (cheering)
Matt: Thank you so much, Kit, for guesting with us this evening, and for coming out and visiting us.
Kit: Thank you so much for having me. We've had an absolutely amazing week and-- oh, it's really nice to speak in my own accent again.
Taliesin: Your accent good. We enjoy.
Kit: Thank you. No, it's been absolutely amazing. It really has been an honor and you will definitely be seeing me again in LA, because this was wonderful. Thank you so much.
Travis: Yeah!
Laura: And everybody check her out on twitter.
Marisha: What's your twitter?
Kit: My twitter is AnemoneTea dot-- not even dot com, just AnemoneTea. It's that simple.
Matt: Travis and Laura have to run to catch a plane flight. You guys go, rock it out, safe flight. You guys are off to...?
Laura: A wedding. And our anniversary is tomorrow. (cheering)
Travis: But we got to go.
Matt: Go. Travel safe. Bye, guys.
Laura: I love you guys.
Liam: Can I hold your mug? I want to see what it feels like. Wow! Look at the size of that.
Sam: It's still got some booze in there, if you want to take a slurp.
Liam: Yes.
Matt: All right. As a note, just so you guys are aware, we had a contest yesterday about 5:30 in the afternoon during one of the streams. We had everyone who was currently present in the chat room be part of this random drawing, and the winner was a David Kingsbury, who won the opportunity to provide the name and essence of an NPC in our campaign. The Broker is actually their construction.
Kit: That's amazing!
Matt: The Broker was designed by one of our viewers, one of our Critters.
Taliesin: Thank you for the target practice.
Kit: Thank you so much!
Marisha: That is so cool.
Kit: That's amazing.
Matt: We're hoping to do stuff like that every now and then in the future to bring in some Critters to throw their creative mind in here and incorporate a character into our world. My heart's been going a mile a minute that entire game, because no DM wants to have to kill a player.
Marisha: I was on the verge of bawling my eyes out.
Liam: If I ever died, I thought-- and I still think I'll probably be the first-- but if I ever died, I thought it would be more like a bus accident. I would just go (impact) and that'd be it. I didn't think the doctor would look at me and say, I'm sorry, you have one week to live. And the whole week I've been sweating.
Matt: Yeah, it's pretty harsh. The internet was very vocal.
Liam: Yeah, thanks guys, for putting the pressure on.
Matt: Oh man. Well, that was awesome. [end of transcript]

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello, everyone, and welcome to this evening's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us voice actors get together and roll dice like we're awesome nerd people, which we are. So, welcome! We're going to do a couple quick announcements here before we kick things off. You want to go ahead and start?
Zac: Yeah, I'm that guy that you can't wait to stop talking so the show can get started. So guys, last week we hit 516 on the sub-train. Okay? And each week, in theory, should grow by itself because re-subs count. So basically, if we break 516 and make a new record, we will do a giant giveaway which includes everything from Heroclix to Steam keys to D&D schwag, books from Felicia, all sorts of stuff. It will be a giant box of wonderful Geek and Sundry-related stuff. So that is if we break 516, so there's a reason to keep that train alive, guys. We are also very close to hitting 10k. We are like 160 away from reaching 10,000 subscribers. How many? 154 away from hitting 10k. Now you guys may remember #noshavetil10k. I have not. If we hit 10k, right when we hit, a straw poll will be released into the chatroom, and you guys get to vote on what my face gets shaved into for the next week of programming on G&S. And it is very unfortunate that that's how we're going to do it. So tomorrow night on Gather Your Party, it will be Stef and Jessica's birthday, we're going to be throwing a birthday party, and I'm going to let them shave my face in whatever you guys vote on, as a birthday present to them.
Marisha: So many things.
Matt: The possibilities are endless.
Zac: Just saying that out loud honestly hurts me. A lot.
Matt: It is thick, too. You can get some nice dimension in there.
Zac: Great.
Liam: Words, shave words in--
Taliesin: You could build a bear in the beard.
Zac: I could build a bear. Yeah. Great.
Matt: Can we shave off bits and then re-apply them to other parts of the face?
Zac: If you want to wear them, yeah!
Matt: Okay! I might do that, yeah.
Zac: And then this weekend, Nerdist is running a 24-hour livestream for Extra Life. You guys may recognize some of the faces that stop by. They are going to be streaming from our set. So, let's welcome them. We'll be hosting it, but I encourage you guys all to head over to Nerdist, twitch.tv/nerdist. This weekend it'll be Saturday from 9AM to 9PM Pacific Standard Time. I will be there the whole time helping out, as well as some of our other Geek and Sundry hosts. So you guys should check that out and help them be part of our team, raising money for Extra Life. And Matt, I wanted to thank you for helping us make Battle of the Bands a success last week. We all know that the voting was rigged and that's why your team won, but it was a valiant effort nonetheless. And if you guys enjoyed that, you should tweet at Geek and Sundry's twitter and let them know, and we will try to do things like that for you more in the future. That's pretty much all I have. Let's get to 10k and get this stupid stuff off my face.
Matt: Thank you very much, Zac. Speaking of shaving, let me take a moment here to mourn the Mercer-beard. Those who saw on twitter. I was trying to hold off until 10k and Halloween for my costume, but due to work, had to shave it as of last night. So, I apologize. I'm in mourning. So please bear with me for this evening, going forward. Couple announcements. Critical Role-related: we have a lot of our party in transit right now. Laura and Travis just flew in from Toronto and will probably be a little bit late to the game. Sam is currently heading here from a session and will get here as soon as possible. Unfortunately, Orion will not be joining us again this evening, but hope to have him back next week for Halloween. So, things will get rolling as they arrive. Thankfully, we're at a situation in the game where I don't think it'll be too halting. We shall see. Next announcement, we're putting out Critical Role thematic playlists. All the players have put together playlists of Spotify songs that they feel encapture aspects of their character and their character's journeying as Vox Machina and in the world of Exandria. So those will be releasing every week, starting tonight at 8PM with Percy, I believe. So Taliesin's playlist will be up available on Geek and Sundry's website and--
Taliesin: Dropping mad jams-- I'm not.
Marisha: They're mad, you're allowed.
Taliesin: I'm going to show you some music.
Marisha: It's good. Go download Spotify right now, so you can go, if you haven't. It's free!
Matt: There you go.
Taliesin: It's cancer. It's been a weird weeknight.
Marisha: It has. It's been a long day.
Taliesin: I had a strange day. I've infected friends with Spotify now.
Matt: As you should. Infecting friends is fun. Couple other things. For those who haven't seen it already, the D&Diesel videos went up earlier this week, where we had the wonderful chance-- for me, at least-- to Dungeon Master for a half an hour for Vin Diesel, along with Travis and Laura, and Jessica and Dan of Nerdist ilk. Had a great time, so hopefully you liked it, and if you'd like to see more stuff like that, hopefully we'll have more things coming up in the future in that vein, because we had a good time. Also, along with that, I released my Witch Hunter class, which was a customized 5th edition class that I designed after I ran that game, based on the character I created for Vin. It went up on the website, untested. Feedback is always welcome, and I will be updating it on the website as feedback comes in and balancing is tweaked for it. But have at it, have fun, hope you guys enjoy it. I had a good time creating it, and it's a good time. Also, just a reminder to you guys: our official Critical Role t-shirts are available on the Geek and Sundry website store if you want to wear any of the awesome red shirts that we've shown on the show with our full-on Critical Role logo. Shown in an exemplary dark, fine ink. Those are available for purchase.
Marisha: And keychains.
Taliesin: What if, due to some strange third-arm syndrome, I can't wear t-shirts; is there any way I can show my support to the show?
Matt: Yes, you can. We have necklaces and keychains with our logo as well. Also available on the store. So, you're welcome to check those out.
Taliesin: With my third arm, I need necklaces and keychains.
Liam: Three-armed shirts are coming in 2016.
Matt: Yeah, three-armed shirts will be on the docket. Thank you, Liam, I was trying to get to that.
Marisha: There's a new shirt up. I didn't know that.
Matt: We have a new shirt up?
Offscreen: How do you want to do this.
Matt: We have it up?! This is good news to know. We have now up on the store our official "How do you want to do this" shirt as well. So you can go check that out on the shop. Prepare for the holiday season with your Christmases and your Chanukahs and your Critmases and all that fun stuff to make people look as nerdy as we are. Which is I think part of my goal, personally, through world domination. (laughter)
Matt: Maybe not Liam. Everyone but Liam can look weird. There's no way to help you.
Liam: Can I just interject for a second only because I'm hot as hell. I just want to thank @pupgames on twitter for making me this fabulous stealthy cloak. I'm going to take it off in about two minutes, because it's more t-shirt weather here in the studio. So I'll just let everybody bask in the glow of my absence of light for two minutes, and then I'm going to switch to t-shirt mode.
Taliesin: You're so stealthy.
Marisha: Where'd Liam go?
Matt: It's mysterious.
Marisha: Holy shit.
Matt: All righty. Also, our cast interviews on the Geek and Sundry website are almost over. Orion's went up today and those will be finishing up shortly.
Marisha: But we have Spotify lists to replace them.
Matt: Yep, Spotify lists coming up.
Marisha: So there's still more content.
Matt: If you've missed any of the cast interviews, they're all available on the website. So feel free to check them out.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: Marisha, you wanted to follow up on the 826LA news you had.
Marisha: Yes. 826LA, they're in a campaign right now for-- let me try to get all this right-- for LA 2050 which is a big contest that's sponsored by Goldhirsh, right now, and it's all for sponsoring education and a brighter future for Los Angeles. So 826LA and Young Storytellers are actually partnering together, and they're in this contest right now. You have to go vote, and they could potentially win $100,000. Which: awesome. And we've got Critters. I think they'll win. So you have to go vote. I tweeted the link, so the mods, go find it on my twitter, or you can just search #LA2050, and you should be able to find it. So, yeah, go vote.
Matt: Team Hooman, Critters, come up there and make this happen.
Marisha: Also, they just announced they're going to be opening an 826LA-- sorry, not 826LA, but an 826 in San Francisco!
Matt: Awesome!
Taliesin: Another 826 in San Francisco?
Marisha: Oh, is there another, I guess so.
Taliesin: Yeah, because there's one there--
Marisha: They might be opening a second one.
Taliesin: They might be opening-- that would make sense.
Marisha: I think they said they announced they're opening one. I think.
Taliesin: I'm retweeting you right now.
Marisha: Okay. Taliesin's retweeting me.
Matt: So there you go. Follow either of their twitters to get the information.
Marisha: But, go vote. Help them win 100k.
Matt: All right, Taliesin, you wanted to mention something about Tara's--
Taliesin: I do! Tara Platt, who is a wonderful friend of the show and amazing voice actress and extremely fabulous in many different ways; she's a sky pirate, she does all sorts of crazy stuff. She's got an Indiegogo for an interactive book called, and I'm hoping I pronounce this right, Zartana. You should check it out, it's really cool, it's really pretty and beautiful. It's got a very Stardust-y vibe. I've already picked up my copy. So you should go, there's just a couple days left, just hop in and grab a copy for yourself. It's going to be really exciting. And--
Marisha: Yeah, it's like about a g*psy girl, and it's got a bunch of recipes, and it teaches you how to make a bow, and has herb cards and all sorts of cool stuff. I was into it immediately.
Taliesin: For the cool child in your life this Christmas. This would be for the kid who needs something that's not quite outdoors, but not quite a video game.
Marisha: Zartana.
Taliesin: Zartana.
Matt: There you go.
Taliesin: Also, I will be in OniCon in Galveston, Texas over Halloween. So, if you're in Galveston, Texas and it's Halloween, and you want to go to an anime con, I'll be there. And I'll be in costume, and it will be pretty hilarious.
Marisha: And last, but not least, last Thursday while we were here, looking at dead versions of ourselves hanging from a tree, Super Power Beat Down won a Geekie!
Liam: Oh! Mazel tov!
Marisha: Yeah, glad I came here instead of going to the award show. Totally worth it. But we won a Geekie. So, I thought I should say that.
Liam: Well-earned.
Marisha: Thanks.
Liam: You nerd.
Matt: Good on you.
Taliesin: You should wear it like bling. Get a chain for it. That'd be great.
Marisha: Just, once again, like, it-- No.
Taliesin: No. No, never mind.
Matt: All righty, any other announcements anyone needs to make?
Taliesin: God damn it, it keeps happening.
Liam: I'm good.
Matt: All righty. Well then, let us go ahead and get ourselves tuned in for tonight's episode of Critical Role. [dramatic music]
Matt: And welcome back. So, everyone, our Sam arrived--
Sam: Samurai?
Taliesin: Samurai?
Matt: We have our samurai! Laura and Travis are in transit, they'll be here as soon as they-- (thump from Sam's mug)
Matt: Well played. So. To give us a little overview of the current story. Two nasty individuals known as the Briarwoods, Lord and Lady Briarwood, have, for the past five years, been occupying the city of Whitestone, which was once the home to Percival here, after it was forcefully taken from his family, most of which seemingly have been either killed or lost in the process, and he was scattered to the four winds to find Vox Machina. After encountering the Briarwoods in Emon in a scuffle that took place, the Briarwoods retreated to Whitestone, inviting the party to come and say hello. Since then, the party has prepared the best they could, made their way towards Whitestone, and, through some bit of infiltration and subterfuge, managed to sneak into the city itself. They, under the guise of Scanlan's Seeming illusion, appeared to be as common folk as the rest of the poor saps that still live in Whitestone. They scoped out an abandoned tavern, which they fitted to their needs as a base of operations, and also managed to come across a central portion of Whitestone's city structure and history, known as the Sun Tree, a tree once risen to the might of the god of the sun, Pelor, now lies dead in the center of town, and from it hung eight figures that appear to have been individuals killed, hung, and painted up and dressed to resemble Vox Machina as essentially a warning, or a welcome. It's hard to tell when it comes to the Briarwoods. Nevertheless, a message was definitely delivered. The party, retreating back to the tavern, set up for the remainder of the afternoon. Keyleth carved, through her druidic magical ways, through the ground to find some of the roots of the Sun Tree, and began preparing an extensive, time-consuming ritual in hopes of restoring some semblance of life to the entity itself. That is where we left off. While the rest of you have been going about your preparations for the rest of the afternoon as this ritual for Keyleth is an eight-hour ritual and it begun in the early afternoon around 2:00, so this will conclude by around sundown, a little past sundown. While she is down there, essentially meditating with the barren roots of the Sun Tree, is there anything you guys would wish to do, or are you just waiting for her to complete her ritual?
Taliesin: Well, there are options.
Sam: What do we need? We have to get water, right? There was some issue about-- we don't have any water, do we?
Taliesin: Was that an issue?
Sam: I don't remember. There was some wells around.
Marisha: Can I do a few checks while I'm preparing the ritual to see if this is a curse over this tree?
Matt: Go ahead and make a religion check, I guess.
Marisha: Not great. Hang on, my ring of protection is in the way. Nine.
Matt: Nine. Honestly, it's hard to tell if it's a curse, the tree itself is just dead. You are very well-connected with the natural essences of the world, the life essence of plants and natural growth. All of your interactions with the Sun Tree are devoid of any response. It seems dead where it stands. But, as you continue your ritual--
Marisha: God, I hope this works.
Matt: Anyone else have anything they want to do?
Liam: Well, couple of things. Grog and I were keeping watch. I forget, one of us was on the first floor and one's on the second. I'm just going to say that I was on the second for now. Because I can't remember. It's probably wrong. I'm going to take all daggers out of my Blinkback Belt except for the Keen Dagger and replace them with wooden stakes that I purchased. And I'm going to spend an hour or so, whatever it takes to-- I've got partial gloves on; I'm going to take that symbol of Sarenrae and I'm going to take as much time as it needs to sew it so that it is fixed firmly to the back of my right hand. I tell Grog that I'm going to go down below and check, and I follow the path all the way down to find-- I think everyone else is down there.
Sam: Oh hi, Vax.
Liam: I step over Scanlan's head and I kneel down by Keyleth and gently place a hand on her shoulder and say: What do you need? What can I get?
Marisha: I don't really know. I don't know if this is going to work, to be totally honest. The tree is dead. Do you have any of that holy water?
Liam: I got holy oil. Not water.
Marisha: Do I have holy water? I don't know if I took one or not. I can't remember.
Matt: If you didn't write it down, it's not in your inventory.
Marisha: I'm pretty good about that. I don't think I took one.
Taliesin: In the meantime, there are options.
Liam: I got two. I remember it. It was two vials of holy oil. I gave one to my sister, and I have the other. If you think it will help, you take it.
Marisha: Okay.
Liam: Do you need me to get water?
Marisha: Yeah, let's get some water.
Matt: Yeah, because as you guys went through the tavern, you found there was no actual water. There was old ale. There were still a few casks of wine. Stuff that was abandoned when whoever previously was the owner of this tavern either left Whitestone or fell to a worse fate. But there was no plain water to drink.
Liam: I'm going to go out into the street. I'm going to find water.
Taliesin: I can show you where there's water.
Sam: What?
Taliesin: I lived here my whole life.
Sam: Are you guys disguised?
Liam: Yeah, we all are.
Matt: They're still technically under your Seeming spell, for the next few hours, at least.
Marisha: Yeah, we cannot let that go.
Sam: Does that have a range? No, it just lasts.
Matt: As far as I know, it lasts just for an eight-hour period. I'll double-check.
Liam: Percival, do you want to come upstairs to the window, and--
Sam: I'm coming.
Liam: Oh, you're coming, too? All right. You're my son, let's go. (laughter)
Matt: Yeah, it lasts for eight hours and allows you to change the appearance of--
Sam: Great. We're still peasants.
Marisha: Remember, we also have Heroes' Feast up.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Sam: Oh, okay.
Marisha: Advantages on wisdom throws and whatnot.
Taliesin: Hit point bonus, advantage on wisdom throws--
Marisha: Yeah. 2d10 hit points. Max hit points.
Taliesin: I have my advantages still. So I'm going to lead them to the closest well.
Matt: Okay. Stealthily?
Marisha: I'm going to start-- I've kind of cleared out around the roots.
Matt: It's a lot. It's earth and then giant roots from a very large tree that go past. You aren't at the bottom of the roots. You've met the roots as you were carving through. They go even deeper than where you are right now.
Marisha: Yeah. Can I start carving a little ravine around it for where we're going to start pouring the water?
Matt: If you've already started the eight-hour process of the secondary spell, you would not be able to really interrupt that to be able to continue another spell you've been doing. I could say that you did that as part of your preparation for the roots. That's fine. That's fine. It'd be a small ravine, because you also don't want to--
Marisha: Damage anything.
Matt: You continue your ritual. The rest of you make your way out the same window that you entered, into the alleyway, following Percival. You lead them to the back of the tavern into one of the large alleyways between this chunk of the city. You find there was a grassy area; most of the grass here has turned gray and brittle, as it is starting to push towards the winter months. And even for the daytime, the temperature is pretty chilly. It's probably around 50 or so degrees, 55. Fahrenheit, for our un-American friends. Eventually, you make your way to the nearest well that you've been to. And there is a bucket there. It looks like it has gathered some dust and some cobwebs. You get the bucket, and you let it down, and eventually it finds its way into the water. It's pretty deep before it hit the water. You don't know if it's been just, like, water level, or if this particular well itself is drying up. But you manage to get a bucket up, and you pull it up and check it and it looks clear. You take the water back with you to the tavern. Seemingly uneventful. You guys have managed to stay far enough out of sight. Nothing seems to caught your attention.
Sam: Okay. Should we scout around and see if there's anything else around the hideout that we should be aware of, or any other hiding places, or safehouses?
Liam: I feel like we should probably bring a little more water than one bucket. So we should spend a little bit of time doing that. But maybe my sister and I can have a look around, see if there's anything that we've missed. Outside.
Taliesin: Well, here's the question. There's three lordly houses that we have to avoid at all costs, for now. There's a few shops that if we feel might be in our best interest to scout out. I know where an old weapons depot used to be. We could check the temples to maybe see if we could maybe find some support to begin with.
Liam: Do we trust anyone here?
Sam: We need friends.
Taliesin: There might be people I trust.
Sam: Is there a central meeting place?
Taliesin: There's a temple.
Sam: Is that a place where you can really chat up brand new people? Or is there a pub? I guess it's not really a pub town, is it?
Taliesin: It's not a pub town. And it's a place where you don't necessarily chat up new people, but maybe find some old ones.
Sam: Okay. We could go there.
Liam: Percival, we're on your turf, so I'll follow your lead.
Taliesin: (sighs) If we have just enough time, I'd like to try to go to the temple and the cemetery. Leave, maybe Grog and Vex to guard Keyleth.
Matt: Okay. So, Keyleth, you're staying behind to finish the ritual?
Marisha: I'm doing what I do best. And I focus all my energy on this thing.
Matt: There are two temples in here. There's the temple to Pelor, which is known as the Zenith. Within the graveyard.
Taliesin: Yes, the Zenith is the one I wanted to go to.
Sam: What's the other one?
Taliesin: The other one is called The Lady's Chamber. It's a temple of Erathis.
Sam: That sounds fun.
Taliesin: I don't know anybody there.
Sam: I might!
Taliesin: That's what I'm afraid-- they might know you, so no.
Matt: So the Lady's Chamber, the temple to Erathis, is more central to the city and is partially a courtyard, partially a half-dome amphitheater place of worship. You guys make your way through the city. I'll have you all roll stealth checks if you could.
Sam: We're not trying to hide, are we?
Matt: Well, if you're not trying to hide, then make deception checks instead.
Taliesin: Awesome possum.
Sam: I rolled an 18 for something.
Liam: Can I choose to hide instead of deceive?
Matt: If you'd like to.
Liam: Yeah, I'll hang a little bit back from them.
Taliesin: I was trying to be stealthy, as well.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: Although I'm fine either way. 23.
Sam: I'm better deceiving.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: 26.
Matt: So we have two folks staying to the shadows, best they can in broad daylight in a clustered city. And one child-looking pauper of a boy wandering through the city alone towards the graveyard. As you guys make your way through, staying off to the side, jumping, or running through buildings and staying off the main path, you walk along the central road to the far eastern side of Whitestone. A few folks come out during the day, some are carrying bundles of textile goods. There's one guy that has a small cart, and it looks like he's bringing tools and stuff either to or from a store of some kind. Gives you a curious look as if he hasn't seen you before but doesn't seem to--
Sam: G'day, sir!
Matt: "G'day!" And just keeps rolling along, the wheels squeaking as he pushes up the road.
Sam: I wish I had a yo-yo.
Taliesin: How about a wheel and stick?
Sam: Oh, the wheel and stick would be good.
Matt: Eventually, you guys make your way to the far eastern side of Whitestone. This is where the boundary wall that surrounds most of the city from a defensive standpoint lies. There is the multiple exit points throughout this wall. You dart around the outskirts of it, being careful to avoid the pattern of the undead giants that are slowly stomping through the city, like these hulking sentinels that walk in a perpetual pattern through the town. You follow the winding path through the thick woods, just on the outside of the wall of the city itself. You sticking to the path in your open way, or do you want to join them in the side of the forest?
Sam: Well, I've got to stick with them, I guess, although I like being a young peasant boy. It's kind of fun. All right, I'll go with them.
Matt: All right. So the three of you dart off into the woods, skirting the outside of the road, but making your way following it to the outside of the graveyard itself. Eventually, you come to the outside of the graveyard. Large iron fence that marks the outside of it. It's rusted from time, small spikes mark the very top of it, about six feet tall, and the gate itself is partially open. With a little bit of breeze that's blowing through, very, very cold breeze that blows through this part of the forest, it's opening a little bit, and (creak) against itself. You push through the gate--
Liam: Wait a minute, nope. Let me look. I'm just going to move in, ten feet ahead, and see what I see.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: That is a 23 for perception.
Matt: Okay. You skirt up and look inside. And there's a handful of trees in little clusters here and there, but for the most part this old graveyard is flat land, with just stones set up throughout. The older stones have very little rhyme or reason to their placement. They're sporadically thrown around, fresher ones tend to be more clustered with family names. This definitely looks like something that was put here when the town was founded and has been slowly expanded over time, and it's not uniform.
Liam: I hiss back at Percy  is this the way to your temple?
Taliesin: (whispers) Yes.
Liam: Through here?
Taliesin: Yes.
Matt: You do see, a little ways ahead in the center of this open barren area, there is a stone temple that has, from what little you can see, a bit of stained glass pattern to it.
Liam: Do we knock?
Sam: Is it safe? Should we go up?
Taliesin: We go up to the doors, and give it a tug.
Matt: Okay. Percy walks up to the doors.
Liam: Well, all right.
Taliesin: This is my neighborhood. I feel comfortable.
Matt: Okay. You--
Sam: All right, Papa, let's go.
Matt: You go to the doors of the temple, the large wooden doors. In them are carved this flaming wreath into the wood. It looks almost like the outer ring of the classical depiction of a sun and going across the sky where you can see the waving flames licking the sides of the actual doors. And it is a double door. As you tug on the handle at the front, it gives very little to you. You give a little more of a tug on it, not enough to gather attention, just enough to really see if it's just stuck, or if it's locked. And it appears that the doors are not opening.
Liam: And I look--
Sam: This is what he does!
Liam: It is what I do. This is an old, old type of lock, hold on.
Matt: There is no lock, actually.
Liam: There's no lock? Oh, but I rolled a natural 20. Does that help? Let me get through the door?
Taliesin: Suddenly, a lock appears! Utterly pickable! (laughter)
Marisha: Utterly pickable! It's the most pickable lock I've ever seen!
Matt: There is no lock. It is barred from the other side. There is some heavy wooden plank that is currently set on the other side of the door.
Liam: Oh, where's Grog when you need him?
Matt: So, with your expertise in these sort of circumstances, you know that with the proper placement of a long blade and enough strength and weight put at the right fulcrum point, you can probably shimmy it off, and it may take a little bit of teamwork to do so.
Liam: Okay who's got a-- mine are all very small. Do you have a shortsword?
Sam: Everything I have is short. I can just go in there and open it from the inside.
Liam: Oh, right. I always forget.
Sam: It's not concentration, so I can just jump in there.
Matt: Essentially.
Liam: Don't fuse with a church pew.
Matt: If you're referring to a Dimension Door--
Sam: Correct. It's not concentration, I don't think.
Matt: No, it is not concentration.
Liam: More of a sneeze.
Matt: You can visualize it. It doesn't have to be a place you have seen yet.
Sam: I can say I want to go ten feet in that direction.
Matt: Yep.
Sam: Before I do, why are we trying to get in here? I thought it was to meet people. I don't think there's anyone in there.
Taliesin: I would like to find out what happened.
Sam: Okay, good enough for me. I go in.
Matt: Okay. (spoof) With a burst of dark purplish energy, Scanlan steps through the door, leaving no mark or trace behind. On the other side you hear this muffled (spoof) as he reappears on the opposite side, completing his transition. You appear now in the central worship hall of the Zenith temple. To each side of you, you can see there are windows, about ten foot wide, stained glass windows, about every ten feet around this pattern, it looks like three to each side. There are pews set up for the masses to come and sit and worship, but a lot of the pews have been pushed off to the side, set astray, some have been destroyed and ruined. There's a pile in the corner of a number of sundered and tattered pews. There is a red carpet that marks the center that goes all the way to what looks like a raised altar on the opposite side of the room. You can see that some of the stained glass further down has been shattered and broken, and a little bit of sunlight creeps through. You can see there is on the altar a large stone platform. It's hard to see from this distance. Make a perception check.
Liam: (muffled) Scanlan! Open the door.
Sam: We do have earrings. 17.
Matt: There appears to be something on the the altar in the distance, small and scattered about it, but from this distance, it's hard to make out the details. But you hear Vax muffled through the door.
Sam: All right, how big is this thing that's keeping the door shut?
Matt: It's about eight feet wide and about a foot-- eight feet long, about a foot wide and about six inches thick. A big old piece of wooden board.
Sam: A couple hundred pounds?
Matt: I would say it probably weighs about 40 or 50 pounds.
Sam: 40 or 50 pounds?!
Matt: It's wood. It's porous.
Sam: And how high off the ground? Could I touch it?
Matt: You could touch it. It gets to about your head, a little higher.
Sam: All right. I'm going to try and lift it off.
Matt: Go ahead a make a strength check. Athletics! Make this athletics.
Sam: Athletics? Hmm. Not good. 12!
Matt: (grunting) From this position, it's not even budging.
Liam: All right, Scanlan, step back from the door a couple of paces. I'm going to stick a blade through the door.
Sam: It's not going to do much. There's a big heavy thing.
Liam: I'm going to hold on one side, you're going to hold on the other, and we'll do it together. Percy, can I borrow your blade?
Taliesin: I've never used this. I've had it since I created the character and I've never used this blade once. This is the most use it's ever gotten. I pull out this pristine piece of shit (laughs) I don't even remember. I think I found it in a dungeon. It's terrible.
Matt: What is it?
Taliesin: It's a boarding sword, it was one of those little curved swords.
Matt: Right. A scimitar or falchion.
Taliesin: A scimitar. But short. It was nothing, it was terrible.
Liam: It's all we need.
Taliesin: Yeah so. Get it in there.
Liam: Scanlan, grab some rags or something, wrap it around the blade. You're going to lift on your side; we're going to lift on this side.
Sam: I get the sharp side?!
Liam: I can't get the handle through the crack in the door.
Sam: All right. I feel like there's some sort of spell I could use. All right, let's just do it your way.
Liam: Got that Bigby's Hand, is that what you're saying?
Sam: Yeah, I've got a million things I could do.
Taliesin: Are any of them concentration spells?
Sam: Bigby's is probably concentration, but I've also got a potion of strength.
Matt: As a note, Seeming isn't concentration.
Sam: I thought it was.
Matt: No. You cast it and it lasts for eight hours. You don't need to worry about that.
Sam: No, I want to follow this through.
Taliesin: Let's keep going.
Liam: All right. Can we lift it together?
Matt: (laughs) We can try. All right, so. This is going to be the three of you as a skill challenge, I want all three of you to roll. Not athletics, just a straight strength roll.
Taliesin: One, two, three.
Matt: Add your strength modifier.
Taliesin: 16!
Sam: Plus strength. 12. (laughter)
Sam: Wait, did you get a four? Four? We are the worst! We are the weakest ones. Oh, I cut my hand!
Matt: Which is exactly what happens.
Taliesin: Bigby's Hand? Bigby's Hand!
Liam: Bigby's Hand? Bigby's Hand!
Sam: I'm going to take damage.
Matt: Yeah. First and foremost, you take four points of slashing damage to your hand. You pull back, and there is a line of blood now, beginning to drip off your hand. You shake it amongst yourself.
Sam: Oh, I can't say "God damn it" in here. I'm in Pelor's-- Sorry, Pelor.
Taliesin: Let's use a sword, I want to see how this plays out.
Sam: God bless you. Gesundheit, Pelor. Man, all right. Well, jeez Louise.
Liam: Whip out the purple hand, man!
Sam: Seems like overkill. What about a Thunderwave? Can I do that?
Matt: Certainly.
Sam: All right. Does it only affect living things? Or does it affect--
Liam: Wait. Scanlan, are there any windows in there?
Sam: There are. There are windows. Good call.
Matt: It's a blast of thunderous energy in an area, it would affect living and nonliving matter, yes.
Liam: Hold on, this is stupid.
Sam: Are you sure?
Taliesin: We are going to the window. We are going to the window.
Sam: No, let's carry this out.
Taliesin: No! We are going to the window. Please do not destroy the temple of Pelor.
Sam: Three hours later, we are still trying to open the door.
Marisha: It's not even locked. It's just heavy.
Sam: I can Bigby's Hand. I'll just Bigby's Hand.
Liam: Which way to the window? I can walk to the window.
Sam: It's up there. You can make it, but Percy can't.
Liam: I can probably lift that door bar from inside.
Sam: You could, probably.
Liam: With your help, son.
Sam: Yeah, but I could blast it. Would be very dramatic.
Liam: Let's save that for important stuff. All right, where is the window? Which way do I go?
Sam: To the right and up.
Matt: There are windows shattered on both sides. They're broken a little higher up. So you could either continue to break the bottom part of the window, or just attempt to leap through the hole.
Liam: Yeah, I'll attempt to leap.
Matt: Okay, so give me an acrobatics check.
Liam: All right.
Sam: The saga of the door!
Marisha: It's just a door, you guys! It's just a door.
Liam: 25.
Matt: 25. You get a running start, leap off the side and parkour up between the actual-- there is an extension to the side where another room is attached on each side of the temple towards the back. You leap off that wall onto the small pillar that's holding the side of the window and up through the broken portion of the stained glass, landing, three-point landing, on the inside. You almost land in one of the shattered piles of wooden pews and splinters and jagged pieces of wood sticking out of it. About a foot away from you, and you are like, "Oh, that was close." You see Scanlan across the way. You see the altar to your right.
Sam: Hey! Oi! Your stupid idea cut my hand!
Liam: Builds character. I'm going to stay away from the altar and skirt the wall all the way around it. Mat: Okay, you get to the door.
Liam: I'm going to try to help. Do you want to help me lift this thing?
Sam: With my good hand, yes.
Matt: Have both you guys make strength checks.
Sam: You know what, I'm going to get some assistance. I call my Unseen Servant to assist.
Matt: (laughs) Okay.
Sam: He is going to lift with us.
Matt: With a brief burst of wind energy, a shimmering form, somewhat humanoid in shape, but still amorphous appears.
Sam: Hi, Darrell.
Matt: (wind sounds) and begins to shove itself up against the bottom of the wooden bar. Make your check, as well.
Sam: That was a six. Is that for me?
Matt: That's for you, and then roll and add five for your Unseen Servant.
Sam: So, five extra to that is 11. Right? No?
Matt: Roll again, add five.
Sam: Oh, I see. Four. So that's a nine.
Matt: The three of you, one mystically summoned from a plane beyond your own, cannot seem to budge this single wooden door! You've defeated beholders. You've slaughtered illithid underneath, in the Underdark, deep in the belly of the planet. But this door bests you!
Marisha: Man, Laura and Travis ain't missing shit!
Sam: All right, I'm doing it. Step back!
Liam: Whip out the hand!
Sam: All right, I summon Bigby's Hand! The mightiest hand that will ever unlock a door, ever! (singing) Bigby's Hand!
Matt: This giant, glimmering, purple fist appears in your vicinity. It grabs the bottom. Go ahead and roll a d20.
Liam: Come on.
Sam: 12.
Matt: Plus eight to it.
Sam: Plus eight? 20!
Taliesin: How do you want to do this?
Matt: With its finger, just goes (ping) and it (thudding noises). The door (creak) opens up and Percy stands there, looking not very happy.
Taliesin: Was it overkill? Because really it took that.
Sam: It took three spells to open this door! Three spells!
Taliesin: It's not overkill if you used what it took.
Sam: Three spells and I injured myself.
Taliesin: We took damage from an inanimate object. Oh god! Get it out of our system now!
Sam: Welcome, Percy.
Taliesin: Oh god! All right, I'm looking around, taking in the damage. Anything that I notice is particularly out of whack from the last time I was here? Other than they're upgrading the locks, apparently.
Matt: Looking about the place, it looks pseudo-ransacked. There has been much force used in whatever destroyed these pews. The glass that was broken, was broken from the outside in. So, definitely seems like there was someone throwing a rock through, or a intrusion from an outside standpoint. As you walk further and look around, the two rooms to the side, the doors are closed. There is the altar on the top, and you do see, there is a couple of small sacks, laid to the side of the altar. What looks to be some low-lit candles, and there are some braziers. One to each side of the altar, and one against each wall. All of them appear to be long dark and out. Go ahead and make a perception check.
Sam: All of us?
Matt: All of you.
Sam: 15.
Taliesin: 15.
Matt: You both, as you approach the far side of the temple towards the altar, you notice the brazier to the right is smoldering ever so gently. Just a very faint glow of ember to it.
Liam: What's the matter?
Taliesin: Reynal?
Sam: Who? Reynal?
Taliesin: Father Reynal? (louder) Father Reynal? Let's check one of the doors. We'll start on the door on the right.
Matt: You step up. You can see now, on top of the altar, there appears to be a couple of glass vials that are overturned, a little liquid spilled. You can see bits of broken glass across the bottom, the one step that leads down from the altar's raised platform.
Taliesin: Can I dip and smell?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Taliesin: 13.
Matt: 13? Okay. Looking at just the general vicinity of the altar. You taste the liquid. It's definitely somewhat caustic in nature, you can't really determine it. But, just touching it to your tongue, your tongue goes numb for a second and you feel a slight burn. Your nostrils clear out a little bit from the scent. There is some random powders and such that've been brushed off. You get the feeling that the way that all this was treated, it wasn't so much like it was destroyed more than it was hastily packed up. Roll a perception check.
Taliesin: 20.
Matt: 20? Okay, looking about the outside of the altar, you do notice that around the brazier that is slightly smoldering there is a layer of ash there, gathered on the inside of the brazier and a little bit on the floor, around its base.
Sam: Okay.
Taliesin: Someone has been working on something in here.
Sam: It couldn't just be ash from the thing that is burning?
Matt: If you look at the other braziers, there is no ash around it. Most of the ash is contained. The wood ash itself tends to fall; it's a little heavier. This seems to be a lighter shade of ash and it's more of a-- has found its way out of the brazier from just the heat and the air.
Taliesin: I want to smell the ash. Does it smell like some sort of-- is it perfumed?
Matt: You lean down and you take some of the ash in your fingers and smell it. It's not perfumed, but you've had some experience with dealing with various burning materials: this is definitely paper-based ash. You do also notice underneath the brazier there is one sliver of paper that was not wholly burned.
Sam: Paper.
Marisha: (whispering) Paper.
Sam: It's a golden ticket.
Taliesin: "Without sufficient magical essence the distillation is proven to consistently fail. A shame, really. I shall seek an influx of materials elsewhere before I can continue this project. Regarding the weapon, after a year of taking notes from eyewitness accounts, my original designs were faulty and recently cost me my hand. The wind of fortune has seen a shift it seems as Sylas just returned from Emon, having encountered the still-living subject, and had the pleasure of seeing his work first-hand. His unnatural eyes took in much detail. I believe his observations have brought me to the brink of finishing my design. I intend to journey from Whitestone within a couple of months to gather the components needed. But, if Delilah's hunch is correct, the subject is heading here. I may find myself needing to leave sooner than anticipated."
Liam: They're trying to copy your work.
Sam: Copy?
Taliesin: Why?
Liam: For war.
Taliesin: I want to take another look at everything that was on the altar, and I want to see if it looks--
Matt: Go ahead and make an investigation check.
Taliesin: 18.
Matt: Testing what's there  I mean, a lot of the material has been scattered and mixed but there are elements that resemble the black powder you've used in some of your constructs and tinkering in the past.
Sam: They're making guns!
Taliesin: Well, we know we're looking for someone without a hand.
Sam: To do what?
Taliesin: To find out who's trying to copy my work.
Sam: Someone who is working with Sylas, right?
Taliesin: Yes. Let's check the rest of the temple.
Liam: Yes.
Sam: Okay, I'm going to go up on the altar. Was there a small something on the altar?
Matt: What you noticed were like some of the glass vials that were overturned.
Taliesin: What's in the pouches?
Matt: Looking at the pouches, it looks like some of them contained phosphorus, some of them contained other alchemical reagents that were used in the research but most have been emptied, and it's just a residuum on the inside.
Taliesin: Checking the door on the right.
Matt: Door on the right.
Liam: Going with.
Matt: (creak) Opens up into what was Father Reynal's room. As the door opens, you're immediately hit with terrible smell of decay. And you can see, shoved under the bed that first appears on the opposite side of the small room, what appears to be the remains of Father Reynal. Long passed and left to fester beneath his bed.
Sam: Can I tell how he died?
Matt: You're welcome to go ahead and take a look. Roll an investigation check.
Sam: 23.
Matt: 23. Looking at the body, it appears that there are a series of puncture wounds. Rapier-based. They're too long, like stiletto, too long to be a dagger.
Sam: Not teeth.
Matt: No, they are inflicted by a weapon, a long thin weapon. And multiple to the torso.
Taliesin: I'm going to search the room for anything else. Search the body.
Matt: Okay. Searching the body, searching the room, it looks like everything of interest has been taken from the place. You find some leftover stale food, you find some candles that are generally used for the purposes of worship here in the temple, but anything beyond that-- all the drawers have been emptied, everything has been taken by whoever was previously setting up residence in this facility.
Sam: Are there any holy symbols or anything that we might take to give to Keyleth to, I don't know. Wasn't she gonna-- I don't know. Do some holy shit?
Matt: You do notice that, throughout the temple, there are images of Pelor, flame-wreathed face, various sun and stars that are set up, but most of them have been profaned, marked on, shattered, or covered in soot. An intentional effort has been made to dampen the power of Pelor in this once-holy place.
Liam: Are there any untouched?
Matt: None that are untouched, but there are some that could possibly be cleaned. A couple of small medallions that are hanging up in the room where the Father lays.
Liam: I'll snag those.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: I want to check the other room. The room to the left.
Matt: Make a perception check.
Taliesin: So much perception. 19.
Sam: 19.
Liam: 20.
Matt: All right. As you walk back into the main temple--
Marisha: Finish. First.
Matt: All right. Your ears catch a faint, distant sound like a strong wind pushing through a mountain pass. This low mournful wail-type sound.
Sam: What's that?
Matt: No wind is moving. There is a stillness to the air.
Liam: Stepping back into the darkest shadows I can see.
Matt: As you guys take in this sense, this sound gets louder and louder. At which point, the air itself gets colder and colder. As you nervously exhale, you can see your breath becoming visible in the air around you. As you all look at each other, you, stepping back into what shadows there are, as it is a very open temple, as it's a temple of sun--
Liam: 32 stealth.
Matt: You find what tiny little alcove you can of shadow. It's not going to offer a lot of protection once you move, but for now you seem to be out of the circumstance.
Sam: I grab Percy, and I make us both go invisible.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: So, what is that, a 3rd-level Invisibility spell?
Matt: Yeah. You guys both vanish, holding your place on top of the altar, and as that moaning tends to grow louder and louder you can see this shimmer at the doors that are open on the opposite side of the room. It looks like a woman. A form of a woman, but translucent in nature, drifting in, giving off the horrible (raspy groan) sound, as it drifts in and you see it looking around and the features are gaunt as it gets closer. It looks elven by racial nature, but the eyes are just these sunken faintly glowing sockets, the hair wild and matted and floating behind it, its hands reaching out, and as it gets partway through the temple, it looks like it's seeking something, and its eyes fall directly on you two.
Liam: I'm throwing a dagger right now.
Matt: Let's go ahead and--
Sam: Ugh! What if she was a good guy?
Liam: It's a banshee, man.
Sam: What if it's a good banshee? Some of the banshees that I've met have been decent. We're rolling for initiative?
Liam: There's Siouxsie and the Banshees, they're all right.
Sam: I'm glad I used half my spells trying to get into this goddamn place.
Matt: Off to the side there.
Liam: He means well.
Taliesin: He means well. That's a terrible costume.
Matt: You guys are on the altar there.
Taliesin: You were so prepared for me to go to the temple that you built it?
Matt: I built the whole city, because I didn't know where you guys were going to go.
Sam: Jesus, Matt!
Marisha: He does have a pile of maps over there. MATT Shh! Don't look at it.
Taliesin: I'm not looking, I'm not looking.
Marisha: I'm just noting the pile.
Matt: So, first and foremost, let's go ahead and roll initiative.
Liam: Okay.
Matt: You'll get a surprise round.
Liam: Okay.
Marisha: Dope.
Liam: Natural 20 for initiative, as well.
Marisha: You finally got a good initiative roll!
Sam: I got a seven.
Taliesin: I got an 11! Together, we can get a Slurpee. I'm weird tonight. I don't know what's up.
Matt: All right.
Sam: Well, I can't do anything.
Matt: All right, well. First and foremost, before anything happens, this entity, as it notices your presence, it begins to transform and its image becomes more horrifying. As you pull your dagger out, I need all of you guys to roll a wisdom saving throw.
Marisha: You have advantage!
Taliesin: I rolled a one and then a natural 20.
Matt: (laughs) Nice.
Liam: 17.
Matt: 17?
Taliesin: Thank you for the advantage.
Marisha: You're welcome.
Matt: Scanlan?
Sam: 11.
Matt: With advantage?
Sam: I also always have advantage, so do I get to roll a third time?
Liam: No. Doesn't stack.
Matt: Unfortunately you are considered frightened by this entity. It scares the crap out of you.
Marisha: You can't be frightened after a Heroes' Feast.
Taliesin: You can't be frightened after a Heroes' Feast.
Matt: Ah! Then never mind. You feel it shake your form for a second. Its horrible visual presence, for a second, freaks you out, but then you remember the knowledge that your friends are here and you have to serve a purpose and you shake off--
Sam: Not only do I shake it off, I gird my loins!
Matt: Pull them up and get ready. All right.
Marisha: Just for a refresher  you're immune to poison, disease, and fear, and you have advantage on your wisdom throws.
Taliesin: We should do this every time we fly.
Marisha: It's expensive.
Liam: So, do I get to attack and then move into the combat round where I got a natural 20 plus five for initiative?
Matt: Well, you go first. Technically, it's not a surprise round because the creature can sense life and saw them before it happens, so it wasn't ambushed. But you do get to go first, and you do get to go before it. In the use of surprise, I didn't mean to use it in the surprise round fashion. These entities can detect living creatures up to five miles away.
Liam: So, there's no sneak attack damage on this thing, is there?
Matt: If you get to it first, you still have advantage.
Liam: All right.
Matt: Because it doesn't see you. You're still hidden from it.
Liam: 15, so this is a 26 to hit.
Matt: That hits.
Liam: Okay. And this gets the sneak attack damage?
Matt: This would, yes.
Liam: All right, here we go. But it's not a critical hit from assassinate because--
Matt: It is not surprised.
Liam: It's not surprised. All right. So, that's a four plus seven is 11. Plus 15, 19, 20, 24, 26, 28?
Matt: Okay.
Liam: I'm just going to keen dagger it three times in a row. Oh, I've got to roll to attack, so that is a twelve plus-- 22?
Matt: Hits.
Liam: Okay. Two, and that is six of damage, and then natural 20 on that one. That is three, four, three, plus seven is ten, so 20 for that, if it's doubled for a critical hit.
Matt: For double dice, not doubled modifier.
Liam: Oh, all right, so six plus-- 13.
Matt: Okay, 13, good to know. Awesome. So, out of the shadows, (whoosh) three daggers strike this wailing ghost entity. Each dagger, it punctures, and you see it reacts from the impact as there's a flash of magical energy with each hit. The daggers then tumble out of its form and then blink back to your belt side. It looks like it definitely did some damage to it, but it's--
Liam: You know what, just to be fair, I changed out all my daggers except for one, so I probably couldn't throw the same dagger three times in a row, so I think should pull back some of the modifiers, so I would pull out four, because my dagger is plus two. So the plus two for two of those hits gets taken out, right?
Matt: It would actually, yes.
Liam: So four, minus four.
Matt: So, minus four damage to this other guy.
Taliesin: So truthful.
Sam: So, we're fighting it with wooden stakes?
Matt: Wait so you threw wooden stakes at it as two of the attacks?
Liam: I threw one dagger and two wooden stakes.
Matt: Okay. So, the first dagger hits?
Liam: First was the dagger, yeah.
Matt: Yeah. The two other stakes pass through its form without any other impact. The one dagger does return to you, but the two stakes just clatter in the distance, and the creature seems unharmed by those two.
Liam: Even though they came out of the belt?
Matt: Yeah!
Liam: All right.
Matt: Sorry.
Liam: It's okay. It's just wood.
Taliesin: You learned.
Matt: So that ends that point. The creature now swoops up to the center of you three and gives out this horrible (roar) this wailing scream that bursts out in the air, you feel like the wind push you back and all of you feel like for a moment you're staring at your own death. I need all three of you guys to roll constitution saving throws.
Sam: Does our meal help us with that at all?
Matt: Nope.
Taliesin: 11.
Marisha: Wait, don't forget you have the additional--
Liam: What?
Marisha: 2d10 hit points on top.
Sam: Okay. 16.
Liam: 16.
Matt: Okay. Both of you guys, you feel this chilling burst of spiritual energy blast through your soul. And you each take 14 points of psychic damage. Percy, however, as you look at it, it seems like this blast actually forces the soul from your body momentarily. You immediately drop to zero hit points and are unconscious.
Sam: What? No! No, he can't. Oh, god.
Matt: So with that, you see Percy, eyes roll back and then collapse onto the floor like a pile of cold bones. Out. Percy, it's your turn. Go ahead and make a death saving throw.
Taliesin: 11.
Matt: 11, okay.
Marisha: That's a good sign.
Matt: Scanlan, it's your turn.
Sam: Very quickly. Should we flee?
Marisha: Get the fuck out.
Liam: In a little bit.
Sam: In a little bit? Okay.
Liam: Without Percy?
Marisha: Well, get him up.
Matt: You still have Bigby's Hand, by the way, on concentration.
Sam: Oh, that's right!
Matt: Let's see how long that lasts, actually. Let me see how long it lasts. Just to be safe.
Taliesin: We haven't been there very long. (whispering) God damn it.
Matt: Up to a minute. So probably would have faded by now.
Sam: God damn it.
Matt: Sorry. What are you doing, Scanlan?
Taliesin: Really, it's the door's fault.
Sam: Shit. I'll just Lightning Bolt her. Him. It. Whatever it is.
Matt: Okay. So you release a bolt of lightning energy right in its direction. Go ahead and roll damage for that.
Sam: Oh, just damage?
Matt: You don't have to hit for lightning bolt; it just hits everything in front of it, and you have to try and avoid it.
Sam: Oh, 8d6.
Matt: What's the DC?
Sam: Do I get my hand cone?
Matt: It is a free action to pull it out, so you instinctively-- hand cone, cast the spell-- out the bolt goes.
Sam: So, 19.
Matt: 19, okay.
Sam: 8d6.
Matt: Does not make its saving throw.
Sam: Great.
Taliesin: Need more d6, or are you cool?
Sam: Nope, that's it. I just need help counting.
Marisha: That's good!
Sam: 16, five, 21, 27.
Taliesin: 28, 29, 30. 34!
Sam: 34.
Matt: 34 points of damage. The lightning blasts through her, not impactful as you think it might be. This entity because it is in an ethereal state, is not as effectively hit by such magics. However, it does take damage.
Sam: Okay.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: I will move back a bit. Away from the thing. And I will-- Oh! We have people.
Marisha: Yay! Percy's unconscious!
Laura: No!
Travis: Keep fighting!
Marisha: It's okay, it's cool.
Laura: We've been listening in the car.
Taliesin: Okay, so you know.
Matt: Scanlan, you move back?
Sam: Okay, and then I can, as a bonus action, still get a bonus? I will heal him, this doofus here.
Taliesin: I didn't do anything!
Matt: Healing Word.
Sam: Okay, yeah. (singing) I'm bring health points back. Yeah! You mothafuckas don't know how to act-- Yeah! That's all I got. (singing) Take it to the bridge!
Matt: All right, so Healing Word is 1d4 plus--
Sam: Yeah, but maybe I should do it at a--
Taliesin: Just get me up. It's okay.
Sam: Just get you up? Okay. 1d4 plus something?
Marisha: Do it.
Sam: Two plus whatever. Six? Eight?
Marisha: I think it's plus your spell level.
Matt: Healing Word will be--
Sam: It's 1d4 plus five, so it's seven points.
Matt: So, seven hit points. You're conscious, but you're still on the ground, face down, loosely fallen over the stuff on the altar.
Taliesin: I don't get my turn until next round.
Matt: Correct. So, Scanlan? Your turn's done? Vax, you're up.
Liam: All right, so where is it? I'm just going to back away from it about three steps, while I pull Flametongue Dagger out of my cloak.
Matt: Okay. You're in this room currently.
Liam: Yeah, oh! That, oh, okay. No. So, I'm going to walk, thanks. I'm going to slide up the wall along where Scanlan is. Towards Scanlan. And another thing I realized, I haven't clicked my Boots of Haste, so I wouldn't have been able to do whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, anyway. And I'm still not going to. But I'm pulling out my Flametongue Dagger and now I'm throwing Keen Dagger, Flametongue. First one is 26.
Matt: Hits.
Liam: And the second one is 23.
Matt: Hits.
Liam: Okay. First attack gets 11.
Matt: All right.
Liam: And the second attack gets eight.
Matt: All righty. Both daggers hitting it, you see its form being impacted by each dagger hit. It still continues to come forward toward the two of you. Is that the end of your movement?
Liam: I'm going to, without doing any dash or anything, because I can't, I'm going to move as far as I can just going kitty-corner. Behind Scanlan, walking along the wall.
Matt: Over here?
Liam: Absolutely.
Matt: That far?
Liam: Yeah, that's as far as I can get, that's good.
Matt: I think so. All right. That ends your turn. The creature now is going to drift up to the unconscious form, or the now-conscious form of Percy. It's going to swipe at you with its Corrupting Touch. Since you're prone, it has advantage on the attack. That'll be 20 to hit. What's your AC?
Taliesin: 18.
Matt: 18? Okay. As its hand reaches down and passes through, as you just come to consciousness, and you start getting yourself up, you look up and feel this cold sensation as its hand reaches through your back and seems to almost grasp your spine. Your whole body lurches from the impact. You take 12 points of necrotic damage.
Taliesin: I'm back to zero.
Sam: That's two!
Liam: It starts over.
Sam: It does?
Taliesin: Yeah. I'm back to zero.
Sam: If he dies once, comes back and dies again, is that two?
Matt: No, he has to fail his death saves.
Taliesin: I just woke up and went, (groans). Passed back out again.
Matt: That ends its turn. Well, no actually, it's going to start moving now. It's going to drift through the rest of its movement this direction. That ends its turn. Go ahead and make your death saving throw.
Taliesin: Yes, 19.
Laura: Yeah.
Travis: Yay, little snitch.
Matt: All righty. That ends your turn. Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: Hey, should we leave?
Liam: No, we should kill this thing!
Sam: Damn it! All right.
Liam: We're not going to be able to run. This thing flew in here on the breeze.
Sam: I don't think Eyebite's going to work against it. So, fuck, I'll cast Bigby's Hand at 6th-level, then.
Matt: (laughing) Okay!
Travis: Has that ever been done?
Sam: I don't have any more 5th-level slots. So, I'm just going to make it even bigger.
Matt: All righty.
Sam: I don't even know what it does.
Liam: Fingers going out the windows of the church like Alice in Wonderland.
Matt: All right. Bigby's Hand. With a clenched fist deals an additional 2d8 damage.
Sam: Okay.
Matt: So if you're going to punch it, it does an additional 2d8 damage.
Sam: Yes, I think--
Matt: What are you going to do?
Sam: I'm going to bitch-slap it, but the forceful hand. So I can just push it far away from us. Possibly to the front door.
Matt: Okay, I see. So it does no damage but it does force its movement.
Sam: Yeah.
Matt: Okay, and I'll say because you did it at a higher level, it's an additional five feet of movement on that. So, as the hand shoves toward the creature--
Sam: It takes no damage for that?
Matt: The forceful hand it doesn't, no. There's grasping hand and the clenched fist do damage.
Sam: All right, so then I'll just hit it. I'll just hit it hard.
Matt: Okay. So, you bitch-slap it physically hard. Clenched fist. Go ahead and make a spell attack. Go ahead and roll a d20, add your spell attack modifier.
Sam: 14. Plus, what am I adding? Oh, nine. Plus nine.
Matt: 14 plus nine? That hits. Go ahead and roll damage. That's 6d8 force damage because you cast it at 6th level.
Sam: 6d8. I don't even know what those are. That's a ten.
Liam: They look like diamonds.
Sam: There they go. I got one. I'll just roll it six times.
Travis: (singing) Diamonds are Scanlan's best friend.
Laura: No, diamonds are Vex's best friend.
Sam: 24?
Matt: 24.
Sam: Even at 6th-level, that's all it did.
Matt: Yeah. As that happens, the fist clenches and (wham) bitch-slaps the back of the wailing ghost creature. As it does you hear it scream out in pain (screech) as its spectral form is scattered across the air and dissipates.
Sam: What?
Marisha: Thank god.
Sam: What?
Travis: I think you smashed it.
Marisha: You killed it.
Liam: You crushed it.
Sam: But I'm so little and wee!
Liam: Lift yourself up for a victory lap.
Sam: Yes, I lift myself up with Bigby's Hand. Yeah, that was a great idea.
Matt: You toss yourself up a couple times.
Sam: Whoa!
Travis: Meanwhile, Percy's unconscious.
Sam: Oh shit! Percy!
Liam: No, I've got four healing potions. I pour, it's not the best. It's a greater healing?
Matt: So, it's 4d4 plus four.
Sam: I will also sing for him a Song of Rest, which is just another d6.
Matt: If you guys are taking a short rest--
Sam: Yeah. Oh, are we clear of danger?
Liam: We don't know, but I poured the potion into Percy's mouth.
Taliesin: 4d4 plus four?
Matt: Yep, you got it.
Taliesin: Four, five, six, seven, nine, ten, 14. Yep. I'm awake. Hurt, but--
Liam: I slap him twice, anyway.
Taliesin: Ugh! Ah!
Liam: What do we do?
Sam: What are we doing here?
Liam: The priest's dead. Is there anyone else, or should we head back?
Taliesin: We should head back. Apparently, any help I thought we'd find here is obviously gone.
Sam: Should we check this other room first, before we go?
Taliesin: Did we not check the other room?
Sam: No.
Liam: No.
Taliesin: Let's check the other room, and--
Sam: Quickly, though, quickly.
Taliesin: We'll check the other room quickly.
Liam: While they check the room, I'm going to go all over the altar and see if there's anything, any hidden door, any trapdoor, anything like that.
Matt: Okay, go ahead and make a perception check.
Liam: Eh. That's a-- oh! No! Wait, I keep forgetting that's a rogue skill. That's a 20.
Taliesin: I was really hoping you missed that part.
Matt: Looking over the altar, it appears to be smooth, solid stone. Nothing catches your attention. You check the other room. This is a small kitchen, essentially, for whoever was running here would make small meals or things to delineate during worship and/or just cook for its own meals when the father was keeping--
Taliesin: Has it been used recently? Is it--
Matt: It does not appear to have been used, you can make an investigation check to gather an idea of how long it's been there. SAM I'm going to look around as well and food and stuff.
Taliesin: 12.
Sam: 22.
Matt: Okay. You get the feeling that the last time this was used was a little under a week ago.
Taliesin: All right.
Sam: Any provisions that we can take? Water, food?
Matt: You find a couple of loaves of stale bread, some dried meats, salted dry meats, like some jerky-ish type things. Things that are meant to last a while. There is produce here, but the produce has long wilted and gone to rot.
Taliesin: I have theories on who's been using this space. Is there anything that would clue me in to who's been using this space?
Matt: It's hard to really tell. You're not too familiar with lifestyles of different individuals. Whoever left the notes, and whoever was dabbling with the vicinity does have a tendency towards sciences and alchemy in ways that seemingly can blend and overlap with your specialty. That's the best you can ascertain, based on the information given.
Taliesin: Now, here's the question. Do we leave them a sign that we're here, or do we hope that they don't notice?
Sam: Well, let's leave them a sign. We're supposed to be sowing discontent, right? So, let's leave a sign that someone was here and fucked up their shit. Do you want me to pee on the altar?
Taliesin: No.
Liam: I take my dagger, and I go to the altar--
Taliesin: Wait.
Sam: No, don't leave your dagger; it's your only one left.
Liam: I didn't say I'm leaving it. Yeah. You want that?
Taliesin: I want that.
Liam: I start-- would you hand me that scrap of paper, yeah?
Sam: Whoa, this is our sign?
Liam: So I start carving this-- Is this Pelor?
Taliesin: This is not Pelor. It's part of the crest of de Rolo.
Laura: Ooh!
Marisha: de Rolos are back!
Liam: Okay. So, I just start scraping it into the stone with the Keen Dagger.
Matt: Okay. And it gives a horrible screeching sound as you carve into this well-polished stone surface that's used predominantly for worship, or when it was. Given about five, ten minutes in you manage to scrape a design into it that is visually distinct against the smooth surface, and does match the design best to your ability that Percy--
Taliesin: I would also like to drag Father Reynal out of his room and put him at the pedestal.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: And then before we go, I'm going to the wooden door, and I carve into the door: Pelor lives in Whitestone.
Sam: That's a lot of words.
Marisha: Six hours later...
Liam: It's wood! It took me five minutes.
Matt: Okay. You finish your carving, seemingly without recurring incident.
Taliesin: Like to head back now, I believe.
Matt: Yeah. You guys make your way out of the temple back into the center of the graveyard. The sun is beginning to set. The reds and purples of the night sky are starting to creep in, as it just begins to crest on the far western side of the mountain range surrounding the valley.
Marisha: I have a question. MATT Yes.
Marisha: What's the weather been like since we've been in Whitestone?
Matt: It's been spotty, cloudy--
Marisha: The sun has come out during the daytime?
Matt: Bits and pieces. There is heavy cloud cover that seems to be pushing through. It brings colder weather. It looks like when you first got there, there was some snowfall that happened before you arrived. You've had a few days of sun, but I'd say about half the day is cloud cover.
Marisha: Does it seem to be fairly natural weather for this time of year? Okay.
Matt: And this far north, too. All right. You guys--
Liam: I also grab those wooden stakes off the ground.
Matt: Okay. Takes you a little time, because they're amongst a bunch of other broken wooden scraps--
Liam: I grab a couple extra, as well.
Matt: Okay! You find some splintered wood. You guys make your way back into the town. I'd like you all to make a stealth, or a deception check, if you prefer.
Sam: Deception, please. (sings a ditty) I'm just a peasant boy.
Taliesin: 13.
Matt: 13.
Travis: G'day sir.
Liam: 23.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: 32.
Matt: All right. As you guys are making your way back towards the tavern, there is a small group of Whitestone villagers walking and having a conversation. Not heated, but there is a sense of desperate conversation amongst them. And, standing with them you can see there's an older gentleman, mostly bald, long scraggly gray hair that falls past his shoulders, a little bit hunched. He's wearing dark leathers and a cloak that's over one shoulder and drags the ground behind him. And they're talking to him and he's growling to himself and the best you can make out is there's an argument about farming shipments and the inability to make dates and requirements. He shouts back to the remainder, says, "Listen, it is beyond my control. This is what has been decreed by Sir Kerrion. That is how it'll be. If you cannot provide, then taxes will be pulled. If you cannot pay, then there are far worse things we can take. Now, be on your way!" And steps away from the group, looks over and sees a little boy and this in the shadows skulking individual. "You there!"
Taliesin: Yes?
Matt: "You new around here?"
Taliesin: A bit, yes.
Matt: "I don't recognize you." And two of the guards step forward.
Taliesin: I suppose it's our good luck, then.
Matt: "What's your name?"
Taliesin: (sighs) Reggie.
Matt: Make a deception check.
Taliesin: Fuck my life. I know! 21!
Liam: My name's Reggie.
Matt: "Then make yourself useful. Maybe you can make up for some of these lost crops that these bags of shite keep saying they can't do."
Taliesin: I'm actually supposed to be going back for a--
Matt: "I don't give a shit, move on, boy."
Taliesin: Yes, sir.
Matt: He grumbles and keeps on walking. The guards give you a look. One of them spits at your foot, keeps walking on. Eventually, they drift aside. You continue your path back to the tavern where the rest of you are waiting. The sun has now set. Night has taken the sky and Keyleth is on the verge of completing her ritual.
Laura: I'm cleaning my nails as I'm watching her.
Taliesin: I'm keeping an eye from the second floor. I want to see how much movement in the city there is and whether or not there's any guards by the tree, whether or not the tree seems to be left to its own devices.
Matt: Okay. As you're keeping watch, you notice occasionally there will be one of the zombie giants that will lumber through the center of town. There's a very specific pattern that they tend to follow.
Taliesin: Definitely trying to memorize that.
Matt: And you do notice a couple of other guards that you didn't notice during the day begin to show up. They're humanoid; they're armored. They sneak around. They're humanoid, but their movement is unnatural.
Taliesin: Is there a lot of light in the town, or not very much light?
Matt: Not very much light at all. There's very low-lit points at certain crossroads that've been left up for general visibility for those who have to travel at night, but you gather most people just do not travel at night here in Whitestone.
Laura: Make sure no lights are lit in our--
Taliesin: We've already blacked out--
Sam: I blacked out the windows.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: Keyleth--
Marisha: Yeah?
Matt: You finally complete your ritual. Sweat pouring down your brow, you have your hand on the roots--
Marisha: Can I do something? Something real quick for my final, extra drama? So, as I complete the ritual, remembering that Pelor, and this is a sun tree. I'm going to cast my 6th-level Sunbeam spell as I'm finishing the Plant Growth with the last big essence--
Sam: At night?
Marisha: I'm underground. So, I'm going to take my Sunbeam, and wrap it up with my druid goodness. And shove it in the tree.
Taliesin: You're going to shove it where the sun don't shine.
Marisha: Yeah, I'm going to kill it. I don't know if it's going to work or not.
Matt: Okay. Roll a d20 and add your wisdom modifier.
Marisha: Do I get advantage on this? Because of Heroes' Feast?
Matt: I would say no, because this isn't a saving throw and because what you're attempting to do is essentially convert a highly damaging spell into a non-damaging circumstance at the end of an eight-hour endurance match with a ritual. This is going to be a difficult attempt. So go ahead and roll a d20. Add your wisdom modifier.
Marisha: I hope I didn't just fuck up by doing this.
Laura: You got it, Keyleth.
Travis: Yeah, you never get arrested or anything, you're good.
Sam: Use the green one. This is you doing greenery.
Marisha: I'm so nervous.
Sam: Natural 20. Easy. Or a six.
Laura: Oh, no.
Marisha: But my wisdom's not bad, so 12?
Matt: You complete the ritual and release the healing energy of your Plant Growth spell. As you release it you begin to concentrate on the sun ray and you begin to see, throughout the pieces of earth around, seeds quickly begin to germinate and small little bits of ivy, greenery begin to pierce out from parts of the earth in your immediate vicinity, as this affects a large radius. There does not appear to be any sort of immediate reaction by the tree. You begin to pull back and concentrate on the spell. You release the Sunbeam forward. In the frustration of the lack of reaction from the tree and the desperation to make sure some effect happens, you release the full force of the beam as opposed to the prequel aspect and you burst into some of the roots, blasting some of them apart and beginning to set flame to part of the under of the tree.
Marisha: Oh, cool. That's cool. Cool story.
Liam: Bucket of water.
Marisha: I'll put it out.
Matt: You guys hear this (explosion).
Laura: That's right in front of-- I pull out my cloaks in my bag and start trying to put out the flames. Keyleth, what? Was that supposed to happen? Is that good? Was this good? Should I stop? I keep putting out the flames.
Matt: You put out the flames. And you notice where the fire had burned aspects of the wood, there is the black char marks across the roots where the flames touched, and the area surrounding the root is a little more of a vibrant brown color. Almost like a little hint of life seemed to have seeped into the root.
Marisha: Oh my god.
Matt: It expands for a moment and you can see a little bit of life return to that localized section of the tree.
Marisha: Ooh! Like starting a fire. (blows air) Go, go! Can I Druidcraft? Come on!
Matt: As you do, there's still these bits of ivy greenery, this long-embedded seeds through years and years and generations of earth layering in here. These long-dormant seeds are starting to come to life and spring through the earth around you. The expansion of the healthier portion of the root begins to spread, and then stop spreading. And you begin to notice all the greenery begins to immediately wither and crumple and turn to ash. And you watch as the vibrant aspect of the roots slowly drain from the bottom up. Like something is pulling the life force out of the roots.
Laura: They're sucking the life force out of the earth.
Marisha: I take some of that holy oil that Vax gave me and I dip my finger in it and start rubbing it along the vines that are growing along the edge of the roots.
Matt: You take the holy oil and place it along the roots, and it soaks into the dry and in some cases now charred aspects of the roots. You wait a moment, and the oil seems to almost burn off and evaporate.
Sam: So, the ground is cursed.
Marisha: The ground is cursed.
Sam: Well, poo.
Travis: Should I try peeing on it?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Marisha: Perception check?
Taliesin: That thing you hate doing?
Marisha: No, I'm good at perceiving things, I'm just not good at reading people.
Sam: You know what we need to do?
Marisha: That's not bad. 23?
Sam: Hydroponics. No ground, just grow it above.
Matt: The pattern of decay that followed your initial attempt at reviving this vicinity, all had a very distinct downward motion of draining. There was something about the ground, something beneath the tree and where you are that is seemingly taking the life force of the surroundings.
Laura: Oh, my god, what if the vampire thing is right underneath us?
Marisha: I was going to say, can I still see the green being sucked down a bit?
Matt: At this point, all the life force was very quickly drained.
Laura: Can I use my Primeval Awareness and sense any sort of vampiric presence within our very close vicinity?
Matt: What's the radius on that?
Laura: It's a minute. It's up to six miles if I spend six minutes.
Matt: Okay. So you take your time, and you begin to focus and it expands. As you do, focusing on vampiric presence, you feel a fair amount of presence: above, below and further north. And smattered throughout the city. You get the sensation at this point in time that there is much more beyond just Lord Briarwood that have come to be a creature of the night in this city.
Laura: (whispering) That's good. Bad. Probably bad.
Travis: Maybe they're not below the tree, maybe it's just the soil.
Taliesin: The ground is tainted.
Marisha: I'm exhausted.
Sam: Let's sleep.
Taliesin: Let's sleep.
Laura: We're just going to sleep? Surrounded by vampires, we're just going to sleep surrounded by lots and lots of vampires?
Taliesin: I'm going to tinker for a moment on my glove with that thing I talked about.
Matt: Okay. Make an intelligence check.
Taliesin: An intelligence check?
Matt: Yeah, just a straight intelligence check.
Taliesin: 14.
Matt: 14. Incorporating this organic organ? Keeping it from rotting is already going to be a feat. In order to incorporate any of its natural charge essence is going to require your workshop. Doing that on the go is too intricate.
Taliesin: I just wanted to think about it. It's fine.
Matt: I mean, it may be functional. It's definitely possible to use what you extracted from the behir to be a way to charge your Diplomacy, but that is something that you'll have to do in a controlled space when you have everything at your disposal. It's a very delicate process to even attempt it.
Taliesin: I think we get it.
Liam: I'll take first watch.
Matt: Okay. You all take an evening's rest.
Marisha: I'm sorry I couldn't fix the tree, you guys.
Taliesin: We learned a lot.
Laura: You even did that awesome fire thing at the end that was really, really cool.
Marisha: Thanks. I was afraid I was going to permanently kill it for a second.
Taliesin: We know it's not dead dead. That it's just tainted.
Sam: Guys, I just want to say that I killed a door and a banshee, so--
Laura: Really?
Sam: Yeah.
Laura: Nice, Scanlan.
Sam: The door was harder to kill.
Travis: That's some door!
Taliesin: It's okay. I think I figured out what we have to do first.
Marisha: What do we have to do first?
Taliesin: I think we have to kill Kerrion Stonefell.
Sam: Who's that?
Taliesin: It's the one that everyone-- he's the one managing all of the goods and all of the farming.
Sam: Is that who they were talking about today? The group?
Laura: Where is he at?
Sam: Oh, Sir Kerrion. I thought they said something else.
Taliesin: Kerrion Stonefell. He's in one of the three-- I would assume that he's been given one of the three mansions in town.
Sam: You think if we find him, kill him, and leave his body on some sort of public display, it would sow some seeds of rebellion?
Taliesin: I think it would be the beginning. He's who everybody's afraid of.
Travis: We could hang him in the tree.
Taliesin: We could hang him in the tree.
Sam: We could. Grog, could you do something nasty to his body?
Travis: Just say the word.
Laura: Oh, this is messed up.
Sam: All right.
Travis: Do we check the mansions for him?
Taliesin: I think we ask around to see if there's a way to ask around to find out who's in what house.
Sam: Ask around? Let's just go house to house and kill everyone in all of them!
Taliesin: Let's-- Eventually, yes.
Travis: Hello. I'd like to share the news of our Lord and Savior: my axe in your face!
Sam: Yes. We could be Mormons.
Matt: As you guys take your watches and go to sleep in the cold interior, and it is a cold interior of the tavern. As the night comes through, this is your first time really staying the night in the center of Whitestone. Even though you slept in the forest, in the boughs of the trees itself, the temperature grows far colder here, and even with the warm interior, the windows frost over and you find yourselves having to huddle or build some sort of small fire to even keep a semblance of comfort to rest. You all eventually go to sleep throughout your various times. I would like everyone to make a wisdom saving throw. With advantage, because you're still affected by the Heroes' Feast.
Sam: Until noon tomorrow, right?
Marisha: 2PM tomorrow.
Sam: Yeah!
Taliesin: 12.
Sam: 17.
Marisha: 25.
Liam: 20.
Laura: 23.
Travis: 14.
Matt: Okay. All of you wake the next morning rested as best as can be. Percy, your entire evening was wracked with nightmare after nightmare, imagery you wish to not recall. Whispers and voices familiar, unfamiliar, seeing yourself pulled from your physical self into the heart of this banshee, then wrest from death, barely, cackling in the distance. I want you to go ahead and mark on your sheet one point of corruption.
Laura: Oh.
Travis: What does that mean?
Marisha: Oh no!
Sam: I don't even know where that is on the sheet!
Laura: He could be evil. We could turn evil here!
Matt: As you wake up, you find yourself wracked by those nightmares, a sense of nervousness comes to you. And there's a tremor to your voice now that's uncontrollable. At times of silence, you find yourself impulsively clearing your throat. And with that we're going to take a five-minute break.
Marisha: What the fuck?!
Taliesin: Yay!
Matt: All right guys, keep this to a stringent five-minute break so we can get to as much as we can before the show's up tonight. So we'll see you guys here in five minutes? All right?
Liam: See you in 17. [break]
Matt: Welcome back everyone. So, a couple quick things. One, we're roughly 30 to 25 subs away from our next milestone. The milestone, as we do with every 100 subs, the winner in the chat room, as long as you're active in it, gets a package of one of our signed cast photos, as well as a wonderful poster art piece from our artist, Kit Buss, signed by the cast, and that will also be our 10k mark.
Travis: Damn!
Liam: Damn, damn!
Travis: Skittles, motherfucker!
Matt: It's pretty fantastic. So, as soon as we hit that we'll have our next giveaway and a big celebration as we hit 10k.
Marisha: Get yourself a double cheeseburger.
Liam: (singing) Look at the Sun Tree!
Matt: Also, you guys just caught, as that break ended, a quick episode of Omnibus. Omnibus is a new show that shows here every Tuesday. It's helmed by Ian and Hector, some of our fantastic hosts here. It talks about all sorts of things. Not just Batman things. All sorts of things in geek culture and-- what's that?
Taliesin: There's more than Batman?
Matt: There's more than Batman! It's crazy! I pop up there every now and then to answer some questions and talk about some cool things, as well as a number of other cool personalities that pop in and out. Check it out if you're around on Tuesday. It's a lot of fun. All righty. So let's kick back into this. So, a rough morning's rest come to fruition. Percy seems a little worse for wear after the evening's sleep.
Marisha: You feeling okay?
Taliesin: (grunts)
Marisha: It was cold. Did you catch a cold?
Taliesin: No, I'm fine.
Marisha: Is your throat ticklish?
Taliesin: A little ticklish, I'm fine.
Marisha: Do you want some Goodberries? It might help a little bit--
Laura: Keyleth.
Marisha: What?
Taliesin: I'll take some Goodberries.
Marisha: All right. If you suck on them a little bit they act like "logenzes."
Sam: "Logenzes?"
Marisha: Well, shut up.
Liam: Kenny Logenzes.
Sam: Kenny Logenzes.
Marisha: Kenny Logenzes.
Matt: It's a whole business opportunity that was missed.
Laura: Oh wait. Seeming has ended at this point, hasn't it?
Matt: Seeming has ended, yes.
Laura: So, Trinket is a bear.
Matt: Trinket is now a bear.
Laura: Okay, cool.
Matt: And not a donkey.
Travis: And not a donkey.
Liam: But he's indoors with us, right?
Laura: Yeah. I've been laying on him all night.
Travis: Man, that was a good night's sleep. Who do we get to kill today?
Sam: Sir Kerrion.
Travis: How many mansions are there?
Taliesin: There's three.
Travis: Right. One, three.
Liam: Do you know which one he lives in?
Taliesin: I don't.
Liam: Shit.
Sam: Only one way to find out. Burn every house down except for those three mansions and see who runs out.
Travis: I like it. Seconded.
Taliesin: I also think perhaps we should find a new place to sleep tonight. I think it might be best. To mix it up. Keep moving.
Travis: But I've been peeing in the corner.
Laura: That's why it smells like it does. Grog!
Travis: What? Look, it's like they did in the old days, they had chamberpots. I mean, I have my corner. It's my recreation corner. Sorry. Yeah, that's my brand.
Liam: That is ripe. We're leaving.
Sam: You want to all be peasants again? Can we not just disguise ourselves in tattered clothes?
Laura: I have a bear. Do you want to disguise the bear?
Sam: Oh, wait. We could just leave the bear behind.
Laura: In the house.
Sam: He could guard this safe house, and then we could go find another safe house.
Taliesin: Scanlan, cast the spell.
Sam: All right, fine. Seeming it is. We're all peasants and he's a donkey. And I'm a little boy.
Matt: You're a little boy. Jovial boy without a yo-yo.
Taliesin: There's a shop that I used to frequent. We can see if that's perhaps been abandoned.
Laura: All right. I want like a crazy eye in my Seeming.
Sam: Of course you can! I'll give you two crazy eyes.
Matt: (laughs) You now have two crazy eyes.
Liam: That's an improvement. That's nice.
Matt: The majesty of bardic illusion.
Taliesin: So we're going to go to Beyond the Horizon.
Matt: Going to Beyond the Horizon?
Taliesin: Yes.
Matt: All righty. You guys step out into the day's sun. Today is fairly overcast. Clouds have taken the sky, and there is a bit of a light mist that is falling. Not quite rain, but not quite drizzle, but just a mist in the air. It's a cold day. The ground and most of the walkways and roads are a little damp due to the moisture in the air. Not muddy, just a little bit of a packed wetness to it. As you head over towards Beyond the Horizon, and that lies more in the northwestern quadrant of the city. A little ways around the street from one of the noble houses, so you keep a wide berth. You come to the row of shops that bookended it before, and you go to the curiosity shop to find that the building itself is partially collapsed and ruined. The door is torn off the hinges and left to the side. Part of the ceiling is fallen in.
Sam: Is there a basement?
Laura: Yeah, secret doors? Can I use a perception check to see if there's any kind of secret entrances in the rubble at all? Something that leads to a cellar?
Matt: Do you wander into the building? You guys are still on the outside--
Liam: How collapsed is it?
Matt: The whole building is still standing. It just looks like the front entrance is caved in and the doors were pulled off.
Laura: I'll just old lady walk into the building and look around.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: I'll go in with her.
Taliesin: Do old ladies lick the air?
Laura: Yeah, she does. This crazy-eyed old lady does.
Liam: Yeah, the eyes, they never go in the same direction; one's always to the left and one to the right.
Matt: Looking about the inside, most of the furniture has been broken or taken. You can see a bunch of shelves set up as this was once a curiosity shop. Empty. Anything of worth has long been taken.
Sam: Oi, Grandma! Any yo-yos in there?
Laura: I'm looking, boy.
Matt: A large scattering of broken glass, and a peppering of stains. Dark, ruddy stains across the hardwood floors you can see spattered in places. Occasional rat seems to crawl out in the distance a little (rat squeaking) sound. But there is no other sign of life within the interior. Go ahead and make an investigation check.
Laura: Ooh, with no advantage, right?
Marisha: What time is it?
Sam: Oh, until noon.
Marisha: Until 2PM, yo!
Matt: Wisdom check, not saving throw.
Marisha: Oh, never mind.
Liam: 13.
Matt: 13?
Liam: 13.
Laura: That would have been an eight.
Matt: Eight. Okay. You take a while pushing through some of the rubble, checking behind the main desk, if you will, as to where most purchases would have taken place. The place is cleared out, and looks like it's covered in enough dust to have been left here for the better part of six months to a year.
Laura: I can't see any kind of like door that leads to a cellar?
Matt: Glancing about, you find what looks to be a small cellar door that opens up in the floor in one of the back rooms. You open it up, there's a small ladder, not even a staircase, a ladder that leads down in there. It's a small room, about ten foot by ten foot. That room is also entirely cleaned out.
Laura: All right. No yo-yos here, boy.
Sam: Thanks, grandmama.
Taliesin: Can we use this as a base of operations in the moment, then?
Laura: But it's half-collapsed, it would not be very protected.
Travis: Yeah, we're fully exposed.
Sam: Let's just take a walkabout and see if there's anything else around the area.
Travis: Do you want to head in one of the directions of the mansions?
Taliesin: Let's head to the closest mansion.
Matt: Okay. So you skirt back towards the the crossroad, the nearest crossroad that heads northward to the very, very far northwest section of Whitestone. There you come to this noble house, which has a nice bronzed fence around the outside of it. Probably about seven feet tall with these intricate spears affixed to the top, almost in a fleur-de-lis type pattern, but looks sharp enough to keep anyone from trying to leap over. The front gate is currently chained off with a lock on it. There is a lawn, but the lawn itself appears to be frost-crusted from the evening's moisture and cold temperature. What grass is there is very gray and dull and currently crisp with a white frost dew. Is a slight hill, and you do see the building itself. It's a very nice building. It's a deep brown. A lot of it appears to be like natural stained wood from the local forest surrounding Whitestone, with highlights of deep green and black. There does not appear to be any immediate sign of life from the inside, but there does appear to be a light coming from the inside, so even at this point in the day, it can be dark on the interior. You can see a little bit of light coming from one of the doors.
Marisha: Is there a mailbox with a name? (laughter)
Sam: Are there guards out front or anything, or is it just a gate?
Matt: It's just a gate, currently.
Sam: Do you want me to go in?
Laura: What if we went to the fields and we asked other peasants how we report to what's-his-fuck. Keron. Keron?
Taliesin: Kerrion.
Laura: Kerrion?
Travis: Oh. That's actually a good one.
Taliesin: I will say, chances that anybody in any of these buildings is somebody we're going to want to take care of is very high.
Laura: So, just bust on in and kill them right now.
Sam: Just, whoever's in there?
Marisha: Is that actually what you're saying?
Liam: And you went from focusing on Kerrion, to kicking in doors?
Travis: Are you feeling all right?
Laura: Yeah, you look a little pale, Percy.
Taliesin: I am a little pale.
Marisha: It's kind of like the game show problem.
Sam: Well, you know.
Laura: Are you sick? Does Keyleth need to cast, I don't know, Restoration on you or something?
Taliesin: I just had a bad night's sleep, that's all.
Travis: Scanlan, go knock on that door.
Marisha: Do you have a fever?
Sam: I'm just a little peasant boy.
Marisha: Is he running a fever?
Matt: He is not actually, he's quite cold and clammy.
Marisha: Ew.
Taliesin: My nice jacket. We can ask around. See if we can manage to ask somebody without arousing--
Sam: Is anyone else on the street?
Matt: Right now, in this particular area, there is nobody on the street. You passed a few folks. A lot of them seem to be traveling southward.
Taliesin: How far are we from the temple? The Alcove?
Matt: The Alcove is a little further east, it's probably about a 15-minute walk. The other temple, that one is about a ten-minute walk south of here. It's closer to the southwestern side of the city.
Taliesin: We could take a walk to the Lady's Chamber and see if we run into anybody there or on the way, and it's only ten minutes out of the way.
Travis: The Lady's Chamber?
Taliesin: Not as exciting as it sounds.
Liam: You know someone there?
Taliesin: (sighs) It's not looking like it.
Sam: I bet it's empty. I mean, it's a temple. The other one was.
Travis: All right, but I thought we were killing somebody in this house.
Sam: I thought so, too.
Taliesin: We'll get to it.
Sam: I can just pop in there and see who's in there and pop out.
Laura: Be killed? Never pop back out again.
Taliesin: He doesn't know what he looks like, anyway.
Sam: I'm just a peasant boy. You wouldn't kill a harmless peasant boy.
Taliesin: I think they would, actually. They already have.
Laura: We saw the tree.
Taliesin: Genuine proof that they are perfectly fine killing a small peasant boy.
Liam: What is there in the way of guards out in the open now, and those giants strolling about?
Matt: The skulking humanoids you saw last night that were wandering the streets? None of them visible. You do take in that far down the road to the east of you there is a large shape looming around the corner in a shadow stretching across the road. And you hear the distant (muffled stomping noise).
Liam: Are we within eyeshot of that thing right now?
Matt: Not yet. It looks like it's coming around a corner at the bend of the road a ways to the east.
Liam: Is there anyone our size, any humanoid guards around?
Travis: No.
Liam: Nothing?
Matt: Currently? No.
Liam: I'm guessing the best time to sneak into any of these places is during the day.
Marisha: Do we want to sneak in, though? You're the only one who knows what they look like.
Matt: It's coming around the bend.
Marisha: Okay, wait. Are the gates locked?
Sam: Let's get out of here. Take a walk, we're going to take a walk.
Taliesin: We're going to take a little walk and let it pass by. Let's go to the Lady's Chamber.
Liam: Lady's Chambers, anyone?
Sam: Towards the Lady's Chamber. We're not going in.
Liam: It's full of prostitutes, Grog. Full.
Taliesin: You'll see. It's not really that complicated.
Liam: What did you roll?
Matt: All right. You guys dart southward across the road, ducking into the alleys of the southern portion of the road, getting out of the visual range of the zombie giant that is making its way down the road, across your path. Heading southward, you dart through the back alleys and keeping free of the main central visual areas of the city, you eventually make your way to the corner that houses the Lady's Chamber. And as you guys see it--
Sam: Have we passed any people?
Matt: If you're keeping an eye out for that, yes. In some of the alleyway, you do pass a couple that are holding some, what looks like either scavenged groceries or some sort of food they have keeping close to themselves.
Sam: Can I go talk to them?
Matt: You can, indeed.
Laura: I'm going to come with you.
Matt: All right. As they're both walking by, keeping the hush, they see you guys step in the same alley. They stop for a second, looking you over, give a nod.
Sam: Oi, excuse me? My papa sent me to send a present, a gift of sorts, to a Sir Keri? Kurion?
Laura: Kerrion?
Sam: Kerrion?
Laura: Kerrion?
Sam: We're just looking to see where we can deliver the gift.
Matt: Make a deception check.
Liam: Scanlan's forte. Come on.
Sam: 29. (laughter)
Matt: You both stop and the man gives her a look like he's trying to usher her along, pulling her arm and she goes, "No, honey, it's just a child." Walks up and leans forward and says, "If you're looking for Sir Kerrion, you'll find him in the extravagant abode to the southeast of the city."
Sam: The one right over there?
Matt: "No." And gives you a side look for a second and says, "You don't want to go find the Countess there. If you're looking for Sir Kerrion, you go to the southeast. Look for the brick building. That's where he stays. Near the farming area south of us. You're not from here are you?"
Laura: We're new to town.
Sam: She's blind.
Matt: "Well, just do what he says. Don't question. All right?"
Sam: Okay. I just need to bring him this sack of presents, or my papa will whip me pretty bad.
Taliesin: TMI.
Matt: "Then perhaps you could do that quickly."
Sam: You're so pretty and clean.
Matt: She blushes for a second, goes like, "You stay safe." And brushes the hair out of your eyes for a second and pinches your cheek a little bit, and there's a look of sadness in her eyes, almost like, what horrible fate befalls this child, if he's not careful.
Laura: I smack him on the back of the head and say: Let's go boy! Keep up!
Sam: I'm her seeing-eye boy. (laughter)
Matt: She rushes back to the side of the man with her and, "See, it's fine. Good luck!" And they both dart off down the alley again.
Liam: Sam Riegel, ladies and gentleman, he played Gavroche in Les Mis. Gavroche, right here, Gavroche.
Matt: On Broadway. Literally.
Taliesin: He is Oliver Twist.
Sam: (singing) Consider yourself! (speaking) Oh, that's a different show.
Taliesin: I was ready! I was ready.
Matt: All right, so. You make your way southward to probably what's the second largest road intersection in this city. Away from the Sun Tree square. You can now see the temple to Erathis here. And it is a large stone half dome amphitheater set up where it's built outward to face the actual crossroads. And there is a courtyard built around it, a small stone wall about three feet tall, that encapsulates this area. There is a couple of trees, but there isn't a lot of grass, most of it's just stonework-- Erathis being the goddess of civilization. You know, it has an interesting duality and disrespect to Melora and all unbridled nature. Things that are controlled and civilized are definitely her realm of expertise. But as you approach, like most of the grass here, it's pretty desolate and dead. Winter is definitely making its way to this part of the city. You do notice that surrounding it, there is dried ivy, and just a general feeling of solemn desperation and sadness. There are a few people scattered throughout sitting on benches, sitting in quiet contemplation. Some of them are clutching small holy symbols and doing a prayer to themselves while rocking in the bench. You do see within the dome, there is a group of about four people that are all sitting, looking up to a man, an older man with a thick, white mustache and receding white hair. His gray robes he's wearing look weathered. You recognize him. While you haven't had too much interaction, not being much of a pious man, in any form of religion from your history, but you do know, Keeper Yennen is the head priest of Erathis here and is currently giving the tail-end of a small sermon to those here. Hearing him, he speaks words of comfort talking of, through these dark days, we must bind together as a community. We have to ensure that our livelihood and our existence is kept, and we look out for our fellow man. There is solace in the friendships and bonds we keep here. And best not to upset those that wish to keep us down. Erathis looks over us. There will be a time in which our salvation will come. And he goes into this very rallying speech and trying to lift the spirits of those around.
Marisha: You said there was 40?
Matt: Four.
Marisha: Four. Right.
Sam: But they're allowed to assemble?
Matt: Yeah. There's four around him in the amphitheater. There are probably another ten or so scattered about the various ground surrounding it, just doing their own private prayer.
Taliesin: Do I have an opinion on Yennen?
Matt: Yennen? From your previous experience and what you've heard is a very-- can be a bit arrogant in his worship, but not in a way that is considered dangerous or impactful to when the de Rolo families were in rule. He does good for the people. Kind of a tool at times. But he practices well and he keeps the people's spirits up for those who worship.
Taliesin: We found him a bit obnoxious to our means and ends on occasion?
Matt: On occasion, but mostly just his personality. Nothing he's done personally. He's not a bad person, by any means. He's just, you know.
Taliesin: He's also not a lapdog.
Matt: Yeah. Strong-willed in his ideas.
Laura: Can we insight check him to see if it seems like he's changed at all, or if he's still that same douchebag or if he's--
Matt: You would have no basis of comparison. You would be the only one that has.
Taliesin: I'm going to walk up to the little meeting. Is it wrapping up right now?
Matt: It seems like it's winding down. He finishes the discussion about the bonds of community, speaks about this city sprang up from nothing, but has a greater destiny to itself. If not here at Whitestone, one day we will all go past these boundaries, these borders, and create our own cities. There is hope for this. And then begins to go into a couple of familiar prayers tailored specifically to the Erathis way of thinking, and then finishes and everyone looks up, bows their heads for a second and begin to stand up and walk away from the amphitheater as he turns around and begins to clear off one of the back benches for him to sit on.
Taliesin: I'm going to just walk up and start a conversation.
Matt: Okay. You walk up to him, he sits down. "Can I help you?"
Taliesin: Do you think there's any hope for Whitestone? Do you think there'll be a day the people can find happiness again?
Matt: "I can say this. If history has taught me anything, our people are a resilient bunch. There has been much death, opposition, to all the free peoples of these lands. And yet, they persevered and surmounted these odds. I think, though, to some degree a prison this town may have become, perhaps we ourselves cannot see the distant ends. It's easy to misinterpret the means of those that would oppress us. But we can't go too long before the world at large can see the atrocities committed, the terrible entities that walk these streets."
Taliesin: Do you think there will come a day that these people can seize freedom for themselves against their oppressors?
Matt: "I look forward to a day in which there can be a beacon of outside hope. From the inside, I fear many wills have been torn asunder. I'm sorry. Forgive my manners. Welcome to the Lady's Chamber. You are unfamiliar to me." And he looks out at you guys standing at the peripheral of the amphitheater. "Travelers?"
Taliesin: Yes.
Matt: "I fear the cold winter is looming. An ill omen takes this city, friends. You may stay to give worship, if you will, then I recommend you continue on your way. There is little here but dying tradition."
Taliesin: I have a prayer to give.
Matt: "Interesting."
Taliesin: I pray for a day to come when outside forces can rally the people of Whitestone again. That strangers may come and bring with them salvation, and that the people will seize it.
Matt: "You speak in strange confidence for a traveler."
Taliesin: Look for signs, Keeper Yennen. Look for signs. I'm going to hand him a piece of parchment.
Matt: "Signs of what, I might ask?"
Taliesin: Salvation. Good day to you, sir.
Liam: Act cool. Everybody act cool.
Taliesin: We walk south.
Travis: We walk south. We leave.
Taliesin: And you know what I've left him.
Matt: Yeah. As you're walking away, you hear his voice call out after. "Wait! What does this mean?" He pulls the parchment forward, revealing the symbol of the top of the de Rolo family crest.
Taliesin: That... (sighs) What appears dead may not necessarily be death. And that with the shadow of death over the city perhaps there is life deep underground. Perhaps things that appeared ended and gone are perhaps continuing to this day. And may rise again.
Matt: Go ahead and make a persuasion check. Give you advantage on this.
Taliesin: 16.
Matt: Nods his head slowly, looks back at the sheet. Looks back at you with a discerning look.
Taliesin: He's definitely not going to--
Matt: Oh, not at all. You look like a dirty peasant right now. Takes it and hastily closes it and folds it and puts it in the pouch. Steps back over and gathers some of his loose tea leaves-- he was making himself some tea-- and looks about shiftily, calls over one of the other worshipers and begins talking with them as you guys walk away.
Taliesin: Let's head south.
Travis: South it is.
Sam: To the--
Laura: To the house?
Sam: To the house.
Taliesin: Kerrion Stonefell's stately manor.
Marisha: So wait, which mansion were we at?
Sam: The Countess.
Laura: The Countess.
Taliesin: Countess Anna Ripley.
Marisha: Which mansion is that out of the three?
Taliesin: That's the northeastern one.
Marisha: That's the northeastern one?
Laura: And she was which? Who was the Countess again?
Taliesin: I'm assuming if it is who I suspect it is, it's Countess Anna Ripley.
Sam: And who is she to you?
Taliesin: She is a terrible person.
Sam: Wait, she's the one who killed a bunch of your people, right?
Marisha: She's the doctor, right?
Taliesin: She's the doctor.
Laura: Oh, she is the one!
Travis: Do we get to kill her?
Taliesin: I hope so. But let's-- one at a time. If we're lucky, maybe one a day.
Marisha: Well, okay.
Travis: Like a vitamin?
Sam: Like a Flintstone's vitamin. Except it's assassination.
Taliesin: (coughs)
Sam: Do you need some healing? Are you okay?
Taliesin: I'm fine. I'm fine.
Sam: Scanlan can make you feel good.
Taliesin: I'm fine.
Travis: (laughs) He can make you feel real good.
Laura: Can I go up and ask Keyleth, outside of his earshot, to maybe cast some sort of restoration on him, without-- He's fighting it. I don't think he's feeling well. Can you heal him?
Marisha: I'm mean, yeah. He's going to feel it once I cast it on him, but I can try.
Laura: He looks cold and kind of slimy, and he's coughing a lot.
Travis: Wow, that's harsh. Looks cold.
Sam: He's probably been up tinkering all night.
Liam: Who are you to talk, Crazy Eyes?
Laura: I know.
Taliesin: I look like like a dirty peasant right now.
Laura: No, that's true.
Marisha: I don't know if my-- I don't know if Greater Restoration will work.
Laura: All right.
Taliesin: Should only take 20 minutes to get to the house, shouldn't it?
Matt: Yeah. Approximately.
Taliesin: We're not passing anything interesting on the way, are we?
Sam: Any other safe houses? Potential candidates?
Matt: I mean, there are plenty of houses that currently don't show signs of life.
Taliesin: I was thinking mostly of the barracks or the Alcove.
Sam: Yes, but after we kill this thing, we're going to need to know where to go.
Taliesin: Got some thoughts.
Sam: Thoughts? We need a place to retreat to immediately.
Taliesin: The Lady's Chamber.
Sam: It's an amphitheater isn't it?
Taliesin: There's quarters. They'll be able to hide us.
Marisha: What makes you think they're going to hide us?
Taliesin: Hunch.
Sam: Shouldn't we have a backup plan, in case they turn us out onto the street?
Taliesin: Actually, my thought was if we take care of Stonefell, why don't we hide in his house?
Laura: Nobody will know, right? Let's do it!
Sam: That's a good plan. They probably have some good wine.
Travis: I always wanted to be a lord.
Sam: All right. Let's go assassinate someone.
Marisha: Percy? I don't mean to beat a dead horse or anything, but--
Taliesin: If it would make you feel better, you can do whatever you like, but I think it's just a tickle.
Marisha: No. You're sure about all of this?
Taliesin: This has been what I've been working for for years. I'm not going to lose-- I was surprised last time. I've had time to think about it. I'm going to be all right. And I'm keeping it together. I'm not going to pretend that I'm great. But I've got a hold on it.
Sam: They also have technology, now. They have weapons, guns, that they're developing. It could be a threat to many, many other people.
Marisha: Well, that I'm fine with. No, not that I'm fine with. I mean, I'm fine helping prevent that. I'm just more worried about your sanity than anything else.
Taliesin: I've got a hold. And I respect that if you think that I'm slipping, you'll let me know.
Marisha: Okay. You followed me into the fiery abyss, so--
Taliesin: If that isn't a sign that I must be crazy, I don't know what is.
Marisha: Touché. I'll follow you, though. I'll follow you to the end.
Sam: As the oldest among us, I say that he's fine.
Taliesin: Are you actually the oldest among us?
Sam: Well, I assume so. How old are you people?
Laura: What?
Travis: Me?
Sam: Yeah.
Travis: Somewhere between one and 50.
Liam: Well, I'm 27, but I don't know how old she is.
Matt: And with that, rainfall begins to hit upon the city--
Laura: Oh no.
Sam: Let's go.
Matt: The ground immediately becomes thick with mud and sludge as you begin making your way through the city to the eastern side.
Marisha: I go puddle hopping!
Taliesin: This is not a happy place.
Travis: Low key.
Liam: Low key.
Marisha: Oh. I look miserable.
Taliesin: Look wet.
Travis: I take the Dust of Tracelessness to void out any footprints in the mud.
Liam: It's been washed away with the rain.
Matt: You do it. As you walk along, you do, some of the mud shifts behind you. It can be a little conspicuous if you're not careful.
Travis: Oh. Not my normal flower girl routine; maybe it's like the old Shawshank Prison walk. (laughter)
Taliesin: The old Shawshank Prison walk.
Matt: All right. The Alcove is a little ways north. It would take some time. You're pushing at like 10:30 in the morning at this point, around 11AM. Are you going straight to the supposed homestead of Kerrion Stonefell?
Laura: Let's do it!
Liam: We're going straight there?
Laura: Yeah.
Taliesin: We're going straight there.
Matt: All right. You bee-line it. You're all getting cold from the wet rain that is now soaked through your clothes. You make your way, and this home is a deep, red brick in construction. This house was not here when you lived here. It looks like what house was here has been demolished and rebuilt with sturdy masonry. It's a two-story building. There appear to be two guards currently set outside. Two regular leather-armor looking, more thugs than guards, but they're just both keeping under the overhang at the front porch to keep dry and grimacing at the weather. There is a gate around it. This gate is more for purpose than visual presentation. It's a black iron, nasty, jagged, rusty-looking gate. Not too dissimilar to the one that surrounded the graveyard. It's about a 20-foot walk from the gate entrance to the front step of the actual building itself. How do you want to approach this?
Taliesin: Let's walk around the back, I think.
Liam: As we walk up, I'd like to trail back by Grog in the rain. The killing's going to start soon. It's not going to stop. We're going to protect them. All of them. (laughter)
Liam: Yeah, big guy?
Travis: Yeah.
Liam: All right.
Sam: Vax, you have your daggers back, right?
Liam: I got them all.
Laura: I put a couple arrows in the holy oil that we have.
Matt: All right. Each holy oil is essentially three--
Laura: Oh, can I just dip one arrow in, then, right now?
Matt: Mark that off from one of your holy oils, you have one of three uses of that, and that that arrow does have a holy oil essence.
Sam: Percival? If we get in there, what are the chances that this gentleman, Sir Kerrion-- Korean--
Taliesin: You can mispronounce his name. It's fine.
Marisha: Sir North Korean.
Taliesin: Sir Starbucks, yes.
Sam: Sir Starbucks. What are the chances that he's going to be in a coffin? Sleeping?
Taliesin: 50-50.
Sam: Okay. All right. Good to know.
Travis: Would it be worthwhile to maybe say that the little boy and the old lady were caught hoarding crops and we brought them to this guy, see if we can draw him out of his house?
Sam: Ooh, that's a cool plan. I like that plan!
Marisha: It is raining.
Sam: Oh, wait, but I would be bait?
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: Okay, fine.
Taliesin: Let's take a long walk around the house to see if there's a way in through the back.
Travis: Okay.
Marisha: It's dark. It's raining.
Taliesin: And I can't imagine that many people attempt to infiltrate this house.
Liam: How dark is it?
Matt: I mean, it's overcast, but it's getting closer to noon. Even though you can't see the sun, and it is dark clouds overhead, it is still a general universal storm light. Darkened daylight.
Travis: Once around?
Marisha: Does it look like it's going to pass soon?
Matt: No. It looks like it's probably going to be here for most of the day at the very least.
Sam: The rain will dampen the screams from inside. So we go around once? Once around?
Matt: Okay. Perception checks all around.
Sam: Perception check.
Liam: I'm looking specifically for ways in the building other than the front door.
Sam: I'm looking for clouds because I rolled a two.
Travis: Four.
Taliesin: 21.
Laura: 24.
Liam: 20.
Marisha: 21.
Matt: All right. I will say above 20s, you guys notice there is a cellar door outside the building that descends beneath it. There's no indicator as to whether or not it's attached to the house or if it's just an exterior cellar that you can enter from the outside. You do also see there are a number of windows around the household that are all currently closed that lead into the interior. You're uncertain if they're locked or open. There's a little bit of light from the inside.
Marisha: Like candlelight?
Matt: Like candlelight or lantern light, the darkened exterior has made most of the sunlight that would warm a building or light it up from the inside has been cut off by the rainstorm. So, there is a necessity for internal lighting.
Marisha: Is there any sign of windows that are blacked out?
Matt: No, but you do notice that one of the windows to the far back side of the building where most of the light's coming from-- occasionally the light does seem to shift or a shadow moves past it. There's movement within that room nearish that window.
Sam: They're watching TV.
Laura: Probably. I cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us.
Sam: Ooh, thank you!
Marisha: Are we going through the cellar?
Sam: Is our meal still affecting us?
Taliesin: Until two.
Sam: Yes! Let's go in quick!
Laura: Is it possible to see what the movement is, who it is inside that window?
Matt: Not from this 25 to 30-foot distance from the building and you guys trying to be inconspicuous.
Liam: There's nothing between us and the building?
Matt: There is the gate. The gate, and what looks to be a few rocks and a couple small trees that are on the actual grounds of the house surrounding it.
Laura: Is the cellar door hidden from view of everything or is it out in the open?
Matt: Which one?
Laura: The cellar door that we saw.
Matt: The cellar door is out in the open, buttressed against the back of the house. It's up against the ground on the side. It has two doors that open up and lead into the cellar below.
Laura: Does it look like anybody can see us?
Matt: From where you're standing? No. You're going to be hardpressed to get across without being in sight of somebody if someone were nearby.
Marisha: We're between a fence, right?
Matt: You're on the outside of a fence.
Travis: Do we want to try to draw them out or get to the cellar? Either way, those two thug guards are going to die.
Marisha: There are guards?
Laura: There's two guards.
Sam: There's two guards.
Matt: They're currently not in visual range of you. They're guarding the front of the building. You guys moved around back. So you don't see the two guards currently on the opposite side of the house.
Travis: What's the fence made out of? Is it the spear-y shit?
Marisha: Is it poky up top?
Matt: It is poky. yes.
Travis: It is poky.
Matt: It's not super sharp poky, but there's iron rods.
Travis: So, I could throw Scanlan over.
Liam: If you roll a two, you can get hurt.
Matt: Yeah, if you rolled poorly, it's going to deal some damage.
Sam: Should we do a diversion for the guards?
Laura: They can't even see us, though!
Sam: Yes, but once we go through the fence, they might. I don't know. All right, you want to sneak in?
Taliesin: Let's try to sneak in and leave the guards there unless they notice us and then we'll just (thwip thwip).
Sam: All right, sure!
Travis: How do we sneak in past them?
Taliesin: You want to try to pull one of the wrought irons off, maybe?
Travis: I'd be down for that.
Sam: If I puffed some smoke, would it draw attention to us?
Taliesin: Yes.
Sam: Okay, then never mind.
Taliesin: It's raining. We can make a little noise, it'll be okay.
Liam: Where are the guards in the front?
Matt: They're currently on the opposite side of the building. If you guys are looking at the back. They're in the front of the building guarding the front door.
Liam: Inside the gate at the house?
Matt: Correct.
Marisha: Want me to heat up that metal bar for you?
Liam: We still have to go over and in.
Travis: Sure.
Laura: Let's just up and over the bar, athletic it. Acrobatics it?
Liam: Grog, can you bend that shit open?
Matt: Your donkey's still there beside you.
Laura: Fuck!
Liam: Yeah, well, if Grog can frigging make a hole in there--
Travis: Can I try and Lou Ferrigno those bars?
Matt: You're more than welcome to. Go ahead and make a strength check.
Marisha: The bar that he's--
Taliesin: Lou Ferrigno-ing.
Marisha: -- Lou Ferrigno-ing, I'm going to cast Heat Metal.
Sam: Is that going to burn his hands?
Marisha: Put on some gloves.
Travis: I don't have any gloves.
Marisha: Spit in your hand a little bit. Grip and bear it.
Sam: It's raining. It'll be fine.
Matt: So, you cast Heat Metal on the bars and a certain area of this gate begins to glow with a dull orange to become a brighter orange, and portions of it going whitish-hot in places.
Sam: Why don't you just hit it with something?
Laura: Wrap your hands.
Marisha: You can use your axe.
Matt: The rain, by the way, is puffing against it and evaporating as it impacts the now-heated metal.
Sam: But that'll be loud!
Marisha: You do you! You do you, Grog.
Travis: I rolled a 23.
Matt: 23? Okay, you reach over and grab it, your hands smoking on the-- use the pain! Use the pain and pull down the bars. You get a large portion of the gate to actually bend downward into an arc, causing the whole gate to fold inward on that side, making it much easier for anyone to pass through. However, you do suffer nine points of fire damage from the burn and your hands are currently scalded.
Taliesin: Now we can get Trinket in!
Liam: That's a hangnail on his pinky toe.
Travis: It's all right.
Marisha: I go ahead and I cast Healing Word on his hands.
Matt: Okay. So it's 1d4 plus six. She's rolling it.
Marisha: Ooh! 11.
Travis: Hey, back to full!
Matt: So, the scarring stays for a bit. You do smell the burning flesh, but there's no lasting wounds on your hands.
Taliesin: You can check to see if there's a lock on the cellar door?
Liam: Yeah, sure.
Travis: We gotta make it across the lawn first.
Laura: Well, we're in the back of the house.
Liam: Well, we're all just walking very quietly.
Laura: We're stealthing.
Matt: So, everyone make a stealth check.
Taliesin: We have advantage?
Matt: No, everyone gets plus ten to their stealth. You have disadvantage on the stealth check, though.
Sam: Plus ten.
Matt: Yes, plus ten to your stealth roll.
Sam: 17.
Travis: 23.
Liam: 34.
Laura: 32.
Marisha: 34.
Taliesin: 26!
Matt: All righty. You guys all keeping low and quickly darting across the grass field. You make your way, pattering across the somewhat slick grass. The rain is a little warmer than the frost that kept the grounds frozen as the morning came to. So, it's a little slick, but you make your way to the back of the building. You're still loosely out in the open, in a weird way, so you don't want to be out in the open for a long period of time. This isn't a safe place. You're currently, apparently made it to this side of the building unnoticed. But you don't want to stay here very long because you are visible to anyone who's on either side of the gate exterior.
Liam: I'm going straight to the cellar door.
Laura: Up against the wall of the building.
Liam: I give it a little (clunk) to see what I feel.
Matt: It is locked. It does gives resistance.
Liam: I get to work.
Marisha: Do your thing.
Laura: I feel like it's been a while since you've done this.
Liam: Did what?
Laura: Lockpicking.
Liam: I already did it earlier when you weren't here. 14, that's 27.
Matt: 27. You reach over, without even looking. You grab the lock; you're familiar with this kind of lock. (clicking) You take the lock off the chain. The chains fall loose against the opposite side of the, or the inside of the door. You pull it open. It's dark inside. You can see the dry stone steps that lead down below the building as rain starts darkening them with drops that are hitting them.
Liam: I lean my head in really fast and just see if I can hear anything, and roll a one.
Laura: Could I stealth in a couple of steps look around and see if there's anybody in there, or hear anything?
Matt: Okay. Make a perception check.
Liam: No, I said it's good! It's good! Let's go! Right? You agree. We're never wrong!
Laura: 19.
Matt: 19. Listening to the inside. The smell's a little musty, like a cellar you'd expect. But a little bit of dust and untouched earth. There's nothing down there; no movement, no sound.
Laura: It's clear, let's go! Ish!
Matt: You all drop in. Darting into-- which is good, because you notice around the corner one of the giants is turning the corner. You all dive inside, close the cellar doors. Bringing you to the interior.
Laura: I wonder if they're going to notice that fence.
Sam: They might.
Matt: You hear the pattering of rain across the wooden doors of the cellar. You made your way down underneath. And it is pitch black. There is no light source down here.
Liam: I pull out my Flametongue Dagger.
Matt: Okay. A little bit of flame causes enough candlelight to see the surface. And it is a wine cellar.
Travis: I have Darkvision.
Marisha: I'll go ahead and use my flaming hands.
Matt: Okay, so with an instant of will, all of a sudden flames burst around-- [no audio]
Matt: -- is a small ladder in the corner that seems to lead up to a latched door that leads to the interior of the house.
Laura: I got up to it and listen.
Matt: Make a perception check.
Laura: I don't hear anything, you guys. I think it's fine!
Liam: My ears are bigger than yours. Let me have a listen. Get down.
Laura: Yeah! Your ears are huge compared to mine!
Liam: Definitely, look at them!
Matt: Your sister assures you she heard--
Laura: There's nothing there!
Liam: I don't hear anything, either. I think we should just bust in.
Sam: Okay!
Travis: Wait.
Taliesin: (whispers) Quietly!
Marisha: Wait, hang on! Grog just said wait!
Liam: I keep forgetting the rogue skill, so really I rolled a 20.
Sam: Wait, what? You rolled a three and it becomes a 20?!
Liam: For perception, I can no longer roll lower than ten, unless I roll a one. But if it's a two or nine, it's actually a ten for me.
Laura: That's awesome.
Matt: Rogues are pretty cool.
Taliesin: That's crazy.
Laura: Yep, rogues are awesome.
Travis: Rogues are whatever.
Matt: So you put your ear up to it and listen carefully. And you hear pacing footsteps creaking against wood no more than maybe four feet away from you.
Liam: Is that one person?
Matt: One person stops and then moves again, then moves again almost like there's pacing, and you hear low voices. It's a conversation; there's two voices. You hear one voice very muffled, but it seems to be similar to the voice of the gentleman that came across you guys on the street that actually briefly talked to Percy the day before.
Liam: The old guy; the balding guy?
Matt: The balding guy with the long stringy gray hair.
Liam: He's just reporting in. He's his frigging money collector.
Matt: The other voice you don't recognize, and it's too muffled for you to make out anything. About four feet from you, not over the cellar, but off a ways to it. You're not certain where this doorway leads to, the level of muffling you can hear through the floor leads you to believe that they're not directly above you.
Liam: Not directly above. All right. There's nobody right above us, but there's people in the house.
Laura: They might be close.
Travis: Just to be clear--
Liam: No, they're on another floor or in another room.
Travis: Before we start  we're killing everything, right?
Taliesin: Yes.
Travis: Okay, good. Do we want to send one person out sneaky and then have a code word like Cheeto if it all goes wrong?
Marisha: Last time we did that, it went really well.
Travis: Did we do that before?
Liam: No, we didn't send anyone, I just--
Taliesin: Let's just go one room at a time.
Sam: One room at a time? We have to get up through this latch and there's people right above us!
Liam: Scanlan, you or me? You want to go invisible, or do you want me to creep in?
Sam: I think you should have some fun, too. But before we do anything, do you want me to send a cloud up there of gross smoke to smoke out the area?
Liam: No.
Taliesin: No.
Taliesin: Let's not let them know we're here.
Laura: Wait, before we do this. Keyleth, can you maybe make the gate outside not look like it's all bent to shit?
Liam: Zombie guards aren't going to-- giants are stupid.
Sam: It'll be fine.
Liam: They're stupid. I mean, there are the guys out front.
Laura: Yeah.
Travis: It's fine!
Sam: What could go wrong? This is a stealth mission. We'll be in and out of here in six minutes if we do this right. Let's go! Go, go!
Marisha: Wait, are you going in? Are you infiltrating?
Liam: I'll go up and see what I see. Just above us, not far away.
Marisha: I touch Vax's shoulder and I cast Enhance Ability and I'm going to give you dex saves-- what do you want?
Liam: I'm good on that.
Marisha: What do you want advantage on?
Liam: Not dexterity. Constitution. I'm feeling a little weak.
Marisha: All right. Constitution.
Matt: What's this for?
Marisha: Enhance Ability. So I think it's called Bear's Constitution or something weird.
Matt: Advantage on constitution checks. Those are different from saving throws.
Laura: Oh.
Marisha: Checks.
Matt: But it does give him 2d6 temporary hit points, but those do not stack with the current temporary hit points you have. Constitution would not be of much benefit to you.
Travis: We could just set a fire down here.
Marisha: Okay. Do you want dex or anything?
Liam: I'm pretty dex-y already.
Marisha: Instead, I say, good luck.
Sam: Bonne chance! Vive la résistance!
Travis: All right.
Liam: I'm going to check and see if it gives at all or if there's anything to it.
Matt: (creak) It gives.
Liam: It gives. All right, so I'm going to go up.
Travis: Invisible or not?
Liam: No, stealthing up. All right. So, okay, hold on, I get advantage. 23.
Laura: Wait, no. Plus ten because Pass Without a Trace.
Liam: Oh, 33.
Matt: 33. You move it up, without a sound, dart up, catch yourself and lower it down carefully. Dark interior, you use your Flametongue Dagger to look inside. You are inside of a closet of some kind, a ten by five closet. There are coats and outfits around you. You can push them aside. This looks to be like a small storage room that has been repurposed as a closet of some kind.
Liam: I am listening intently and feeling through as many pockets as I can find around me.
Matt: Easily enough. As you put your ear to the door, they are talking immediately on the other side of this door. You are a room adjacent to it. You do manage to pocket from a few of the coats about 47 gold pieces in total.
Marisha: Who leaves that much in their coat pockets?
Travis: Dead people, that's who.
Liam: Can I make anything out through there?
Matt: You make out conversation. It seems to be between a voice you don't recognize and the gentleman earlier you met, basically saying, "With everything that's going on now, it's honestly very frustrating that these people wouldn't do their share of the bargain. I, myself, I've been doing my best to keep them in order, but at this point in time, I think we need to do another show of strength in order to keep them working as hard as we have been." Another voice calms him down and says, "Don't worry, don't worry. Keep it under control. At the very least, we should have to be ready, prepared. If what Lady Briarwood says, we should be having visitors any day now. And I would hate to be caught flat-footed. So, we're going to go ahead and gather our arms, going to make sure that we outfit the place the best we can. Traps, alarms, whatever is necessary to make sure that we are not caught off-guard." (laughter)
Marisha: This is about to be hilarious!
Matt: You guys came at just about the right time.
Liam: I'd like to-- everybody hold.
Sam: Hold?
Laura: Hold.
Liam: I just want to wait for one minute and see what progresses.
Matt: Okay. The conversation continues. The older gentleman begins talking about, "I don't like the idea of there being any sort of conflict on our home turf. I wish they would just meet them out, head them off, cut them off at the head. Why did we invite them in here? That seems to be a dangerous circumstance."
Liam: While they're talking I say  we've got two gentlemen up here.
Sam: Two gentlemen!
Laura: Okay. I start climbing the--
Liam: I think it's time to start killing.
Sam: Grog up first!
Marisha: Places everyone, places!
Laura: Grog up before me.
Travis: It's opening night and I'm so excited! (laughter)
Matt: Stealth checks all around.
Laura: Plus ten!
Liam: Send up the goliath.
Marisha: That's good!
Travis: 29!
Sam: 18.
Laura: Plus ten!
Sam: That was plus ten.
Marisha: 32.
Taliesin: 28.
Laura: 34.
Matt: All righty. You all slowly make your way up. There's not enough room for all of you inside this room, this storage space.
Laura: Grog first.
Matt: Grog, you go up, you push open the door into the next room and it is a-- for lack of a better term, a music room. There's a few couches around, there's a piano set up.
Liam: Oh, it went closet to music room?
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: Oh, we're opening the door?
Matt: You guys are opening a door to a room next to-- the wall you were listening to is the room next to you. This opens up into a room adjacent.
Marisha: A music room! How regal!
Matt: So, as you push out into the room, it's dark in here. The only light that's coming in is from the nearby window. A little bit of sun's coming through from the rainstorm. You can still hear the rain pattering on the window and the second floor above you, there is no sound from the rain hitting the roof from this distance.
Liam: Dart my eyes around. Is there anything that's useful in here?
Matt: Not particularly; it's mostly decorative. Few vases, some books on the shelf. There is a door that is partially open that leads into hallway. A hallway that seems to connect the two rooms.
Liam: Which way are the voices coming from?
Matt: Yeah. The door is the opposite of the window and the room that you're in is adjacent to the room that the voices are coming from. The closet is in between the two.
Liam: Oh, between the two. So it is out, door, hallway?
Matt: Yes, out, door, hallway, and then the room where the speaking is coming from.
Sam: Do you want me to create a diversion of some sort? No?
Laura: Just run in, surprise him.
Sam: Are we going to go around?
Liam: So, we're stealthing, right?
Matt: Yeah.
Liam: So I pull both of their hands and I say--
Sam: Who's they?
Liam: Grog and Keyleth. I start pulling them through-- that's all right. Out the door. Along the hallway towards the voices.
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: Matt, that's a lot of maps you have down there.
Laura: Really? Really?! I'm offended. And I'm hurt.
Marisha: I look back at Vex and I just go--
Laura: I give you the worst evil eye I've ever given anyone.
Liam: Too bad one's going that way and the other's going that way.
Sam: As they go, I quickly lock eyes with Grog and I give him a quick little inspiration. (singing) Blood, glorious blood! Grog's about to take some. Dead dudettes and dudes, Grog's about to make some! (laughter)
Matt: All right, so take a d10 inspiration die. So, the three of you move on ahead. The rest of you-- Trinket is unable to climb.
Sam: Oh! Can I? Trinket  stay. (laughter)
Laura: I smack the back of your head again. And it's hard because I'm angry right now.
Travis: Do you have any of your rings on? Turn them inside and (impact noise).
Marisha: It's the mom slap, exactly! It's the grandma backhand.
Matt: All right, the three of you stand at the double doors. You moved around to the hallway. Is there a change to this arrangement that you would like? You currently have Grog, Vax, and Keyleth at the front, and three of you in the back.
Laura: Yeah, I want to stealth in behind Grog after they go into the room.
Matt: All right, so there you are. I'll put you on the side of the door there. You hear the voices from the other side of the door conversing and talking back and forth. Scanlan, Percy.
Marisha: Oh my god. Someone say something cool!
Matt: What's the plan?
Liam: I put my hand up in the air.
Sam: de Rolos, roll out!
Liam: And I click my boots together. (click) Feel that adrenaline rush.
Travis: I rage.
Liam: And I kick the door as hard as I can and go right in!
Marisha: (scream and cheer)
Taliesin: (scream and cheer)
Sam: (scream and cheer)
Matt: (impact noise) The door swings open, both of them slamming into the sides of these two bookcases. Immediately, you see behind the desk here and standing in the center.
Liam: It's Kiefer Sutherland.
Matt: You see the older gentleman in these long robes immediately spin his head and see, essentially, a troupe of armed villagers, peasants, dirty faces come rushing in. all fucked up eyes and all. Rushing into the room. They both turn, looking completely caught off-guard by this. You do also see in the room, there are a few guards that are just waiting off to the side. There's a couch area, there's a fireplace.
Marisha: Of course. Damn guards.
Matt: You guys get a surprise round.
Marisha: That's right!
Matt: So, let's go ahead and roll initiative to get the order of things here.
Travis: Advantage on initiative because I have that thing.
Sam: Are you alert? Do you have Alert? Is that what it is?
Travis: I have Feral Instinct.
Sam: Ooh!
Travis: Which I forget sometimes. That's better.
Sam: (sing with the battle music)
Laura: (sing with the battle music)
Matt: All right, so 25 to 20?
Travis: 20!
Taliesin: 23.
Matt: All right. 20 to 15?
Sam: 16!
Laura: Whoa! Look at you, Scanlan!
Sam: Better figure out what I'm going to do!
Matt: So, Scanlan is 16. 15 to ten?
Liam: 13.
Laura: 13.
Marisha: 13.
Liam: Half-elves!
Matt: Ten to five? Is that everyone?
Laura: That's all of us.
Matt: That's everyone, yeah.
Marisha: Bitches gonna die!
Matt: All righty! First, surprise round from all of you guys, catching them off-guard. Up first is Percy.
Marisha: Percy!
Taliesin: I'm going to pull into that empty-- Oh, I've got a button, don't I? I'm going to pull into that corner right there?
Matt: Over here?
Taliesin: And I'm going to take two shots at that soldier in the corner, that guard.
Matt: Okay. The guards, you can see, are wearing dark studded leather armor, no cloaks. Both have rapiers or stilettos, daggers on their sides. They look at the sudden intrusion and begin going for their weapons. You caught them off guard.
Taliesin: 22.
Matt: 22 does hit.
Taliesin: That's just a d10, where are my d10s? That's nine points of damage.
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: Another shot to him.
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: That's a misfire. I'm going to do a quick repair. And that's fine.
Matt: Does the repair take an action?
Taliesin: No, it takes a--
Matt: Okay, so you're fine. It does not break. Cool. That's your turn. One shot off. The blast rings out. As you fire the pepperbox, it misfires, and you quickly throw one of your tools in the air, catch it, and with one swift movement you unblock the passageway, click it back up into its place. Out of the corner of your eye, you turn, and for the first time in five years, you see, standing behind the desk, Sir Kerrion Stonefell. Visually, nearly the same as the last day you saw, except maybe a bit of white on the sides of the hair. Armored with a nice set of relatively ornate leather armor, blue hues and blacks. The hair itself is this tousled brown. There's a boyish charisma to him, if he wasn't such an asshole. And the moment you see him, there's this boiling rage from within just to have that moment of sight.
Taliesin: If you're lucky, you die last.
Matt: There's a look of complete confusion, as he has no idea who any of you are. You look like paupers that literally burst into his office. That ends your turn, Percy. Grog, you're up.
Travis: I hear him say that he has to die last, and in my rage, I race forward to that fuck in the middle of the room and I swing my Firebrand Warhammer at him twice!
Matt: All righty!
Travis: I would make to make this first one a new feat called Great Weapon Master.
Matt: All righty!
Sam: What does that do?
Matt: Minus five to hit.
Travis: I'm going to use my-- no, not on that one. That misses.
Matt: What did you roll?
Travis: A two! So that's 11. Yeah, that misses.
Matt: That definitely misses. As you swing in, (nervous yell) just ducks out of the way, and even though he's older, he reacted pretty quickly. Your weapon slams into the ground, splintering some of the wood. You peel back for a second attack.
Travis: That makes me even angrier. And now I'll use inspiration. 18... minus five, 23!
Matt: 23 does hit! Plus ten damage.
Travis: Okay. Plus eight is 13, 17, 27!
Matt: 27 points of damage, ooh!
Travis: Plus four for the fire damage, but still the 27 total.
Matt: So, as he ducks out of the way, you bring up the hammer a second time and (whack) smack him right square in the chest. (grunts) The wind escapes him for a moment and the flames lick across the front of his chest. He catches himself on the table between the sofa and chair behind him. Gets back on his feet. Looks to you for a second and pulls out two short swords.
Travis: That's the best thing you could have ever done.
Matt: "I don't know who you are, but you're going to regret this!"
Laura: What does Grog look like?
Matt: Grog looks like an oafish butcher. Tubby on the sides, an oldish, middle-aged looking man. Scruffy beard. Scanlan does his best on that one. Whatever other visual you want to--
Sam: Potbelly.
Matt: Huge potbelly. Grog, that ends your turn?
Travis: Yep.
Matt: All right. In theory, it is a surprise round. So you may have had advantage on that first strike, so go ahead and roll it.
Travis: (screams) 26. Minus five is 21.
Laura: 23. No, you're right.
Travis: Yeah. 21.
Matt: Roll damage again. We'll say this is an additional third strike in reaction to him pulling his blades out.
Travis: 32.
Sam: Jesus! God!
Matt: (wham) The hammer slams him a second time and he almost drops his weapons. The actual end table he's resting on shatters beneath him and he, (grunts) has to get back up onto his feet. Looking genuinely fearful now. That ends your turn.
Travis: You dropped your toothpicks.
Matt: Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: Okay, so he's been attacking the old guy.
Matt: Correct.
Sam: Those two flanking the big boss are just guards, right? They're just standard-issue guards?
Matt: Best you can tell, they're both in studded leather armor. They don't look like guards, like armored, they look like thugs that are essentially there to watch.
Sam: All right, well, I'm going to run in the room.
Matt: About how far in?
Sam: Make a left. I'm sorry, turn right, away from the action. And then I'll look at the guard behind and to the right of the big guy.
Matt: That guy there.
Sam: The good guy-- the bad guy.
Marisha: You got it.
Matt: That guy there?
Sam: No, this guy over here. And I'll Dominate him.
Marisha: Is that also a guard? There are three guards?
Taliesin: There are three guards.
Matt: All right, you're going to attempt to Dominate Person.
Sam: Yes. I pull up my hand cone and I say, (singing) You're as cold as ice! Willing to sacrifice your boss! And so I tell him to kill his boss. (laughter)
Matt: What's the DC on that?
Sam: 19.
Matt: Wisdom. He rolled a 17. That's a fail.
Travis: Yes!
Matt: He is currently Dominated by Scanlan.
Travis: (singing) Cold as ice!
Matt: Good to know. So, as he pulls his heavy crossbow out, loads it, and aims it towards you, looks over his shoulder for a second, and trains it on his boss. Sir Kerrion looking confused by this whole circumstance.
Marisha: Cool.
Matt: That ends your turn?
Sam: Yeah, that's it.
Matt: All right. Keyleth, Vax, and Vex, take your surprise rounds now.
Laura: Can I go first so I don't do any damage to you guys if you guys go in?
Marisha: I'm also probably going to do a ranged spell.
Liam: What are you guys talking about? Kill him!
Laura: I want to go in, peek my head in and shoot-- first, I'm going to shoot from my Longbow of Sky Sentinel. And I'm going to use-- it turns into three arrows for one of my attacks, so it's three more attacks, potentially?
Matt: Well, it's two additional attacks against the one arrow. So you'd get four attacks in one round, essentially.
Sam: Good god!
Laura: Okay! I'm going to do that! I'm going to attack him, the guy.
Matt: Which guy?
Laura: The bad guy.
Matt: There's two bad guys in there.
Laura: The one that's in charge. Kerrion.
Matt: Sir Kerrion? All right, go for it.
Laura: Yeah! 28.
Matt: 28 hits.
Laura: Okay, so I make an attack for all three arrows.
Matt: Correct. That was one of them. You fire it, it splits into three along the way, and you roll for each attack on each arrow.
Laura: Oh, that one doesn't hit. Well, probably not. 13?
Matt: No.
Laura: 18?
Matt: 18 unfortunately does not hit, either.
Laura: Jeez Louise, what a waste of a storm arrow.
Matt: And you still get a fourth attack with your second--
Laura: Yes.
Taliesin: Hunter's Mark?
Laura: That was the wrong thing. I can't; I'm going to Hunter's Mark him after this first one because it's a bonus action.
Taliesin: Oh, yeah.
Laura: What am I doing? 14, 15, 16, and then plus another d6, so it's basically like Hunter's Mark, right?
Travis: Nobody knows what you're doing. (laughter)
Matt: So the first arrow does an additional lightning damage.
Laura: 19 is the first one. And then I attack again. I'm going to Hunter's Mark him now. Can I do that?
Matt: You haven't used your bonus action, so yes you can. Two eyes going all--
Laura: 29.
Matt: 29 does hit, yes.
Laura: I'm so confused right now.
Liam: Us, too.
Laura: I know. 14 on the second one.
Matt: Okay, gotcha. So your arrows split, two of them embedding into the actual desk itself and exploding with a burst of electricity. A third one strikes him in the chest and you can see it stick in the armor and (boof) jolt him for a second. He backs up a little bit, catching himself on the edge of the desk as the final arrow comes and strikes him in the shoulder. He cuts off the shaft of the arrow as it hits (grunts) out of anger and frustration.
Laura: I totally shit the bed on that one, guys, and I apologize. I had things I wanted to do.
Sam: After she does that, I say  that was my grandma! (laughter)
Laura: That's right, boy!
Matt: This little boy.
Travis: Adding to the confusion.
Matt: Do you want to move at all? You would've had to move into the room to do that shot because you were outside in the hallway.
Laura: Huh?
Matt: You were in the hallway when that happened, so I'd say you'd have to be in the room to shoot them. Where would you want to be?
Laura: Oh, just right inside the door.
Matt: Right there in the door?
Marisha: What kind of armor is Sir Kerrion wearing?
Matt: Best you can tell, it looks like a very high quality studded leather.
Marisha: Studded leather?
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: Okay.
Laura: Can I say I peeked in to shoot and then went back around the side of the door?
Matt: Yeah, you can do that.
Laura: Yeah.
Travis: Keyleth, Vax.
Liam: Is it up to us?
Matt: You guys are the last ones to go.
Liam: Go.
Marisha: Okay, I'm going to cast Call Lightning. And I'm going to bring down a bolt. Here we go. This way. Right in between Sir Kerrion and this guard so they both have to save from it.
Sam: Take that, Sir Korea!
Marisha: Yeah!
Taliesin: Kerrion Stonefell.
Matt: As a thing of note, a storm cloud appears in the shape of a cylinder that is ten feet tall with a 60-foot radius centered on a point you can see in the air.
Marisha: Oh, so it's going to--
Matt: The room won't fit it, unfortunately.
Marisha: The room won't fit my storm cloud?
Taliesin: That sounds like a great song.
Matt: It says if you're in a room that can't accommodate the cloud, it can't appear.
Marisha: Pooper muffin. Okay. Well, then.
Matt: If you want to consider your next move, Vax can go.
Marisha: Yeah, go Vax.
Liam: I am running straight towards what's-his-name, Kerrion? Is at the desk, so I just run right towards the desk, I step against the desk, leap up in the air and go (stabbing sound) into his shoulders.
Matt: Right there?
Liam: Yeah, no, I'm on the desk in front of him, going for his chest.
Matt: Go for it.
Liam: First, and I get advantage on everything is a-- It's a 30! And this is surprise attack, so it's a critical hit plus the sneak attack damage. This guy is going down! One plus seven is eight-- what gets doubled?
Matt: Just the dice.
Liam: Just the dice? But not the sneak attack damage?
Matt: No, the sneak attack damage, as well, but just the modifiers don't get doubled.
Liam: Okay. So that was-- okay, two plus seven is nine. Nine, ten, 11, 12, 18, 23, 29, 33, 66 for the first attack, darling.
Sam: 66?!
Liam: 66! Here comes the second dagger into him at advantage.
Marisha: 66?!
Matt: Surprise rounds.
Liam: Is 28, so that obviously hits. And that is seven. And then the third dagger comes down. Is 29, and that also hits. So I've shanked his ass, that's an eight. (stabbing noises)
Sam: That's 15, is 70-- is 81.
Matt: Yep. 81 points of damage in one round of combat. As you land on the desk, your daggers bypass the armor and they find their way through the top of the armor and sink past the clavicles into the deep portion of the chest. He (choking noise) from the impact and you hear him choke and blood splatters up from his throat. He reaches up and grabs your hands and lifts them off out of the wound. You see a gout of blood pour from the wound as you reach back and stab him a third time with the dagger as you catch yourself on the desk. He reaches up and kicks you, forcing you to get back on your feet with your daggers at the ready. The blood's beginning to pour. It's not a mortal wound, but it's looking really bad for him. He's not on death's door, but that definitely took him down a few pegs.
Liam: I give him a Vex wink.
Matt: (laughs) He looks at you and growls. Draws two rapiers from his side.
Travis: Two rapiers?
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: He draws two rapiers? Do we get any indication by what we just saw if he might be a vampire or something?
Matt: Make an insight check.
Marisha: I can make an insight check? Ooh, yeah! 27.
Matt: 27. Nothing yet has given away any sort of essence of that. He doesn't look particularly pale.
Taliesin: He's also aged. He's a bit peppered.
Marisha: Yeah, he has aged.
Matt: He definitely looks wounded and unhappy.
Liam: Can I ask a technical question?
Matt: Sure.
Liam: According to Assassinate, any hit I score against a creature that is surprised is a critical hit. Any hit. So are the two subsequent attacks--
Matt: After the first hit--
Liam: That's sneak attack. This says, "in addition, any hit you score against a creature that is surprised is a critical hit."
Matt: Right. Okay.
Sam: Any? He wouldn't be surprised after the first one.
Matt: I'm usually under the impression that after the first hit, they're no longer surprised. They know you're there.
Liam: Okay. Okay. Got it.
Travis: (grunts) Ow! (grunts) Ow?!
Liam: Well, I thought they were like 0.3 seconds apart, so I thought it was so fast.
Matt: That's true. I'll allow it.
Travis: Oh!
Taliesin: What?!
Travis: Double what?
Liam: Double the last two attacks. Which were much less.
Sam: It was 15, so it becomes 30.
Matt: Yeah. Okay. So, yeah, he's not happy. Really not happy. Okay. All right. That ends your turn. Keyleth, what are you doing?
Marisha: All right, I'm going to do some fun shit. So seeing Vax go up and get next to Lord Kerrion or whatever the shit his name is. I'm going to go and turn into a dire wolf this time. Mixing it up from Minxie.
Taliesin: That's like a normal wolf.
Marisha: But slightly bigger.
Taliesin: But dire.
Marisha: But dire. It's white, a wintery wolf from the mountains that I'm from.
Matt: You are now filling up the entirety of the double-door frame right now.
Marisha: I'm going to rush and use my pack tactics and flank Lord Kerrion.
Matt: At your size, you can't quite get to him, unfortunately. You can try and move around this way, maybe. You will probably take an attack of opportunity from this guy, but you can try and move around.
Marisha: Oh, from a random shithead? Yeah, let's do it.
Matt: What's your movement?
Marisha: 50 feet.
Matt: Yeah, you can do that. You move around and you get over there.
Marisha: Is that flanking?
Matt: It's not flanking, no. Yeah, it's not flanking per se. I mean, you're adjacent to him. You'd have to be on opposite sides to flank.
Marisha: I know, that's what I was trying to get. All right. Well, then, since Vax has that guy, I'll go for this guy. Take him out.
Matt: Okay. So you move into that guy there.
Marisha: Okay.
Sam: That is the most peasant-looking direwolf ever.
Matt: Yeah, this little peasant girl just went (growls).
Marisha: Ooh, that was a 19 to hit.
Matt: That'll hit.
Marisha: Okay, 2d6 plus three. That's not great, four, five, six, seven, eight piercing damage, and then do I also-- oh, and he has to make a DC 13 strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
Matt: He rolled a 12.
Marisha: (cheers) So he's down.
Matt: He's knocked prone. How much damage was it?
Marisha: Not a lot. What did I say, six?
Matt: Six points of piercing damage?
Marisha: Yes.
Matt: He's knocked prone. (impact sound) Falls on the ground.
Marisha: Do I get my fiery stuff for that?
Matt: What attack was it? Was it bite?
Marisha: Bite.
Matt: No.
Marisha: Okay. Okay, he's down.
Matt: All right. Is that your turn?
Marisha: Yep.
Matt: All right. That ends the surprise round. Now we're at the top again. Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: I'm going to take one step forward. I'm going to shoot that guard once, one more time.
Matt: The one over here?
Taliesin: Yep.
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: Fuck it, I'm going to try sharpshooter. And that's 14, 15, 21 to hit?
Matt: 21 hits.
Taliesin: That'll do 19 points of damage. Actually, that's more than 19 points, because it's a fire shot, so 19 plus two, so 21 points, with two points of fire damage in there.
Matt: 21 points of damage. All right, (gunshot sound) you fire. There's a burst of flame that gouts out the side of the pepperbox, (impact sound) blasting into the chest of the guard off to the side. He's thrown against the wall from the sheer force of it. Reaches down and grabs his chest and looks at it, and you can see there's this red crimson across his hand, as you've actually blown a piece of his leather armor open and you can see the wound in his chest. There's a little bit of blood trickling out of his mouth, and he looks angry at you.
Taliesin: I'm shooting him again. (laughter)
Taliesin: That's 17.
Matt: 17 hits.
Marisha: Nice.
Taliesin: That's 21 points of damage.
Matt: 21 points of damage, nice. (gunshot) You blast him, this time on the other side of the shoulder, you can see now this armor is now torn open exposing the wound here and his arm's now hanging to one side. He's (grunts). He's looking in severe pain and barely hanging on at this point.
Taliesin: Fall, damn it. Shooting him again.
Marisha: Kill him!
Taliesin: That's 20 to hit.
Matt: 20 to hit. It hits.
Taliesin: Eight points of damage.
Matt: Eight points of damage. All right, this is the final one as he's looking at himself; he's like (pained noises), angrily looks at you, picks his crossbow up and aims it at you. Before he gets a chance to, you aim your third shot, (gunshot) firing, hitting him right in the center of the head, (impact noise) blasting out part of his face, his body spins, and then he falls over into the plant in the corner, slumped over it there.
Taliesin: I finish walking almost into the corner over there, right next to him, about there. Spend an action surge, taking three more shots at Kerrion.
Sam: Whoa.
Marisha: Yeah!
Sam: Damn.
Taliesin: This is a sharpshooter round.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: That's 19, 26 to hit.
Matt: 26 hits.
Marisha: Do you crit on a 19?
Taliesin: I don't crit on a 19.
Marisha: Fuck!
Taliesin: Oh, that'll do. 24 points of damage plus a point of ice damage. So, 25 points of damage.
Matt: Plus an additional d6 points of damage for that.
Taliesin: Yay! Because he's an asshole. That's six more points of damage.
Matt: So, as you go around and fire from the barrel, the shot fires out. And as you recoil you guys, for those who are noticing off to the side, this dark smoke's beginning to slowly pour out of Percy's body, out of his eyes and his ears and the hand on the gun. There's black smoke beginning to emit from his body and beginning to envelop the gun arm.
Sam: What?
Marisha: We all see this?
Matt: For those who are paying attention, which right now would be pretty much just Scanlan and Vex.
Sam: You're weird.
Taliesin: So you don't see shit. Shut up.
Marisha: I'm not crazy! No, and I'm at this guy's throat.
Taliesin: I'm going to take a quick reload, and I'm going to fire again, with Sharpshooter, and I'm going to do a head shot.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: So, I'm going to attempt to make him have issues doing things. Natural 20. (cheering)
Travis: The golden snitch strikes again!
Marisha: Yeah, it did! I can see it from here!
Matt: Damn!
Taliesin: I swear it's-- yeah.
Matt: With the additional d6, by the way.
Taliesin: What?
Matt: With the additional d6.
Taliesin: Does the d6 double or does it not double?
Matt: All dice rolled double. Then add the modifier.
Taliesin: This is going to be angry.
Marisha: Yeah it is!
Liam: Gunslinger warlock.
Taliesin: So.
Marisha: That's pretty "grood."
Taliesin: 42 points of damage. Of fire damage. 42 points, and that's with 5 points of fire damage. 42 points.
Matt: Okay. (gunshot) The first blast hits and you can see the cloak is blown off the shoulder and set aflame and actually burns to cinders in the corner. Sir Kerrion looks down and is like (grunts), and is looking very, very curiously. The second shot rings out (gunshot), and at this point now the smoke is wreathing your entire arm, the gun isn't even visible, it's just this giant column of smoke. (gunshot) The second shot rings out, this time hitting him in the side of the neck and the shoulder, blowing a chunk off of it so part of the bone is now sticking out it's like (noise of pain). He reaches back with his arm and is like with the rapier up, clutching it for a second and leans over and looks back over and is (pained panting) "Ripley."
Taliesin: Just as an action, as a bonus action, I'm going to remove my hat, and I'm just going to say: Drop it.
Sam: Will this take an action?
Matt: To drop the spell? You can do it on your turn.
Taliesin: On your turn, yeah.
Sam: Okay. I think that's next.
Matt: All right, so.
Marisha: He thinks it's Ripley. He thinks it's Ripley with the gun! Ripley's building guns!
Laura: It's Ripley that's doing the guns!
Marisha: Fucking Ripley!
Matt: So. That finishes Percy's turn. It is now Sir Kerrion Stonefell's turn. Kerrion's going to use a bonus action to use Second Wind.
Sam: Oh no, that's some sort of healing thing isn't it?
Taliesin: That's healing. It's not much healing.
Marisha: Wait, who's doing what?
Sam: He has 6,000 health points.
Marisha: Kerrion's healing? Is it a regeneration thing or is he casting a spell?
Taliesin: No, it's a fighter action.
Matt: And that was with the head shot, you said?
Taliesin: Yeah, it was with a head shot. So that means he has disadvantage on attacks for one round.
Matt: And deals damage, right?
Taliesin: And deals damage.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: I'm a good boy.
Matt: Sir Kerrion is going to, in the circumstance, is going to move this way just to hide alongside Vax, and since you're on top-- his both rapiers out, and you just jammed your daggers in, is going to do a flurry of four strikes against you.
Liam: Okay.
Matt: With disadvantage on all the attacks.
Travis: His clavicles sticking out of his shoulders.
Matt: Yeah.
Liam: I'll use Uncanny Dodge for the first one that hits.
Matt: 16, the first attack?
Liam: No.
Matt: All right. Rolled a one on the second. That is a 21 on the third attack. And, no, that's a 14 on the fourth attack. That disadvantage just-- swinging wide, gets one hit on you.
Travis: Get that clavicle; be working.
Liam: Yeah, Uncanny Dodge on that attack.
Matt: That is eight points of piercing damage against you.
Liam: So, four.
Sam: Ooh! That's nothing!
Liam: That's nothing.
Matt: That finishes Sir Kerrion. Sir Kerrion is now going to--
Sam: Turn invisible.
Matt: He's actually going to take a step back towards the wall. You get an attack of opportunity.
Liam: All right. I throw a dagger in his face.
Matt: All right.
Liam: That is a 28.
Matt: That hits.
Liam: That is eight points of damage.
Matt: All righty. Steps back and slams his fist against the wall (thudding).
Laura: Oh no!
Sam: Wait, who did that?
Laura: Kerrion.
Travis: Kerrion.
Laura: He's calling in backup.
Marisha: Wait, he's calling in backup? Shit.
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: So, that ends Kerrion's turn. Grog, you're up.
Travis: I keep smashing shithead that's in front of me!
Matt: Okay, go for it!
Travis: That's 24. These are just regular.
Matt: Yeah, 24 hits.
Travis: Oh, I should roll the other one first. Again, 24.
Matt: 24 hits. Are you going into a frenzied rage?
Travis: Regular rage. 23 on the first one.
Matt: All righty.
Travis: And 12 on the second.
Matt: Gotcha. (whack) Is this with the fire damage as well from the hammer?
Travis: Yes.
Matt: Yeah. so the hammer strikes across the back, the broadside of his shoulders and back. (grunts) Looks up at you and looks over at Sir Kerrion being annihilated behind the desk and is trying to nervously gauge his circumstance. Second strike smacks him upside his body and he's like (panting) and he's trying to take in the surroundings and figure out a plan. All right, are you going to stay where you are?
Travis: That's it.
Matt: It is now Master Vouk's turn.
Sam: Who?
Matt: You have not heard his name yet, but it's his turn.
Travis: The guy I've been smacking.
Taliesin: Mr. Rogaine.
Laura: I'm picturing him as what's-his-name in--
Taliesin: From Harry Potter.
Laura: Yeah!
Taliesin: Yeah. I know, me too.
Travis: Mr. Filch?
Taliesin: Filch. Filch on steroids.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: He's going to use a-- okay. He's going to use a bonus action to disengage from you. He's going to back away just one step that way. Use his action to--
Laura: He has magic?!
Marisha: Oh, he's going to Dimension Door out.
Laura: But Mr. Filch doesn't have magic.
Travis: Yeah, he's a squib!
Laura: He's a squib! Squibs can't do magic.
Travis: He knows this. He's making origami.
Taliesin: Don't you get an attack of opportunity?
Matt: Actually, instead, he's not going to use bonus action to disengage, he's going to use a bonus action to use Misty Step. Vanishes, reappears over by the wall. Uses the action to cast a level three Invisibility on both him and Sir Kerrion Stonefell. So they are both considered invisible at the moment.
Travis: With the Missy Elliot step, I don't get an attack?
Matt: Not from that, unfortunately; it's an immediate teleport. So he just vanishes from in front of you.
Travis: What the fuck?!
Matt: We'll say, for the purposes of this, they are both currently invisible. And that's going to end--
Taliesin: That soldier hasn't attacked yet, either.
Matt: Correct, his turn hasn't come up yet. Now it becomes Scanlan's turn.
Sam: Oh. Well, I can't see anyone who's alive who I haven't Dominated already, except for the guy under the dire wolf. I will remind all my fellows to keep one alive to spread our terrorist message and I will run out to the hallway and say, Vex, get inside. Because I know reinforcements are coming, I cast Stinking Cloud out into the hallways.
Matt: Okay. Stinking Cloud appears. What's the radius on that?
Sam: (singing) Stinking Cloud!
Matt: I think it's a 20-foot radius, isn't it?
Sam: It says 90-feet range, let's see here. 20-foot radius.
Matt: Okay, cool. So you just filled this entire hallway.
Sam: Yeah. Will it seep into the room as well?
Matt: You can keep it localized to that area, you'll just be in your own cloud.
Sam: Oh. Well, can I stop just short of the door?
Matt: You stop just short of the door and fill this whole area with a Stinking Cloud.
Sam: Sorry, Vex.
Taliesin: You can hold that action until she comes into the room.
Sam: Okay, I will hold that until she comes in the room.
Matt: Okay. So Stinking Cloud is not yet up. Okay.
Sam: Laura's next, I believe.
Matt: So, next round. You are up next.
Sam: And I will inspire her, as well.
Laura: Yay!
Sam: Do you want a d10?
Laura: Yeah.
Sam: Okay. (singing) Vex be nimble, Vex be quick! Vex jump under limbo stick! Now you don't know how you're going to react because Vex has an attack! Oi!
Travis: Amazing! How?! God! I don't get it!
Matt: You take your d10 inspiration. Confused, but accept the inspiration. A chuckle in the middle of a hearty battle is always worth a little inspiration.
Laura: All right, so I go in the room.
Matt: You step into the room. At that point, you trigger your action to release the Stinking Cloud. You want to stay there? You're just outside of the radius.
Laura: Yeah, I stay in the doorway. Actually no, I back-- well.
Matt: What are you doing, Vex?
Laura: Yeah, I'm staying right there. I can't see; is there a soldier right there next to the invisible guys, or is it just the invisible guys?
Travis: On that wall, it's soldier being eaten by Keyleth, and then invisible.
Sam: There two invisibles, and then another soldier who I have already Dominated. He still hasn't had a turn?!
Matt: Surprise round, and they're lowest on the initiative count.
Laura: Actually, I'm going to do Lightning Arrow because that gets everything within ten feet.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: I'm going to cast Lightning Arrow on the soldier on the ground.
Matt: Which one?
Travis: The one that Keyleth's attacking.
Laura: The one that Keyleth's attacking.
Matt: I will say you don't really have visual on him from that position.
Laura: Can I move to a place where I get it?
Liam: Do a bank shot off the ceiling.
Matt: Now you can see, yeah.
Laura: Awesome. Let's do it from there.
Matt: Okay, go for it. You have advantage on the attack roll because he is prone.
Laura: Nice. 27.
Matt: 27 hits.
Laura: Okay, so that is 4d8 damage to him.
Matt: All righty.
Laura: And then anything within ten feet has to make a dex save.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Is that including your brother?
Laura: Yeah, that's everything within ten feet.
Travis: It's also including invisible guys.
Matt: If it's ten feet, he's not there. It'd just be Keyleth and Sir Kerrion.
Marisha: 22. 21!
Matt: Makes it, 21, actually, exactly.
Laura: 19 to little prone soldier.
Matt: Okay, 19. As it snaps and it bursts, the electricity shockwaves out, he shakes and on the ground takes in the effect. The blast seems to-- is it half damage if they make the save?
Laura: To the little prone guy?
Matt: No, it's to anybody within radius.
Laura: Anybody within radius takes 1d8 if they make the save and then 2d8 if they fail.
Matt: Okay, so roll 1d8.
Laura: One.
Matt: Okay. So one damage to you, and one damage to Sir Kerrion.
Laura: Oh.
Matt: You see a spark of energy around the invisible form as it wavers in place.
Travis: That's good; at least he (electricity noise) around some.
Matt: All right. That ends your turn. Vax?
Liam: I saw that spark in the air and I start knifing right into it.
Matt: All right. Was that the last thing you wanted to do with your turn?
Laura: Yeah. Does the Hunter's Mark damage him, the invisible guy, still, if he gets hit with anything? Or is it just if I attack him with an arrow?
Matt: I think if you attack him. That was more of the burst in the vicinity.
Laura: Okay.
Liam: So, hearing him go (grunts) and seeing a spark right in front of me, I start knifing at that point.
Matt: All right. At disadvantage on all the attacks.
Liam: Disadvantage? But I get advantage, so it cancels out.
Matt: Why do you get advantage?
Liam: Oh, no, I don't. I'm sorry.
Matt: Disadvantage on weapon strikes because he's invisible.
Liam: The first one misses. That was it. So, the first two were terrible. That's terrible. That's also terrible. I whiff. I just (whooshing).
Matt: Yeah, you're swinging in the area, and you can't get blades to find any of his physical person. You're striking and arcing across the wooden wall behind him, causing these giant gashes. All right, that ends your turn.
Liam: Still bleeding!
Matt: Unless you want to stay where you are right there?
Liam: Yeah, I'm going to stay there.
Matt: You probably would've had to move up there to attack him. Oh, you're just throwing the daggers, right?
Liam: I back up. Is Keyleth on the desk?
Sam: No, she's next to the desk.
Liam: And I'm on the desk? No, I'll stay where I am.
Matt: Okay, so you're just throwing the daggers from the desk? Okay, that ends your turn. Now, Keyleth.
Marisha: Looking up and noticing that Sir Kerrion is gone and Vax is blindly stabbing into the distance, I'm going to drop my wolf form and cast Faerie Fire in that radius.
Matt: Drop your wolf form.
Marisha: 20-foot cube.
Sam: Mark that shit.
Marisha: Right here.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Realizing my party members are clearly stabbing at something.
Taliesin: I like it when he has to go to the book. Makes me feel like there's, perhaps, things he doesn't know.
Sam: Faerie Fire is an underused thing. It's really cool.
Matt: Yeah, so both of their forms all of a sudden are outlined by this sparking purple halo that shows you directly where they are.
Sam: Yes!
Matt: All right. So that's your turn? You going to move anywhere?
Marisha: I'll back up a tidbit.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Just back up a smidge.
Matt: Okay, as you back up an invisible form that just got revealed swings out at you with a rapier, an attack of opportunity.
Marisha: Yeah, sure, whatever.
Taliesin: But, he's--
Matt: At disadvantage on the attack. He has advantage on her because he's-- although--
Marisha: I can see him now.
Matt: You can see him, that's true.
Laura: This is confusing!
Matt: Faerie Fire kind of made this weird.
Travis: To the books again!
Matt: Indeed.
Marisha: Faerie Fire always makes it weird.
Taliesin: Ain't it the truth? Man, that Faerie Fire.
Matt: Just a minute, folks. Lot of overlapping effects, here, because everyone has magic.
Sam: Now's a good time to go to the store and check out Critical Role t-shirt--
Matt: Yeah, it doesn't benefit from Invisible. It's at disadvantage. It has disadvantage on the attack. That is--
Sam: Brand new t-shirt for sale, guys.
Matt: And 15.
Marisha: Miss.
Matt: Yeah, so (whoosh) as you back up. All right. That ends your turn. Now, this guard gets up, (grunts) gets his crossbow, aims it up and, looking around the room, aims it, this would be-- seeing his friend turn on his boss briefly after you shouted that song at him, is going to turn the crossbow on you.
Sam: On me?!
Matt: Yes.
Sam: Jesus.
Matt: That's going to be a 16 to hit?
Sam: I don't even know any more. No one's attacked me in a while.
Taliesin: It's your AC.
Sam: It's 17.
Matt: 17!
Sam: Well, it's 15 plus two because I've got some thing on.
Marisha: You've got the amulet on.
Matt: All right. So, as it comes towards you, you just duck out of the way and it passes and snags into the wall behind you (arrow landing sound). No hit. The thug is then going to drop the crossbow on the ground and rushing up, pull out a mace that was hanging from the side of its belt and engage you right there.
Travis: I thought he was coming for me.
Sam: I thought so, too. That would have been good!
Matt: This guy is going to attempt to make two attacks against Master Vouk Strono. Has advantage on them because Faerie Fire. That hits. And, two attacks with a mace. That is 18. Yeah, hits with both. (whack whack) With the mace both times.
Marisha: Is that the guy who you charmed? Awesome.
Taliesin: Nice.
Sam: Wait. Who's this?
Liam: The guy you charmed.
Sam: That's not my guy, Matt.
Matt: That guy?
Sam: Oh, that guy there is, yeah. Oh wait, he's attacking my guy?
Matt: No, he's attacking the guy that's invisible. (laughter)
Matt: Doing a total of 16 damage with his mace. (whack whack) Bludgeoning. He's now going to try and make the saving throw to shrug it. What's the DC on that?
Sam: On my spell?
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: It's 19.
Matt: 19. Yeah, he does not make it. Still under control. That ends the thugs' turn. Top of the round. Percy, you're up!
Marisha: Go Percy, go Percy, go!
Taliesin: Sharpshooter against Kerrion.
Matt: Sir Kerrion, okay.
Taliesin: Do I have advantage on that because of Faerie Fire?
Matt: It does not benefit from invisibility and you have advantage. Yes, you do. Vox Machina: broken. (laughter)
Taliesin: 16.
Matt: 16 to hit?
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: Misses.
Taliesin: Taking another shot.
Marisha: That was with advantage?
Taliesin: Yeah.
Marisha: Pooper.
Taliesin: 20.
Matt: 20 does hit.
Taliesin: 15 points of damage.
Matt: 15. (gunshot) You see one blast hits the wall and causes part of the wood to splinter outward. The second shot impacts the partially invisible form. You can see a splash of blood across the desk in front. Partially spattering across Vax and one of his guards.
Taliesin: Third shot with ice. No sharpshooter. Natural 20!
Travis: What?!
Marisha: Percy rolls!
Travis: What the hell?!
Taliesin: It's making up for my gun failing four times.
Travis: Whatever, you possessed Voldemort.
Taliesin: I know.
Travis: (laughing) Smoke arm.
Taliesin: Six, 16, 25, 31 points of damage. 31 points of damage with four points of that being ice damage.
Matt: So, Percy  how do you want to do this?
Travis: He said that weird.
Marisha: This against Kerrion, right?
Matt: This is against Sir Kerrion.
Sam: Wow! How do you want to do this? That's the logo that's on the shirt that's for sale right now.
Taliesin: Oh, stop it.
Travis: Is this the name on one of the barrels?
Matt: Percy.
Taliesin: Don't cheapen this!
Sam: Too late.
Matt: Currently visible, at your disposal, Sir Kerrion. You have enough of a shot to finish him off. The smoke is pushing you, "Vengeance. Vengeance. Vengeance." Repeatedly echoing in the back of your mind. How do you want to do this?
Taliesin: I'm going to put on the mask, since he still doesn't know who I am.
Matt: Okay. You pull the mask down, the bird-beaked element to the mask now wreathed in smoke, resembling, very closely, the entity that made the original bargain with you.
Taliesin: I'm going to walk up to him. Yeah, there's no way to drop the illusion. That's such a damn shame.
Sam: Oh wait, you told me to!
Taliesin: I did.
Sam: I could have; I didn't. Fuck! (laughs)
Marisha: Could you do it now, for flavor?
Taliesin: That's fine. The mask will do. I'm going to take one last shot. I'm going to look right at him, I'm going to catch his eye. This is for the de Rolos. And let me say: you were the one I was least looking forward to.
Travis: That's some cold shit!
Matt: With that, the little bit of wreathed magical energy you can barely make out an expression of horror on the face before the resounding blast sound rocks the room. The actual bullet itself a trail of black smoke behind it as it impacts the front of Sir Kerrion's face. The entirety of his head caving inward as the back splatters across the scarred wooden wall behind him. The body slumps to the ground immediately. You guys all glance over at Percy. You don't even see Percy, you just see a humanoid entity made of black swirling smoke energy with the peaked beak of his mask poking through.
Marisha: Not 100% sure what's going on. Can I take my Faerie Fire concentration that I still have up and move it over top of the black smoke figure?
Matt: Can you move a Faerie Fire?
Marisha: I don't know; can I move a Faerie Fire?
Matt: I think when you use it, it just stays where it was. Could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure that's how it works.
Marisha: 20 feet; is he in it, perchance?
Matt: From there, it's 20 foot, no. Not from where you placed it right on him, unfortunately. That's okay. Yeah, no, it just happens once.
Marisha: Never mind.
Matt: With that, you recoil from it and the voice echoes in the back of your head, going "Yes."
Taliesin: I'm going to drop the gun.
Matt: You drop it (impact sound).
Taliesin: Remove my mask. Run to find something metal, something sharp, anywhere on the table. And just start scratching off the name on the gun. I'm just going to go to a corner and just start scratching the name off.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: He's disturbed.
Matt: Okay, that's your turn.
Taliesin: That's my turn.
Matt: Sir Kerrion is gone. Annihilated. That brings us to Grog.
Travis: Percy's having all the fun. And I start smashing that fuck that's looking at Vax.
Matt: Right there, okay. So you move up to him, (whoosh) swinging the hammer wide.
Travis: Might as well make these great weapon master strikes, just for fucking why not. That's a 15.
Matt: 15 just hits.
Travis: Yeah, that's awesome. And the second one-- Yeah, that's pretty good. 28 minus five. 23.
Matt: 23 hits.
Travis: Okay. 15. 20 is the first one, with the fire damage. Oh!
Laura: Actually that's 30.
Travis: Yeah, 30 is the first one. Plus 10. And 13, 16, 26 for the second one.
Matt: Okay. So as you rush up, you can see, it's pulled out its mace and is swinging it in a wide arc towards Vax. As soon as you rush up, it looks to you out of the corner of the eye, drops the mace and before the mace can hit the ground, your hammer actually swings around, hits the mace, and then both your hammer and the mace slam into the side of his head, pushing him down onto the desk. Stunned, blood spatters across the wood as he's (gasping) twitching on the table, already done. And you swing the hammer, lift it up, (impact sound), like Gallagher performance, the head just (explosion noise). (groaning)
Laura: This is disgusting.
Liam: Happy Halloween, folks.
Travis: Great weapon master.
Matt: Vouk is currently looking very--
Sam: He's Vouk-ed.
Matt: Yeah, he's Vouk-ed. All right. Is going to cast Haste on himself and is going to run, dropping invisibility, and leaping through that window.
Laura: Doesn't the guard get a--
Matt: The guard gets an attack of opportunity, and Keyleth does. The guard has advantage. A three. No, the guard misses, with a mace.
Marisha: Natural 20.
Laura: Yeah! With your fire hands?
Marisha: No, it's with my staff, I'm assuming, right? Unless I wanted to deck him in the face.
Matt: No, this would be with your staff.
Marisha: This is with my staff, okay.
Matt: You just (whack).
Marisha: So it's five, so that's 11. I don't attack a lot. 13 damage.
Matt: 13 damage?
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: All righty. As you smack him at that point--
Marisha: I just clothesline him. I see him running, I'm like (grunts).
Matt: It brings him exactly to zero. (cheering)
Matt: You whack him right in the face, knocking the teeth out, and he just falls to the ground. Unconscious and bleeding.
Sam: Good, yes, keep him alive.
Matt: All right. That ends his turn (laughs). Wow. Man. Surprise rounds, man. You guys are nasty. All right. Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: Scanlan's up?
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: All right. I go run up to the guard I have dominated, and I just-- Is he still dominated, can I change the domination?
Matt: I mean, you can cancel it, but otherwise he's just--
Sam: I mean, can I change it from "kill your boss" to--
Travis: "Kill yourself."
Sam: To "give up"?
Matt: Yeah, you can tell him. You can't tell him to attack himself.
Sam: No, I will tell him--
Taliesin: You-- Oh, go ahead.
Sam: No, what?
Taliesin: I was going to say, tell him to go tell anybody else in the house everything's fine.
Sam: Oh. Ooh! That's good.
Travis: Yeah, because we should kill the more powerful guy.
Taliesin: Tell him that everything's fine.
Sam: Okay. You there, guard! Go tell everyone that everything's fine. Go into that Stinking Cloud out there and tell all your friends that everything's hunky-dory.
Matt: Technically, Stinking Cloud is a concentration spell.
Sam: Is it?
Matt: So if you were to maintain concentration on that, you would lose your Domination.
Sam: Oh, okay.
Matt: So it's your call. Which one do you want to maintain?
Sam: The domination.
Matt: Okay. So the Stinking Cloud fades from the hallway.
Sam: Stinking Cloud is concentration?
Matt: I believe it is. Spells like that usually are, if it's to maintain--
Sam: It is! I never wrote down a C next to it.
Matt: This is where that circlet would come in handy.
Taliesin: Can I run over to Kerrion's body?
Matt: You will be able to shortly.
Sam: You mean the thing that Orion took from me? Yeah, the thing that I needed? Yeah.
Matt: It's all right. He's used it pretty well a couple of times.
Sam: Yes, so I tell him to go warn his friends-- not warn his friends. Tell his friends that everything's fine. All is good.
Matt: Cool. Good to know. That ends your turn. Is anyone going to take any specific actions?
Laura: I want to loot the bodies.
Taliesin: I'm running over to Kerrion and just going to rage loot him.
Sam: I'm going to go to the desk.
Matt: Okay. While you guys all do that, the guard leaves the room. You hear a few whispers in the hallway, a conversation with a person unseen.
Liam: I walk towards the door.
Travis: Uh-oh.
Sam: A giant attacks.
Matt: The conversation fades and the guard walks back, seemingly job done. Also is going to make a wisdom saving throw. That is a 17?
Sam: 19.
Matt: He remains dominated. You guys now-- For the moment, the threat seems to have subsided. At the moment. You're still in the house and there's still, apparently, things in the house. Whether it'd be guards or other individuals in the house that are on edge as they heard a series of gunshots ring out, screams, and other sorts of cacophony. The fact that this is even right now being handled is a very lucky series of rolls on his part.
Travis: I want it said that this one should die. He has magic. He's too strong. They could set better traps.
Sam: We can interrogate him, though. Get crucial information. He's an officer.
Taliesin: I can't talk yet.
Matt: So you're going through Sir Kerrion's body.
Taliesin: I'm taking his swords, and I'm going to use his sword to get that deep gouge into the gun.
Matt: He has two rapiers, so it's like holding a stiletto.
Taliesin: And anything he has on his body, I'm taking it.
Matt: He has a potion of greater healing on him. Never got round to actually using it.
Taliesin: And once there's a good gash in the name, I'm going to sit down and breathe.
Matt: Okay. As you finish gashing the name out on the side of the metal and start breathing, you can see the name itself begin to glow with a slight dull purple glow and burn away from the metal, leaving just the scratch marks. From his body, you have two rapiers, regular rapiers, studded leather armor that is enchanted with a plus one bonus, and that potion of greater healing. So you can mark those down.
Laura: I'm keeping a very strong eye on Percy right now.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Anything on the desk, papers of any sort?
Matt: Going through the desk? Go ahead and make an investigation check.
Sam: It's a lot. Yeah, it's tons. It's 27.
Matt: Yeah. You find wax seals, you find parchment, you find pocket change, about six or seven gold pieces just left in there. On himself though, on his actual person, on Sir Kerrion's body, you find about 320 gold pieces as his own personal fund. Looking through the desk, you find mentions of the bridge plan to move between the two continents. To go across the channel to Wildmount. Basically plans, the discussion, a lot of what they were planning to do with Emon.
Marisha: Someone write that down.
Sam: I got it.
Matt: You also find a small notebook that just has some hand notes of his.
Sam: I'll take it.
Matt: Okay. So mark that down.
Travis: I start tying up unconscious guy on the floor.
Matt: He's currently-- He's got to zero hit points, he's bleeding out.
Marisha: What about the dominated guy? He's about to save from it. Domination, he can save from it at any second.
Travis: No, I know. I thought we wanted to interrogate--
Matt: Which he does not; he's still dominated.
Liam: I take a rag out of my pocket and I roll it up and I shove it into Kerrion's mouth while Grog is tying him up.
Taliesin: Kerrion's dead.
Liam: I thought he was out.
Sam: Vouk's.
Travis: The balding guy.
Liam: Balding. All right.
Travis: We tie him up, he shoves a rag in his mouth, I put one hand on the top of his head and the other hand under his chin. Should we bring him back just a little so we can ask him some questions?
Marisha: Vouk?
Travis: Yeah.
Marisha: Okay, but what are we going to do about dominated guy? Can we tie him up, too?
Laura: Yeah, tell him to go sit in a corner, Scanlan.
Marisha: He could save from that any second. We need to like off him or something.
Taliesin: There'll be time for that.
Liam: I got it. Could you tell him to look in the corner?
Sam: Turn away, look in the corner, Blair Witch style. (laughter)
Laura: Oh, this is so wrong.
Matt: Doesn't make his save.
Laura: Oh, terrible.
Sam: Grog, do you want to?
Laura: No, this is so wrong.
Travis: What? We're asking questions. We got to bring him back, just a little bit.
Sam: Are you on Vouk's right? Or whatever-his-name?
Travis: We're on Vouk.
Liam: Can we put him to sleep, or anything short of me knocking him out?
Sam: I can put him to sleep.
Liam: Put him to sleep, then.
Sam: But I have to drop my thing first.
Laura: Just knock him out.
Liam: I'll do it. I'm really good at knocking people out.
Marisha: Just knock him out. Knowing what's coming, I'm going to Druidcraft some pretty kaleidoscope-y flowers in front of his face. Pretty image before you die.
Matt: All right. He seems momentarily confused before the blow of the-- Are you hitting him with the blade or pommel?
Liam: Oh, pommel.
Travis: Before we knock him out, should you make sure that whatever he tells people is truly fearsome? But not too descript about us?
Sam: Well, he already told his friends in the hallway--
Travis: That everything was fine.
Sam: That everything's fine. So now we're just knocking him out.
Marisha: While all this happens, I'm going over to baldy. Lord Vouk or Mister Vouk and pop a Cure Wounds potion into him. How far down is he? He was just at zero. I brought him to zero.
Matt: Yeah, he was unconscious and he was making his death saving throws. I was treating him for that circumstance. When you go straight to zero like that, you know--
Marisha: Yeah. All right, I'll pop a Cure Wounds into him.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: The guy in the corner? Scanlan, could you go stand next to him and tell him a joke?
Marisha: I was giving him pretty flowers.
Liam: You're standing next to him?
Marisha: I gave him pretty flowers to look at.
Liam: You walked over and gave him pretty flowers?
Marisha: I Druidcrafted from a distance.
Travis: Are you standing next to him?
Sam: I walk next to him and sort of distract him with a little soft shoe tap.
Liam: Thank you. That's what I needed. I got an 18. Sorry, I got a 29. And that is eight plus 14, 22, six, seven, 32.
Matt: 32. He is (impact noise) from barely damaged to nothing. He goes immediately unconscious in the corner, face down, in the middle of a bookcase.
Marisha: I drop 18 points of healing into Vouk.
Matt: Okay. (gasps, chokes)
Travis: The rag's in his throat. You are going to listen very carefully as my friends ask you some questions. You'll shake your head yes or shake it no.
Laura: What are we going to ask him?
Sam: (laughs) Percy?
Taliesin: I'm not available right now.
Sam: All right.
Liam: All right.
Liam: Come on. Come with me.
Laura: Okay.
Sam: Where are the Briarwoods?
Laura: Where are the Briarwoods?
Liam: You've got to do yes or no.
Laura: Are the Briarwoods--
Sam: -- in the palace?
Matt: (muffled moaning)
Liam: Yes or no.
Sam: Just nod or nod.
Laura: This is really smart. I feel good about this.
Travis: Should we take the rag out?
Laura: No.
Sam: He can do spells.
Liam: I just want to remind you that my friend over here can split you in half like an apple, right?
Travis: I nod his head yes.
Matt: (muffled murmur)
Liam: Have you seen the Briarwoods this week?
Matt: (affirmative grunt)
Liam: Do you like working for them?
Matt: (sounds uncertain)
Laura: Do they know we're here?
Matt: (affirmative grunt)
Laura: Yeah.
Sam: Are they in the palace?
Matt: (sounds ambiguous)
Sam: Sometimes.
Laura: Do you know where they are?
Matt: (negative grunt)
Liam: Do they have pointier teeth than most?
Matt: (sounds ambiguous)
Sam: (laughs)
Matt: (sounds sad)
Sam: This is mumblecore.
Laura: Yeah.
Liam: Is your life worth giving a little information?
Matt: (affirmative grunting)
Liam: We want to know how to get into the palace without a problem. Got any advice?
Matt: (eager affirmative grunting)
Liam: Now I just want to remind you. He can take your head off, your knees off, your cock off, anything, in half a second.
Travis: I just give a little squeeze.
Liam: I'm going to pull the cloth out.
Sam: I cast Blindness on him.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Don't know if he's blind.
Matt: Suddenly he goes (muffled panic noises).
Sam: Oh, he's blind. He's blind.
Liam: I give him a pat on the cheek.
Matt: (whimpers)
Laura: Oh, now I feel bad.
Liam: I'm a big fan of efficiency, so I'm going to pull this rag out and you've got about 30 seconds to start talking about something useful. Otherwise, my friend is going to make you about six inches shorter.
Travis: Yeah. I'm going to turn your head into a dreidel.
Liam: So we're going to start talking now, yes?
Matt: (grunts in agreement)
Liam: In three, two.
Matt: (gasping for breath) "Please don't kill me. I can show you a secret entrance into the castle. I know a way in."
Laura: It's not guarded?
Matt: "I don't think so. They've closed it off. If you can find a way through, they won't expect it."
Taliesin: Is it the one in the forest?
Matt: "There is one, yes, yes, in the forest. Look, I can bring you to their project room under the castle, what they're working on. Please don't kill me."
Laura: What is the project room?
Sam: Are they working on explosives?
Matt: "They've been-- They've been working on something. It's hard to describe. I've only been there once. It's beyond my interests, but it is part of the reason they even took this place."
Liam: Lord Briarwood is a vampire.
Matt: "Aye."
Liam: What the fuck is Lady Briarwood?
Matt: "She's powerful, I'll give you that. She scares me more than the two of them."
Laura: Is it hard to talk with no teeth?
Matt: "It's more difficult than expected, aye."
Travis: I start to tilt his head and I'm like showing us won't work, we need a location.
Matt: "It's under the castle. It's under the city. All the caverns are there. I can show you how to get there, I've been there. They've taken me."
Laura: Do you know what they've done to the ground here? Do you know why nothing grows?
Matt: "Stuff grows. It's how we do the farming."
Marisha: Stuff doesn't grow, though. Not like it should. What did they do to the land?
Matt: "I don't know. Maybe it has something to do with what they're doing under the castle."
Marisha: And what exactly are they doing under the castle?
Matt: "It's an excavation, or they're building something. I don't know the details of it."
Liam: You've no idea what they want?
Matt: "Comparatively, I'm just a peasant to them. I work with-- well, I worked with Kerrion."
Taliesin: How long have you worked with Sir Stonefell?
Matt: "Five years."
Taliesin: Were you here when he took the castle?
Matt: "Yes, yes. I was part of the incursion."
Taliesin: Good. You're very lucky. Because you're going to live if you show us-- And I bring out a map.
Sam: He can't see anything.
Taliesin: I know. Drop the Blindness.
Matt: He hears the crinkling of paper.
Taliesin: Drop the Blindness.
Sam: All right. I drop Blindness and I drop Seeming.
Matt: (scared, fast breathing)
Taliesin: Look at me. Look at me. You're going to show me where on the castle is the secret entrance. Do you know who I am?
Matt: "No."
Taliesin: You will. Mark it on the map.
Matt: He looks down at his bound arms and legs.
Travis: I take his head and I shove his nose and his face right above the map. And I say: use your nose.
Matt: "It's right--" He spits and puts a little droplet. It's loosely in the area of the western side of the mountain that the castle is built on. Roughly around the entrance where you escaped when you and Cassandra left Whitestone, five years before.
Taliesin: I know where that is.
Travis: That means we don't need you anymore.
Matt: "No! I can show you-- I can show you where their project is. The tunnels. You need me."
Travis: He'll set a good trap.
Laura: I just want to ask, when do the Briarwoods come out?
Matt: "Not often. They don't need to. Kerrion does the work for them. Did the work for them."
Sam: Those giants. Who controls them?
Matt: "Lady Briarwood does. She's the one who made them."
Travis: It's all over the room.
Marisha: She's the one who made them?
Taliesin: Can I propose something to you?
Matt: "She's strong with necromancy, she is."
Liam: I shove the rag back in his mouth for a moment.
Taliesin: Mark his face, take his tongue, let him loose.
Sam: His eyes, too?
Taliesin: No, just his tongue.
Travis: His tongue?
Taliesin: Mark his face.
Travis: I stick my two fingers inside of his nose, crank back on his nose, reach in, and rip his tongue out of his mouth.
Sam: I cover Keyleth's eyes.
Taliesin: That was a bit more than I was--
Travis: You said take his tongue! That's a natural 20.
Marisha: Natural 20?!
Taliesin: Natural 20, really? I'm feeling like such a bastard right now.
Matt: There isn't even a slow scuffle. You just reach in and (wet ripping noise, pained scream) You immediately jam the cloth back in. The cloth begins to slowly soak with blood. You hold almost a pound of muscle: a now motionless tongue in your hand, bloody at its base. These tears are running down his face. (muffled sobbing and coughing)
Travis: Is that good enough for your message?
Taliesin: I take my gun. I'm going to shoot it very gently-- I'm going to shoot into the ground to muffle the sound. I'm going to take the heat of it, and I'm going to cauterize it. His tongue, so he doesn't bleed out.
Matt: You pull the cloth out. (pained cry and choking sounds)
Taliesin: I'm going to mark his head with the still-hot gun.
Matt: (noises of pain) He starts screaming in pain as you're burning what into his head, the symbol of the de Rolo family?
Sam: It's a very complicated symbol. (laughs)
Taliesin: I'm going to do it. And then, I say we let him run out the front door and we set fire to the house.
Travis: I'm good with that. I've got this.
Sam: Where are we going after this?
Marisha: Whoa!
Travis: No. I like that a lot.
Marisha: You would, though. You would.
Sam: Trinket's downstairs. We should leave Trinket.
Travis: Have we forgotten that this entire town is full of evil, undead vampire people?
Marisha: Have we also forgotten that this entire town is looking for us?
Taliesin: They don't know we're here.
Marisha: They will after we set fire on the house and send a man screaming through the street with your symbol on his forehead.
Sam: They don't know where we live.
Marisha: They will! They're going to go, "Hm, let's look at the burning smokestack of a house and start there."
Taliesin: He's going to be missing by morning. They're going to know.
Travis: We've got the guy painted all over this room. They're going to find out one way or the other. Might as well do it with a little showmanship.
Sam: We're trying to make everyone know that we're here.
Taliesin: We're trying to start a rebellion.
Marisha: (voice cracking) Yeah, but-- yeah.
Travis: Come on, be the Mockingjay, Keyleth!
Taliesin: (giggles) Don't make me laugh. This is dark shit.
Travis: It is!
Sam: We can stay the night before we release him and burn it down.
Taliesin: Fair.
Sam: Although there are a bunch of guards around.
Marisha: We can't stay the night.
Laura: We can't stay the night.
Sam: All right, just burn it, then. Let's get out of here.
Marisha: Hang on. Fellow half-elves, you look as horrified as I feel. What do you guys think?
Laura: I feel like it's a little stupid, since we have nowhere to go.
Sam: We can go back to our old hideout. We have the tavern. No one's found it.
Liam: Percival, I know what you've been through, to an extent.
Taliesin: I don't even know what I've been through, to a certain extent, but yes.
Liam: We came here to wipe out a scourge on this city. Careful lest you become the scourge you've come to destroy. These people have eaten shit for five years. I'm not saying that man was innocent, but he's had a hard road. Everyone here has had a hard road. I am maybe willing to overlook what's just happened for all the hardship you have had, but careful how you are walking.
Sam: Hey, wait a second here, Vax. That was an enforcer. He kept the people oppressed. He worked for the Briarwoods and punished all of these farmers for not bringing enough taxes and enough tithes.
Liam: Are we to turn into Jack the Ripper because of it?
Sam: Well, that's what a rebellion is.
Travis: I do like ripping.
Taliesin: There's no pretty way to do this.
Laura: I'm fully in support with burning down a house, I just feel like it might backfire a bit.
Marisha: Look, I agreed to start a rebellion and let the people have their uprising, but I'm with Vax. I was trying to tell you this before we even came here, Percy. You don't want to become the thing that you are so desperate to seek vengeance on. How are we any different than the Briarwoods, at this point?
Travis: We're not fucking vampires. Look, what are our options besides burning the house down? I'm open to other ideas.
Sam: We can just leave it as a symbol of our terror.
Taliesin: I've marked him. I'm willing to walk away.
Travis: And where do we stay?
Sam: Somewhere else.
Travis: The tavern? Do we have to find another building?
Taliesin: I know a barracks. It's not too far away.
Liam: I agree with you, with burning the house down. Let's find anyone who's in here and get them out.
Taliesin: I think they'll get out when the house catches on fire.
Liam: Your soul doesn't need to be forfeit, Percival.
Taliesin: (sighs heavily) Things are more complicated now.
Sam: Percy, is that last barrel for you?
Taliesin: No. But, if it was, would I tell you?
Sam: No.
Taliesin: Thank you.
Marisha: Why are things more complicated, Percy? Clearly, we all just witnessed what just happened.
Taliesin: That was unexpected.
Marisha: Yeah, no, I'd agree with that, yeah.
Taliesin: (sighs) That's a longer conversation.
Sam: These guards aren't going to stay out for long. We should set fire and get out of here.
Liam: We burn the house down, and we find a place to hole up for the night.
Laura: Hey, buddy. How's it going?
Matt: He looks over at the body of Sir Kerrion, which is still slumped against the wall.
Liam: Percy, we need to have that longer conversation soon.
Laura: Soon, but not now. Let's go.
Marisha: Let's get out of here. All right, we're setting this damn house on fire?
Laura: Let's do it.
Travis: I take the tongue-less one, and I throw him out. I keep him bound. He's bound amongst the chest and hands. And I throw him out the window. Bye, motherfucker!
Matt: He falls out into the rain, (boof) falling on his side. (whimpers) He's being rained on, and he's trying to struggle with his bindings.
Travis: He'll get up. His feet are free. His legs and feet are free. I'm picturing chest and arms.
Matt: Okay, then he gets to his feet and starts running.
Sam: Grog, can you carry this unconscious guard out on our way out?
Travis: Sure. Do I kill him first?
Matt: Are you leaving Sir Kerrion's body?
Sam: Sir Kerrion's body?
Matt: Are you leaving Sir Kerrion's body to burn with the house?
Taliesin: Yes.
Laura: Are we?
Taliesin: Let's take him, too.
Travis: We might as well leave him out on the front step, or something. I'll grab Sir Kerrion--
Sam: Can you carry both of those fuckers?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: He threw one of them out.
Sam: No, there's the unconscious guard and the body.
Travis: I'll grab unconscious guard and the body.
Liam: He weighs like 600 pounds.
Marisha: I'm going to say  All right. Well, if we're going to light this damn house on fire and make it a symbol--
Sam: You have fire hands.
Marisha: We're at least going to make it cool and make it the message that it's supposed to be.
Travis: There you go!
Marisha: I turn into an eagle and I fly to the roof.
Matt: Flying out the window that you just shattered.
Marisha: Give me your symbol.
Taliesin: I give her one of the parchments.
Matt: You fly up. The rain is coming down on you. It's a little hard to fly. You get up to the top of the roof.
Marisha: I cast Flaming Sphere.
Matt: You transform into yourself again?
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: We're all going to start going out the way we came.
Travis: I throw unconscious guy and Sir Dead.
Marisha: Hope you guys were ready to get out.
Laura: I open up a bottle of wine and take a giant swig.
Matt: Okay. As you guys head back down to the cellar?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: You guys all head back down to the cellar. You throw them both out the window, including the body of Sir Kerrion (boof) out into the yard. You head back down into the cellar.
Marisha: I cast Flaming Sphere, and I start moving it around on the roof and start drawing the shape of the de Rolo family crest on the roof.
Matt: Okay. It will take you a few minutes. You now see, as you're finishing the symbol, Vouk running to the front of the building, and you hear the voices of two guards going, "Master Vouk? What happened? Tell us. Unbind him!" "Yes, sir." And the two guards at the front of the building are talking with him. You finish the symbol.
Marisha: And I take my Flaming Sphere, and I throw it right at the feet of where the guards are.
Matt: Okay. You're on the roof, so you don't see them, but you know they're off to the side of the roof, so you can roll it off the roof down to them. They both freak out and react and seem to get into a defensive position. They start arming themselves, and you hear crossbow bolts being set into place.
Marisha: I run over to the edge where the cellar was, and I go, (whispering) Grog. Grog!
Travis: What?
Marisha: (whispering) Come to the side of the roof!
Matt: You guys make your ways back down through the cellar, where Trinket's waiting patiently. (bear grunts)
Laura: Hey, buddy. Let's go.
Travis: Hi, Trinket. Get out.
Matt: You guys come out of the cellar now.
Marisha: (whispering) Grog! Hey!
Travis: What?
Marisha: (whispering) Catch me!
Travis: Okay!
Matt: Catch Keyleth. You guys are now out in the open, still during the day, rain pouring down.
Laura: Running toward the woods? Where are we running?
Marisha: Get the fuck out of here.
Taliesin: Let's head back to the inn. Let's try the barracks. We'll try the barracks.
Matt: The barracks are attached to the castle.
Taliesin: Shit. Okay.
Sam: Back to the tavern, then.
Taliesin: Back to the tavern for now.
Laura: They're going to notice--
Matt: Stealth check real fast, guys.
Marisha: I was going to say, do you have Pass Without a Trace, can you summon any more spells?
Laura: I don't. I mean, I can cast it right now.
Matt: If you want to quickly, yeah.
Marisha: Yeah, before we move.
Matt: Stealth checks?
Sam: 19.
Liam: Did we get the Pass Without a Trace?
Laura: Yeah.
Liam: So, plus ten, right?
Matt: Yeah.
Liam: 34.
Taliesin: 20.
Marisha: 25.
Travis: 21.
Laura: 24.
Matt: Sure enough, both guards rush around the corner. You guys have already leapt over the fence. However, they see the fence. "The fence is bent!" And they go rushing toward that direction. You guys have already disappeared into the various alleyways, making your way back towards the inn in the center of town.
Laura: Pass Without a Trace, I mean, Dust of Tracelessness.
Travis: Okay, yeah, just throwing it down behind us.
Matt: Okay. They're giving chase. They're hearing the sounds of your footsteps a little, but eventually their sounds fade. You do hear in the distance a bell start going off.
Taliesin: We're going to go into the basement.
Matt: You start seeing people emerging from their homes, hearing the bell. And, you would know this, this would be a warning bell for whenever a fire breaks out in the city. You see smoke beginning to rise up, even through the rainstorm. The fire is fighting the rain. But the smoke is black and it's starting to fade. You gather the building itself did not catch fire enough to burn into rubble due to the rain, but you've probably left a very visible mark on the roof.
Taliesin: That'll do.
Matt: People begin to gather from the outside, and you see folks running past the alley as you make your way back to the tavern that you currently have as your base of operations. You all make your way in safely from the rain. Take a deep breath and come to understand that you've definitely started the motion of whatever it is you're intending to do. We'll see how it plays out in the near future. We'll call the session there for the night.
Travis: Shit got hairy.
Taliesin: That was amazing.
Laura: That was dark, you guys. Super dark.
Sam: I found seven gold.
Taliesin: I have a sword, now.
Travis: It's October.
Marisha: Speaking of Percy and his crazy storyline--
Taliesin: So that's about to happen, yeah.
Marisha: I'm guessing by now if you go on the Geek and Sundry website, you can find his playlist.
Taliesin: Music to burn a house to. Music to violently murder people to.
Marisha: I was gonna say, music to murder to. Go check it out, it's great.
Taliesin: Music for a midnight murder. There we are. Actually, I have some art that I would love to-- can I put on the--
Matt: Yeah, sure.
Marisha: Taliesin art.
Taliesin: Yeah, I drew pictures. Just in case everybody wants to see, this is the terrible thing we keep carving into people and things.
Marisha: Or burning on rooftops.
Taliesin: And then this is actually the de Rolo family crest. Just another fancy thing.
Matt: Very, very cool, and well done, sir.
Taliesin: Thank you. I drew a picture. So that shit happened.
Marisha: Glad I'm not the only one who thinks you're crazy anymore.
Taliesin: I think I'm crazy now. It's gonna be interesting.
Marisha: You're all crazy, we've all seen it. Now we can handle it as a family.
Zac: Yeah, y'all's fucked up.
Taliesin: That got way darker than I was expecting.
Zac: Yeah. I'm sure that won't have any negative repercussions whatsoever.
Matt: No.
Taliesin: I hate you, Matt.
Laura: Hey, man. Did we hit 10k?
Zac: Yep. (cheering)
Zac: 10,060. Currently Starburns is winning.
Marisha: Starburns! Do it!
Taliesin: Starburns! Do it!
Zac: Here's what they forget  Jess and Steph are the ones doing it. If anyone's watched Jess and Steph's craft show, it will most likely end up being just a shaved face. If you think Jess and Steph can pull off Starburns, you're lying to yourself, and it will just end up being a clean shave.
Taliesin: I got a straight razor, we could go for this. You trust me, I mean, you know. I can get in there.
Zac: Moving on.
Taliesin: I can Sweeney Todd that.
Zac: Okay, so. Tonight, guys, we're just gonna be reading off the names and we're gonna knock through 'em pretty quick.
Matt: We're trying to keep time down for weeknights. All right, guys, so we have donating tonight to Extra Live, we have Connor Brown, Steven Sudeban Davis, Ravi Persuad, Mitchell DeFow-- sorry if I ruin any of these names, guys, by the way-- Tom Revely, Caleb Popum, Michael Holloway, George Rinn, PumpkinSpiceThisBitchTheFourth, Anonymous Donator, we have Patrick Toro, the Lost Tigers, Rebecca Case, Lewis Letter, Emma returns, Emma Engquist, I hope I'm not ruining that too bad, Pernil Ilfsen-- that's a cool name-- Arthur Gibbs, another wonderful anonymous donator, Maxine Poloquin, another great anonymous donator, Christian Huntlee, James Bell, John Reap, Killer Penguin, Monica Dahl, Kayla Ernest, Tim Pearson, another great anonymous donator, PumpkinSpiceThisBitch twice more--
Zac: Well, one's the original and one's the second.
Matt: Oh, it carried over, I see. I see. The original and the second. There's a third one in there, probably. Guys, thank you so much. It's really incredible, each one of you that donated to help Extra Life. We really appreciate it.
Zac: Since this weekend is the 24-hour Nerdist Extra Life stream, starting next week we'll go back to 826LA and get those donations rolling back in for 826--
Marisha: But in the meantime, don't forget to go to LA2050 and vote for 826LA so they can win 100k.
Zac: I would also like to throw out there the other-- it currently looks like it's a race between Starburns, Freddie Mercury, and Fu Manchu.
Laura: Oh, I like Freddie Mercury.
Taliesin: Starburns' really kinda rocking it for me.
Marisha: I was gonna suggest-- we had the Hunger Games reference, so what was his name? Kerrion or whatever? The Gamemaster in the first one?
Zac: There is no way Steph and Jess have the ability to do something like that.
Matt: I almost wanna see the tristache. Tristache is when you shave the handlebar, and then a smaller handlebar, and then a smaller-- (laughter)
Zac: Poll's out. The poll's out, dude.
Sam: Is the Hitler on the poll at all? (groaning)
Taliesin: You're a terrible person! That is the worst thing I've heard yet.
Sam: The Charlie Chaplin.
Zac: We also have a video to show you guys from a community member about their own D&D Extra Life stream they're doing this weekend, so we are going to show that to you guys here once you guys sign off, so.
Matt: Fantastic, thank you so much.
Zac: Stick around tomorrow for Jess and Steph's birthday, where they cut my fucking face up. (cheering)
Matt: That's gonna be worth its own weight in gold. Well, all right, guys, we'll be back next week for our special Halloween episode of Critical Role. We'll see how the story progresses darker and darker down this hole of horror and moral conundrum. (laughs) I'm excited. I hope you are too. Once again, guys, thank you all so much. Our love to the Team Hooman, Critter crowd out there, and is it Thursday yet? See you guys next week.
Travis: Damn straight!

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello everybody! Welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and roll dice and play Dungeons & Dragons.
Travis: Yeah, we do.
Matt: My name is Matthew Mercer. I am the Dungeon Master of the show. Before we get started, let's go ahead and run through our announcements for the evening. First, I wanted to let you guys know that tonight-- tomorrow, I'm sorry. Tomorrow is the last day to preorder your Dagger Dagger Dagger shirt. Is it also the last day to do the Strongjaw Ale?
Laura: It is!
Matt: Strongjaw Ale and Dagger Dagger Dagger shirts.
Travis: Also ale.
Ashley: I need them!
Matt: You do need them.
Laura: You do. Actually, Ashley, I think I got shirts for you.
Matt: Yeah, we've got some shirts held for you.
Sam: Extra large!
Taliesin: But if you're not Ashley, you'd better get yourself a shirt.
Matt: Yep. So you have until tomorrow to get those, so go to the Geek and Sundry store to preorder if you're interested. Yay! Next up, a reminder, me and Marisha are flying out bright and early tomorrow morning to Pittsburgh for Tekko! We're going to be doing awesome panels on voiceover and gaming and all points nerdy on the Internet in between, as well as signings and autographs and all that fun stuff. So if you're in the area and you want to find a place that's warm, we'll be there in the convention, so hopefully we'll see you guys over the weekend.
Marisha: And I went to college there, so I'm going to be finding my old homies and getting drunk.
Taliesin: Do you have a college sweater that just says "college"? You could really use one.
Marisha: I went to the performing arts school, and we did make football t-shirts, because we thought it was funny, as our performing arts shirts.
Taliesin: That sounds like a performing arts joke.
Marisha: Yeah.
Sam: Fascinating.
Matt: Indeed.
Marisha: Cool story, bro.
Matt: Next up, I get to announce, coming up as part of a celebration for International Tabletop Day and a sponsorship by Pathfinder and Syrinscape, who have been fantastic in getting this program for me in this game as well, we're going to be doing an event called "Critical Role One Shot" on April 18th, Monday, at 7 to 10 PM. We're going to be taking over Ivan's No Survivors slot that evening to run a Pathfinder one-shot that I'll be running. However, Ivan will actually be playing as a player in that one.
All: What?
Matt: I know! What, what? (gunshot) Mind blown. Destroyed. Ivan will be playing. We also will have guesting players of Taliesin and Marisha in that game as well, and we have two special guests that evening who will be playing with us: the illustrious Ashly Burch will be joining us for the evening, and the wonderfully talented Phil Lamarr as well.
Sam: Wait, what? I didn't know that.
Matt: Yeah! So it's going to be a fun night playing Pathfinder.
Laura: When is that, again?
Matt: That is April 18th, Monday at 7 PM, Pacific Time.
Travis: Aren't taxes due that day?
Matt: When you're done with your taxes, this is a great way to celebrate.
Marisha: A great way to celebrate. I'll be filing an extension, like everybody else.
Matt: It'll be a fun event, we've got some cool surprises set up for the story, and I'm excited about it, so come and join us 7 PM Pacific, Monday, April 18th for Critical Role One Shot. Also, those of you out there who are members of the Nerd Block, or are looking to be, this upcoming, now live, Nerd Block that is going out has a little surprise in there, a little artistic surprise for fans of Critical Role.
Sam: Oh? What is it?
Matt: They'll have to see.
Sam: Oh, a tiny poop. I'm in.
Laura: A teeny-tiny poop, just from Sam.
Matt: But yeah, those of you out there who want to check it out, we have a fun little insert there in the box. You get to see if you grab one, so check it out and see if it's to your liking. Liam, did you want to talk about--?
Liam: Oh, yeah, hey! You know my love for Wyrmwood Gaming and their boxes. We have these beautiful ones. Lift up a Wyrmwood box.
Laura: Oh! Oh my goodness.
Liam: They make great, beautiful boxes. They have all kinds of woods to hold your dice in, and if you use the code "critrole," you will get free shipping. But also, today, I would like to let you all know that Wyrmwood Gaming has a kickstarter for their Sentinel box. I'm sure I'm forgetting the actual name, but it's a beautiful box. It's good for D&D, it's good for Magic: The Gathering, and it holds cards, it holds dice, there's a Bluetooth in it so that if you lose it, you can find it.
Travis: Satellites can see it?
Laura: I wish we had the box in front of us, but go look it up, it's got this box on the top, and then it separates on the bottom and you can put your dice in the bottom.
Liam: It's called the Sentinel deck box. There's also a version of it called the Vox Machina, which is a premium item, and it's gorgeous.
Travis: Premium, premium, premium.
Liam: Premium. But tossing this out, too, if you guys want any of the other Sentinel deck boxes and you want to get the logo etched onto it, that's also an option. I don't know if it's on the site or not, but it will be.
Marisha: It's an off-the-menu item.
Laura: Yeah. Check it out!
Liam: 'Twill be there. Gorgeous box.
Ashley: That sounds like something Gilmore would sell.
Matt: There you go. Oh, he would. Don't worry. He would be happy to sell that.
Sam: And because of the Bluetooth feature, the NSA will track your every roll.
Marisha: You're now on the Homeland Security list.
Matt: All right. Do we have anything else you guys wanted to announce before we get started?
Travis: That fucking Rogue One trailer! Holy shit!
Taliesin: I haven't seen it yet!
Travis: All right. No words. No words. No words!
Sam: Is it like Batman vs. Superman good?
Taliesin: Don't set expectations you can't match.
Laura: Did you see it, Ashley?
Ashley: Yes! Gimme!
Travis: Yeah. All the things.
Matt: I'm sure it's cool. I haven't seen it yet.
Travis: Oh, on the break! On the break, on the break.
Laura: Yeah, we'll watch it on the break.
Matt: I haven't had a chance, I've been busy working on this shit for you guys!
Travis: What, you don't just make this stuff up as you go?
Matt: (mock weeping) No, I have to prepare.
Taliesin: It's imaginary, how could it be? You just flow with it. Right?
Marisha: Oh, I thought this was scripted.
Laura: I've been in rehearsal all day for this.
Sam: Hey, Wyrmwood crashed.
Liam: Wyrmwood crashed? Sorry, Wyrmwood. Or you're welcome, Wyrmwood.
Taliesin: I'm Instagramming my Wyrmwood box right now, too.
Travis: Well done. Well done, legion.
Sam: Colbert Nation.
Liam: I should say, the etching is a new development, so if that's not happening today, it'll be there tomorrow-ish.
Marisha: Yeah, so don't yell at them. Don't be like, "Bullshit!"
Travis: It's either going to be there tomorrow or very soon.
Laura: Because we literally got an email about it as we were starting.
Matt: Cool. All right.
Travis: Now we go to our deaths.
Matt: Now, we bring it back. I will ask if we could turn that speaker down a little bit. A little bit more. That's good. Great. All right, guys. Let's plug in to the world of Exandria, as we begin tonight's episode of Critical Role. So, last we left off, the adventuring party of Vox Machina, traversing the lands in search of lost artifacts of wars of old, referred to as the Vestiges of Divergence, in hopes of eventually tearing down and defeating a conclave of chromatic dragons called the Chroma Conclave that have destroyed society all across the continent of Tal'Dorei and beyond, you returned to the outskirts of a city named Westruun that was very important in your early adventures, to find it, from a distance, partially destroyed by the dragon attack but a couple weeks before, and since taken over by what seems to be the remnants, now swelling in power and size, of Grog's old herd of wandering barbarians and various savages. Having taken the city by force and ruling it with an iron hand, it was also deemed not the right time to face this foe, and as such the party continued venturing southward in the direction of the Frostweald, where somewhere at the base of the Stormpeak Mountains, the mate of Osysa, the gynosphinx you had met in Vasselheim-- her mate resides somewhere in this vicinity. That's all the information you have to go on as you head down towards the frozen forest. So. That's where we begin. As you guys continue pushing south from Westruun, seeing the distant pillars of dark smoke that slowly drift into the atmosphere disappear as the town itself vanishes over the horizon, you continue to push southward through the open grass fields. You continue traveling for the better part of a day, eventually coming up along the side of the Silvercut Channel, which is the river that comes down and cuts through near Kraghammer to the west of Westruun. It goes past Kymal and then eventually heads down in this direction, towards the Foramere Basin. You guys, travelling fairly quickly, as you're in your mist forms, which is making up a lot of the normal travel time you would have to worry about here, by the time the sun finally begins to set across the mountains-- pay attention, please.
Sam: Yes!
Matt: Sorry.
Liam: It's another beholder!
Matt: I've got plenty of things I could throw in here if you guys aren't paying attention!
Taliesin: That's not funny.
Matt: No, it's really funny for me. As you guys continue pushing southward, as the sun slowly begins to set in the distance, you glance over towards the Foramere Basin. You can see, just over to the right, the city of Kymal, which has lights glimmering in the far distance. But what you see by the basin itself is this large lake that is centered in this region just north of the Frostweald. You can see where the two main rivers diverge before heading southward towards the ocean. There's a smattering of various tents that are clustered right towards the side of the riverbank and the edge of the lake itself. As you continue coasting overhead in your mist forms, you see small trails of smoke from smoldering campfires, clusters of people and families wandering the shore in this small group. You continue going forward?
Sam: I mean, we should check it out.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: You don't have to, you can keep going.
Sam: It's a tent city?
Matt: It looks like it, yeah.
Laura: They're refugees, probably.
Sam: Hundreds, thousands?
Matt: There's probably a few dozen, close to maybe 50, 60.
Marisha: What do the tents look like? Do they look like military encampment tents, or refugee tents?
Matt: You can't really tell from this distance, especially as the light is beginning to slowly diminish.
Travis: Can we float closer?
Laura: We float down, we float down.
Sam: Oh, are we still mists?
Laura: Yeah.
Sam: Oh my God.
Travis: That whole description, and yes, we're still mists.
Matt: As you coast down closer, you get a better look, and yeah, there are about 50, 60 or so people on the outside. You don't have an idea of how many are inside the tents. Even more, most likely. But these tents are fairly ramshackle, barely standing, the people look destitute. They look like they're holding onto survival here on the outside of the city. You see a few boats that are going in and out on the shore, probably fishermen. There are a few bonfires that are now starting to kick up as the night's cold begins to swell in. It looks like this is a fairly "thriving," a fairly functional refugee camp.
Travis: Well, those that give a fuck, speak up.
Laura: We can't, we're in mist form.
Travis: Then like (hissing) in a direction.
Laura: (hissing) I think we should help them. Maybe we can --
Taliesin: (buzzing fart sound)
Sam: Good point.
Laura: Maybe we can send them back to Whitestone.
Taliesin: Maybe, if we could talk, which we can't right now.
Laura: I float down. Into the trees, outside of the camp.
Taliesin: I follow.
Matt: Okay. These are open grasslands, there aren't a lot of trees, and they're spotted around. There are a few rock formations and small hills, you might be able to get out of sight.
Laura: Around there.
Matt: So you coast around there and you go back into your physical form. The rest of you follow?
Travis: Tall grass? Low grass?
Matt: It's probably thigh-length.
Liam: Following.
Travis: Yeah, we go.
Matt: For you, close to the knee.
Laura: Near the rocks, so that we're in camouflage.
Matt: So you guys set down maybe 300 feet from the outside of the nearest part of the camp, reconstitute into your physical forms. At this point, the sun has now disappeared over the horizon and the blues have now gone to orange, to purple, and you can see in the distance the darkness of night is starting to crest over the sky. What do you want to do?
Travis: What are we stopped for? Are we here?
Laura: No, it looks like a refugee camp, Grog.
Taliesin: They may have information.
Laura: People that escaped from Westruun, potentially.
Travis: Oh, really?
Laura: Yeah. I mean, it's a large group of people, I'm assuming they came from a city of some sort.
Travis: Hey, Scanlan.
Sam: Oi.
Travis: If we go over there and it gets a little hairy, you've still got old magic door, right?
Sam: Old magic doll?
Travis: Hugh Hefner house!
Sam: Oh, yeah, magic door. Yes.
Travis: Magic doll if you have it, too, for later, but yeah.
Sam: I mean, I have a little Pike figurine that I keep with me.
Taliesin: Oh.
Sam: What, no, it's a keepsake!
Travis: Yeah, I'm sure it is.
Sam: Why is everything I say creepy?
Liam: I don't know, why is it?
Laura: Maybe we should pop them back to Whitestone. I feel like it might be good, if we find out if they're hurting. That's where we're putting our survivors.
Liam: They look like they're hurting.
Marisha: I couldn't help with that today.
Laura: Oh. We could rest overnight, and you could pop them in in the morning?
Marisha: What time is it?
Liam: It's late. Sun's gone down.
Travis: Super late. Yeah, and if they're from Westruun--
Laura: Are you out of all your-- oh, mist form.
Marisha: Mist form got us here.
Taliesin: It's worth talking to them at the very least.
Travis: Yeah, Pike and I are from Westruun. If they're of that village, or that city, I'd like to make sure they're all right.
Marisha: Maybe they're friends.
Laura: Maybe we'd find Pike's grandfather.
Travis: Grandfather Wilhelm.
Laura: Percy, would Whitestone be able to sustain this many more people?
Taliesin: I think at some point we're going to have to have that conversation, but for now I think we'll probably be all right.
Travis: Yeah!
Laura: All right.
Travis: You're good for it. You're rich.
Taliesin: For now.
Liam: Here's an idea. Scanlan, you said that a lot of people can go into your house, yeah?
Sam: I can fit many people into my hole.
Liam: Could you-- (laughs)
Marisha: I wonder why everything he says is creepy.
Liam: Could you invite the folk in, and then they live in your hole for a little while, and then when we get to Whitestone, you open your hole and out they come?
Sam: No, not quite.
Marisha: That's some cartel shit right there.
Travis: Yeah. We become "Vox Machina  Coyotes."
Liam: Scanlan is the mule.
Sam: No, the house is mainly for us and a few guests, for one night at a time.
Laura: You can't, like, leave them there.
Liam: Didn't you say 100 people, the other day?
Sam: 100 servants are in there. I don't quite-- I haven't jammed people in there. I don't know how many it can totally hold.
Marisha: You mean, you've never thrown a party?
Matt: Go ahead and roll an intelligence check
Sam: First roll of the night  Natural 20! (cheering)
Sam: Wasted it on an intelligence check. (laughter)
Travis: Smile upon us, dice gods!
Matt: Though the magic is new to you, you've spent in your first time casting it and a large part of the evening, especially since you realized you weren't going to have as fun a night as you thought, after the broom had been taken and Vex left your room, learning the intricacies of the spell itself and the pocket dimension that is created. You can fit quite a few people in there. However, it is stationary in its entrance and exit and then once the spell comes to completion after a 24-hour period, it expels anyone and anything that was brought into it, on the spot where it was originally cast.
Liam: I see.
Laura: Oh.
Travis: Like gently, or like--
Sam: Like a flush.
Travis: Like (sweetly) "Please leave." or like (angry) "Get the fuck out!"
Liam: Is that a yes or a no?
Sam: It's not a transporting-type spell. It is a temporary shelter, at best.
Liam: You just don't want to bring them in.
Sam: I have a cold, cold heart. (laughter)
Sam: Listen, I'll consider taking the females in.
Travis: That is very noble of you.
Laura: So noble, Scanlan.
Travis: I will join him in this charity.
Laura: Oh, yes.
Marisha: Well, all right, why don't we just walk around and talk to these people? Maybe they're not even interested in being transported. Let's just find some citizens around.
Laura: Should we make sure they're actually innocent, nice people?
Marisha: We should probably do that as well, not like a band of thieves. Bandits.
Laura: Stealth ahead.
Travis: That could be fun.
Laura: Can I sneak ahead and just listen to them?
Sam: Yes, sneaking up on them will definitely put them on our side.
Laura: Hey, like 100 yards out. I just want to hear what they're saying.
Sam: All right, all right.
Liam: She can read lips so she doesn't even get that close.
Laura: It's pretty dark, though. But I do have good darkvision.
Matt: This is true. As the night takes over, it's still quite a distance to be able to make out a lot of detail. You'd probably have to get closer. But you're going alone?
Travis: No, twins.
Matt: Twins going together?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Why don't you both roll a stealth check?
Liam: Oh, I guess I'm going then.
Taliesin: I'm keeping an eye also, to see if anything-- From a great distance, I'm just keeping an eye out.
Laura: We're in the woods, right?
Matt: No. You are in the plains.
Sam: There are no woods, tall grasses
Laura: Just kidding, we're in the grasslands.
Liam: Grass, grass. 32.
Travis: I'll roll this big bastard.
Taliesin: White manna, not green manna.
Laura: 18.
Matt: All right.
Sam: I'm hiding in a tree.
Matt: There's no-- (annoyed hmm)
Laura: There's no-- (laughter)
Travis: "There's no (grumbles)"
Sam: The grass to me is like a tree
Matt: This is true, actually. It's more of a rose bush. So as you guys push forward, pushing and stalking through the grass, you come to about 40, 50 feet outside. And there's a little bit of chatter, it's hard to make out at this distance but the people seem to, not necessarily be jovial. Almost like they've accepted the circumstances and are just surviving it for the time being. There are a few individuals that are armed, though the armor itself seems patchwork, or you know, not the best or most trained of individuals currently guarding this group of survivors. But there are patrols going around, people keeping a close look, there are torches being lit now as people begin walking--
Laura: Do we see anyone that we recognize from Westruun?
Matt: Not from this distance.
Laura: No.
Matt: With your darkvision you can make out the outline of the very, very nearest individuals, the guards in particular. But at this distance, nobody catches your eye that you'd be able to make out much detail on, that you would recognize.
Liam: Can we just sit for five or ten minutes?
Laura: Well, the guards are coming through with torches, I don't want them to find us and think we're spies.
Liam: But we are.
Laura: Yeah, but I don't want them to think that.
Liam: But we are.
Laura: Yeah. I think you can stay 'cause you're more hidden than I am. I'm going to go back to the group.
Liam: All right.
Laura: I feel like they're going to see me.
Liam: All right.
Matt: (chuckling) You don't know that. As far as you know, you're so hidden.
Laura: "I'm so hidden." Shit.
Travis: Come on.
Laura: All right, all right, all right. Just a second.
Liam: I'm just going to stay here for a couple of minutes longer. Wait, you said they were coming our direction or they're just-- ?
Matt: No, they're just wandering. Just patrolling
Laura: Oh all right.
Liam: You're paranoid!
Laura: Okay, fine fine fine fine.
Liam: Let me listen for a bit.
Matt: Okay. I'll have you both roll perception checks, if you could.
Liam: All right. 22.
Laura: 23.
Matt: Okay. You two, at about the same time, focus best you can. You have to scoot a little bit closer once the guard that's nearest to you passes by. You wait for your moment, scoot up close, get by one of the tents, and look off to the side. There are a few folks that catch your attention a little bit. There's one that was Elowen Brist, who was the mother of the first child that went missing in Westruun. You see her, with her daughter who's a little bit older now that you guys helped save her.
Marisha: Oh my god.
Liam: All these throwbacks are blowing my mind.
Matt: A little dirty but alive. They wander off. You scan through the crowd, keeping an eye out for the guard as well. No one really catches your attention. You see one older gentleman that walks by, 60s, not completely withered away. But, you know, older but carries himself with much importance. Very expensive clothing, reds and blues. It seems like he's attempting to hold a social station, even though in his current location, society has crumbled. He doesn't really catch your attention as anyone you recognize, but the person to the left of him is a very familiar-looking elven man, with long brown hair slicked over and behind his ears. This is Drez Vina, who originally contacted you when you arrived in Westruun.
Laura: Holy-- (whispers) That's Drez Vina!
Liam: Yeah, yeah.
Matt: He's looking a little rough, too. This has not been the kindest time to any of these people.
Laura: Well, should we go back to the group or tell them to come on in?
Liam: Do we have to go back to tell them to come on in?
Laura: We have earrings.
Liam: Well, yeah, that's true
Laura: (whispering) Hey, you guys.
Travis: What?
Sam: What, what what what what?
Laura: You guys! Hey Percy, pay attention.
Taliesin: Oh, yeah, yes. Hello. What?
Laura: Hey, guess who I'm looking at right now?
Taliesin: Your brother.
Laura: Well--
Sam: God, you're so good at that.
Laura: Drez fucking Vina
Marisha: (gasps) Drez!
Sam: Wait, remind us, who-- ?
Laura: Drez Vina was that dude that sent us on our very first mission together, you guys.
Taliesin: Ooh.
Marisha: Yeah! He protected us, he's a magic user.
Sam: Oh. I was mostly drunk that time.
Laura: Yeah, Percy you weren't there yet.
Taliesin: Oh, at the Winter's Crest festival, I remember.
Matt: (laughing) That's not him at all.
Liam: No. He was-- Drez Vina.
Travis: "That's not it at all." (chuckles)
Laura: Percy, you weren't there--
Matt: That's Abjurist Noja.
Marisha: Oh. Abjurist Noja.
Taliesin: Oh. Abjurist Noja.
Liam: Drez Vina was the dick. Drez Vina's a dick.
Laura: Drez Vina's the guy. Drez Vina was the asshole.
Sam: Doesn't he work for someone else?
Matt: He had a Master.
Marisha: Wait, was he the guy that we stole from, kind of?
Laura: Hey, keep it down. I don't know who all can hear over these earrings!
Travis: Oh, did he have the tower with the magical items?
Matt: Here, I should step in here and clarify-- (laughter)
Marisha: It's been like three years.
Liam: This was only three years ago.
Matt: No, I know. Drez Vina came to you under the pretense that he was working for an individual called the Master, he called him his Master, who was interested in hiring your services. Originally sent you into the mage tower of Eskil Ryndarien, the Realmseer, to steal the brass box with the pearl top. However, you did not steal it and instead you ended up befriending the Archmage.
Travis: He let us pick something.
Matt: Yes, he let you pick something from his array of items.
Sam: That's right!
Matt: Drez then found you guys at your inn, a number of weeks later. And Drez was very unhappy that you both didn't return with the item, and used a very powerful and expensive object that was part of this endeavor, and never paid it back. So, to pay back your debt, he sent you guys to the Druid Barrow where you had to retrieve this cortex, this magical gem that was embedded in the center of--
Marisha: And that was where we fought the golem!
Matt: Yep. Where you fought the golem. And you retrieved the cortex successfully, and that's the last you've seen of him.
Laura: See? He likes us now! We totally helped him.
Sam: But he has magical items--
Laura: Well, maybe not anymore.
Sam: Had. Well, we should--
Liam: What was, DM, can you remind me the name of the mother that we spoke to all that time ago?
Laura: The one you just mentioned.
Matt: Elowen.
Liam: Elowen? Elowen. I'd rather go talk to her.
Matt: I'm pretty sure, let me check my notes. Yeah, Elowen. Elowen Brist.
Laura: Do you guys want to just come on in?
Sam: Yes, let's go in.
Taliesin: I don't see what the harm is.
Travis: We go in.
Laura: Make a nice, pleasant chattering-- maybe you should sing, Scanlan, as you approach so that people know we're nice
Sam: I would love to sing. Oh. Right now? (singing) Sunny days, chasing the dragons away, On our way to where the air is clean, Can you tell me how to kill, How to kill some drag-eens?
Matt: Go ahead and roll a performance check.
Sam: Performance check.
Matt: Yes.
Laura: What is it? What is it?
Sam: It fell off the table. And it is-- a six. But plus 13.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Wait-- plus 14.
Matt: Plus 14? Okay. Okay, so, as you guys begin strolling up, immediately you see torches (fire sounds).
Liam: Hands up. No weapons.
Matt: You see guards come forward, two of them with nocked crossbows. "Who goes there?"
Laura: Hey, you guys!
Matt: And they don't really recognize-- they're all looking at this source of singing. Crossbows--
Sam: (singing) It's a magic carpet ride. Except we burned our magic carpet so we can't-- (laughter)
Matt: The guards slowly drop their crossbows. "What's your business?"
Travis: Hey, hey, that's not necessary. We're friends.
Matt: "We've already got enough mouths to feed. Move along."
Travis: No, we're not looking for food. We're here to provide aid if we can, if it's in need, if people need our help.
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Travis: Oh, shit.
Sam: Persuasion? You?
Laura: Grog--
Travis: Ten.
Matt: While their crossbows are notched, they haven't lowered them completely, they're still on guard and still nervous of your approach.
Liam: We also think there's a woman with you named Elowen. She knows us. We'd like to speak to her. We'll wait here.
Matt: One of them glances over at the other one. One of the guards who was paying attention walks away and they all raise their crossbows again and just train them on you guys for the next few minutes.
Travis: I mean, it's really not necessary. Even if you were to loose those, it would just be a tickle. I mean, trust me, we come from Westruun, all right?
Laura: Don't you remember us? In Westruun?
Travis: Yeah. Winter's Crest festival?
Laura: Vox Machina?
Travis: Grog? Pike? Wilhelm?
Matt: One of the guards takes a moment and gives you an eye and just goes-- "I remember seeing you around town. You were-- Oh man, jeez, it's good to see you."
Travis: Right? I'm as psyched about all this--
Matt: "Sorry if I gave you any trouble back in the day. I was young and stupid."
Sam: Why don't you all lower your crossbows, for a second?
Matt: "I mean no offense, but we're very guarded with your kind at the moment."
Travis: (inhales) Right. Yeah, yeah, understandable. Right. We just actually came from Westruun. It seems to be a bit occupied at the moment.
Marisha: And he's with us. So-- He's not with them. LAURA. He's different than the other guys, see? He's got a beard.
Travis: No, I, listen. It came about my own. I just got the genetics for it. (stage-whispers) Would you shut up?
Matt: At which point the guard that had left comes back with Elowen. She walks up with her tightly braided reddish hair with a little bit of grey on the sides, that probably has come since the last time you've seen her and the experience of having her child gone so long. It's taken a physical toll on her. But there is a smile on her face. Now she looks over and focuses her eyes--
Liam: Elowen!
Matt: "That's them! That's them! Let them in, let them in." And she runs forward immediately and gives a big hug to you, Vex.
Laura: Oh.
Matt: And starts moving through, and, you know, just this big smile and surprise. And you can see her little boy Simon come up to the side.
All: Oh! Simon!
Matt: Simon, who last time you saw, you were retrieving him from the pocket dimension that the Dread Emperor had called his domain. At which point, there's a few quick pleasantries, as she says hello again. She says: "Please, please come in. Please. It's fine. They're trustworthy." And the guards nod. And they follow behind, not in an aggressive way but just in a being-careful kind of way. So you have two people, two armed individuals flanking you the entire walk that you guys are doing, but it's at ease.
Marisha: Keyleth goes up to Simon.
Matt: "Hi!"
Marisha: How old are you now?
Matt: "This many-- " He puts up nine fingers.
Marisha: You've grown up so well.
Matt: "Thank you."
Marisha: And I just give him a big hug.
Matt: He freezes up. He's gotten a little shy at the interaction.
Liam: I kneel down next to him and I say  do you want to see something cool? Look at this. And I take off the serpent belt. And-- (snake hisses)
Sam: Oh, Jesus.
Liam: And I put him around my neck. I named him after you. (laughter)
Matt: "Really?"
Liam: He's my pet. Do you want to, he's gentle as a lamb. Do you want to tickle his neck?
Matt: "Yes." (laughter)
Liam: Yeah. Here, you hold him. I set it down around his neck. Don't worry. Nothing's going to happen. It's fine.
Matt: He locks up again. Snakes and women have the same reaction to this poor little boy.
Liam: Simon, fart in his ear. Go ahead and fart in his ear.
Matt: He gives you a stern look. And the snake just wraps around him for a second.
Marisha: Keyleth does a little wind gust and goes (poof).
Matt: He goes (giggles) and starts laughing. Reaches up and rubs his ear from the tickle.
Liam: It's good to see you again, kiddo. Come here, Simon Jr. I'll put him back, now.
Matt: He has a big smile on his face now. "That's so cool."
Laura: While that was happening, I pulled aside his mother. Is this everyone that made it out of Westruun?
Matt: (sighs) "Well, we're one group. Many went to Kymal, but they're at capacity now, and based on many of the farming fields that were destroyed or burned by the dragon ransacking, there's only so much food to go around, so they had to turn us away. But there were some small farming communities along the river that were kind enough to take us in and we're... we're getting by."
Laura: But you're searching for a home?
Matt: "Hoping to find out if anything takes care of the problems in Westruun. You should probably talk to Cornelius. I don't know the details of everything happening."
Laura: Cornelius. Is he the man I saw in the finer robes?
Matt: "No, no. Cornelius is rather-- he's not very well-dressed. He--" And she scratches her head. "He used to be the bookbinder in Westruun but when everything fell apart, he rose up and took the lead in keeping everyone safe and so, I mean, he won't say it, but we kind of look to him as a leader for now."
Laura: Did he work in the Cobalt Reserve?
Matt: "I think he did business with them, but I don't think he worked directly with."
Laura: Oh, okay.
Matt: "Here. Let me take you."
Laura: Oh, wonderful.
Matt: She walks over and, as you guys are talking to Simon, she scoops Simon up and pulls him to her side and gives you guys a smile of acknowledgement. "Come," and leads you guys--
Laura: We're meeting Cornelius.
Sam: Okay.
Travis: (softly) Who's Cornelius?
Laura: He's a bookbinder.
Travis: Never heard of him.
Matt: You guys are led through. Most of the folks stop what they're doing and pay attention. Some look wary and guarded. Others, you see their faces brighten up as they begin to connect the dots between the whispers they've heard of Vox Machina throughout the landscape and the individuals walking through. Most everyone seems to have a somewhat visceral emotional reaction once Grog passes by. It does catch you. You know, as a person who has always stuck out against the society as it was, and you've worked hard to a degree to get some respect, especially in that city. Having so many eyes on you, and you can feel the, while unearned from your standpoint, the heaps of hatred that are thrust upon you by how you look right now is uncomfortable. Eventually, the guards and Elowen bring you guys up to a central tent around what looks like a larger bonfire in the center where a lot of people are starting to bring their big nets of fish over and starting to divvy it out and set up small cooking arrangements so that people for the evening can have their dinner. She walks up to the edge of tent, speaks to one of the guards, mentions you guys and your wanting to talk to Cornelius. The guard leans in, shouts off to the side, "Cornelius, you've got some visitors. Is that okay?" A voice muffles through, "That's fine. Go ahead and let them in." The guard pulls open the tent, and at this point Elowen says, "I'm going to go get my son some food. If you need anything, just ask around."
Liam: We'll see you again.
Matt: "Thank you guys, again." She rubs Simon's head and walks off. And as she walks off with him, he keeps looking over his shoulder at you the whole time, with a big smile on his face. You guys walk into the tent, and it smells like a tent that's been lived in for a couple weeks. The interior's not fancy by any means. It's blankets and burlap, and whatever functions to guard against the relatively muddy shores of the river. And you get a sense that most places here, just because of the landscape and how close it is to the river, mud is tracked everywhere. So it's mostly caked ground. There is a small cot on the far edge and there is a table set up and some elements of dried fish that are just being pulled from a sack on the side. And there are two guards, and you can see what appears to be Cornelius coming to greet you, as you enter. A man in his mid-40's, blondish hair with a scruffy, unkempt beard. You get the sense that he's a working man. His hands look calloused. He's got a layer of just dirt and grime across his brow that tells you he's definitely one who gets in the thick of it when it's needed. And you can see why in this circumstance people put trust into a person that can rise up amongst all the chaos from simple means and prove themselves to want to help everybody. And in the moment he smiles, you immediately see also why people follow him. He's got this bright, toothy, white smile, and he puts his hand out immediately to each of you. "Pleasure to meet you. I'm Cornelius."
Laura: Vex'ahlia.
Matt: "So, I'm told that you all are here to talk to me? What's this about?"
Sam: We know that you've been driven out of your homes by an attack of dragon or dragons. How many have menaced your city?
Matt: "Well, counts all say that we have upwards of three dragons that came through here and tore into this city and-- They were gone for a while, and we'd hoped they weren't going to return, but that's when--" He kinda looks over to you, Grog. "That's when the savages came in and took what was left. And I mean no offense to that. I recognize you; I've seen you around the town before. You seem like you're not like your ilk."
Travis: No. No, I'm sorry, I don't know who you are.
Matt: "That's okay. No one really knows who I am and I want to keep it that way, when all this blows over."
Travis: Understandable.
Matt: "Don't like all the attention."
Taliesin: How long have you been nomadic for?
Matt: "We're going into our second week now, I think. We sent a few of our most able-bodied up north in hopes of trying to figure out if the city was safe to return to, and, well, only a few made it back, and those that did said it was a bloodbath."
Laura: It's quite dangerous there right now.
Matt: "Yeah."
Travis: How many do you have here, in your encampment with you?
Matt: "Let's see." He kind of takes a moment to think and does couple marks on the dirt in front of him to do a count. You can see he's not a very numbers-guided person.
Travis: I like him. (laughter)
Matt: "I'd say we got probably about close to 60, 70 people left. We used to have more. Then we lost the scouting parties up north and, well, these past four days we've had a few of these orcish fuckers been raiding the outskirts of our camp every night and taking goods, people--"
Marisha: What's your current destination?
Matt: "Hah, we got none. We're just staying here and staying alive."
Marisha: And what made you camp out here?
Matt: "Fish, mainly. I mean, all the farming grounds are destroyed or they're being guarded currently, and there's no space for us in Kymal. We can keep going east, but--"
Travis: If I could be selfish for a moment. Have you seen Wilhand? Pike, Pike Trickfoot. Her grandfather.
Laura: A small, older gnome?
Matt: "We got a few older gnomes from the city. I don't think we have any among us though, no."
Travis: Fine. Thought I'd ask.
Liam: If we could help you relocate quite a ways away, would you be open to that?
Matt: "How do you mean?"
Laura: There's a city. A lot of the refugees from other cities that have been destroyed by the dragons are finding their way there and--
Marisha: Percy actually has family who's in charge there.
Laura: We could give you safe passage.
Taliesin: Possibly find you someplace to work.
Laura: Very quick, safe passage.
Marisha: Can they account for 70 extra people in Whitestone?
Taliesin: We lost a lot during the attack with the Briarwoods.
Marisha: Right.
Taliesin: There's room, but there's only-- We can maybe make room for a few more.
Laura: There's farmland, there are some empty buildings.
Matt: "I appreciate the offer, and--"
Marisha: It hasn't been touched by dragons yet.
Matt: "Hah. 'Yet.'"
Marisha: Yet.
Matt: "I tell you what. We greatly appreciate the offer, and we're liable to take you up on that at some point in the near future. But right now, we have too many of our people that are unaccounted for to the south. We got a couple scouting groups who're trying to find out where these orcs are, where they've taken them. See if we can retrieve our own before we go ahead and find a new place to live."
Sam: How many are missing right now?
Matt: "Well, we lost 11 in the last few nights of exchange, to blade, and we've lost about nine to the actual bands themselves, so. There's nine unaccounted for. We're hoping--"
Sam: If we found them, would you be more likely to take your people to somewhere safe?
Marisha: And what is necessarily stopping you from at least sending a handful of women and children ahead? Families that don't need to be nomadic.
Matt: "Do you have the means to keep them safe for that kind of travel? That's a long way, up to Whitestone. We don't have the guards to keep them up on that."
Laura: We have very safe means of travel.
Taliesin: A shortcut, one would say.
Marisha: They'd be there in an instant.
Matt: "I don't know anything about any of that weird magic stuff, but you seem like a reliable group."
Liam: You can tell we're a motley bunch of assholes. We've seen shit and we've done shit and we can do shit.
Matt: "Ain't that the truth. Well--"
Taliesin: We'd also like to talk to you, perhaps, to see if you've seen some shit. We're actually looking for something out here.
Laura: Oh.
Liam: Are we?
Taliesin: We are. Well, you've been travelling, we're looking for a creature who may have what we need to help defeat these dragons.
Laura: Possibly a bit deeper into the Frostweald.
Matt: "Into the Frostweald?"
Taliesin: Yes.
Matt: "That's where we're thinking our scouts are saying these orcs are holed up, anyway."
Laura: Really?
Taliesin: That's useful.
Matt: "At least, that's where we've been sending our folk. And follow them out there. Only one group went in after them and they never came back, so--"
Marisha: No one's returned who's come back?
Matt: "Oh, we've gotten one group that came back. That's how we know they're there. But they were just a scouting party. They got to the outskirts and came back."
Marisha: Can we speak to them?
Matt: "I think they're out right now, actually. Going to get more information. Sorry."
Taliesin: Well, that works out well, then. We can go up that direction, perhaps take care of this problem, possibly.
Laura: Yes.
Taliesin: It's on the way.
Travis: I wouldn't mind a good stretch.
Laura: Kill some orc.
Taliesin: I could use some breathing.
Marisha: Do you know your way around the Frostweald at all?
Matt: "Can't say I do. But I do have some stake in this personally, if you don't mind me asking. We don't have much to offer you, at all, really, other than my gratitude. Tell of a few friends of ours that've found their way wherever these savage creatures are stationed. One of the individuals that was taken in a raid two nights ago was my brother, Cyrus. Don't know if he's still amongst the living, but if you are indeed planning on taking a look at where these orcs are and bring folks back safe, if you could just keep an eye out for him?"
Liam: Well, I'll tell you, in times like these, it will feel good to be able to do a bit of good.
Taliesin: Hear, hear.
Laura: What does your brother look like?
Matt: "He's about 15 years younger than me. Shaggy brown hair, bit of a puffy goatee. He looks like a lazy man. He is a lazy man, but I love him. If you're looking for someone who's hiding in the corner, shaking in their boots, it's probably him."
Laura: Understood.
Travis: Check the corners.
Matt: "It's his defense mechanism."
Laura: (laughs) A very safe one.
Matt: "I hope." His eyes go a little colder at that moment. "I hope."
Laura: Well, we've been to the Frostweald before. I'm not afraid to go in there again.
Marisha: No.
Taliesin: I say we take the evening to rest, and first thing in the morning, head out.
Laura: Would there be any injured members of your camp that would want to head out in the morning to Whitestone? Somebody that needs any medical attention?
Matt: "We've got plenty of folks who aren't feeling too well. Illness and disease, unfortunately, tend to go hand-in-hand with these type of nomadic lifestyles. We can probably-- about seven or eight people that could use some relatively immediate attention. Couple survivors of the recent raids. If you can indeed do this, you might be saving some lives, here."
Marisha: Are we camping the rest of the night?
Taliesin: Yes.
Liam: That's wise.
Travis: Yeah, we promise you no one will bother you tonight.
Marisha: Question. Question. Can I do my Transport via Plants as a ritual cast to not burn a slot level?
Matt: Nope.
Marisha: That's what I thought.
Matt: It would say it next to the spell. Ritual.
Marisha: That's what I thought. Okay. Keyleth spends the rest of the evening burning up my remainder spell slots to do curing on those who need it.
Matt: Okay. You guys are given a relatively ramshackle tent in which you can sleep for the evening, cooked fish-- that's about all they have to offer-- with a few leftover potatoes that appear to have been recently either located amongst their remaining crates, you have no idea, but a passable meal is presented if you'd like, and a place that has cloth over your head.
Travis: No, I don't need to sleep tonight. I'll be on the watch.
Sam: Boy. (laughter)
Laura: Should we scour the camp for her grandfather?
Taliesin: I'm sleeping tonight. I don't know what's wrong with him.
Laura: I know he said there were no gnomes, but--
Travis: There's only 60 people. I feel like he'd know with 60.
Laura: Yeah.
Travis: That's like this many, like--
Liam: And it's not a lot of gnomes. I'm assuming it's a handful of gnomes.
Travis: Yeah.
Laura: Right. I just, I don't know. I wish Pike were here.
Travis: Yeah, me too.
Liam: Always wish Pike was here.
Matt: You do recall, last time you were in Whitestone, you left the other half of your gatestone with Pike.
Taliesin: I'll write a letter.
Marisha: We'll write a letter.
Taliesin: I'll write a letter that will travel with them to Whitestone and--
Sam: Oh.
Marisha: Ooh, that's a good idea.
Laura: That's wonderful, and she can pop over.
Taliesin: Mm-hm. Take about a minute.
Travis: Really?
Marisha: Yeah.
Sam: Wait, we'd have to send them tonight, though.
Taliesin: No, in the morning.
Laura: They could go in the morning and just go find her immediately.
Marisha: Yeah, could task someone to find her immediately and then, as soon as she gets the message, she'll beam to us.
Sam: All right.
Liam: I've still got the other one. Right here.
Travis: Great. We take the night, then.
Laura: All right.
Taliesin: I write a letter to my sister, letting her know that I do apologize that we're sending more people, but it's necessary, and I write her a letter insisting that Pike be sent here by stone immediately.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: (singing) D-E-A-R C-A-S-S, how are you? I'm fine.
Laura: What the fuck are you singing?
Taliesin: (singing) Everybody else is too!
Liam: Wow! You know what I'm doing!
Travis: Holy shit, what the fuck just happened?
Laura: What was that?
Taliesin: You are a nerd!
Liam: A theatre nerd, yeah.
Taliesin: Yeah, you are a theatre nerd.
Laura: Wow.
Liam: Secret Garden, ladies and gentlemen.
Taliesin: Secret Garden  The Musical. It's magical.
Liam: Can we have the break so Taliesin and I can go make out in the other room?
Matt: Don't go on break for that! Just move your seating arrangement.
Taliesin: And suddenly the YouTube hits just go through the roof. (laughter)
Sam: What injured people are going back? Have we met these people yet? Can we meet them?
Matt: You haven't met them, no.
Laura: Let's go find the injured.
Matt: You guys are led with Keyleth as well. There are two armed guards that are hobbling their way through their patrols tonight as they've been wounded in the previous orc raid that happened the couple nights beforehand. There are a number of just relatively sick people. Couple of children. Whether it be having to eat whatever was around to stay alive but some of the food had spoiled in travel, or just catching disease as when you have clusters of people in cold environments, especially cold, wet environments like this tonight. It does tend to happen. Nothing seriously life-threatening, but, you know, definitely worrisome.
Sam: I try to find the one who's the most able-bodied. Right? We're going to need someone to go find Pike or deliver a message, right?
Laura: Yes.
Taliesin: It's going to be whoever's organizing it.
Sam: Is someone going who's not injured to transport these people?
Matt: Possibly. And you can organize whoever you'd like. Someone you know, you could bring along.
Marisha: Well, I start attending to the children first.
Matt: Okay. So you tend to the children, helping them feel comfortable, deal with any wounds, scrapes, relative inconveniences, and it's easy enough for you to take a moment to cure disease if need be.
Laura: Can we find any families with children and maybe see if there's able bodies in there that we could send through?
Matt: Okay. Yeah, you manage to-- and with Elowen and her son Simon as well--
Laura: Yes. Maybe Elowen could go?
Taliesin: Elowen would be perfect.
Marisha: Well, remember, we were able to get about 25 or so people through last time with the spell.
Laura: How many sick people are there?
Matt: You see about seven or eight people that could use it.
Laura: Perfect.
Matt: So you can get a bunch of other folks through as well.
Marisha: Okay.
Laura: I talk to Elowen and ask if she can go find Pike in the morning, if she wants to go through, and all that kind of stuff.
Matt: "I'd be happy to, I--"
Sam: You remember what Pike looks like?
Matt: "Yeah. About your size, lightish hair--"
Sam: Hair the color of the sunset, eyes like waves that crash in the night, breasts, supple, firm--
Travis: Okay, Scanlan. Scanlan.
Ashley: True, true, true. (laughter)
Matt: "Right. Yes, I remember. I'll find her, yes."
Sam: Smell of morning dew as it touches--
Matt: She begins to cover Simon's ears. (laughter)
Matt: "All right, I think we should turn in for the evening, but yes, I'll be happy to take care of it."
Liam: Also of note, you're going to be going through a tree.
Matt: "What?"
Liam: Just go with it. You're going to be--
Marisha: Well, you know, you didn't have to tell them that now. Could've just let it be a surprise.
Laura: It's really fun, actually.
Liam: It's kind of frightening, though, if you don't know it's coming.
Laura: You'll pop right out in Whitestone. It's amazing.
Liam: It's still a little weird for me, to be honest.
Marisha: Is it? Okay, that's good to know.
Matt: "All right. All right." So, as the evening comes to completion, you're taking guard for the course of the evening.
Laura: I pop Trinket out and I sleep on him.
Travis: Very attentive.
Matt: (bear sound) He curls up.
Laura: Hugs and hugs.
Matt: Yeah. Warm, fuzzy. Trinket makes for a very good bed for one.
Laura: Yes.
Liam: I'm going to curl into the butt end, which is all I get. All I ever got while we were traveling.
Laura: Yeah. He farts on you all the time.
Liam: I fart on him all the time.
Matt: It's just a fart exchange. Back and forth, forever.
Liam: Bada-lang-lang-lang-lang-lang-lang-lang.
Matt: (laughs) That got weird. Did you want to do anything for the evening?
Travis: No.
Matt: Okay. Make a perception check.
Sam: Oh boy.
Liam: Oh crud. Big two!
Travis: Big watch, big watch. Nine!
Laura: Ey-oh!
Liam: Ey-oh! (exploding sounds)
Matt: Okay. All right. The evening goes by without a hitch. (groans)
Laura: What would you have seen? What would you have seen?
Matt: You all come to consciousness. You eventually get your rest as well for the evening.
Marisha: What didn't you see? Tell me what you didn't see.
Matt: At this point, the tent city is back to a bustling sound of folks going about their business for the day, what kind of business that can be done. The people that you've requested be sent over to Whitestone have been gathered on the outside, the western side of this small city area, and some of the guards there are prepared to greet you in preparation for sending these people over.
Sam: Keyleth, before we do this, there are no trees here.
Marisha: What? What do you mean? Are there trees here?
Matt: No. It's a plain. I mean, there are the occasional small tree, scattered in clusters around, but you're in the grasslands.
Marisha: I thought we were on the edge of a forest.
Sam: There's no forest here.
Matt: The forest is south of you guys.
Laura: We've got to walk them to the forest.
Marisha: How fucking far are trees?
Matt: I'd say, probably--
Sam: Four days' journey.
Matt: No, from this area, it's most of a day's travel. There are trees closer, but the forest is that far.
Marisha: I just need a tree to fit people through. I need a person-width tree.
Sam: A giant tree.
Matt: To find a tree large enough to do this is probably going to be about two hours' walking distance.
Laura: Okay, we can walk for two hours.
Marisha: That's a nice morning hike.
Laura: You know what, I'm going to fly up. I'm going to (hacking spit) and fly up and find a fucking tree.
Sam: Oh, you're going to scout?
Laura: I'm going to scout for a tree.
Matt: All right. Go ahead and make a perception check.
Travis: Why did you pick that as the word?
Laura: I didn't think about it. I forgot.
Taliesin: That was a great decision.
Laura: 23.
Matt: 23. You find, actually, hiding just around the bend of a series of small hills that butt up against the southwestern side of the Foramere Basin, there is a small cluster of trees, one of which is the largest of the group, that may function as a function of this that is only about a 30-minute walk from these.
Marisha: That's doable. There we go.
Laura: Fly back down and I tell them. I look along the path, though, and make sure it's safe, the walking back. Is it okay?
Matt: Yeah.
Liam: Hopefully nobody saw the comely half-elf flying through the bright blue sky.
Laura: I wear turquoise to blend in with the blue surroundings.
Matt: You didn't blend in too well, as when you crested over, a number of the families and kids that were prepared were pointing up. "Mom, she's flying!" People were excited to see you take off into the distance. It was quite a display. Well done.
Laura: I do some circles around and wave.
Liam: Maybe you can join Dr. Dranzel in the circus.
Laura: I hang off of it as I come down, like woo! And then come back up.
Matt: Go ahead and roll a dexterity check.
Laura: Dexterity or acrobatics?
Matt: Dexterity.
Laura: Damn it.
Travis: Outstanding.
Laura: I said as I come down. It was low. I was low.
Matt: So as Vex takes a moment to do some unique tricks with her elaborate and long-running experience directing brooms across the sky, she gets a bit cocky and does a "look, ma, no hands" moment. However, in doing so, the broom sputters out from under the grasp of her legs, and suddenly goes limp as it begins to fall almost as fast as you are, as you both begin to plummet.
Laura: I grab for it! And (hacking spit) as I'm grabbing for it.
Liam: You can't fight the power of the one.
Matt: Unfortunately, you don't have any momentum to go forward, and it's already coasted about 15, 20 feet away from you, and there's nowhere to swim. All the kids are like, "Yay!" Cheering, and all of a sudden you start falling, and they go (screaming). And starts yelling.
Taliesin: Which child in the crowd is going to become Robin? I'm so excited.
Matt: I want you to go ahead and roll an acrobatics check.
Taliesin: This is how we make a vigilante.
Laura: Okay, okay. 25.
Matt: 25, okay. So you only suffer nine points of falling damage as you hit the ground and do a tumble, land arms out and catch the broom, smiling amongst the serious pain in your legs and back.
Laura: I'll bet you thought I was really falling!
Matt: All the kids are like, "Yay!" And start cheering, clapping. Even the parents start clapping. The guards start clapping, like, "That was genuinely impressive." Played it off.
Travis: Blood trickles out of the ear from the brain trauma. (laughter)
Sam: Does the broom just fall, or does it shoot off like a missile?
Matt: It shoots off for a second, carrying the momentum of the propulsion, and then it falls limp as it no longer has the immediate connection with the person. But she did catch it after she tumbled.
Sam: Oh, okay, that's cool.
Taliesin: Working on it.
Laura: I'm going to work on that trick, you guys, and it's going to be amazing.
Taliesin: I think it's perfect.
Liam: Blood for the blood gods.
Matt: All right. Finding the tree, you guys walk, and bringing the families and the children and the people that were chosen to go to Whitestone, Keyleth, you create your Transport via Plants spell. (whoosh) The doorway opens, and it barely fits onto this one half-dead willow that's cresting the side there. Everyone (gasps).
Marisha: We form the line, the ranks.
Liam: Climb through, climb through, you have to move quickly.
Marisha: Go, go, go, go!
Matt: At the very end, Elowen's the last one through, and she's holding the letter and she looks back and says, "Promise," and leaps through right as it closes in the tree. You look toward the guards that were with you guys, who are just watching this whole thing with their eyes wide open.
Travis: Glad you let us in, aren't you?
Matt: "Yeah."
Marisha: I turn to him and I go, high five! Okay.
Matt: At this point, you see two figures walking towards you at this southern forest.
Sam: Two figures walking towards us?
Matt: Towards you guys, rather hastily.
Sam: I draw my whip.
Matt: Okay. Whip's out. You glance over and, easy enough to see, it is Drez Vina and this older individual, both rushing up. Drez has his hand up. "Excuse me, I'm sorry, pardon me!"
Taliesin: Yes, hello? Hello?
Matt: "It has been some time, everyone. Pleasure to see you again."
Laura: We remember, dear.
Matt: "Wondrous, wondrous. I'm here with--" And as he gestures, the old man puts his hand in front and goes, "Would you please just let me talk for once? Hello. I am--" And he looks over. "Has he been giving you my-- I am Master Quall. Pleasure to meet all of you."
Sam: Quall?
Matt: "I was the collector that had hired you in previous times as Drez has recently made me aware, and while our track record has been spotty, you seem to be rather able-bodied, and whispers this morning that have come to my ears mention that you have interest in returning to Westruun. Is that correct?"
Sam: To set it free, yes.
Matt: "Wondrous, wondrous." He looks over to Drez. Drez goes, "Yes, well, you see, the master here lives within Westruun, and-- " "I'm talking, I've got this. My abode, which is a relatively humble structure, two stories, bricks and dark wood, southeast of the town square, right by the fountain crossroads, I'm sure you've seen it before. Since this whole endeavor has happened, it has usurped a bit of progress in my experimentation, and I would be remiss if I didn't request your assistance in perhaps retrieving a very important piece of my collection so I might continue this research in this desolate place."
Liam: What are the subjects of your experimentation?
Matt: "Various things. I enjoy finding out the base elements of existence and life."
Laura: Insight check.
Matt: Insight check.
Laura: He's lying. 18.
Matt: 18.
Taliesin: God damn it.
Travis: Whispers!
Sam: Dagger Dagger Dagger is one of the shirts that's available. There's Strongjaw Ale. Strongjaw Ale available for sale. Check it out. Geek and Sundry.
Taliesin: That's very interesting. Did you know that I'm a collector as well, actually?
Matt: "Really? Oh, quaint."
Taliesin: Of specifics.
Matt: "Of what?"
Taliesin: Specifics. I see that you have not really handed any over.
Matt: "It may be a bit beyond your understanding."
Laura: Very few things are beyond his understanding.
Matt: "Very well. I appreciate the synergies between various elements and the ability to link the essence with that of a living organic entity, or the transition of such living essence into what is normally non-living matter."
Marisha: So you're a necromancer.
Matt: "No! I don't deal with that ridiculous stuff."
Taliesin: He's talking about transmutation of some kind.
Matt: "Yes, yes! Thank you. The transitioning of essences or sparking essence within what was once non-living matter. I'm talking about elements, I'm not talking about flesh."
Marisha: Like natural elements?
Laura: Like golems.
Taliesin: It's the veganism of necromancy. It's just kind of dull.
Matt: "What was that?"
Taliesin: Nothing.
Matt: "Now, I had previously asked you to retrieve an item in the past. That was part of this research and I was nearing a breakthrough, I believe. However, if you could find your way into this abode and retrieve for me-- It's in the basement, amongst my work desk area. It's a simple dark iron and cobalt circlet. A band, if you will. If you could retrieve that for me, I would make it quite worth your while and be ever-grateful and in your service."
Liam: What are we talking about, a pile of coin, or something else?
Matt: "As I said before, I am quite the collector, and while I do hate to relinquish my grasp on various parts of this collection, for someone who does me a grand favor, I am willing to look the other way as one might disappear."
Laura: What does the circlet do?
Matt: "It's more of an experimental piece."
Liam: Come on. Don't treat us like a bunch of fucking assholes. It's in the middle of shit right now. We're not going to go in there for a trinket. It's obviously something very worthwhile. You would have a better chance with us if you're honest.
Matt: Drez at this point steps forward and goes, "I would appreciate if you respected the master for his research. He is going to offer you a great guide."
Marisha: Oh, shut up, Drez.
Liam: Yeah, you're an asshole. You're the biggest asshole. I'm not talking to you. I'm talking to you. I'm not talking to you, I'm talking to you.
Matt: "Sir, perhaps we need to--" At which point he looks over and the master's like (cackling). "About time someone called you on it."
Sam: Master Quall. We're looking for the Vestiges of Divergence.
Laura: Scanlan, what the fuck?
Sam: Oh, am I not supposed to say that? Do you know where those are? That's what we want. If you can offer us one of those, we'll do business with you. Otherwise, we're going to fuck off.
Marisha: Wait, he might. Look, Master Quall. Finish what you were saying first.
Matt: "Yes. I've heard of this title before. You say you're seeking them, are you?"
Sam: I am. Not them.
Matt: "Where are you seeking these? Whereabouts are you off to?"
Marisha: Well, we were headed towards--
Sam: We don't know where they are.
Laura: They're all sorts of different places. We're trying to figure that out right now. We're not exactly sure. We're not exactly sure, Keyleth.
Sam: We thought you might know.
Marisha: How is what we're seeking less important than where we're seeking it? I'm really confused.
Travis: Oh, you know, just in case we mention where we might be looking for them, in front of these people.
Laura: Because what if he goes to find them?
Matt: "Don't worry."
Marisha: Does he look like the man capable of going and finding things? He's trying to send us back into his own god damn basement to get his own shit.
Matt: "See, there is a woman who speaks both her mind and a mind of quite acute truth."
Sam: She is cute.
Laura: Is it morning yet? Can Pike come join us yet?
Sam: She is being sought.
Matt: As you guys are having this conversation, there's a little (crackling) flash of divine energy before you, and a slight popping sound as out of the middle of the air next to you, there comes, jogging in, a freshly winded, fully armored Pike.
Sam: What an entrance!
Taliesin: See, you start arguing and you just make a gnome. This is what happens.
Travis: I run over and I pick up Pike and I spin her around in a big bear hug.
Ashley: Hey, Grog!
Travis: Oh, my little buddy Pike. We missed you.
Ashley: Oh, I missed you guys.
Marisha: Hi, Pike!
Ashley: Hey guys! Oh, who are these two?
Matt: At this point, Master Quall is going through a series of notes. He goes, "I'm very certain this gnome was not created."
Marisha: And you remember Drez.
Ashley: Oh, yes. Mr. Vina. Drez Vina.
Matt: "Yes. It is a delight to see you as well, small one."
Ashley: Hi!
Matt: "Well, this grew very complicated."
Taliesin: Master Quall.
Matt: "Yes."
Taliesin: Let's lay the cards on the table. If we find this thing of yours in your basement, and if we go to your home, we are certainly going to go into the basement and find it now regardless, we're going to figure out what it is before we give it to you anyway. The world is dangerous right now, and it is not appropriate to just be handing mystical artifacts of great strength willy-nilly to anybody who asks. The world is dangerous and we need to make sure that power is flowing in the correct direction. Now, you can either be forthright with that and get your property, or we can find it in your basement and experiment on it until we know what it is.
Matt: "Good luck even attempting such an endeavor."
Taliesin: I have very good luck attempting these endeavors.
Matt: "Well. Let's just say that it's a device that, when completed, to the specialty of my own training and studies, would enable me the means of personal defense to get me through these rather difficult and dangerous times. As I am not getting any younger and it seems that we're having entities of great power and mischief intent on destruction continuously tearing down my very doorways--" He looks off in the direction of Westruun. "I would feel more comfortable if I could keep myself well guarded. And that is what this circlet is intended to provide."
Laura: Tell you what, Master Quall.
Matt: "Yes?"
Laura: We're not heading there now, but we'll be going back, and when we do, we will find your home, and we will search out this circlet.
Sam: Well, hold on, before we just say no, what's the reward? Do we know what you're paying for this?
Taliesin: Well, he's got a collection.
Matt: "A simple trade of my collection. You bring me one of my items, and I gift you one of mine as well."
Taliesin: I personally feel this is reasonable.
Marisha: I'm curious if you could be more beneficial in paying us with information. With knowledge.
Laura: As well as something from your collection.
Matt: "I am more than willing to offer information for trade. It is quite a grand trade indeed. If that is acceptable."
Laura: No, we would want something as well, physically.
Taliesin: This is a deposit of information.
Matt: "All right. Then, as part of the deposit, what do you require of me?"
Marisha: Are you familiar with a sphinx named Osysa?
Matt: "Can't say that I am."
Marisha: Resides up-- No?
Taliesin: What does he know, perhaps, of the-- no?
Marisha: Are you familiar with any other sphinxes that reside in this area? Do you know the address?
Matt: "I'm sorry, but they don't really wander in open daylight."
Laura: Do you know where they wander?
Taliesin: In darkness, if they don't wander in open daylight.
Matt: He gives a curious look at both of you. "I am not a master of mythology. I do not know of such entities and where they might reside or exist. I apologize."
Marisha: Well, you do seem to be a master of items. We are looking for certain special Vestiges.
Matt: "So you say. And you're saying this sphinx may want to help you in this endeavor?"
Marisha: We're not sure yet.
Taliesin: It's a long walk.
Marisha: We thought maybe he could help us find them, but maybe you could be of a similar service.
Matt: "Well. What I do have--" And he turns around. "Come with me to my tent, please. I may have something that can be of service to you."
Marisha: Sure.
Laura: I give Pike a hug as we walk to his tent.
Sam: Actually, I pull Pike aside and say-- Well, not aside. I just ask her, how's Whitestone? What's going on there?
Ashley: Well, it's okay. I think I got to the point where I couldn't build anymore, heal any more people. I needed a little adventure. But everything is as you would think it would be.
Sam: No dragon attacks?
Ashley: None at the moment. We've been trying to hold down the place as much as we can, and getting there seems to be okay.
Liam: I did not go up to Pike. I hung way the fuck back.
Matt: All right. You guys eventually make your way back to the small outpost, at this point, to the tent of Drez Vina and Master Quall. Master Quall steps inside. You hear him rummaging through some things. Something rolls and breaks, and you hear, "Oh, damn it!" from the inside. He comes back out and goes, "All right, so, this." And he holds up this small glass bauble. The inside has a spinning, looks like a brass gyroscope-type interior. He goes, "This item, when clasped and concentrated on, should light up any sort of nearby magical incantations or enchantments. This, if you are in the presence of such objects as you are seeking, should be quite helpful in locating their presence. It does not have an incredibly long range, but it should, at the very least, be somewhat helpful."
Laura: That's pretty cool.
Sam: You're giving this to us?
Matt: "I'm lending it to you. Should you wish this to be part of the trade instead of something from my collection..."
Laura: No no no. Lending is--
Taliesin: Lending is perfectly agreeable.
Matt: "Now I have lent you something in the past, and not only did it not return to me, but I had to extract the funds by forcing another contract on you. Can I trust you to complete this endeavor?"
Sam: You can trust us, as far as Grog can throw me.
Travis: Pretty fucking far.
Taliesin: You can trust her.
Matt: "Deal." And he hands it out.
Travis: We will make our way into the city, and when we do, we will look for your items.
Matt: "Thank you. I appreciate that."
Sam: Or we could just send Vex on a broom right now to get it solo--
Marisha: Wait, what? What?
Taliesin: We are not flying a half-elf into the city on a broom that she has already fallen off of in the last 24 hours.
Liam: Archers!
Laura: I am recovering a bit right now, but thank you for the wonderful, wonderful idea, Scanlan!
Sam: I think you can do it. I think you can do it.
Laura: Thank you! I appreciate the vote of confidence.
Liam: He is a tactician.
Marisha: Hey, what might this item be called, Sir Quall?
Matt: "I haven't named it, actually. I made it for myself. Call it what you like."
Sam: How about "The Hunk of Quall"?
Marisha: The Hunk of Quall.
Matt: "Should you wish, certainly."
Taliesin: Didn't we had a conversation about letting him name things? I feel like we had this conversation.
Travis: Always do it, right?
Matt: "Enjoy carrying among yourselves The Hunk of Quall."
Travis: Thank you. Drez Vina, it hasn't been a pleasure, nice to see you.
Matt: Drez crosses his arms, "Indeed. All right, good luck."
Travis: And can I take Pike around the shoulder and lead her out of the tent?
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: Hey, hey... hey, Pike?
Ashley: Yeah?
Travis: So I'm glad things have been good at Whitestone. They've been good, yeah?
Ashley: Yeah, they've been all right, I mean, it's okay, I've been missing you guys, though.
Travis: Yeah, we miss you a whole lot. Listen, I've got some rough news, actually. We made it back to Westruun, and the city has kind of been ransacked and overtaken. It was attacked by a bunch of dragons, and what's worse is that after it was attacked-- you know that herd of wandering goliaths that left me for dead in the woods?
Ashley: Of course.
Travis: Yeah, they've kind of taken control of the city, and I think that's my family that's in there.
Ashley: Oh no.
Travis: Yeah. Look, we wanted to go in, I wanted to look for Wilhand, but we haven't done it yet, and--
Ashley: Have you heard anything else? Do you think they are okay?
Travis: I don't know. Some of us went in via mist and they haven't seen him, but they don't really know what he looks like. The place looks pretty rough, he's not here in this little encampment. I'm not really sure where he is.
Ashley: Okay. Well, I wonder if we should go look for him
Travis: Yeah, I want to, but like, listen. I'm afraid to put everybody in the group in jeopardy. They're going to be there, in the city, and I was wondering what you might think about going to look for a few other more Vestiges, trying to find Osysa's mate and seeing if we can find anything that can help us, because it's going to be a fight, right? And you know me: I fucking love a fight, but--
Ashley: That's a lot of them.
Travis: Yeah, it's a lot.
Ashley: I think we should wait until we're fully prepared.
Travis: Yeah, you think so?
Ashley: I think so. I don't think it's safe any other way.
Travis: I missed you so much!
Ashley: Oh Grog, I missed you too!
Travis: And I cry a little bit into my beard, and I wipe it away I'm like: Oh! The pollen out in these fields is awful! (laughter)
Ashley: It's okay, Grog! I give him a hug, and I take my blue scarf and I pat his eyes.
All: Oh!
Travis: (crying) It's raining! (laughter)
Travis: As soon as we find this out, if we find nothing-- I promise, I pledge to you that we will find Wilhand.
Ashley: Okay.
Travis: All right.
Matt: All right.
Sam: So, is the task then to go find the orcs that are keeping their people hostage up in the Frostweald?
Laura: We head into the Frostweald, we find the orcs and send them back and keep going and find this Sphinx-y mate.
Marisha: Did we have any other information of where he is in the Frostweald or do we just know Frostweald?
Laura: We just know Frostweald. Pike?
Matt: The information that you received was, somewhere in the base of the Stormcrest Mountains, past the Frostweald.
Marisha: Past the Frostweald?
Liam: Through it to the base of the mountain.
Laura: Of the what mountain?
Matt: Stormcrest Mountains.
Liam: That's a real place.
Travis: Actually, Pike.
Ashley: Yeah?
Travis: I've been holding on to something, and I think you might like it. I have these Gauntlets of Ogre Power, and I can't wear them anymore, because I got some new stuff, and if you wear it, your strength score goes up to 19.
Ashley: What!
Travis: Do you want them? You have to attune to them.
Ashley: Do you think they'll fit?
Travis: I think they might shrink. I don't know, though.
Taliesin: Do you know what 19 means?
Travis: Isn't it like a French dish?
Laura: Yes.
Ashley: I would love to wear those.
Travis: All right, and I give Pike the Gauntlets of Ogre Power.
Matt: As you guys take a short rest to prepare for this, Ashley, you take some time with the gauntlets, and while you're looking them over and taking your own armored gauntlets off and replacing them with these, your hand goes-- It's like placing a baseball into a bucket. It's so big around your arm. But then as you take a moment to see the metal and reflect upon it, you can feel the hum of magical energy that begins to invisibly intertwine with your forearm as the metal begins to creak almost, and it shrinks down, encases itself to your forearm. While it doesn't match the metal of your armor, the silver-gold theme that goes on along it with this weird ogreish face that's built into the plate there, you feel suddenly this surge of strength begin to spill through your body, and you're pretty confident that this may be useful in the near future.
Laura: You're stronger than Grog now!
Matt: You are technically now stronger than Grog.
Ashley: I let out a little battle cry. (battle cry)
Travis: Yeah, and I go to give her a fist bump.
Ashley: I fist bump him!
Matt: And it hurts you a little bit.
Laura: Oh, shit! Pike is so strong!
Travis: Holy shit. Nice, Pike!
Matt: Pike, what was your strength before?
Ashley: 13.
Matt: Okay. At a 19, you're now at a plus four as opposed to a plus one to all your hit and damage with your physical weapons.
Liam: You just Tyler Durden-ed out, son!
Matt: So on your sheet, where it has your attack bonus with your mace, or with your morningstar, and the damage, add a plus three to both the attack bonus and damage.
Ashley: All right, because right now my attack bonus is plus seven, so I add three to that.
Matt: It's now plus ten.
Laura: Holy moley!
Marisha: That's so cool! You're a beast!
Liam: Little golden bullet.
Ashley: I can't find a pencil! That's okay, I'll make a note. I can do it later. I am unprepared. Yes, I am unprepared for all this strength!
Travis: Right, so now we have all our stuff. Should we make our way towards that area they said that the orc raiders were coming from?
Sam: Yeah, it's a couple days from here?
Matt: On foot travel, it's about a day and a half.
Sam: For mist form?
Matt: Mist form, you'll get there by nightfall.
Laura: But we can't use it, because she already used the travel through the trees.
Marisha: Sorry.
Laura: But we saved all those people, Scanlan.
Sam: Pike, can you make us mist?
Ashley: No, I can't do anything like that.
Sam: All right.
Laura: Let's walk.
Ashley: I feel like I haven't spent any time with Vax.
Sam: With Vax? Oh, he's around. You know, he's probably just sulking.
Liam: I walk away.
Matt: You glance back and see Vax towards the back of the group. Noticing this conversation, Vax immediately turns around and walks away and dodges around one of the nearby tents.
Liam: Big nope to that one.
Travis: What is the weather like outside?
Matt: Actually, today it's spotty clouds, but blue sky. It's actually pretty good weather, versus a lot of the rain that you had over in Vasselheim.
Travis: Cold, snowy on the ground?
Matt: No. Because you're getting a little further south than the northern area of it, the temperature is probably around high 70s, low 80s.
Laura: It is going to get cold, though, once we head into the Frostweald. We had all those fancy cloaks. I had winter's cloaks for all of us before.
Travis: I still have mine.
Laura: Does everyone still have their winter's cloaks from a long time ago?
Marisha: I do.
Taliesin: Oh, wow, yes, look at that.
Sam: I didn't burn it.
Travis: Let's go.
Sam: We're just going to walk? Do these refugees have any horses or anything?
Laura: They're refugees.
Matt: The few horses they do have are currently quartered to wagons and look to be more beasts of burden for, if they have to move, to carry most of their goods with them, as opposed to riding horses.
Travis: Come on, man, let's just hoof it.
Sam: All right, we'll walk.
Marisha: Oh my gosh, are we walking? We haven't walked anywhere in so long.
Liam: It's like we're back in New York again.
Marisha: It's like we're level three again.
Matt: And those horses will survive, because you didn't take them.
Travis: Oh, that's fucked up.
Laura: That's really sad.
Travis: Take a walk. Save a horse.
Matt: That's a good Vox Machina bumper sticker.
Taliesin: My other horse is walking.
Travis: Coming to the Geek and Sundry store.
Matt: All right. You guys make your Fellowship trek southward with the sweeping camera drone shot.
Laura: I constantly keep an eye out for anything in the front of us and behind us.
Matt: Thankfully, most of these fields, of varying degrees of grass height, but for the most part it's pretty wide vision of where you're heading.
Marisha: I paint pictures in the clouds as we go.
Laura: Oh, that's good. That'll definitely not let anyone know magical people are on their way.
Taliesin: Just point arrows in the opposite direction.
Travis: Graffiti as we go.
Ashley: Can I insight-check Vax?
Matt: Sure. Roll an insight check.
Ashley: Natural 20.
Matt: I believe you.
Marisha: This never happens.
Sam: You just saw all of his dirty dreams.
Matt: What does she see and read on your face and body language, Vax?
Liam: I got to say this?
Matt: I can say it, if you want to.
Liam: I don't want these assholes to know what I'm thinking. I don't know. Can't whisper it to her.
Matt: You can text it to her real fast, if you want.
Liam: Yeah, I'll text it to you.
Laura: But put it on Twitter so that everybody else knows what it is.
Liam: No.
Ashley: I'll post it.
Matt: Okay, so you'll have an incoming text of information. As you guys continue walking, these are the observations you make of Vax as you travel southward. You travel for the better part of a day. You get quite a bit south. You do see in the distance a few times what appear to be some pack animals, some larger beasts that roam the land, none that are necessarily aggressive unless you encroach upon their territory, and Keyleth, you have experience with some of these beasts, so you manage to keep people at bay and traverse around what they claim as their own landscape. No terrible detriment to your traveling speed. You make your way to the point where the sun goes down. You can stop and camp for the night or you can push through the evening. What do you wish to do?
Marisha: Are there any trees nearby?
Matt: Little periods here, little tiny groves that might be spotty along your journey, but for the most part it's open fields.
Marisha: How much further do we have, do you think?
Matt: One more day. One more eight-hour period of travel.
Laura: We should probably rest, then, right? We'll be hitting the Frostweald at night tomorrow.
Taliesin: We're not in a rush.
Laura: Not anymore. The dragons are bunkered down, I believe.
Taliesin: Everything we do now is measured in weeks and months and not days.
Laura: And I still have a little dried blood on the outside of my ear. I could use a bit of rest.
Taliesin: Actually, yeah, do you have a concussion? Is that something that we can-- how many fingers am I holding up?
Laura: You're really blurry, Percy, I have no idea.
Travis: Nine!
Matt: Save versus brain swelling. Are you guys setting up camp?
Laura: I want to pull my brother aside when we set up camp.
Sam: Do we want camp, or do you want to sleep in a mansion?
Laura: Pike hasn't seen your beautiful mansion!
Marisha: Oh, you have to show her the marble floors.
Taliesin: Do we want to do it now, or do we want to do it tomorrow night, is the question?
Sam: We can do it both.
Laura: Oh, that's right-- We can do it both nights?
Sam: I can do it every day, right?
Ashley: Where do you have a mansion?
Laura: Scanlan has a mansion, Pike!
Sam: I inherited some money. It's a long story. There was a great-uncle Vesuvius.
Taliesin: Also known as Uncle Touchy. Uncle No-No.
Liam: Canon, that's canon.
Sam: The court said that he had to give me-- No. We'll sleep in the mansion tonight, and they all know where they're sleeping, but I'll personally show Pike to her chambers, which are right next door to mine at the end of the long hallway. My room, obviously, the biggest, tallest. Pike's a close second. Beautiful, covered in yellow rose petals as far as you can see.
Matt: So, Pike, as Scanlan creates this somewhat shimmering door of mystical energy in the middle of the air off of the path you guys have been walking, in the middle of this field. It's just the open grass that's blowing with this gentle night breeze, a little bit of the moonlight is coming through the clouds, giving enough of a visual of this change in the air space. He pushes open the shimmering door, and on the inside is this beautiful mansion. Tall foyer with marble floors, pillars that raise to the ceiling with gold trim. There's a giant portrait in the center of the main stairway now that has both Scanlan and you on horseback over a beautiful landscape. There are a number of mystical servants that are somewhat transparent and spiritual, arcane energy in form, that take your coats and offer food. A delicious meal is presented for all of you.
Sam: Mostly chicken.
Matt: It's mostly chicken. It's a lot of chicken.
Laura: I'm having a lot of talk with the servants about different ways to prepare food.
Sam: Please do.
Taliesin: They keep clucking it up.
Matt: Protein, bro! Scanlan does lead you to your room, which is right next to his, and covered in yellow rose petals, a beautiful interior. The color scheme is marked tailored specifically to your tastes that he's been able to glean from conversations with you over the past couple years.
Sam: Blues, silvers. There's a little mini prayer area for her to pray to Sarenrae, and there's a little statue of Sarenrae, and if you pull it, a little secret door opens to my room. But it's a small door that only a gnome could fit through.
Ashley: Oh, great! Is there a lock on that, maybe? (laughter)
Sam: Only on my side.
Ashley: Okay. Oh, this is beautiful, Scanlan!
Sam: I did it for you. And, hey, while we have a moment alone, can I just mention something to you? Listen, I'm not really concerned with other people's vices or bad behaviors, but Grog has this sword, and it's sort of not good. It could be used for good, possibly, but I'm just worried about it. Just keep an eye on it. I don't know what it is, and maybe you could just check it out next time you're friending it up with him.
Ashley: Okay. When they had that fight with Percy, up in the house, I felt like there was something weird with that sword. I'll check it out.
Sam: I don't want to judge him or what he does, but just make sure that it won't kill any of us. That's all I care about.
Ashley: Yeah, that's a good plan. Okay, I will. Thanks, Scanlan.
Sam: Sleep tight. And if you hear any footsteps in your room, it's not me. It's the servants, I assure you.
Laura: Can I find-- Is there a library in the mansion, Scanlan?
Sam: Of course.
Laura: Can I pull my brother into a library or something? I just want to talk to you.
Liam: What? What?
Laura: Okay, weirdo. I couldn't help but notice, anywhere Pike was, you were not, all day today, and I have a feeling it's because--
Liam: You want to talk?
Laura: Yes. I do. Don't walk away from me, please. I have a feeling it's because of this Raven Queen situation. I don't know. I know that you offered yourself to her to save me, and I can't put into words how much that means to me. I'm worried that she took you up on the offer, and I know you're worried about it, too. And I'm afraid that's why you're avoiding Pike. You're afraid she's going to see something in you. But I wanted to tell you, I've been looking through this book. It's the best 35 gold I've ever spent. Maybe it was 30 gold, I don't even remember anymore.
Liam: It was 30.
Laura: It was 30! It would have been worth 35 for all the things that I found in it! Look, it's got all this information about the Raven Queen, and I've been looking at it all the time. I don't think she's as horrible as you're afraid she is. Can I tell you what I found?
Liam: Yes, please.
Laura: It says that those that follow her must hold no pity for those who suffer and die, for death is the natural end of life. That's not bad. Bring down the proud who try to cast off the chains of fate. As the instrument of the Raven Queen, you must punish hubris where you find it. Bring down those who try to cast off the chains of fate. The Raven Queen represents death, right? Therefore she hates those that live an immortal life. She hates vampires! We hate vampires! They're terrible people, right? That's not bad! Watch for the cult of Orcus, and stamp them out whenever they arise. Orcus is bad. If she hates him, then she must not be that terrible.
Liam: She's already speaking to me.
Laura: Oh. And?
Liam: I don't know, Vex'ahlia. I don't know what this means. I know that she's not a force for evil. Neither are funeral homes. I don't want to bed down in one.
Laura: Well, that's understandable.
Liam: But it doesn't matter. And I'd do it again, because I did it for you, and I am trying to come to terms with it, not knowing the terms.
Laura: Well. We've lived half our life in the shadows. You've made them your home. Am I right?
Liam: Maybe so.
Laura: This is a time you can either let those shadows swallow you down and keep falling into a hole, or you can use them to your advantage. You can become a champion. It's pretty fucking badass, if you ask me.
Liam: Do you know how bad this armor smells?
Laura: I can smell it, actually. Pretty terrible.
Liam: It's several centuries old. It's not pleasant.
Laura: Maybe we can get you some oils or something to put on it.
Liam: Maybe.
Laura: What I'm saying is, brother, I'm proud of you, and I'm happy for you, and I'm so, so thankful for you. And you don't need to be frightened! This is a wonderful thing. Not many fucking people can say they're a champion of a fucking god.
Liam: Listen. I'll take what you say under consideration. Again, none of us, you and I don't know what this means. I'm waiting to see.
Laura: All right. But as someone who's seen the other side and has come back thanks to you, there's no use living your life in fear. I love my reckless brother, as much as he hurts my heart. I love you for that, and don't be afraid to be that.
Liam: I have no clever answer to give you.
Laura: That's wonderful. I love you. And I walk away! (laughter)
Liam: I go to bed.
Taliesin: Before Scanlan disappears, I grab him as he's leaving.
Sam: I'm just making the rounds, make sure everyone's tucked in for the night.
Liam: Scanlan's like, wasn't looking in on Pike. Wasn't looking in on Pike.
Taliesin: Have you, perhaps, installed some sort of workspace in this wonderful home of yours for me? I've got a few little projects I want to poke at.
Sam: You mean the all-purpose room?
Laura: The Room of Requirement?
Taliesin: I'm a little worried by what all-purpose necessarily means.
Sam: Don't look in there with a black light.
Taliesin: It's not really a work table, is it?
Liam: It is the danger room.
Sam: It's all purposes, Percy. All purposes. But yes, it is a private room. No one can hear you scream in there. It's the farthest wing we have. I can give you some servants to help you set something up, bring in some tables, whatever. We don't have much in here, we're not prepared for chemical reactions.
Taliesin: Nothing complicated, just some very basic blacksmithing and a little bit of leatherwork.
Sam: Do I have that stuff? Anything to help him?
Matt: Yeah. If it was prepared within the house.
Sam: I tried to make enough stuff for all of us to have our basic needs met.
Taliesin: I can think of some very sexy things that can be done with an anvil. Think about it.
Sam: All my anvils are gnome-sized.
Taliesin: That's comical.
Marisha: Keyleth pops her head out into the hallway. Did I hear something about working? Are you working?
Taliesin: Yes. Scanlan's helping me find a room that apparently is so sound-proof we don't actually have to hear anyone else's drama.
Marisha: Oh, that's fantastic.
Taliesin: I know. Grab a book. It'll be fun.
Marisha: I might join you.
Sam: Are you going to have a working dinner? I'll send some chickens down.
Marisha: I can't sleep, so, yes.
Travis: What about cows?
Taliesin: No cows in my room either, please.
Marisha: I join Percy and help him.
Matt: Okay. You guys find the all-purpose room, which does have the basics required for smithing. The smithing gear that is brought to you by the servants in itself is very, very finely crafted and nearly weightless. It's really impressive, and you look at the label, and it has a small timer on it before it becomes immaterial.
Taliesin: I can work with materials that are in the Bag of Holding, that are real materials, as long as I put them back in the Bag of Holding and take them with me? I can't leave anything, obviously.
Matt: Yeah. Anything you leave in here will just be spat out.
Taliesin: Oh, it'll just be spat out. That's lovely.
Matt: Yeah, onto the ground where it was.
Taliesin: For the moment, because I don't have everything I need for the broom yet, I want to work on a piece of jewelry, if that's okay. I want to work on the thing.
Matt: Work on jewelry?
Taliesin: I want to construct a little piece of jewelry if that's okay. Not magical.
Matt: Do you have a jeweler's kit?
Taliesin: Do I have a jeweler's kit?
Matt: It's a whole different skill set, man.
Taliesin: I can't tinker something?
Matt: You can tinker something, but jewelry is different from tinkering.
Taliesin: No, well, this is a piece that has purpose. It actually is going to be a functional object.
Matt: What is the function of this object? You need to tell me these things.
Taliesin: I know. This is something that I-- I'm so sorry.
Matt: I'm going to make something! Make me roll for it! I got to know what you're doing.
Taliesin: I want to make a-- I'm so sorry, I'm losing the word.
Marisha: Hey, Percy, what are you trying to make?
Taliesin: Something that's too complicated to explain to you. I'm blanking on it. I may have to just give you the name at the break. A little herb pouch, like one of those cages that close up to put herbs in them?
Sam: Oh, like you make tea with?
Matt: Okay. It won't be pretty, but you can make it functional. Yeah, go ahead and make a tinkering check.
Taliesin: All right, I'll make it pretty later.
Liam: Like a Shoprite bag with a bunch of shit in it?
Matt: This will be a dexterity mod, because it's not a very complicated piece based on what you've constructed in the past. It's more about your ability to make it work.
Taliesin: Dexterity? Thank god, because that's a terrible roll. 14.
Matt: 14. Okay, it takes you the better part of the night.
Marisha: Do I assist him at all?
Matt: With a job this small, there's not a whole lot you can assist with except handing him tools.
Taliesin: I'm not going to run the whole night. At some point I'm going to be like, I don't have the design yet. This is something I want to get right, so this is going to be working towards it.
Matt: Okay, so you get the first stage of that set and ready to go.
Taliesin: I can't think of the name of what it is. I'm so embarrassed.
Matt: You all eventually find yourselves to rest, tasks completed to the extent of which you wanted to, conversations finished. You find yourselves at breakfast, a delightful spread of breakfast chickens prepared for you.
Marisha: I pick one up off the table and I say, hey Vex! (whoosh)
Laura: Shit! I'm not even on my-- (grunt)
Matt: All of you duck instinctively as the chicken has enough time to arc and begin to plummet down before she gets her arrow out, and you see her aiming downward as it falls. As she releases the arrow, it manages to catch it. Go ahead and roll for an attack, see how well it hits.
Laura: Oh, that's good. 30?
Matt: (arrow impact)
Laura: Oh, wait, 28, 28.
Matt: (slightly quieter arrow impact) It pins the chicken to the wall, and then it just sags. The wooden shaft slowly snaps under the weight of the chicken before it hits the ground. One of the servants scoops it up and sets it back on the table in front of Keyleth with the broken arrow shaft sticking out.
Marisha: I like that game. It's my new favorite game.
Liam: Do you want some more broom target practice?
Laura: I need to practice with this broom.
Liam: You do need to practice, seriously.
Marisha: We have more chickens.
Travis: We've got stuff to do.
Laura: Yeah, we have stuff to do.
Liam: I'm still eating. I would love to see you, for five minutes, get up on that broom and fly around and fucking put some arrows in some chickens.
Laura: All right, fine, I'll fucking practice. Does it help me at all to practice on this broom?
Liam: It helps me.
Sam: I will command seven servants to each have a loaded chicken at the ready.
Liam: Pull!
Laura: I start flying.
Sam: Vax, you can do the honors and say the pulls.
Laura: I clench really hard with my thighs to try to hold on to this broom.
Matt: As the rest of you enjoy what is the strangest of Medieval Times experiences you've had, glancing upward to the raised ceiling of this dining room area, you watch Vex spiral around on her broom before, Scanlan?
Sam: Vax is saying pull.
Liam: Pull!
Taliesin: (chicken clucking)
Matt: Roll, with disadvantage.
Laura: Oh, Jesus. Okay.
Travis: Say it. Say it!
Laura: One!
Taliesin: Easiest number to count to.
Matt: So as the first chicken goes in the air, she reaches and goes to aim. However, she catches herself. The broom throws her off, and she stops just in time and haphazardly focuses on just the chicken, not realizing where the chicken had now fallen past. Releases it. Scanlan, I want you to make a dexterity saving throw.
Sam: Nine.
Matt: Go ahead and roll damage.
Laura: Okay, that's not that bad. Damage? Oh, it's automatic hit?
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: Okay. Oh, no.
Liam: Full damage.
Laura: That's 17.
Matt: So, Scanlan, as you're watching this, chewing, suddenly, (impact).
Sam: (screaming)
Laura: Shit! Scanlan, Scanlan, I'm so sorry! I land, I land. I land and I instantly cast Cure Wounds on him. Fuck, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Matt: A big old chicken dangling at the end of the arrow.
Laura: Pike! Pike, help, help, help, help!
Travis: I'm just applauding. Again! Again! I pick up my chicken and I throw it at Scanlan.
Taliesin: Does this mean when the night's over there's going to be a little pool of blood where the door was?
Matt: You'll find out. Go ahead and roll for healing.
Laura: Oh, God, okay.
Matt: As Vex reaches out and grasps you and manages to heal some of your wounds.
Laura: Oh, good, that's good. It's just 1d8, do I add anything?
Matt: 1d8 plus your wisdom modifier.
Laura: 11.
Matt: So you heal 11 hit points.
Sam: Can I pull out the arrow?
Matt: Sure. A gout of blood sprays out.
Laura: I hold my hand there. Pike, can you help?
Ashley: I'll help, I'll help. That broom is amazing!
Marisha: Isn't it, Pike?
Ashley: Yes! And there are too many chickens in here, anyway. Healing Scanlan.
Matt: Pike, you're just casting a Cure Wounds?
Ashley: Yes, I'll cast Cure Wounds.
Matt: The wound closes as Pike reaches out and, with a small chuckle, heals how many hit points?
Liam: The chicken comes back to life!
Ashley: What did you say, Matt?
Matt: How much do you heal? Roll 1d8 plus five, I'm pretty sure. That was amazing.
Laura: Sorry, Scanlan. You can blame my brother.
Ashley: Nine.
Sam: I'm back.
Matt: You're back to full. The wounds close. Pike's there holding her hands on your shoulders, closing the wound.
Sam: Thank you, Pike.
Ashley: You're welcome.
Sam: All right. Well, let's say breakfast is over.
Laura: I'm going to practice a bit more, you guys.
Matt: The other servants are holding their chickens at the ready.
Sam: Pull.
Marisha: Go, go, go!
Ashley: Can I try punching one in the air with my new gauntlets?
Matt: Okay. As he's about to throw it up, Pike runs over and grabs the chicken and throws it and (boom) punches it in the air. Pike, roll a strength check. Roll a d20 and add plus four to it.
Liam: 20 chicken McNuggets fly through the air.
Ashley: This is so dumb, why am I doing this? What am I doing?
Matt: Roll a d20, add four to it.
Liam: For the greater good.
Ashley: Okay, it's not that high. 11.
Matt: 11, okay. You (boom) bat it up with a Pike punch. We'll say for the sake of brevity on this, go ahead and roll one more attack, and this will count for the rest of the shots. With disadvantage.
Laura: Oh, come on. 16.
Matt: 16, okay. You do manage to recover your sense of self-esteem as you manage to pin a couple more chickens against the walls and the table in here, but each arrow is just a reminder of the one stray that began this whole breakfast excursion.
Laura: Sorry about that, Scanlan.
Sam: Great job, Vex.
Marisha: Guys, this is the best brunch we've ever done.
Liam: I will never forget it.
Marisha: That was great. Thank you for that, Scanlan.
Sam: Sure, sure.
Laura: We should probably get a start on a walk.
Marisha: Yeah, so, question, before we leave, you guys--
Taliesin: This is going to make the archery booth at Renn Faire hilarious. Sorry, okay. Carry on.
Marisha: Do we want to travel via Wind Walk, or are we okay?
Sam: We're only eight hours away?
Taliesin: It's only eight hours. Save your strength.
Marisha: Because I can save my strength.
Laura: Yeah, yeah, save it.
Marisha: Okay. All right. Thank you.
Laura: We might come across some orcs.
Marisha: That's true.
Travis: Hopefully. Shit.
Laura: I know, right? I could use some.
Sam: All right, let's set out.
Matt: You guys say good-bye to your servants, gather yourselves as you step out and the door closes behind you. Do you choose to leave the spell up, or are you going to fade it as you walk along?
Sam: If I leave it up, can anyone go in there?
Matt: Anyone that you allow into it.
Taliesin: I want to see if the blood comes out.
Sam: No, I'll shut the door and hide the key under a rock.
Matt: Okay. You guys continue walking southward towards the Frostweald. About another seven to eight hours of travel along that way, you begin to see the Stormcrest Mountains in the distance get closer and loom larger and larger, and you get the feel of the Stormcrest Mountains especially because there is a very large storm surge that seems to rise from the ocean to the east of it that has caused a very heavy thunderstorm that's blasting through. You can't see the peaks of the mountains from this distance. There are clusters of trees and forest areas along, but ahead of you, you can see, coated in a very, very bright, visibly white forest, this is the Frostweald itself, with snowfall. Once again, you've been here before, and there is an essence, and you don't recall the specific reason for it, but there is a purpose, an ancient purpose, as to why this one area is perpetually sitting in the heart of winter. Amongst what is a relatively temperate, in some places almost tropical temperature layer, it is very strange, and part of the mystical calling to the Frostweald is that it is perpetually locked in a winter state. You-- don't worry, I'm working on it.
Marisha: Keyleth takes a second to meditate on the previous time that we were here in the Frostweald, and I cast Find the Path. 6th-level spell. Which gives me the most direct, shortest route as long as I'm on the same plane existence of where I'm going, if I have a vague idea of where I'm going.
Matt: Where are you going?
Sam: We're going to the Stormcrest Mountains, right?
Marisha: We're trying to get to the Stormcrest Mountains through, but we're also looking for the band of orcs travelling.
Matt: If you name a destination on another plane of existence, a destination that moves, or a destination that isn't specific, such as a green dragon's lair, the spell fails.
Marisha: But we're in the Frostweald, right?
Matt: Yes. You're approaching it now.
Marisha: Is the Frostweald considered on a different plane?
Matt: No. But do you have a specific location that you're familiar with that you want to go to?
Marisha: Well, I can find us the shortest, most direct route to the Stormcrest Mountains.
Sam: Have we been there?
Matt: Yeah, you can see them. I'm trying to figure out. For the spell to work, you have to choose a specific location that you're already familiar with to lead you to it.
Marisha: Right.
Matt: So what are you saying?
Marisha: Stormcrest Mountains. But just because I can see them doesn't necessarily mean we're going to find the most direct path, shortest direct path towards it.
Matt: That's true.
Marisha: Right? Or is this a waste of a spell and I should just do something else?
Matt: I will give you the benefit to say that you can see the mountain range. This is more useful if it's trying to find a place that you're very familiar with, seen a picture of, or you had a very specific bit of information for it. For a general location or a location that you're unaware of, the spell wouldn't have an effect.
Laura: Maybe you could think of the location of her mate, the sphinx's mate.
Marisha: I don't know it, so it fails. That's why I was trying to do Stormcrest Mountains, but apparently that's not specific enough.
Laura: Well, is it specific? It's just we can see them.
Liam: Yeah, it's right there.
Matt: It's a large range that's very visible.
Liam: Let's move on, let's move on.
Marisha: I'll do something else.
Taliesin: Save it for something special.
Matt: So as you guys press forward to the outside of the Frostweald, the snow- and ice-covered treeline is a very familiar sight from your last time traveling here. There are canopies of pine-like trees that interlock with windless snowfall, that leave a fairly dark interior set from the frozen-over canopy. Slick surfaces and knee-deep snowbanks permeate this entire forest region. Your breath is immediately visible as you step past that threshold, and the temperature drops about 40 degrees from what it was before, getting steadily colder the further in you travel.
Laura: Bet you're glad you have that beard now, huh? Keeps you warm? No?
Travis: It's actually quite nice out here. This is like spring for me.
Liam: Are your people-- Did you grow up in the cold?
Travis: Yeah, we're pretty cool.
Liam: Wow.
Matt: Pressing in, as the temperature drops further and further, you occasionally come across a broken sunbeam that manages to penetrate aspects, different places in the canopy, and even stepping into those, they don't lend any change in temperature or warmth. The enchantment that surrounds this entire forest doesn't seem to be moved by such natural incursions. Everyone go ahead and roll a perception check.
Laura: 25. Are we in the woods? 29.
Travis: Two.
Marisha: 18.
Taliesin: 15.
Sam: 20.
Ashley: 25.
Matt: As you guys are walking through, keeping your eyes peeled, Vax, you're so lost in thought that your eyes glaze over for a second and you forget where you are. Pike and Vex, the two of you get a little bit ahead of the rest of the group, pushing through the snow. You come around from a tree and you can see, this is about an hour or so into your entrance to the Frostweald, you see a small clearing with a few patchy trees outside of the heavy canopy, and what appears to be a couple of small stone ruins and a single obelisk, a monolith-like pillar of stone that juts out of the snow. It's about 200 feet away from you guys, 250 feet.
Laura: Can we see anything around it? Any people, any trace of tracks in the snow?
Matt: From this distance, no. You don't see any, there are no figures, there is no movement. There is just that stone piece that, at a slight angle, stands out amongst the rest of the treeline.
Travis: What do you see?
Laura: There's a, look. There's a fucking obelisk. It's a tall stone thing, Grog.
Travis: Yeah? So?
Sam: Let's go over.
Travis: Yeah.
Taliesin: Vex, you and I should hang back, but we'll let everyone else.
Marisha: It's a big obelisk? Are there any birds or anything like that around?
Matt: Listening, that's what's interesting. Usually forests, because they're teeming with so much life, there's a perpetual sound of things that live amongst the boughs and the treeline. Because it's so cold here, it's eerily silent. Every footfall that hits the snow, you can hear the crunch resounding and echoing through the nearby vicinity. It is just a still, silent atmosphere in this forest.
Laura: (clanging) Pike!
Travis: Let me check if it's safe to move on. And I reach down and scoop up a handful of snow, right? Just snow? How's it taste?
Matt: It's the clearest snow you've tasted in a long time.
Travis: Shit's crazy pure, yo.
Sam: So then we're safe to move ahead?
Travis: Yeah, we're good. Let's go check out the scary obelisk.
Liam: Everybody starts inhaling snow.
Matt: Are you moving ahead, Grog?
Travis: I'm moving ahead. Who wants to come with me to the obelisk?
Laura: I'm going to hide behind a tree and watch.
Liam: To the what? What obelisk?
Travis: For what? Why are you hiding?
Laura: I'm just going to keep guard!
Marisha: I'll come with you, Grog.
Travis: There's nobody out here.
Taliesin: I've had bad luck touching things lately. I'm letting other people touch things.
Matt: Grog, Keyleth.
Sam: Pike's coming.
Matt: So Grog, Keyleth, Pike, and Scanlan are all going forward. Looks like Vex, Vax, and Percy are staying.
Taliesin: I'm getting another angle so that we have two different vantage points of what may happen.
Laura: Getting a little closer, but keeping.
Matt: Are you going with Percy?
Liam: I'm brainfarting, so I'm just following Percy.
Matt: Okay. Percy and Vax splinter off to the left, Vex you go ahead and take the right, and you head around this clearing while the rest of you walk into the center of it.
Taliesin: We're keeping an eye on that thing in the--
Liam: Look at that!
Taliesin: I know, it's a thing. We're going to let Grog touch it and see what happens.
Matt: You guys approach, and as you're stepping through the snowfall, which right now is, for you, up to just past your knees, like the grass was. For Keyleth it's just up to your waist. Scanlan, you and Pike are both (grunting) like the dogs jumping through the snow that vanish with each leap as you're having to find your way through this heavy snowfall.
Travis: Do you guys want a ride?
Sam: Yes, please.
Travis: I pick up each gnome on my shoulders.
Ashley: Thanks, Grog!
Travis: No problem!
Matt: Go ahead and make an investigation check as you guys approach this obelisk.
Sam: 25.
Travis: It's a two, minus three.
Marisha: 11.
Matt: What did you get, Pike?
Ashley: 14.
Matt: 14, okay. So as you guys approach, from this vantage point, it's carved, definitely, and the carving is very old. Weathered somewhat, but not too heavily, so it's either not very old or there's not a whole lot of weather that comes through here, and by the stillness of the wind since you've entered, you get the feeling that's probably more the case. It's hard to gauge how old or how long it's been here. But there are various carvings amongst it. There is a big symbol. I want to have you guys roll a religion check real fast.
Travis: Awesome. What the fuck. Natural one.
Laura: You need to not use that dice right now.
Sam: 12.
Marisha: Religion? Nine.
Matt: Pike?
Ashley: 15.
Matt: 15, okay. It looks familiar, but you're having a hard time really getting the essence. Pike, you recognize this. This is not the largely understood or most commonly utilized symbol of Ioun, but it is a very ancient, the basis of the religion of Ioun, which is the same goddess of knowledge that Osysa was overseeing the temple beneath.
Ashley: Wait, how do you spell it?
Matt: Ioun. I-O-U-N. You actually carry a stone, enchanted with the essence of Ioun's knowledge.
Sam: Oh, that's my Ion Stone! Ioun Stone!
Travis: Is it made of, it's stone?
Matt: It's solid, solid stone, and goes up about 35 feet or so.
Travis: Hey, Scanlan, I heard if you touch your tongue to something like this, it'll stick.
Sam: Wow. Wow, we should probably try that out. Keyleth?
Marisha: What?
Sam: Can you go lick that obelisk?
Marisha: Hell no.
Travis: Why not?
Marisha: I know that one. But you should do it, Grog. I can't do it, just because of my elven abilities. It's our saliva, it doesn't work the same way. But you should try it, it's crazy.
Taliesin: Keyleth, that was very clever.
Sam: How far are we?
Matt: You guys are about ten feet from it.
Sam: I'm going to just look around it for any traps.
Matt: Okay. Make an investigation check.
Sam: 18.
Matt: 18, okay. You have to leap off Grog and start wading through. You're finding pieces of broken stone, smaller chunks about that big and bits of stone dust that are scattered amongst the snow. You push around, because you see the ruined walls around. You do find a larger piece of stone that looks like a broken statue, like there must have been some sort of a statue here that had lost the hand, and it's stumbled there on the ground.
Marisha: Upon him seeing that, I pull out my Hunk of Quall and see if it lights up.
Sam: Oh, you have to concentrate on it.
Taliesin: Are there orcs present?
Matt: (laughs)
Taliesin: I knew someone would laugh at that.
Matt: You hold it aloft. It has a small vibration of energy, as part of the crystal sliver itself, but it doesn't seem to change in the environment.
Marisha: Can I move a little bit closer to the obelisk?
Matt: As you're stepping closer to the obelisk, you also notice there is some writing or some sort of scripture that is carved towards the base, that is partially buried by the snow that has gathered at its base. You find more pieces of statues. Arms, part of a torso, like somebody had knocked over a series of statues. A lot of them have deep grooves in them, like these statues were either carved to pieces, like they were physically torn down--
Taliesin: Are you describing what you're seeing at all?
Sam: Sure.
Taliesin: I can't have a reaction to this unless I'm actually hearing anything.
Marisha: I do Control Water. Can I do Control Water and clear away all the snow from around it?
Matt: It takes you a little bit of concentration because it's in a different state than liquid, but you begin to focus, and as you guys are watching, Keyleth focusing, a lot of the ice begins to rapidly melt into a water form and it begins to melt away, leaving the wet, muddy ground around it.
Sam: These statues that have been broken. They have gashes and slashes in them?
Matt: Yes, around the areas where they're broken.
Sam: Okay.
Taliesin: Can I see the statues at this point?
Matt: From this distance? You can't, unfortunately.
Taliesin: I want to get a little closer, just so I can make out the statues.
Matt: Okay. As the snowfall begins to melt away, you guys see around the base of this obelisk it is a garden of statue-pieces.
Sam: Hey, hey guys!
Taliesin: Are they classical statues or are they people in weird poses? Are the poses weird?
Matt: Some poses look aggressive, some poses look surprised--
Sam: Okay, everybody hey hey hey.
Taliesin: Back up, everybody. Back up now.
Matt: And we're going to go ahead and take a break on that note.
Laura: We fought basilisks in the Frostweald before.
Liam: Basilisks here, yes.
Matt: So. We're going to go ahead and take a quick break here for the restroom and--
Marisha: Son of a bitch.
Ashley: Son of a bitch.
Matt: See you guys here in a few minutes.
Travis: I don't see what the problem is. [break]
Matt: Hello, and welcome back, everyone. So. As the snow is melted away, revealing this garden of statues in various states of-- some of them are still solid, some of them are just missing pieces, some of them are entirely shattered, many of them crushed or torn, thick, heavy grooves visible on the pieces of them that have been torn asunder-- the party begins to gather their thoughts and figure out what this might be. You did notice as well that there was writing or script among the bottom of the obelisk, and as the snow melts away, there is another large shape that is carved into it.
Travis: Can I hold my hand up to the obelisk and just feel if there's any, like, heat radiating off of it?
Matt: Sure. As you walk up to the edge of the obelisk and put your hand to it, no heat being radiated.
Marisha: I pull out the hunk of Quall again. Anything? Hold it closer to the symbol.
Matt: It does not seem to be reacting to anything in the immediate vicinity.
Travis: Man, somebody does not like sculptures.
Sam: That--
Taliesin: Those aren't sculptures.
Marisha: Can I do a nature check?
Travis: No, it's art, I get it.
Matt: What languages do you know?
Travis: It's like, interpretations and it seems whimsical--
Laura: Can I hop on the broom and fly up and see if I could spot some basilisks around?
Matt: Sure.
Ashley: Well, Percy, what do you think they are?
Travis: Where is she going?
Marisha: Sorry. Elven, Sylvan, Druidic, Primordial.
Matt: As you walk up and begin to hold the Hunk of Quall towards it, you see that the language-- the script that is beneath the initial symbol of Ioun that Scanlan had seen is Elvish.
Marisha: Oh, okay.
Matt: The rough translation is of old, old, old text, it reads, "A name is earned."
Marisha: A name is earned?
Matt: A name is earned.
Taliesin: Oh, no.
Matt: And beneath it, there is what appears to be-- the other large carving you saw on it-- it looks like a triangle. A dark, recessed triangle that is just built beneath the text that tapers internally into a point. It is almost like a reverse pyramid on the inside. It is just an empty space that comes to a point.
Taliesin: Oh, no. I think that there are basilisks nearby.
Laura: Do I see any?
Taliesin: I think these statues are victims.
Marisha: Can I do a nature check? To see if I can see any signs of basilisks?
Matt: Sure. Make a nature check and you make perception check.
Sam: Are we having a short-- is this a short rest?
Matt: No.
Marisha: 21.
Matt: 21.
Laura: 26.
Matt: 26. You glance up above, and you do not see any basilisks. What you can see, this clearing itself is visible from your height, but once you get above the tree-line, you can see the trees are pretty thick. You don't see any signs of basilisks in the vicinity. You, upon looking around the ground, you can see-- it's very muddy now from all the snow that had melted down, and you see that some of the mud is slicking into holes in the ground. Like four-foot-wide cavernous holes that were dug, like little burrows that now have all this water and mud seeping into them.
Marisha: Oh, it was made by a creature, it looks like?
Matt: It looks like. Which one of them (bubbling), expels a bunch of the mud and water, it just comes bubbling outward. At which point, you see something burst out and emerge onto the ground nearby. More of these holes start bursting forth, all the mud and liquid that has seeped into it is now being forced outward, and these creatures, now covered in mud, you can see long, lizard-like bodies with a toothy snout, multiple legs, rows of them of them down the spine, and its tail flickering about.
Liam: I'm closing my eyes.
Laura: Don't look at them!
Matt: I would like you all to roll initiative.
Marisha: Fuck. Shit. I'm standing right in the middle of them.
Travis: Fuck you.
Marisha: Got the fucking shittiest initiative rolls.
Ashley: Yikes.
Taliesin: I have a terrible initiative roll.
Sam: Okay, this is it.
Travis: Feral Instinct's screwing me up.
Sam: Battle in the snow. But we've got Ashley.
Matt: It's hard to see with the mud across their surface, but you do see hints of blue coming through. You have encountered these previously-- these are referred to as the ice-scaled basilisks, the ones that are more specific to this indigenous region. All righty. So, going by initiative order here, folks, 25 to 20?
Laura: 22.
Matt: 22.
Travis: Percy?
Matt: 20 to 15?
Liam: 18.
Sam: 19.
Matt: 15 to ten?
Taliesin: 13.
Travis: 11.
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: I rolled really badly.
Travis: Yeah.
Laura: Pike?
Ashley: I know, I know, my initiative is always shit.
Travis: Welcome back, Pike!
Laura: She likes to get the lay of the land before she attacks.
Ashley: Yeah, yeah, you know, I do the clean-up.
Matt: Is that everybody?
Marisha: Pike.
Ashley: I'm eight.
Matt: Pike? Oh. All right. Due to the series of rolls here, they're going last.
Sam: Oh!
Matt: They rolled a five, minus one penalty to dex. So, as these-- which more of them burst up right next to Scanlan right there.
Sam: Oh, great.
Matt: As they all burst out of the ground, shaking their heads off of the mud, swinging off, slapping into the stone, splattering across the white snow around them, across some of you, they snarl and hiss. As you see their eyes now (click).
Liam: Merry Christmas.
Matt: So, top of this would be you, Vex. You actually would be on top here, on the broom, looking from above.
Laura: We can't look at them, right? We remember that from before?
Matt: You remember, you'll want to try not to.
Laura: Can we-- we can look at them to shoot at them and look away? Just don't look at them at all?
Matt: You can choose at the start of your turn whether to avert your gaze or not. You'll have disadvantage on pretty much everything as long as you're doing that.
Laura: Ah, that's so annoying! I can't tell how everybody's clumped. They're-- just basically they're all amongst all of our friends.
Matt: There's three right here, and one right there behind. It's one, two, three, four.
Laura: Okay. Can I fly down and land on a tall tree?
Matt: You can try to.
Laura: Try to brace myself?
Matt: If you would like to try to.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Let's say for the purposes of this, that you coast down to the height. Stupid broom. Let's say you land down somewhere over here.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: All righty? There you are.
Laura: Okay. I avert my gaze-ish, I look off to the side of one, but I can see it in my peripheral, is that how it goes, or it's like--?
Matt: You kind of guess where it is real fast, in the peripheral and kind of--
Laura: I Hunter's Mark one.
Matt: Which one?
Travis: Laser pointer.
Laura: Is that Scanlan? That it's next to?
Liam: Yeah, it's Scanlan next to one of them.
Laura: I do the one next to Scanlan-- That was my eye. That's just a flashlight. Oh, that's how I do it, okay.
Matt: And what are you doing?
Laura: I'm going to--
Liam: Professional D&D player.
Laura: That's right. And I'm going to shoot it!
Matt: Go for it.
Laura: Through the Blazing Bowstring.
Matt: Okay. So go ahead and roll with disadvantage for the first strike.
Laura: Oh, I don't get regular because it's my favored terrain, so I cancel it all out?
Matt: It's disadvantage for averting your gaze, advantage for being your favored terrain-- I don't think you get advantage on attacks for being in favored terrain, do you? I think it's just on ability checks.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: Yeah. So you're at disadvantage.
Laura: I'm at disadvantage.
Matt: I'll double-check this so the internet doesn't scream at me.
Laura: 18.
Matt: 18 with disadvantage?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: That still hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
Laura: Plus the Blazing Bowstring, plus an additional d10.
Matt: First attack on the basilisk near Scanlan.
Laura: 17.
Matt: 17 damage? All right, go ahead and roll for the second attack, with disadvantage as well.
Laura: 17.
Matt: 17 does hit as well. So roll for that one. You included the Blazing Bowstring for the first one, right?
Laura: Yes. 15 on the second.
Matt: 15 points of damage. Holding on the top of the tree, which is starting to bow a little bit with your weight, and you're clutching the broom under one arm, and you pull back and release two arrows in succession, both finding their mark. You did Hunter's Mark damage on top of those?
Laura: Yes I did.
Matt: All right, good. You see, Scanlan, as you try and avert your gaze momentarily as you see the giant creature there, and you recall, two arrows streak past, which gives you a little PTSD, based on your morning. So that'll complete your turn?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: All right. Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: It's right next to me?
Matt: Yes. Are you averting your gaze or not?
Sam: I'm averting my gaze.
Matt: All righty.
Sam: Well jeez, I mean, do I know where they are?
Matt: You saw them all burst out, once they shook off the mud, you heard her shouting and you were like, oh, hmm.
Sam: So I kind of know where they are. All right. I'm going to hop away five feet from the guy who's-- I'm going to get an attack-- yeah, that's a fine direction, sure.
Matt: It lunges out at you with a strike.
Sam: Yeah.
Matt: That is a 22 to hit?
Sam: Yeah.
Matt: All righty. As you pull away, pain strikes your body as the sharp, stone-crumbling teeth of the basilisk reach out and pierce your body for 12 points of piercing damage. You wrestle your elbow out of the way, you can feel the wound beneath your leather armor.
Taliesin: That's barely an arrow and a chicken in the neck.
Sam: (laughs) Okay. And I'm going to aim to the one in the middle there-- does anyone have a pointer? Yeah, that one. The other two are within 20 feet of him, yes?
Matt: Yes.
Sam: So I will cast a Wand of Fireballs right there on him.
Laura: Yeah!
Matt: On him or behind him, or where--?
Sam: Just behind him so it hits all three?
Matt: Right, and not yourself.
Sam: Yes?
Matt: I figured that's probably what you want to do, okay. As you back up, release it in that direction, the beam of light streaks out from the wand, hitting the snowbank right behind it and exploding. Already the slushy atmosphere is-- snow and fire scatter around it as they both screech out in pain. DC of what?
Sam: Oh! DC 15! I wrote it down.
Matt: 15. That's... first one fails. Second one rolled a 15, with its minus one dex, that's a 14, that's a fail. And a natural one. So full damage for all three of them. Go ahead and roll that 8d6. Vax, you're on deck, so be ready.
Liam: All right, okay.
Sam: 25!
Matt: 25 points of damage total. The flames subside after the force of the explosion. The obelisk itself shakes from the impact. The three basilisks look notably charred, whatever mud was on them is immediately dried and is now cracking on the outside of their scales. You hear the hissing at their presence. You want to keep moving or stay where you are?
Sam: I'll tuck around the obelisk a little bit.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: And I'll turn to Pike, my love, and inspire her with a song. I will sing, (singing) I used to scry you on the shit phone... (laughter)
Sam: (singing) Late-night when I need your love! I know when that poop phone glows, it can only be one gnome! Ever since you left the party, you, you-- (laughter)
Travis: Yes!
Matt: Take your d10 inspiration die, Pike. All right, so d10 inspiration die for you. Vax, you're up.
Liam: Yes. I'm going to click my heels together, set the boots going. I'm going to go very far away towards you, your end of the map. I want to be about a little away from the tree, though, so I've got a clear sight on that one-- further back, though. I know. I want to be 50 feet away. Yeah.
Matt: Okay. You're far away, you're off-map.
Liam: And I'm going to dagger-dagger-dagger him from very far away.
Matt: Okay.
Ashley: Dagger-dagger-dagger!
Liam: And I'm going to use that sharpshooter trick where I take a negative five to attack, but add ten to damage?
Matt: Okay. Go for it.
Laura: On all of them?
Matt: Are you averting your gaze?
Liam: No.
Sam: Whoa!
Matt: All right, so at the start of your turn, on your first part of the round, I want you to go ahead and make a constitution saving throw.
Liam: From this far away?
Matt: When you started your turn, you were in melee.
Liam: Okay. So constitution?
Matt: Constitution saving throw.
Liam: 16.
Matt: 16 total?
Liam: Yes.
Matt: Okay. The gaze is upon you as you glance over and see the basilisk turn its head over its shoulder at you and hisses, and the eyes catch you. You can feel the magical effects take hold of your body for a moment. You back away and quickly close your eyes, and you can feel that it begin to reach over but you shake it off.
Liam: Oh yeah! Gamble worked out, man!
Matt: So you do not have disadvantage in these attacks.
Liam: Yeah, I know.
Matt: Minus five for each attack.
Liam: First one, and advantage because I'm going before it, so the first one is 18.
Matt: 18 hits.
Liam: Second is 14. And the third is 27.
Matt: First hits, last hits.
Liam: Last hits?
Matt: Yes.
Liam: Okay. First one gets sneak attack damage, and plus ten to both hits because of the sharpshooter.
Matt: Correct.
Liam: Right. So, here we go.
Laura: (singing) There can only be one gnome.
Liam: I can't think! 33.... 43 for the first one.
Sam: 43?!
Liam: No-no-no... 43 plus... 49 for the first one.
Matt: 49 points of damage.
Liam: And the last one that hits is 19. Sharpshooter.
Matt: As you run backwards, at the basilisk glaring back at you, its toothy mouth opening and the breath out, you shake it off. Throw the daggers. One (impact) sticks into one eye, and the other just (impact) into the other, and it-- (cheering)
Marisha: Damn!
Laura: That was fast.
Matt: The snow nearby is spattered with this kind of dark-purple basilisk blood.
Sam: Ugh! My eyes...
Laura: (gasp) Basilisk blood! We need to take the basilisk blood! Remember, that's super good...
Marisha: Yes! Yup. Uh-huh.
Matt: You want to stay where you are?
Liam: I will take another ten feet back away from it all. Bye, guys!
Matt: All right. Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: Okay!
Matt: Avert your gaze or... ?
Taliesin: No.
Matt: Roll a constitution save.
Marisha: Gamblers!
Liam: (singing) You got to know when to hold 'em!
Taliesin: That's a... (counts) 21 points.
Matt: 21?
Taliesin: Constitution save.
Sam: Oh, it's a save! That's right!
Matt: What did you roll?
Taliesin: I rolled a 14 plus seven.
Matt: That's great!
Taliesin: I look at it in the eye.
Matt: You stare it down and it kind of (snarls).
Taliesin: (barks) Bark it down.
Matt: Orthax has left his mark on you.
Taliesin: I know. I cast Hex on it. I'm looking at the one she's Hunter's Marked, I cast Hex.
Laura: Ooh, nice!
Liam: Are you gonna bark all day, little doggie?
Matt: Same one that she's Hunter's Marked?
Taliesin: Yeah. And I'm taking... I'm giving it a disadvantage on willpower ability checks.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: And I'm going to take three shots with Sharpshooter.
Matt: Go for it.
Taliesin: 12. Misses.
Matt: Misses, unfortunately.
Taliesin: Oh my god, goodbye! Going to the good die, 12.... Better! 24.
Matt: Yeah, third shot hits. Go ahead and roll damage. With the Hex damage as well.
Taliesin: Oh my god! I'm sucking. 22 points of damage.
Matt: 22 points of damage. So the first shot goes wide. Second shot goes wide again. For some reason, it's moving faster than you expected at this moment, missing your sights. The third shot manages to find the front of its nose and (shattering) the front of its skull shatters and it kind of crumbles to the ground.
Taliesin: So, while shooting, I ran from that one tree all the way to the other one. That was a running shot, so...
Matt: Okay, so you run this way?
Taliesin: Yeah.
Liam: It was a lot harder the last time.
Taliesin: Behind the tree over there.
Matt: Over here? Because you can only get about that far with your running.
Taliesin: About there.
Matt: Right there? Okay. Then you got behind there. That's fine. All right, that ends your turn, Percy. Grog, you're up.
Travis: I would like to avert my gaze, and go into an averted-gaze rage! (growls) (laughter)
Travis: And I would like to run at that little bastard right there.
Matt: All right.
Liam: (Grog voice) I can't see you but I'm so angry!
Travis: I'm using my Feral-- no, that's wrong. I'm using my... what the fuck is it called?
Taliesin: Slap Fight. Hair Pull.
Travis: I've totally forgotten what's it called. What the fuck is it? Reckless Attack!
Matt: All right, there you go.
Travis: Yes. So can I cancel out the disadvantage and get just a normal roll?
Matt: Yes, you would have a normal roll on this.
Travis: Yes! And Great Weapon Master on these two strikes.
Matt: All right.
Travis: Shit! Nine.
Matt: (whoosh)
Travis: (yells) (laughs) Shit! Nope.
Laura: It's a bad luck night for Grog rolling!
Matt: You rush forward (sword swinging). You thought it was there, you're sure it was there, you heard it hiss. It's about two inches below where you swung.
Travis: I'm so mad that I come out of my rage because I don't hit anything, right?
Matt: You don't have to hit it. You have to attack. There's a difference.
Travis: Well, I've been swinging.
Matt: Yeah. (laughs) Ending Grog's turn, Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: How many are left? Two?
Matt: There are two left.
Marisha: I am remembering what the basilisks did last time, and I've only done this once before, and am going to go...
Matt: Avert your gaze or not?
Marisha: I'm looking down and transforming into a giant scorpion.
Taliesin: Scorpions are fascinating.
Sam: How so? They don't have eyes, or something?
Marisha: Yeah, they have blindsight.
Sam: Wait, what does that mean?
Marisha: It means they don't use their eyes to see things. They have blindsight.
Matt: So Scanlan, as you're averting your gaze, you glance over as Keyleth goes (poof) into this giant scorpion, big tail, big pincers, black and red carapace. It's upsetting.
Sam: I'm scared.
Marisha: (clicking pincers)
Taliesin: That's really upsetting.
Marisha: Where are they? The two are kind of in the middle there?
Sam: One's next to Grog.
Marisha: Okay. I'm going to move in between them and I'm going to do a multiattack on both of those. I'll start on the one that Grog's not focusing on.
Matt: Okay, go for it.
Marisha: So I have three attacks, two with my claws and one with my stinger.
Matt: Do it. Disadvantage on all attacks.
Marisha: No, why?
Matt: Because you averted your gaze.
Marisha: No, I didn't. I have blindsight as a scorpion.
Matt: Right, but at the start of your turn, before anything happens, is when it happens. Did you avert your gaze or not?
Marisha: No, I turned into a scorpion.
Matt: Before that happened, at the start of your turn, did you avert your gaze or not?
Liam: You said you averted your gaze.
Marisha: I said I looked down, but once I'm a scorpion, I have blindsight.
Matt: Right, but the effect takes place before your transformation happens. So, yes or no, do you want to take the advantage or not?
Marisha: Well, I said I looked down and turned into a scorpion to try and avoid it, so... I mean, I did, yeah.
Matt: All right, so disadvantage on the attacks.
Marisha: That's the whole reason I did the scorpion.
Sam: But it's also looking cool.
Laura: It's okay, from here on out, you're fine.
Marisha: Miss. Six misses, for the first one. That's a three, it misses again. Nope, that's a two. Last one is an eight, plus a four... So that's 12. Probably still nothing.
Matt: Let me think here for a second. The scorpion has blindsight?
Sam: Starring Ashley Johnson! Blindsight!
Taliesin: How did we not walk into that? How have we been sitting here and that didn't happen?
Marisha: That legitimately made me spit my fucking coffee in my face.
Matt: No, you're right. I was thinking more in terms of it averting the magical power of the basilisk, but you could still avert and blindsight would allow you to still know where it is without having the disadvantage, so yes.
Liam: Although with coffee in the eye, disadvantage is back.
Matt: This is true. I'll let you reroll those attacks.
Marisha: All three? Okay, I wish I remembered them. Do you want me to reroll all three?
Matt: Just reroll all three. That's on me. I was thinking in wrong terms.
Sam: Matt, you're the worst.
Matt: I know. I know, I am the worst.
Marisha: Jeez, I'm going to tweet at you later about this.
Taliesin: Actually Matt, how blindsight works...
Matt: They've already been sent, I'm sure.
Taliesin: I'm shutting the fuck up now.
Marisha: These are just straight, they don't have disadvantage? First attack, 14.
Matt: 14 does not hit, unfortunately.
Marisha: Second attack was a natural 18, so 22.
Matt: That does hit. And for the tail?
Marisha: For the tail, 16.
Matt: 16 hits. That was my bad.
Liam: Just a bunch of idiots dorking around, guys.
Taliesin: There is coffee everywhere.
Marisha: That's not very much. Four damage for the claw attack, and then for the sting, oh my god. Three damage, and they have to take a constitution saving throw.
Matt: 15, what's the DC?
Marisha: 12.
Matt: Yeah, so it makes the save.
Marisha: Fuck.
Sam: Yeah, Keyleth, good one!
Marisha: Okay, they take 4d10 poison, and on a failed save, they take half as much.
Matt: Okay, so roll 4d10.
Sam: 4d10 is a lot!
Laura: You should be a scorpion all the time!
Marisha: Thanks guys! Wow, these are fucking horrifying rolls. Six, seven, eight, nine, plus seven is 16 points of poison damage.
Matt: Total, so that would be eight for half of it.
Marisha: No, that is halved.
Matt: Nice, that's not bad at all. All right, so as your first claw streaks off its armor, the second one grabs hold and-- hold on a second.
Liam: I'm listening!
Matt: Thank you.
Marisha: Sorry, it was eight damage.
Taliesin: No, you did, because you did half the dice.
Sam: No, she did 4d10.
Taliesin: She did 4d10?
Marisha: Eight damage.
Matt: Eight damage, all right. All right, so as the first claw streaks across its armor, second one manages to grab and actually pince onto it, dealing some damage. As you're holding it there, the tail strikes inward, manages to pierce the outside of the scaly basilisk hide. Not as effective as it could've been, but still you see its body tense with the sudden pulse of poison in its system. That brings us to Pike! What's up?
Ashley: Okay. Since I can't see it, is there any way that I can Guiding Bolt one of the basilisks without hurting anybody?
Matt: Yeah, but for Guiding Bolt I believe it's a spell attack roll. Am I correct on that? Or does it automatically hit? I'm trying to remember which one it is. You guys have so many spells. Guiding Bolt, yeah. You can totally Guiding Bolt. You'll have disadvantage on the attack roll, but you can do it still.
Laura: Do it, Pike!
Ashley: All right, let's do it!
Matt: All right, so go ahead and roll with disadvantage on the attack.
Sam: Which one, the one near Grog or the one near scorpion-face?
Ashley: Which one would I not hurt anybody?
Matt: It's not so much you hurting anybody, you wouldn't hit anybody. It's about if you miss or not.
Marisha: Grog and I can take it anyway.
Ashley: Okay.
Liam: The one by Grog.
Ashley: Yeah, we'll do the one by Grog.
Matt: Okay.
Ashley: Oh, natural 20!
Matt: But it's with disadvantage, so you have to roll it again.
Liam: Say it again.
Taliesin: One in 20 chance.
Ashley: 13.
Matt: With that, unfortunately, as you're holding your eyes at bay--
Sam: Wait! You're inspired!
Matt: You can add the inspiration dice if you want to.
Ashley: Yeah, I'll add inspiration!
Matt: Okay, so roll a d10 and add that to the attack. 13 plus...
Ashley: Okay, okay, okay. All right, seven. So 20.
Matt: Go ahead and roll damage on Guiding Bolt. So 4d6 radiant damage.
Ashley: Okay... 17!
Matt: Nice, all right! 17 points of radiant damage, and now there is a glowing hue of radiant light around it, so even though you're not looking at it, it's a pretty decent beacon, so it gives advantage on the next attack roll against it. Keep that in mind. Do you want to move at all or do you want to stay where you are, Pike?
Ashley: I'll stay, yeah, I'll stay.
Matt: All right. Now it is their turn. This one turns around and it's going to go ahead and make a bite attack against you, Keyleth, in scorpion form. That's a 17, plus six?
Marisha: That hits.
Matt: All right. You take 11, plus three. 14 points of piercing damage, plus seven points of poison damage.
Marisha: So that was 21?
Taliesin: My brain is not doing numbers for some reason.
Marisha: I know, and I keep looking at you.
Matt: Against you, Grog... It hits you regardless. It has advantage on you because you're averting your gaze, plus you had your reckless attack last round. It still only rolls a nine, plus six, so that's 14? 15 to hit.
Travis: Misses.
Matt: This one bites out towards you, and even though it's not there, because it's so bright, you see it shift, and you (boom) hit it in the front of its snout with the base of your sword. That brings us to the top of the initiative order. Vex, you're up.
Laura: Awesome. So it's the glowing one, I get advantage on the attack, because it's glowing?
Matt: You do, yes.
Laura: I'm going to Hunter's Mark it.
Matt: Okay, so Hunter's Mark moves over.
Laura: I'm going to avert my gaze, and roll a regular attack then? Since it's advantage?
Matt: Yes. It cancels out the disadvantage. So roll your first attack against it.
Laura: That's 31.
Matt: 31 hits, yeah.
Laura: 15 plus Hunter's Mark-- Oh, I didn't Hunter's Mark it.
Matt: Yeah, you did.
Taliesin: Yeah, you did.
Laura: Okay! What did I say, 15? 18.
Matt: 18, all right. So the first arrow strikes into it. It's still standing. It's looking a little hurt, but it's still standing.
Laura: And then do I still get regular attacks? This is at disadvantage.
Matt: Disadvantage on the next one, yeah.
Laura: 19?
Matt: Yeah. What's your total? 19 with disadvantage? That does hit, yep.
Laura: 18.
Matt: 18, all right. This arrow, however, manages to strike through the top of the head, stapling the mouth shut, and it falls to the ground as its eyes slowly glaze over.
Laura: I roar from up in the tree!
Taliesin: Wait, do you let go of the broom to roar?
Laura: No, I hold the broom in my hand!
Marisha: Katy Perry style.
Laura: Defying Gravity style.
Liam: Holding it in your hand while you're flying on it?
Laura: I'm not flying, I'm in a tree, dude.
Matt: Yeah, she's clutched up on top of a tree.
Liam: I'm not looking at you.
Matt: All right, that brings us to Scanlan. Are you averting your gaze or not?
Sam: I'm not only averting my gaze, I'm looking towards the holes that it came out of, any of the holes that are near me.
Matt: There's two that are near you.
Sam: Okay, I'm going to go over to one and throw a Fireball down into it.
Matt: Okay! So, Scanlan, you walk over to the nearby holes behind you, where the one that snuck up behind you essentially came out of, aim down, and make sure you mark off these charges for each use of the wand.
Sam: Yes.
Matt: You (whoosh) release the beam, which gets about 15, 20 feet down before it blasts. I need you to make a dexterity saving throw.
Travis: Like putting yourself at the mouth of a cannon.
Sam: Seven.
Laura: Oh no!
Matt: Roll 8d6. But take half damage, because it's mostly guarded and this is a circumstantial, at the outskirts of it, you're not taking the full brunt of the Fireball. However, you do get caught in the very edge of the backblast.
Sam: 29.
Matt: So you take half that. So you take 15 points of fire damage and are blown about five feet backward onto the ground. However, the ground shudders beneath all your feet, and the earth, the wet damp earth (squelch) sinks inward and the tunnel collapses. A few of the others (squelch) into it. There's still a couple more on the opposite side that are open. There's two more on this side that are open.
Sam: So the tunnels nearest me are not accessible anymore.
Matt: The two that were there and there both, the ground from it shuddering, collapsed inward, and now the mud has filled the space. There's these small sinkholes where they were.
Sam: All right. I'll spend the rest of my time in this round licking my wounds and studying the obelisk to see if I can see any other clues or anything on it.
Matt: Okay. You can see the text that she saw upon there, the Elvish script.
Sam: I can't read it, though.
Matt: But you see it there, and you see the triangle, a dark recessed triangle about that big that is in the base of it.
Sam: Is it a hole, or is it...?
Matt: It's a hole, but it's carved. It's not a perfect triangle, it starts as a triangle and slowly, as it recesses inward, comes to a point towards the back.
Taliesin: Like a reverse pyramid.
Sam: I throw a snowball in it.
Matt: (impact)
Sam: It's safe, guys.
Matt: Vax, you're up.
Liam: All right, I'm off the map, but I want to try to come down towards the tree that I think Percy's at. He's between two trees. I'm going to avert my gaze, I'm going to look at the ground, come up around the side of that tree, and I'm listening for scorpion clacking and basilisk hissing, and I'm going to throw, dagger dagger dagger, in the direction of the basilisk I hear near scorpion claws clutching. Does that make sense?
Matt: Mm-hmm.
Liam: All right. So this is at disadvantage because I'm looking at the ground. So first one is... first one is a 21.
Matt: 21 hits.
Liam: And second one is... 19?
Matt: Hits.
Liam: Third one is 16.
Matt: Hits. These are not with Sharpshooter?
Liam: No, not at all. So we've got ten, plus nine, plus ten.
Matt: With that, your final dagger hits in the side of its rib cage, and the creature slumps over on the ground, letting out a horrible, gurgling hiss as it slowly dies amongst the mud.
Liam: Daredevil.
Laura: Was that all of them?
Matt: Currently, yes. Make a perception check.
Laura: Okay. Oh, I roll with advantage, because I'm in the forest! Oh my god, I rolled a one twice in a fucking row. I see nothing.
Sam: Two natural ones?
Marisha: We are fucking eating it on rolls tonight.
Matt: You're about to look down to inspect the vicinity. However, the tree is starting to bow forward and you (grunt) have to catch yourself, and you have no chance to even survey the territory.
Taliesin: Pine sap gets in your eye.
Liam: Laura Bailey dies on stream.
Travis: I rolled a 16.
Matt: As you take a moment, the rage still in, you can hear the blood pumping in your ears, but you also hear the (hiss) rising hissing, what sounds like a distant echo coming up from a subterranean tunnel.
Laura: Oh no.
Marisha: Subterranean tunnel?
Travis: Yeah. That Fireball, I think it might have pissed them off.
Sam: Good.
Marisha: Can I use my blindsight tremorsense to see if I can feel how far away they are?
Matt: You do. You feel beneath the ground. It's less of a tremorsense, more being able to sense the vibrations in the air around you. You can tell that there is motion coming from underneath.
Marisha: Sounds like a lot of them?
Matt: A few more.
Ashley: Fireball the other holes?
Marisha: I'm going to drop my scorpion form.
Sam: Oh, god, Keyleth, you're horrible! Oh, wait, no, you've turned back to normal.
Marisha: The things you say, Scanlan. I'm just going to do a Wall of Stone, flat over the area with the holes.
Matt: So from the stone chunks and portions of the shattered bodies that litter part of this garden, a giant stone wall forms around them and builds over it, sealing these holes. Eventually you hear a (knocking) (reptilian snarl) scraping sounds.
Sam: They're friendly!
Liam: "I can't breathe down here!"
Matt: They're not budging it, they're just hitting it from underneath, and it's getting more frantic as time goes on.
Sam: How long can you hold that?
Marisha: It'll last until they bust out of it, so we either keep moving or figure out where we're going from here.
Sam: What is this obelisk? It seems important if these things are protecting it.
Laura: What does it say?
Marisha: It has writing in Elvish in it.
Sam: What does it say?
Marisha: It says, a name is earned, in Elvish.
Sam: Should we say a name to it and see what happens?
Matt: One of the stone parts of the wall begins to crack from underneath.
Laura: Didn't Osysa say something about, her mate wouldn't say its name?
Sam: That's right, that's right.
Laura: And this is a symbol of Ioun.
Travis: Should we say Ioun in Elvish?
Marisha: I say Ioun in Elvish.
Matt: You say it out into the air.
Sam: Why don't you say it into this triangle hole over here?
Marisha: Ioun!
Laura: Say knowledge in Elvish.
Marisha: Knowledge!
Sam: Elvish is just English except muffled.
Marisha: I'm going in the triangle hole!
Matt: A moment passes.
Marisha: Osysa! Sphinx!
Laura: A name is earned.
Travis: What's in the hole?
Marisha: What's in the hole?
Sam: I don't know what's in the hole. Nothing.
Matt: A basilisk face bursts through the stone wall.
Sam: Whack-a-Mole! Grog! Whack-a-Mole!
Travis: Can I run over and play golf?
Matt: Yeah. Do you want to avert your gaze or not?
Travis: Nah.
Matt: All right, I need you to make a constitution saving throw.
Liam: Shite.
Travis: 22.
Matt: Without an issue, the eyes find yours and you just grin as you bring... what kind of attacks do you want to do?
Travis: Reckless and Great Weapon Master.
Matt: All right, go for it.
Travis: That's a natural 20. I'll take that one on the first one.
Matt: Okay, and the other one?
Travis: 19. 20.
Matt: Both hit. The first is a critical. This would be over here.
Travis: 31?
Matt: Did you roll the... Is that times two?
Travis: No, that's just the attack.
Liam: It's critical.
Matt: Before you add your modifier.
Travis: Before the modifier? It was 12 before the modifier.
Matt: So 24 plus the modifier.
Travis: Which is 32, plus ten is 42.
Matt: 42. Did you roll the additional brutal critical rolls?
Travis: Nope.
Matt: So roll 4d6 on top of that, because of your brutal critical. I think it is.
Liam: I think we can all agree it's the jelly of the month club at this point.
Travis: 17.
Matt: For a grand total of...
Sam: 59?
Laura: Do you double those ones though, because it's the dice?
Travis: That's just the first hit.
Matt: Yeah, all right. 59 points of damage. You square up.
Travis: Happy Gilmore-style.
Matt: You strike down with the blade at an angle, using the stone holding it in place like an executioner's block, and the blade scrapes against the stone as you strike, finding itself embedding about seven to eight inches into the throat of the basilisk as its head's protruding out. Immediately, blood begins to pour out of its side, and it's gurgling at its attempt to try and push through. You wedge the blade out. Go for your next strike. You already rolled your attack, which was a 19, so roll damage on that one.
Travis: Seven, 12, 20, 30, on the second one.
Liam: Oh, that's all?
Matt: With the second strike, you (whoosh) clean slice. The head (splat) onto the stonework there, the body still wedging the hole shut. The neck is a clean cut, and starts gouting blood out.
Travis: I dip the tip of the sword into the little well and I pick up the head.
Matt: Which, by the way, both saving throws were failed, so you gain another plus two to strength.
Sam: Wow, you're catching up to Pike!
Laura: Ow! Nothing.
Taliesin: Did you cut yourself on your cup?
Laura: No, I just hit my tooth.
Marisha: Oh, I hate that.
Taliesin: Oh, I hate that.
Matt: All right, so you can feel the impact still attempting from beneath growing more and more frantic.
Marisha: I say, earned!
Ashley: Can I go collect some of the (stuttering) basilisk-- I can't say that. Can I get some of the blood and collect it?
Matt: Sure. And you notice that the longer it stays out there, the blood itself is beginning to freeze in the general atmosphere and get slushy.
Laura: We can get some and put it in my bag. It keeps things good.
Ashley: Can I stab the carcass then in another area and get some fresh in the body?
Matt: Yeah, there's plenty of carcasses of basilisks around. As they're inspecting, and you still feel the impacts from underneath the stone wall from the other tunnel, you manage to gather, we'll say two small vials of basilisk blood.
Ashley: Vex!
Travis: Yeah, put it in Vex's little refrigerator Bag of Holding.
Matt: Okay. The slamming on the other side of the stone wall slowly subsides until silence comes.
Marisha: Did they give up?
Travis: Has anybody put their hand in the hole yet?
Laura: It's all you, Grog.
Travis: All right, I put my hand in the hole.
Matt: Where the one you killed is?
Travis: No, the triangle.
Matt: Okay. So you take your hand and you place it inside this empty recess in the obelisk. It reaches in, and the shadow of the obelisk completely takes it to the wrist. Nothing happens.
Sam: I'm going to take my Ioun Stone and shove it in the hole.
Matt: Okay. You take the Ioun Stone and place it in the hole, and it has a soft light that it gives off naturally from the magical enchantment, and it lights the inside of the dark recess, and as you place it inside, the top of the obelisk begins to glow ever-so-faintly, like a little beacon. The very top of the stone glows a matching color to your stone.
Marisha: A matching color?
Matt: Yeah. I need you all to make a perception check.
Sam: 17.
Marisha: 14.
Liam: 16.
Travis: 19!
Laura: 25.
Taliesin: 11.
Sam: Ashley Blindsight?
Ashley: 16!
Matt: Okay. You catch a little bit of this, Grog, and you perk up as you notice, and you see immediately. There is a matching beacon, a faint glow that appears to be streaking down the mountainside in the distance. It's a little bit off-center from the direct south direction that you're facing, but there is a slight marker, very faintly visible on the mountain range, just visible over the treetops.
Laura: I drop a pin in that, and I tell Keyleth, now you can use that thing!
Marisha: I hold up the Hunk of Quall.
Laura: No, I mean your spell, Keyleth. Fastest way to get to this point!
Marisha: I didn't bring it because everyone said not to learn that spell.
Sam: That was today, wasn't it?
Laura: I thought you already learned it.
Marisha: He said to learn something else because it wasn't going to be useful.
Laura: No, he said just don't use that thing!
Marisha: No, you said to learn something, it was at the beginning of the day!
Sam: You can't unlearn things! It's all good.
Laura: It's okay, it's okay. I can see it.
Matt: You had it already memorized when you guys got to the edge of the forest, I'm pretty sure.
Marisha: Okay. I thought you were saying to pick something else because it wouldn't be handy. But I take it back, and I'll use it now if you want.
Taliesin: No, we're good. We're good.
Marisha: I'm so confused.
Matt: Up to you.
Marisha: Is it me tonight?
Taliesin: It is a really weird pot of coffee. It's not just you.
Marisha: Do I need sleep? What am I missing?
Matt: It's all good.
Marisha: I can keep it.
Travis: Just lick your finger and stick it in the wind.
Laura: Just use the spell and pretend that you never unlearned it.
Marisha: I never unlearned it! It's been there the whole time! I didn't use it. It's not like I used a 6th-level spell. Look, guys! Find the Path! That way!
Matt: Okay. So what is it that you're focusing on for the spell?
Marisha: That beam of light!
Laura: That I pointed out to her.
Marisha: That she pointed out. Am I doing this wrong?
Matt: No, you're not doing it wrong! You cast the spell and, concentrating on the source of this beacon, you feel the direction that would pull you the best way to travel towards that beacon is to travel towards that beacon.
Liam: Look, you're just doing what the bossy half-elf told you to do. Just go with it.
Marisha: What, that one?
Liam: That's the only bossy half-elf here.
Sam: DM, can I experiment and take away, if I take away my Ioun Stone, does the light fade?
Matt: As you pull the Ioun Stone out of it, the beacon does fade, yes. But you have a direction.
Marisha: I have it marked now. I have a pin in it. Right, that counts?
Matt: Right. No matter where you travel in this place, you will have a directional position towards that beacon.
Laura: See, there we go.
Marisha: Fucking handy, that one is.
Travis: Yep, redemption.
Marisha: Totally a great 6th-level spell I'm going to use all the time going forward.
Liam: Oh, for fuck's sake. Here we go, people. Here we go. And we're moving.
Travis: We take off at a jog now!
Sam: Wait, before we leave, is there anything else we need to do here? Do we need to go down into the tunnels? Do we need to piss on the obelisk? Do we want to do anything?
Liam: You should piss on the obelisk just to be sure.
Taliesin: You should lick it, too, after you piss on it.
Travis: Let's not.
Sam: Let's go.
Matt: Are you guys leaving?
Sam: Wait, we need some basilisk blood and stuff!
Laura: We got some!
Matt: You're standing amongst the obelisk, a long series of mud with a bunch of mostly together stone statues of people and pieces of people around.
Travis: Do we want to check the other building ruins? We didn't check those at all. There's a whole corner of a building over there.
Laura: Sure.
Travis: Well, go check it!
Laura: I go look at it.
Liam: Half-elves look at the building structure.
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Travis: What the hot holy fuck.
Liam: 26.
Taliesin: It says it was forged by dwarves, that's all I can understand.
Laura: Investigation?
Matt: Investigation, yeah.
Laura: 19.
Matt: 19, all right. You guys both start gathering around the sides of the ruin. Glancing about the outside, it looks like at one point it was a smaller structure, probably part of the construction, like this here was a satellite place of worship for Ioun, like a beacon as part of a journey. But nothing about it catches your eyes. As you're stepping over the remnants of the stone individuals on the ground, you catch your eye on one of the individuals you see, lying partially submerged in the snow and mud. You glance down and see two arms that are out like this, although the right arm from the elbow down is missing. It's broken off in stone. Both are reaching out. A young human male, shortish brown hair, spectacles at the end of his nose, thin body and tucked-in, nice buttoned shirt. Slacks. This is Tyriok, the mapmaker.
Liam: The mapmaker?
Taliesin: You're a terrible person.
Laura: No, why would you do that, Matthew?
Matt: I didn't do this! He was travelling the world to take notes, people!
Liam: I take... Wait! Everybody shush! I look at him for a moment and then I leave him, and I don't tell anyone else.
Marisha: What?
Sam: We have Pike with us!
Liam: I don't tell anyone else. Pike didn't see him. His arm is broken off! You don't fucking know he exists. He's gone.
Ashley: But, but!
Laura: That's terrible!
Taliesin: Why don't you two just write a sequel to Batman/Superman while you're at it? Just destroy everything. I don't care anymore.
Laura: We could heal him!
Matt: You don't know. Eventually, after you guys do a perusal of the ruins, you find your way back to the party and you guys continue travelling which way, towards the beacon?
Laura: Towards the beacon!
Marisha: I've got it in my head now.
Liam: Wait, wait, wait, I go to Pike. I go to Pike. Pike.
Ashley: Yeah? Hi, Vax!
Liam: Do you remember that mapmaker? Were you with us? So much shit has happened. Do you remember Tyriok the mapmaker?
Ashley: I don't think I was with you.
Liam: There's a man over there. His arm is gone. Can you fix stoning? Can you fix a man who's been turned to stone?
Ashley: I can try. Remember one time we fixed Vex, when she was turned to stone, the last time we fought the basilisks.
Liam: Two years ago, yeah. What did we do?
Ashley: We covered her in basilisk blood.
Liam: I need to take a walk. Could you do that? Could you do that?
Ashley: Sure. Which stone is he?
Liam: Look over there by that tree there. Do you see him? There's two hands pointing towards the sky.
Sam: One hand.
Liam: Two.
Ashley: One and a half. All right, can I head over there?
Matt: You walk over there, and you do see a number of broken body parts all turned to stone in various states of disuse and crumbling. You do see a young man who's caught with his arms out, one broken off at the elbow, staring up, glasses at the end of his nose, looking both frightened and frozen in a moment of complete unaware danger.
Ashley: Okay. Can I try covering him in some of the basilisk's blood?
Matt: Sure. You take one of the vials that you collected and take the basilisk blood and pour it over the statue. The blood congeals and spills over, crystallizing slowly as the ice cold gets to it. It doesn't seem to have an effect.
Ashley: It's been too long.
Matt: You gather, based on the last time it happened, the blood needs to be applied within a short period of time after the person turns to stone. Do you have anything else that might help?
Ashley: Probably Greater Restoration.
Matt: Do you have that prepared?
Ashley: I do.
Matt: You concentrate, grasping the symbol of Sarenrae around your neck and touch your hand out. The warm glow of Sarenrae's divine energy transferring into the stone form. The form glows with energy, and the glow subsides and fades, the stone texture of his body beginning to slowly soften, and the color returning to his skin, and for a moment the head seems to shake, and the eyes clarify, and a voice begins to peek through these previously frozen vocal cords. "I mean no--" (screams) As all of a sudden his arm begins to spray gouts of blood.
Travis: I got it! I got it! I start catching it with the sword.
Matt: (stuttering) He turns to you, and sprays right across your face.
Travis: Good! Splash on! Yes!
Matt: "Help! Help me!"
Ashley: I grab his arm and Cure Wounds! I don't know if that's a really good move.
Matt: Go ahead and heal him up a bit.
Ashley: Can I try to reattach his arm?
Matt: You gather that might have been something to do before you had restored him.
Sam: Oh, shit.
Matt: However, go ahead and heal for Cure Wounds. Roll a d8 plus five.
Travis: That's kind of fucking hilarious.
Ashley: 5d8 plus five?
Matt: Depending on what level you want to use on him. A level one is 1d8 plus five.
Ashley: Oh, God, okay. I feel like I'm using all this, but I don't know. Okay, so let's do level five.
Matt: Level five. All right, go for it. 5d8 plus five.
Taliesin: Not our finest hour. Pretty reasonable hour, but it's definitely not the finest. We brought most of a mapmaker back.
Matt: So how much is that?
Ashley: 29.
Matt: 29, okay. As you reach out and grasp the edge of his bleeding stump...
Ashley: Stop moving!
Matt: "I just--" (yelps) The warmth causes the pain to fade and he calms for a second. "Oh. Sorry." He looks down as the wound has stopped bleeding, skin is scabbed over, and it looks like it's now in a place where it's no longer an open wound. It is mostly healed over, though he is now missing part of his arm.
Laura: Can you regrow his little arm like you regrew my brother's little nubbin of a toe?
Matt: This is a bit beyond your healing capabilities.
Travis: C'mon, Deadpool hand.
Matt: At which point he goes, "Thank you, small one. I--" And he goes to reach up for his glasses and... Other hand.
Laura: Oh, we're terrible.
Taliesin: Technically saved seven-eighths of a mapmaker.
Matt: He looks around at the rest of you. "Oh! Hello, it's been a while. We haven't... Well, I seem to have gotten myself in a bit of a predicament."
Sam: What happened?
Matt: "Well, I was... Well, I had two escorts. And I had been making my way through most of Tal'Dorei, and had gotten as far as this region, and... That's all I remember."
Laura: Basilisks? Big lizard creatures?
Matt: "Yes. Very scary. I tried to run, and that's all I remember."
Laura: Was it just the three of you, then? Not a large group of people?
Matt: "No, just three of us."
Ashley: What were you doing over here?
Matt: "I was trying to finish this portion of the map. If I... Ah!" And he goes over and reaches through some of the snow and pulls up a large stone bag that is currently still attached to his broken arm.
Taliesin: No!
Matt: "Um. Is this...?"
Travis: Nope! No, no, that's just part of a-- It was a statue garden, it's not a big deal. It's just a fragment.
Matt: "All right. Well, these were my maps."
Sam: Are they stone?
Matt: They are stone, currently.
Laura: Can we-- Oh, no.
Travis: Is he on the ground still?
Matt: No, he's standing. "Oh boy." He takes his glasses off and goes to rub them into his shirt and... does it with one hand and puts them back on.
Ashley: Oh, buddy.
Laura: I feel terrible.
Matt: "Well."
Taliesin: It's like a one-legged duck walking around.
Matt: "What do I do?"
Travis: Which hand does he have, his left?
Matt: He has his left hand.
Travis: Are you right-handed?
Matt: "I'm kind of ambidextrous."
Travis: Thank gods for that.
Laura: That's good, that's good. Well...
Taliesin: A lot's happened.
Matt: There's shock on his face. He still hasn't quite taken in all of this stuff.
Sam: Everything is going to be okay.
Marisha: Well, you have a great story now.
Taliesin: And a period of adjustment.
Matt: "This is very true. This is a valid point."
Taliesin: We should send him back to the encampment.
Laura: It's like a two-day walk.
Sam: These escorts you had with you who were also turned to stone, were they important to you? Were they friends of yours?
Matt: "I hired them as part of this endeavor. They were nice fellows. Hold on a second." He starts walking off and starts rummaging through the pieces of stone and various people, picking up heads. "No. Well, that's Alex. Golly, I don't... I don't know where Gerald is, but... Can I come with you for now?"
Laura: Well, you're more than-- Actually--
Travis: No.
Laura: He's rather smart, isn't he?
Sam: He has knowledge of the area.
Taliesin: That actually could be useful.
Laura: Here's the thing. It's very dangerous, dear, and it's quite possible you might be turned into stone again.
Matt: "I don't want that."
Laura: No, we don't want that for you, either.
Travis: Also eaten alive, burned, shot, stabbed--
Laura: Straight-up killed.
Travis: -- pulled apart, maimed--
Laura: Beheaded.
Travis: -- Lacerated.
Laura: All options.
Travis: But that's just in the mornings.
Laura: But you're more than welcome to join us, for a short amount of time. Or you can head back to a camp that's about a day and a half away.
Matt: "All right. Whereabouts are you going?"
Travis: We're heading up the mountain.
Matt: I'll head for the camp.
Travis: Are you sure? We could always use you as a decoy-- I mean, as an aid.
Matt: "I'm good. I'm all right. Thank you, though. I appreciate the offer. I have a lot to think about."
Marisha: I could...
Taliesin: Well, we'll run into him when we get back.
Travis: Do you need a hand finding your way to the encampment?
Sam: Oh, Grog.
Taliesin: Not cool.
Liam: Groan.
Matt: He starts walking northward, basically trailing past the path where you guys walked from.
Laura: I feel like we should help him or something.
Liam: Not bad enough to actually do it, though, right?
Marisha: I have Conjure Woodland Beings in my back pocket today, so I could conjure you a little posse to escort you.
Laura: That would be good!
Liam: Have some squirrels, buddy.
Marisha: Have a little posse.
Matt: What's the duration on that one?
Marisha: I don't know. That's something else that I haven't done, ever.
Sam: Untested high-level spell? Do it!
Marisha: That always works so well.
Matt: It's an hour of concentration.
Travis: Is this as far as you got, or did you make it up the mountain previously?
Matt: "I was cresting through the base of the mountain, and made it most of the way down the Stormcrest and was heading back through the Frostweald."
Travis: Oh, you've been up there already?
Laura: You've been to the base of the Stormcrest Mountains!
Matt: "I was kind of along the side. We were trying to make our way through the central portion of the mountain pass so we could keep track of the division of topography on both top and bottom."
Travis: Oh, man. Why you didn't say so? We could really use your help here.
Laura: Actually, did you see something similar to this obelisk at the base of the mountain?
Matt: "Uh..." He looks back and thinks to himself. "Not quite like this, though, but there are a number of cavern entrances that litter various portions of the base of the mountain."
Travis: Did you go in any of them?
Matt: "No, see, I was afraid those would be too dangerous. So I went into the forest."
Travis: Right.
Matt: "Anyway."
Travis: Well, look, you don't really seem to have a lot on you. Why don't you join us for just a little bit, to the areas that he knows, and then we'll send you back on your way, maybe with a bit of ale, a little bit of food? Maybe a weapon?
Matt: "That would be fantastic. And... Thank you. I realize now that if you hadn't come by, I probably would have been there forever."
Laura: Yes, well, we're sorry about the arm, dear.
Matt: "There are worse things. And I can retrain to write with this arm. It's totally fine."
Sam: Yes. You're lucky to be alive, and now you're going on an adventure with us. Hey, who has two thumbs and is really excited? You and me, both doing this.
Matt: You know what, make a charisma check.
Taliesin: You worry me.
Sam: Charisma?
Matt: Yeah, add your plus five charisma bonus.
Sam: 20.
Matt: 20? As you do that, he... "Yeah. You're right! You're right. I'm thankful to be alive today, and it's because of you guys."
Liam: Technically true.
Matt: "Let's travel!"
Travis: Well, listen, I'll walk with you. Lead the way.
Matt: "All right, so where are you going? Because this place was dangerous, and that place is dangerous, and we don't want to go that way."
Travis: Yeah, Vex'ahlia will point where we're headed.
Laura: Why don't you want to go that way? Have you seen orcs in this wood?
Matt: He points and says, "There's a lot of them that way. We came through here to avoid them, and that's when this all happened."
Laura: Ooh. Actually, we should probably take care of the orcs.
Taliesin: Get the orcs really quick, and then we can send him back with the refugees from there.
Marisha: We did say we were going to take care of the orcs.
Laura: Yes, we did.
Marisha: We did promise that.
Laura: What do you say, Grog? Would you like to kill some orc?
Travis: Do you always ask questions to which you know the answer already?
Laura: Would you like to stay here while we fight the orcs, or could you walk us towards them and stay hidden?
Matt: "I don't want to stay here."
Laura: Then you come with us, and then you stay very, very hidden.
Matt: "I can do that. I can definitely do that."
Taliesin: When it's time, he can hide with the bear. Then a bear will be hiding with a mapmaker, or most of a mapmaker.
Sam: We'll be fine. Let's go.
Matt: "All right."
Liam: While all of that happened, for the last ten minutes, can I stealth away for a little bit?
Matt: Sure. Roll a stealth check.
Liam: 31.
Matt: Okay. Based on passive perception, nobody notices your exit.
Liam: I don't want to go that far, I want to go so I can still hear all this bullshit behind me, and find a quiet spot... I know you can hear me. I'm going to need... I'm going to need more than nightmares. A deal has been struck, and I will honor it. I need to understand what this is. Any time.
Matt: In that moment, the white snow suddenly flashes to dark, and it's like you were struck blind. You gasp instinctually as your vision goes dark, nothing, and you see come from the shadow, another flash, another vision. It's of Vasselheim. Another flash. You look out and you can see there's one large, darkened structure that you have not visited but passed by on the southeastern side of Vasselheim.
Taliesin: Yeah! Temple! Temple of the Raven Queen.
Matt: The actual name of this, and you've heard it in passing before, when you were given your initial pass over of the... I'm trying to find the specific name here so I don't mess it up. It's in here somewhere. You see this dark, obsidian structure that is ridged, almost like an even rib cage along each side. It is ominous, and it stuck out in the middle of the city because, amongst the rest of the jovial atmosphere, it loomed over the Amaranthine Oubliette. But this was the central temple to the Raven Queen. You then flash once again, in a long chamber, and you see veils, dark veils passing by, one after another, after another. Another flash forward, and you see a chamber with dark brown, smooth floors. You see gold trim along large pillars that reach up to a dome-type stained glass ceiling of amber colors and white, and in the center of this chamber you see what appears to be a pool of still, crimson liquid. You see the crimson liquid shift, and a form rises up out of it. An arm rises up and beckons a finger. Your vision goes to black, and you're back in the forest.
Liam: Fuck. Not exactly what I was talking about. At some point, a little bit of clarification. Congratulations, you're creepy as fuck. We'll work it out. I head back to the group.
Sam: Good talk.
Matt: As you guys gather yourselves, your new companion, and start heading in the direction that he ushered you within the Frostweald, towards where supposedly these orcs have holed up and made their camp, you know that the good news is, you probably have the element of surprise in this, but you're not entirely sure what it is you're in for when you get there. That's where I'll end today's session. (groaning)
Laura: That was a lot of sidetracks on this particular adventure.
Matt: That's all right. Sidetracks make it fun.
Taliesin: Nothing wrong with sidetrack.
Liam: Heebie-jeebies.
Laura: Oh, man, she's creepy!
Ashley: Creepy as fuck!
Laura: Creepy as fuck!
Sam: Hey, Pike, good job tonight, lady!
Travis: Hey, Pikey!
Sam: You brought a guy back to life!
Laura: 19 strength, say what!
Sam: You're super strong!
Ashley: I'm a tank.
Travis: Tank up in this motherfucker.
Liam: (bang! bang! bang!)
Ashley: It feels so good to be back.
Matt: I know. Come back to us soon! Physically!
Laura: Yes, please!
Ashley: Yes, very soon! A few more weeks, a few more weeks.
Travis: She's coming, she's coming.
Liam: We need our Pike.
Matt: All right, guys. We'll pick this up next Thursday! Thank you for coming and watching us play around, make believe on the Internet.
Sam: Is next week any-- It's not our 50th episode?
Liam: It's our 49th!
Laura: Next week is our 49th, two weeks from now is our 50th.
Matt: 21st is our 50th episode.
Sam: Last time in our 40s.
Marisha: Got to enjoy it now.
Travis: And don't miss the 50th.
Matt: Don't miss the 50th, it's going to be fun.
Laura: May be a couple surprises in store.
Matt: We'll see.
Travis: Nothing. Just us.
Matt: I don't know where we'll be in the story, because that's definitely based on whatever you guys do. But we'll have some fun things here.
Liam: Shopping episode.
Matt: Yep. But yeah, thank you guys so much! See you next Thursday. Those of you in Pittsburgh, we'll see you this weekend. Is it Thursday yet?

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors battle traffic from E3 to get here in time to roll dice and play Dungeons and Dragons.
Travis: Yeah, we do.
Sam: Video games!
Marisha: All the video games.
Matt: Thank you for being patient and waiting for us with a couple of tech issues and generally battling living in Los Angeles and having a car. Anyway, before we kick the night off, real fast, I just want to take a moment to acknowledge-- and I feel it's important to acknowledge there's been a lot of difficulty and a lot of terrible things happening in the world and in our country in particular this past week or so. And us as Critical Role and this community around, I'm sure many of you agree, we just wanted to take a moment to express that we stand with the families of those that are currently dealing with this difficulty, who have lost those, and stand with the community that this was aimed at. And everybody who has come together as part of this, we are in full support of this whole wonderful gathering of people in light of this darkness, and I think it's not just myself when I say that everything this community stands for is to perpetually spread love, community, positivity, acceptance, and everything in between. So we just wanted to bring that to you guys and let you know that we're thinking about you all out there. And we have a wonderful community of Critters out there as well. If anyone needs any help, assistance, or guidance, or even just a happy word to pick them up during this rough time, we're all there for you. So, anyway. (blows kiss, sighs) Then, to kick off this evening of announcements and such, we are kicking into the second day of our renewed Loot Crate sponsorship. (cheering)
Matt: We wanted to reinforce that their current theme is Dystopia, which is an awesome theme box that deals with all sorts of things of post-apocalypse and dystopian-type films, games, the whole thing. They have Fallout, RoboCop, BioShock, a whole bunch of really, really cool things, so if you guys want to go to lootcrate.com/criticalrole, you can go ahead and get $3 off your subscription and get a whole bunch of that cool stuff. We also have the Dystopia DX, which is their big collector's box--
Travis: So awesome.
Matt: which we showed last week.
Laura: Oh, is that what this one was from?
Marisha: Yeah, your sweet shirt.
Ashley: I love that shirt.
Laura: Yeah, Skeletor!
Matt: (laughs) That's pretty slick. If you guys have a chance to check it out, go see if it's something you'd be interested in, and make sure you put in the criticalrole-- all one word-- code to go ahead and get your subscription discount, which is fantastic.
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: We're happy to present that (funny accent) and are happy that they like our show enough to come and sponsor, which is awesome. (normal voice) So check that out. You have until the 19th at 9pm Pacific to subscribe and receive the Dystopia theme, otherwise it switches over to the next theme, so if you're gonna get under the wire for that one, (funny accent) do it soon. It's like a-- yeah! We have a--
Travis: We’re giving out crates in a chat room thing, don't we?
Matt: You think so?
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: Giving out crates?
Laura: We are?
Ashley: Yeah.
Taliesin: Are we?
Marisha: Are we?
Laura: (gasps) That's exciting!
Ashley: It's going to be one at the break? It's going to be a giveaway at the break?
Matt: Oh, snap.
Ashley: I'm just going to start making stuff up.
Travis: Is that-- did you just point and--
Ashley: Point, shoot.
Sam: Loot Crate has donated two Loot Crate DX boxes to give away to you. We will be doing this at the break and at the end of the night, random in chat. You must be active! Stay tuned for that! Exclamation point!
Marisha: I'm so glad someone wrote that down for us!
Taliesin: Yeah, I'm so glad they wrote out the exclamation point.
Travis: I'm in the chat right now.
Laura: (laughing) Yeah.
Travis: Totally.
Sam: Remind you, gotta stay active.
Marisha: You're active? Stay active.
Matt: Stay active, Travis. In the game! (snaps fingers) Eyes up here, Grog. (laughter)
Matt: All right, so the next couple of things we want to mention to you guys real fast: We have, it started up today, a Critical Role t-shirt contest that went up.
Laura: Yeah!
Matt: We're doing this with Woobox. The link should be in the chat room for you guys to check out, but we have currently, until June 24th at midnight, the cut-off date, but if anyone wants to submit any designs, all the rules for the contest are there. When all those designs have been submitted, we ourselves, the cast of Critical Role, are going to pore through and pick our favorite.
Laura: Top three.
Matt: Top three?
Laura: Yes.
Travis: Top three faves.
Matt: (funny accent) And we will have designs incoming forward for official Critical Role shirt stuffs, which is nice.
Travis: (similar accent) Critter.
Laura: (similar accent) Critter, it's a Critter shirt.
Marisha: Critter shirt.
Travis: (similar accent) Critter community t-shirt.
Sam: Are they all going to be like Boaty McBoatface or something? (laughter)
Laura: What's Boaty McBoatface?
Sam: Boaty McBoatface is like an online "name our boat." (all say Boaty McBoatface)
Matt: Say Boaty McBoatface so we can get into this, and I'll be happy. (laughter)
Travis: Do your worst. Show us your best. Yes!
Marisha: All right, who did we send to Alaska? Who was that? Was that Flo Rida?
Matt: No. Oh, Alaska? That was... Redman. Bulldog.
Marisha: Bulldog!
Taliesin: Pitbull.
Marisha: Pitbull! Pitbull!
Matt: I mess up his name intentionally all the time.
Travis: Bullman?
Taliesin: (groans)
Marisha: (laughing) Pitbull.
Ashley: Bulldog. Shih tzu.
Marisha: He played in, like, a Wal-Mart in Anchorage.
Laura: But it was like a joke for publicity, right?
Matt: He went ahead and did it! The online poll for his next performance, the internet trolled him and made it to this far Alaska performance.
Marisha: A Wal-Mart in Anchorage, or something like that.
Laura: And he did it
Matt: And he did it! I was like, "respect to you, man. Well done."
Marisha: Yeah, respect. Like 50 people showed up.
Laura: That's awesome!
Marisha: And got a private--
Laura: Concert.
Marisha: Yeah.
Taliesin: You know what, I've done a con in Anchorage. It's nice. I like it.
Travis: Yeah, man. Anchorage moose.
Taliesin: They've got moose.
Laura: Can we talk about our next thing because I'm so excited about it.
Sam: Yeah.
Taliesin: What's the next thing?
Marisha: Yeah.
Sam: Do we get to show it, or no?
Laura: YES.
Taliesin: Oh, yes, that!
Liam: (frustrated noises)
Laura: Wait, okay, so Liam gets to say it.
Matt: So, you are technically DM.
Liam: So some of you might remember us talking about Joe Madureira and his Kickstarter game, Darksiders Night War, which he successfully Kickstarted. We talked about it a bunch on this show--
Matt: Battle War, you mean?
Liam: Hm?
Matt: Darksiders was--
Liam: Excuse me. Battle Chasers.
Laura: Battle Chasers.
Liam: Excuse me, I was going to be here for a half hour and settle down and go over my talking points.
Liam: Battle Chasers.
Sam: You're wearing the shirt.
Liam: Battle Chasers. I'm wearing the damn shirt. (laughter)
Liam: Sorry. Hour and a half in L.A. traffic. Anyway. He successfully Kickstarted, they're working on it, I just saw him at E3, I saw him a couple of days ago. If you don't know Joe's work, he is a comic book artist rock star. He has worked on X-men, he's worked on Avenging Spider-Man, Inhumans, Ultimates 3, and his own comic, Battle Chasers, which I fell in love with when I was a teenager. He does gorgeous artwork. He's only gotten better with time.
Sam: Pitbull Chasers.
Marisha: (laughs)
Liam: Pitbull Chasers, Flo Rida, and Joe collaborating together. Anyway, that game's coming out. You should check it out, this is it. But I bring that up because while Joe is a busy, busy guy, he somehow found the time-- I'm so excited-- to create an exclusive art piece for Critical Role.
Ashley: Can we bring it in?
Marisha: So gorgeous.
Laura: Okay, okay, okay. (noises of awe)
Liam: Look at that business. So right now--
Laura: It's blocking my face, but I want to see it.
Marisha: Well, we've seen it tiny.
Liam: Guys, if you go over to the Geek and Sundry shop right now, this is on pre-order, so-- I'm going over my script-- signed versions of this will be available for pre-order for 2 weeks only.
Travis: Yeah, limited 2-week run, y'all. Get it.
Liam: 2-week pre-order. And then unsigned for 3 weeks.
Laura: 3 weeks.
Liam: So this is now or never.
Ashley: It's so badass!
Marisha: Now or never and then it goes away forever.
Laura: Forever!
Liam: And it's too gorgeous, too. Oh my lord.
Marisha: It's so gorgeous.
Ashley: I wonder if we should show a close-up or something.
Laura: So yeah, keep in mind when you order it on pre-order that you have to wait for it to be fully pre-ordered before we can send it out. I don't know if that was on camera because I'm above the poster. (laughter)
Ashley: It's so sexy.
Marisha: You're so sexy.
Liam: It's all right. Vex is on the paper, so.
Laura: That's right.
Marisha: Pike in that three-point landing!
Laura: Oh no, don't take it away.
Ashley: (singing) Goodbye, my love!
Travis: There's an image on the website, right?
Marisha: And they are movie-poster size. They are that size.
Laura: Yeah, they're that full-on--
Liam: They're 24 x 36. Gorgeous.
Marisha: 24 x 36.
Sam: And there's a place to click on the page where you are right now watching this.
Matt: Those are my eyes. I'm on a poster!
Marisha: If you scroll down, there'll be a button.
Liam: Scroll down to the bottom of the page, there's a button for that.
Marisha: Scroll down, there's a button.
Liam: Thank you, Joe. Thank you. It's gorgeous.
Laura: Thank you, Joe!
Marisha: Thank you, Joe!
Matt: Thank you, Joe. It's amazing.
Ashley: Thanks, Joe!
Taliesin: That's amazing.
Laura: It's beautiful.
Ashley: I love it so much.
Matt: It is getting framed and becoming a centerpiece of our home.
Liam: And Battle Chasers Night War. You should check it out today. (laughter)
Matt: All righty.
Sam: Signed, by the way, signed by us, not by the artist.
Liam: Us. By us.
Marisha: Yeah, by us.
Taliesin: You could find him. Hunt him down if you wanted to.
Marisha: Yes. (laughs)
Matt: (in a funny accent) Taliesin, you are going to be somewhere this weekend, are you not?
Taliesin: Oh, god, I am. As soon as we're done here, I go home and pack and get on an airplane. I will be at Amazing Comic Con in Vegas all weekend.
Travis: You bastard.
Taliesin: Yeah. Sleep is never gonna happen.
Laura: No.
Ashley: No.
Marisha: No.
Taliesin: Never.
Ashley: What is that.
Travis: Sleep.
Taliesin: You can meet me, slightly deranged, all weekend at Amazing Comic Con with a bunch of other Street Fighter kids, and it's going to be a great time, and be right next to the Library Bards. Bonnie Gordon, yeah yeah.
Matt: Yes, yes.
Taliesin: Yeah, be hanging with them.
Marisha: Oh, yeah, Library Bards. Nice.
Matt: Glorious.
Taliesin: Good times.
Matt: And if I recall, there was also a recent announcement of a cool Telltale game that went up this week.
Laura: Oh, man! Batman the Telltale series!
Travis: It's sweet. They announced the Batman cast and Laura is playing Catwoman Selina Kyle.
Laura: Yeah.
Marisha: Yeah, man.
Travis: I play District Attorney
Laura: Harvey Dent.
Travis: Harvey Dent.
Ashley: Ohhh.
Laura: It's pretty exciting.
Travis: We're gonna turn Gotham around.
Laura: And at E3 today, we went and checked out the demo and it's pretty frickin' cool.
Ashley: It's so good. I saw it yesterday and today because I just couldn't not watch it again.
Travis: It's gonna be fun.
Matt: All righty, anyone else have anything they want to talk about? (southern drawl) Or shall we dive into the rest of tonight's story?
Travis: Let's dive into the story.
Marisha: Let's dive.
Matt: (southern drawl) All righty. Let's go ahead and bring it down as we all prepare ourselves to begin to kick off tonight's episode of Critical Role. (spooky ethereal music) (heavy breathing) (roaring) (dramatic music) (gun firing) (dramatic music) (crackling flames)
Matt: Welcome back. So, picking up where we last left off last week. Vox Machina, the growing troop of heroic misfits, having recently felled their first recent member of the Chroma Conclave, Umbrasyl the Hope Devourer, as well as destroying the current incursion of the Herd of Storms in the city of Westruun. You met with the remaining people of the town and began to decide a plan for its continued existence and the recovery of those that were displaced in these recent conflicts. Part of this process was meeting an individual named Kerrek, who was a blacksmith who had been in the town for a while, who unwittingly became part of this discussion--
Marisha: My best friend.
Matt: (laughs) Grog had spoken with the remnants of the Herd of Storms that had essentially been disbanding from the name and moving west to join with the Rivermaw, which had stepped off from the herd not too long ago. You guys had a hot springs episode in the mansion.
Sam: (laughs)
Matt: Scanlan, you had made your way back to Kymal, in which you, along with the aid of a few of your friends, figured out a plan in which the people who had been displaced could eventually return to Westruun, and also found Kaylie and spoke with her, had your somewhat-tearful reunion there. You guys began to construct a subterranean portion of Westruun that would be protected from future dragon incursion, renovating and restructuring within the sewer system beneath the city. After this process was complete, you decided the next level of your trek, the next direction you would travel would be towards the far western, northwestern continent of Othanzia. Specifically, the city of Vasselheim that you all know so well. All of you guys stepping through a tree portal presented by Keyleth, you immediately step out into the snowy exterior of what seems like the outside of the Quad Roads in Vasselheim. And now, we see what your next plan of action is. What do you guys want to do?
Sam: (sighs) Light a fire.
Laura: What time is it? (laughs)
Marisha: Yeah, what time is it?
Matt: It's hard to tell right now with the cloud cover so thick in the sky, but you envision at this point in time, it's probably mid-afternoon or so. The general omniscient glow through the clouds, kind of diffused light, but based on the time that you-- where you were and how far you traveled, you gather it's probably early to mid-afternoon.
Sam: Well, you're the one who brought us here, Vax. Where would you like to go?
Liam: I need to go to the temple of the Raven Queen.
Sam: We'll come with you.
Laura: Let's go.
Taliesin: I know where that is.
Liam: I know that you all have a lot of errands to do. I don't need everyone to come.
Travis: We have a lot of errands to do?
Liam: I thought so. You mentioned...
Laura: My only errand is to keep my eyes on you.
Taliesin: I have some errands, if that makes anybody feel better. I have some errands to run.
Travis: Do you need any help with your errands?
Taliesin: Sure. Actually, yes. I would love some help with my errands.
Laura: Don't let him shop, Percy. Do not let him shop.
Taliesin: That shouldn't be a problem.
Travis: I don't know what that means, but I'm sure I take great offense.
Laura: (laughs)
Taliesin: You're getting smarter.
Travis: How effin' dare you.
Laura: That eagle form really made a difference.
Travis: I spit out a feather. (pthh)
Matt: So. Who's off to where?
Laura: Where is this Raven Queen's temple?
Liam: (sighs) We've not been here many times. Are we surrounded by people? Are there people walking about?
Matt: It is quite a busy time in the afternoon. There is actually a bit of hustle and bustle. Looking around, just a quick glance at your vicinity in Vasselheim, you can see a lot of the bastions are out in force. Many of them are in process of helping construct what looks like reinforced dragon-headed ballistae. Some of the ones you had seen towards the outside walls of the city. There are more being installed upon the inner walls, and the ones in the distance appear to be under some form of construction.
Taliesin: We have rooms. Why don't we go claim our rooms and I'm sure they can lead us to everywhere we need to go.
Liam: That makes sense.
Marisha: Want to go check in at the Slayer's Take?
Taliesin: And we can meet back there when everything is done.
Marisha: All right.
Laura: Do you need to check in at your temple, or should we pretend you're not here so they don't try to make you stay?
Ashley: Let's just pretend for a little bit.
Travis: Yeah.
Marisha: Okay.
Ashley: And then I'll check in later. There's no rush to get there. At least, that I know of right now.
Sam: God will wait for a long time.
Travis: All right. To the Slayer's Take, then?
Laura: Let's do it.
Taliesin: To the Slayer's Take.
Matt: All right. You guys continue further south into the Quad Roads until eventually you find yourselves at the Slayer's Take guildhall. The door is partially ajar already. It appears that somebody had left it open, but it is warm on the inside. You can see a fireplace hearth on the far back and to the right is already kind of filling the area with this subtle musty smoke smell, and the crackling of wood in the distance is a very welcoming sensation from the cold exterior of the city streets. As you enter, you do not see anybody at the front desk at the moment, but you do see a few other random individuals of the guild that have taken certain tables. Some are eating, and some are in the process of playing cards or passing the time. It seems to be a relatively casual day here at the Slayer's Take. But your rooms are still available, best as you need. Anything you specifically require in this place?
Laura: Can I grab one of the people that are here and ask him, What's all the hustle about outside? I see them installing more.
Matt: Okay. You go ahead and-- one of the guys closest to you, you've met him briefly in passing, his name is Loran. He has a completely bald head with a single stripe tattoo down the center. He has a very, very pointed long chin. Human, but he's probably been busted in the face a few times. You can see there's just scars and what appears to be bone structure that may have been reformed at times due to blunt trauma. But he's just sitting there, sharpening his weapons, just kind of doing good upon his own self, being prepared for anything. But as you come over to ask him the question, he looks up to you and goes, "Word's gone around the town recently that there's some wandering dragon horde tearing through Tal'Dorei, so they're just upping security around these places, just in case."
Laura: Smart.
Matt: "I hope so. Hope they make their way here."
Laura: Nobody's sighted the dragons, though, over here?
Matt: "Not to my knowledge, but (chuckles) I'd love to get my hand on some of them scales." (blade scrapes)
Marisha: What's your name?
Matt: "Loran."
Marisha: What?
Sam: What?
Marisha: Oran? What?
Matt: "Loran."
Marisha: Loran.
Matt: Because... that's what I remember.
Liam: Thought so. (laughter)
Liam: It took over 50 episodes for that to happen.
Laura: I'm sorry, what was the question?
Matt: Well, when you don't take notes when I give you a character's name originally, and they come back around and it's weird when you suddenly take damage and your character starts hemorrhaging.
Laura: Oh no. Loran. Loran was his name.
Liam: I was just eating an apple. Why am I dying?
Matt: (laughs)
Travis: Veiled threat.
Ashley: I'm just sitting by the fire, so.
Laura: Slayer's Take.
Marisha: So we have seen this guy before?
Matt: Some of you may have seen him in passing. You haven't really had a conversation with him. He just exists within the guild. There's many members that you've come across in the past.
Marisha: Sure, that exist.
Travis: Probably a dragon.
Laura: Pointy chin. Got it.
Ashley: Stripe on his head.
Travis: Nothing wrong with those.
Liam: How are the people doing? Is there a sense of worry, or do you guys feel pretty secure?
Matt: "As far as this town is concerned, it takes a lot more than a couple dragons to drop these walls. It's the reason it's been around for a long time, and I'd like to see them try."
Marisha: Have you ever encountered a dragon personally, Loran?
Matt: "I mean, I've come across a few small ilk in my days."
Marisha: Uh-huh. Sure. Yeah. Yep.
Sam: (laughs) Are you hazing Loran?
Marisha: Nope.
Laura: Keyleth is proud of herself because we've just killed our third, actually.
Matt: "Oh, that's fantastic. I love to hear it. You half-elves are a humble bunch." (laughter)
Travis: Fire! Put the flames out!
Marisha: Yeah, Team Half-Elf. Yeah!
Travis: Such a good burn.
Laura: Liam, I don't want to ask Matt this, but the chick that runs the Slayer's Take, her name's Vanessa?
All: Vanessa.
Sam: Cyndrian.
Liam: And her husband Merkin.
Sam: Mertin.
Matt: (laughs)
Laura: Are Vanessa and Merkin around?
Sam: Mertin.
Laura: Mertin.
Sam: Merkin is a different thing.
Matt: (laughs) Yeah, a very different thing. I guess it depends on if he shaved recently. He looks toward the back room, where her main office is, and he goes, "You're welcome to go ahead and knock on the door if you're feeling frisky."
Laura: Should we try to sell Vanessa some of our dragon bits?
Travis: We should sell to a merchant?
Laura: Well, they tend to be in the--
Taliesin: They may have a buyer.
Laura: Yeah.
Marisha: Yeah.
Travis: Love that you asked me that question.
Laura: I know, right? What was I thinking?
Travis: I don't know. (laughs)
Taliesin: Keep a few of the scales, obviously.
Travis: We can tell what my place in the party is.
Laura: Of course. Grog, come with me.
Marisha: Oh, wait, keep the teeth. Keep enough teeth for us.
Taliesin: We'll talk about the cold bag for now and see if there's anything else they want to talk about.
Marisha: I have an idea for teeth.
Laura: Can I go find Vanessa?
Matt: You go and knock on the door. (knocks) There's a brief pause. Knock again. (knocks)
Laura: (sing-song) Vanessa? Vox Machina here-- oh, hi.
Matt: The door (whoosh) swings open. You have to duck backwards. It (thump) slams onto the other side of the wall there, knocking a few knick-knacks that were on a nearby shelf over. And Vanessa swings out. "What? Who's calling-- ah. It has been some time. How nice of you to come and visit. May I... be of service to you?"
Laura: Oh, well, we were wondering if we could be of service to you. We happen to have acquired a great many dragon bits and we thought you might be in need of buying them for your sellers-- buyers. Your people.
Sam: Fencing them.
Laura: Fence-- you know.
Taliesin: I really thought you'd be better at this.
Matt: "There is no fencing."
Laura: No fencing, no. No, you're--
Matt: "We run a legitimate business."
Laura: Legal buyers.
Matt: "Good. As was I hoping to hear this. Let me check my ledger." She turns around and goes back to her desk. Her tail flicks behind her as she steps over to her table, leans over. "(muttering) Ah!" Pulls one of the books. (blows) Starts thumbing through it. (mutters) "What color dragon?"
Laura: Black.
Matt: "Chromatic."
Sam: (quietly) Ancient.
Laura: Ancient black dragon.
Marisha: Yeah, you might have heard about him. Umbrasyl... (chuckles)
Sam: You're super salty today.
Travis: Tone it down two notches.
Matt: "There is currently no contract for a black dragon. I do have one up for a bronze or perhaps a white, but..."
Laura: Oh, white! Do we have any white bits left?
Travis: Yeah.
Ashley: We should have white from back in the day.
Laura: What, do you want scales or...
Matt: "Specifically hide. If there is white dragonhide?"
Travis: We have 60 pounds of--
Laura: That was the dragon we killed for you before, because we didn't bring the--
Taliesin: No, it was before that one.
Laura: No, but we killed one with Zahra. We killed a white dragon.
Matt: "That was for a different contract. This is for a newer one I came by."
Laura: We've killed four dragons?! Four fucking dragons. Go us.
Marisha: Yes, we have. Yes.
Travis: Excuse us while we reminisce, apparently.
Matt: "(deadpan) Yes, it is amazing. The things you've accomplished. I am blown away. But in light of your capabilities, I do not require anything black dragon. However, if a contract comes in, I know who to call. Hold onto that, because that would save you a trip."
Laura: All right.
Marisha: All right.
Taliesin: We do have some white scales left over, don't we?
Laura: Yes, I think so.
Travis: Yeah, we do. We have 60 pounds of scales.
Matt: "Is this hide or scales?"
Travis: Just scales. No hide, unfortunately.
Matt: "Well, I could definitely do a bit of business for you there. The hide would fetch more, but-- 60 pounds, you said?"
Travis: Yeah. 64, to be exact.
Laura: Of white dragon scales.
Matt: "64 of white dragon scales, okay."
Matt: "I would be willing to continue at least part of this contract for this applicant for... let's say... 4,500 gold pieces."
Laura: 5,000 gold pieces, I think is a fair price.
Matt: "This is not about bartering. This is what the contract says, my dear. This is beyond a situation of conversation. The paperwork is already signed."
Laura: What if we gave you less dragon scales? Would you have said less money?
Sam: That's typically how it works.
Taliesin: (laugh)
Marisha: (laugh)
Matt: "Vex'ahlia. My dear. My delightful little dragon-hating half-elf. We've been good to you. We've done many great things for you. You've done great things for us. This is a fantastic arrangement." (thud) She slams the book shut and sets it down. "But you have signed on with us, and the deal is to fulfill contracts as they are signed, as they are written, as they are agreed upon by the person. If you wish not to accept this contract, we can just wait until somebody else picks it up and goes out and fulfills this need at the price at which they are requesting for this. You're welcome to keep the scales."
Laura: I think we'll keep them and we'll sell them to other vendors, then.
Sam: Haven't we had them for years?
Taliesin: I have a thing I'm thinking about.
Matt: "See? Then it's easy for you to get rid of them. If they've been a problem for you, then I'm sure this would be easy."
Sam: Where are we going to sell these? The world's on fire!
Marisha: Okay, hang on. We know it's here. There aren't that many white dragons walking around--
Taliesin: Certainly not anymore.
Marisha: Certainly not anymore. We know it's here. Why don't we sleep on it. Think about it. If we're ever in a pinch for money, we can come back.
Travis: Yeah. Sounds good.
Laura: Vanessa, you're so kind.
Travis: Besides, I've been working on that dragon immunity potion.
Laura: I'm so sorry.
Matt: "That is all right. Goodbye." And she shoos you out.
Marisha: Oh, wait, Vanessa. Wait.
Matt: "Yes, other female half-elf?"
Marisha: That's me. Where's the temple of the Raven Queen?
Matt: "Oh, you're looking for the Duskmeadow. Raven's Crest." She points loosely outward, kind of southeast of the direction of the Slayer's Take guildhall. "It's kind of hard to miss. It's giant, black, ominous. (chuckles) You'll see it." And she bops your nose a little bit with her finger. "Now, please. Out of my office. I have work to get done."
Laura: Thank you, Vanessa.
Marisha: Okay, bye.
Sam: Thank you. Kord's strength to you.
Matt: "That does nothing for me." (slamming) Slams the door shut.
Laura: They were worth a lot more than what she was offering, just for the record. They are worth so much more.
Sam: To whom? We haven't ever sold them or come across anyone who wanted them before.
Taliesin: This is no reason to get rid of something for wholesale.
Laura: Well, we've not really tried. That doesn't mean we should just give them away.
Sam: We also are almost full in our Bag of Holding, might I remind you, and 64 pounds would free up quite some--
Laura: It's not 64 pounds.
Sam: It's 64 pounds.
Travis: It's 64.
Laura: Oh, it was 64 pounds. (groans)
Matt: (laughs)
Travis: Like I just told you.
Ashley: 64 pounds of scales.
Travis: But I could get rid of some other stuff.
Laura: Well, they're worth like 20,000 gold.
Sam: To whom?
Laura: You don't care.
Travis: We also have 15 cases of expensive-ass bottles of wine.
Taliesin: I'm just going to point out, since--
Liam: We should drink those.
Laura: We should drink those.
Marisha: We should drink those.
Taliesin: We should drink those, first of all. That is the only thing that makes sense. And I feel-- and I apologize if it seems like I say this a lot, but I do have a castle that we can drop things at, and we can leave them there, perhaps get back to them at a later date.
Marisha: To be fair, Percy, you do a lot to remind us to try not to forget that you're titled.
Sam: To be fair, have we ever gone back for something before, ever, in our entire travels?
Taliesin: Yes.
Sam: What?
Liam: We needn't stay here long. I don't think what I'm here for is going to take too long. I hope. We could go to Whitestone next.
Taliesin: Yes, drop everything off, create a little nest of what we need.
Laura: All right. Let's go find your queen.
Travis: (quietly) There is some gross shit in this bag. (laughter)
Taliesin: You found the troll dick, didn't you?
Laura: What do you have in there?
Travis: There are six basilisk eggs.
Laura: Are they still good?
Marisha: Those are probably bad.
Taliesin: Oh, I bet those have gone really bad.
Travis: I reach into the Bag of Holding and think about one basilisk egg.
Liam: I'm sure they smell like Grog.
Matt: You pull out a basilisk egg.
Taliesin: Do they just turn to stone?
Matt: It's roughly that size. It's a dull grayish-blue hint.
Liam: Sulfuric?
Travis: Can I get the smell?
Matt: It has a somewhat, very vague sulfurous scent on the outside of the egg.
Travis: I'll put it back in the bag.
Ashley: Oh, Vanessa!
Laura: We could make stink-bombs with it.
Marisha: Ooh.
Taliesin: Ooh.
Liam: Yeah, we could.
Marisha: Good idea. I like that.
Travis: All right. So what's next?
Laura: We go see the Raven Queen. You go see the Raven Queen and we wait outside.
Liam: I didn't say anything.
Laura: Uselessly.
Liam: I didn't say anything!
Taliesin: Is it in the direction where I have to go?
Matt: Where are you heading?
Taliesin: I need to resupply everything.
Matt: That's the opposite direction.
Taliesin: Okay.
Matt: You're heading to the Braving Grounds. They're heading to the Duskmeadow.
Travis: Oh! I like the sound of that. I'll go with you.
Taliesin: Yes, you will.
Sam: I'll come with you, as well.
Travis: Yeah, three! Who else? Any other takers while Vax goes and gets a tattoo?
Matt: (laughs)
Liam: Another tattoo?
Travis: Well, I thought that-- is that not what you're doing?
Laura: That's what he's doing, Grog.
Liam: It is. I'm getting a tattoo.
Ashley: Close. Something like that.
Liam: It will say "Phillip the Brave".
Travis: (gasps)
Liam: Across the small of my back.
Travis: Phillip. Full name, Phillip.
Taliesin: This is out of-- I don't know if this is going to be any help or anything, by the way, Vax, but just in case. I'm going to reach in and pull out the mask and hand it to Vax. Just in case.
Liam: (slowly) I don't know. Thank you.
Marisha: Percy?
Taliesin: Yes?
Marisha: Do you still have that raven's skull I gave you?
Taliesin: I do. We'll talk about that.
Marisha: All right.
Taliesin: But I've found in moments when I was feeling less than brave that pretending to be somebody else on occasion, even afterwards, can be helpful.
Liam: Is there anything left inside of this?
Taliesin: Just some spit.
Liam: That's wonderful.
Laura: (laughs)
Taliesin: And something that smells nice in the front that will help. It helps cleanse the air.
Liam: All right, Percival.
Taliesin: I don't know why. I'm feeling... what would be the word? Superstitious.
Marisha: Oh, I was going to say "giving."
Laura: She's ornery today.
Marisha: Sorry. Angry.
Taliesin: You know, I kind of like it.
Liam: You know. Enough chit-chat. Let's get this shit done.
Matt: All right.
Travis: All right.
Matt: So you three are going to the Braving Grounds. You four are going to the Duskmeadow.
Laura: We are.
Matt: Okay. All right, so. You three are making your way towards the Braving Grounds. Following suit after Percival, you make your way up not quite to the Trial Forge, which is where you had your last discussion and brief showdown with Earthbreaker Groon. Still seeing the large statue of Kord looming over the entirety of the realm. You can still see the large columns of dark smoke and soot coming out of the various forges, the various mining encampments, and a lot of the folks there that are working on different pieces of iron and metal. You, I assume, make your way to a very familiar abode. (laughs)
Taliesin: Of all the options of the world that you've given me...
Matt: All right. (laughter)
Taliesin: This is really your fault as much as it's mine.
Matt: You come up to the outside of a familiar hovel. Previously damaged, missing part of its roof. The roof is mostly repaired. You actually see two individuals are over the top of it, hammering pieces of wood into it. Not a very fine job, but definitely enough patchwork to keep the rain and snow from pouring in. The door is partially open as you approach.
Taliesin: (sighs heavily)
Sam: You might be blown up if you go in there.
Taliesin: I know.
Travis: Should we wait outside?
Taliesin: Let's just all be ginger. (louder) Hello? Victor, are you home? It's Percy.
Matt: Silence.
Sam: Want me to go in and investigate?
Taliesin: Hold on. (louder) Hello, you up there? Hello?
Matt: (hammering noises) "What?"
Taliesin: Where is the owner of this domicile?
Matt: "I don't know. I haven't seen him."
Taliesin: How long has he been gone for?
Matt: "(mutters) (louder) Couple of hours."
Sam: Oh, good. Not dead, then.
Travis: He's dead. (laughter)
Taliesin: Do you have any idea where he's been off to?
Matt: "I haven't seen him leave." (hammering noises)
Taliesin: Well, I'm going to pop in and check really quickly, just letting you know.
Matt: "Your funeral." (hammering noises)
Taliesin: I gingerly open the door. Can I check for traps?
Travis: Attaboy.
Matt: You may. Make an investigation check.
Travis: Yeah, we're standing right here.
Taliesin: Oh, yay, that's not that bad. Investigation? I never use that. 11. No, 12. 12.
Matt: 12, okay. (creak) You move the door open and kind of search the ground and the area before it and the actual frame of the door itself. No traps.
Taliesin: All right.
Matt: Glancing inside, though, you can see a little bit of light. It looks like there's a hooded lantern across the way and just a little bit of light is flickering and it's kind of going against the wall nearest to you, to your right, as you enter. The same familiar smell of fresh earth, really, really, really dry dust and a very familiar smell of explosive black powder material.
Taliesin: Oh, dear.
Sam: Is Victor in there?
Taliesin: No, I don't see anybody in here.
Sam: Well, should we just purchase what you need via the honor system and leave some coin behind?
Taliesin: He's not necessarily always a believer in coin. Sometimes he just wants some trade. Also, I need to talk to him about some personal issues.
Matt: (thud) You see off to the side, what you didn't initially notice as you entered, what appears to be a wooden trapdoor in the far corner that (thud).
Taliesin: Oh, sweet gods of Pelor!
Matt: (repeated thuds) And you notice that apparently something-- a large sack of some heavy material has rolled off a nearby table and is now currently holding the door down.
Taliesin: Okay.
Matt: You hear a muffled, "I'm inside!"
Taliesin: I'm going to go try and lift it.
Taliesin: (grunts)
Matt: You lift it up, set it off to the side. (boosh) "(coughing) What's going on? You trying to kill me?"
Taliesin: (laughs) No! Hello, Victor. I was just to give you money. You were stuck-- you had gotten stuck down-- what is down there?
Matt: "This is my mining building."
Sam: Your mine?
Taliesin: His Mayan building. Can you not understand simple English?
Matt: "Don't put things on top of the door. It makes it hard to get out!"
Sam: (whispering) Something's happened to him.
Taliesin: Are you all right?
Matt: "I'm okay!"
Taliesin: Are you sure?
Matt: "No, I've been locked down here for hours!"
Ashley: Oh no.
Taliesin: Grog, Scanlan? (stutters) Come on in, he's fine.
Matt: "Help me out!"
Matt: He raises his hands up. You can see now, where once was two, now is none. (sounds of dismay)
Matt: (grunts)
Liam: You have to build him a hand.
Taliesin: I know.
Matt: (grunts) "I can't wait all day, here!"
Sam: Grog, can you get him out, can you lift him up?
Taliesin: Grog, can you lift the poor--
Travis: All right, yeah.
Travis: I grab the stump and I pick him up into the air.
Matt: (screams)
Travis: I shake him a little bit.
Taliesin: I need him mostly intact.
Travis: Oh. So on the ground?
Taliesin: Treat him slightly better than you would treat a member of your own family.
Matt: "Don't shake me too hard."
Taliesin: More than slightly better. Much better.
Laura: Oh, don't shake him too hard-- I'm not there.
Travis: Oh. Gas.
Matt: "Sure."
Travis: I put him gently back on the ground.
Matt: "Thank you." He pats you on the head with his nub.
Sam: Ugh.
Matt: Goes over. You can see he's kind of bandaged. He goes over and then pulls the ladder up that he didn't use, closes the--
Travis: (laughing) The ladder he didn't use?
Matt: "Okay. So. What do you want?"
Taliesin: Well, I was hoping to buy a little bit more black powder from you, if possible, and I'm curious if you had anything else for sale, and I wanted to ask you a couple of questions, just about other customers again.
Matt: "That's a lot."
Taliesin: I know.
Matt: "I have powder."
Taliesin: You do.
Matt: "I can sell you more powder. Question one: yes. How much?"
Taliesin: One question?
Liam: First question.
Taliesin: First question. Has a one-armed lady, a one-handed lady, a doctor come by to purchase--
Matt: "Not a lady. I am an honorable man!"
Travis: Don't insult him.
Taliesin: I know.
Taliesin: And I would never insult your honor or preferences of any kind.
Matt: "Are you saying I'm pretty?"
Taliesin: Victor, I think you know how I feel about that, but you're a very attractive man, and--
Matt: "Your friend's hitting on me."
Travis: I know it.
Matt: "I'm taken."
Travis: He's taken.
Taliesin: Are you dating right now?
Matt: "No, I'm just taken."
Taliesin: Okay. (laughs) I can't. I'm sorry. I'm good.
Matt: "(shouting) How much?"
Taliesin: Well, I was going to offer, I was originally going to offer some gold if you like, but if you'd like, I could make you a tool you could use with your current predicament. Some sort of simple clawing mechanism for grasping, lifting, not getting caught in your mine.
Matt: "Maybe. Maybe. Maybe a trade? Maybe a claw?"
Taliesin: I love trade. Trade is brilliant.
Matt: "Build and bring. Build and bring, and we trade."
Taliesin: I would ask one other thing, if I am to do this for you.
Matt: "Oh, so many questions! Does he have questions, too? Does he have questions, too?!"
Sam: I do have a question, actually.
Taliesin: You have a question?
Sam: Yes, I do.
Travis: I don't, no. I don't have any questions. None.
Matt: (sighs) "I like him. What's your question?"
Sam: I'm just looking for a hat shop. Is there a hat shop around here?
Matt: (considering noise) And he starts pulling around from a pile of oiled rags and shit and he pulls up what looks like a small burlap sack that's torn somewhat at the opening. "Hat."
Sam: Oh, god. Ugh. All right, thank you. Thank you.
Matt: "My pleasure. Happy to help." (chuckles)
Sam: Okay.
Taliesin: That was everything I could have hoped for, and more.
Matt: "Don't get near the fire."
Taliesin: Really, don't.
Sam: Thank you.
Taliesin: Has Dr. Ripley-- has a woman come by to buy black powder, one hand, one mechanical hand, one normal hand? Mechanical hand?
Matt: "Is that the one you're saying you can make?"
Taliesin: I'm going to make you something, nice and useful claw piece, yes.
Matt: "So you're saying that this woman made a better hand than you can make?"
Taliesin: No, I can make a better hand.
Matt: "Then make me a better hand! Why would you give me a lesser hand?!"
Taliesin: You're going to need to give me quite a bit of black powder for that. And more questions.
Travis: Ooh.
Matt: "Really?" (laughter)
Matt: "I've had a bad day."
Taliesin: Is that recent?
Sam: That happened today?
Taliesin: It doesn't look that recent.
Matt: (ripping sounds) He starts unwrapping the wound.
Taliesin: Oh, that's recent. That's wet. That's very wet.
Matt: It's pretty recent.
Taliesin: I can work with that. I can work with that. I'm going to go construct you something that will be perfect for your needs. I have a great idea. I will need another hogshead and a half of black powder and a little information about another customer and then I will leave you to your work. Is that fair?
Matt: "Fair!" He turns around, rushes over, and grabs the same phantom hogshead that he has lying around his place.
Taliesin: He eats a lot of pork.
Matt: Before he fills it with powder, he goes over to Scanlan and goes, "(hums) Too big."
Travis: Good hat.
Matt: Fills it with black powder, carefully brings it over, holding it under his arm. (grunts)
Taliesin: Thank you. (grunts) I will put this in something reasonable. I'll be back in just a little bit with-- actually, do you have a glove that you used to wear, or anything like that? Do you have something?
Matt: "Yes!" He pulls out the glove that was on the hand, (laughing) and you can see that it's blown apart, hand burned to cinders--
Taliesin: I can take measurements from that.
Matt: It's more a sleeve with a charcoaled edge.
Taliesin: I'm going to be busy. Can you cast the--
Sam: No, but Keyleth can, and I think that would save you a lot of time.
Marisha: I'm not here.
Taliesin: She's not here.
Sam: No, but we can go get her and come back.
Taliesin: To?
Sam: To just fix his hand.
Taliesin: I don't think she can just fix his hand.
Sam: Someone can restore something. Maybe Pike can.
Marisha: I can. Not today, but I can over time.
Travis: Want me to give it a try?
Taliesin: While I'm tempted-- would you just-- I feel like I made a deal. I'm just going to have to see to it.
Sam: I think he would prefer a real hand than a claw hand.
Taliesin: Would you prefer a real hand or a claw hand?
Matt: "Depends. How cool is the claw hand?"
Travis: (laugh)
Sam: (laugh)
Taliesin: That's what I thought.
Sam: I would much rather you spend time on projects for us than projects for him.
Taliesin: This is projects for us.
Travis: I vote for the claw. It's pretty cool.
Taliesin: And believe me, I would like--
Matt: "Cooler than that lady's hand?"
Taliesin: Keeping him happy is pertinent. I can make this myself, it's just very difficult.
Sam: We have party members who can regrow his hand.
Travis: Hey, Percy.
Taliesin: Yes?
Travis: He wants the claw to be cooler than that lady's claw hand.
Taliesin: That's very easy to do. She has no aesthetics whatsoever.
Travis: All right. Then eff the old original hand. Let's give him a reasonable claw, yeah?
Taliesin: Don't worry about it.
Sam: All right.
Taliesin: It'll be fine. And if you can't do the mansion, I know where I can go get some work done.
Sam: Oh, you want me to make-- we have the Slayer's Take. They have a workshop, don't they?
Taliesin: If not, I know where I can work on something. I will be back. I will not leave town before I've delivered to you something--
Matt: "(squawks)" He takes the hogshead.
Taliesin: Oh! Absolutely fair.
Matt: "Trade when you bring hand."
Taliesin: Yes, of course.
Matt: "Then I deliver with new hand. Then all is well."
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: "No more questions!"
Taliesin: No. That's fine. We'll be back! It'll be good.
Matt: "You're small."
Sam: I need a big hat.
Matt: "Can't help you, sorry."
Sam: All right.
Taliesin: Are we going to go find a hat shop, then?
Sam: Maybe, if we pass one.
Taliesin: All right. We will be back. Stay safe.
Matt: "Okay. Don't touch the door, please!"
Taliesin: Yes. No. Just. We'll be back. Bye!
Taliesin: I'm going to go find a workshop to work on something.
Travis: I like you. We'll see you later.
Matt: "(chuckles) He’s big."
Travis: (chuckles)
Taliesin: And I'm just right. It's... a thing.
Matt: "I'm undecided about you."
Taliesin: You're not alone. I'm going to go see if the Slayer's Take has--
Sam: We're going to leave.
Taliesin: I cannot handle any more of that. That was brutal.
Sam: Too good.
Travis: I feel like you’re just on a higher level.
Ashley: Right?
Laura: So much.
Laura: I just thought you were going to make him not there so you didn't have to do it.
Matt: No no no.
Marisha: Yeah, yeah yeah. He's just not home. Sorry, guys.
Ashley: Oh, I love him.
Marisha: Victor's on vacation.
Taliesin: So, I'm going to go see if there's-- if there's not a blacksmithing, if there's not somewhere I can do a bit of basic smithing work and technical work, then I'm going to go find that blacksmith from last time.
Matt: There's basic materials to do essentially weapon repairs, armor repairs, minor armor construction within the Slayer's Take. If you want something that's going to be a little more to the level of what you're doing, you may have to actually rent out a facility.
Taliesin: Well, I'm going to go find that young chap from before.
Matt: Okay. Yeah, easy enough to do. If you want to rent the forge for the day to craft whatever it is you're looking to craft, he's charging you 50 gold for the day.
Taliesin: 50 gold for the day? Can I use all of his tools and just my own materials?
Matt: You have to supply your own material, but he'll let you rent.
Taliesin: I'm going to run and find Vax, get my stuff, and go to work.
Matt: Okay. You guys. You four make your way over towards the Duskmeadow.
Laura: Trinket's out.
Matt: Trinket's out? (whoosh) (bear moans)
Laura: Come on, Trinket.
Matt: (grunts) He rolls his head against you, licks the side of your face, happy to be out of that stuffy little necklace. You make your way towards the Duskmeadow, which you've seen before. It's a very comparatively... glum-looking area of the town, hence the name that accompanies it, but this is the area of the city that contains the Raven's Crest, the Amaranthine Oubliette. It also contains the entire town's catacombs. This is where, since this town's existence, all of the dead are interred perpetually deeper and deeper and deeper beneath this part of the city. Also one of the oldest libraries of the city is kept here as well. As you approach the outskirts-- and you can see a very fine line between this area and the Birth Heart, which is the Melora section of the city. There is a very, very wide river divide between the two of them and it's like night and day, back and back. Very, very, very directly between the two of them. You can see on Melora's side there's just stalks and stalks of corn and other vegetation that's being grown for food. There's almost like a lush forest that curls around the outside of it that doesn't match the rest of the indigenous trees you've seen in this area of Othanzia. The entire Birth Heart area, where this temple to Melora is, is just this plucked-out-of-nowhere section placed into it. And then you move over to the Duskmeadow and it's just... like the color has left the vicinity. And there you see in the center of this part of the town, this large, looming, ominous obsidian and gold structure. It's like a giant black stone aerie. It has no intricacies from this distance that you can see. It's almost like a giant square building that is just devoid of light, with little glimmers of gold when the light catches it at moments. It's hard to miss and definitely stands as a centerpiece to this section of Vasselheim.
Liam: The whole walk over, I've been talking a lot, mostly to Trinket. You know, scratching him behind the ears, saying, "Buddy, you've been trapped in there a while. It's good to see you out."
Matt: "(moans, snuffles)"
Liam: Come hug your uncle. Come.
Laura: He doesn't mind it.
Liam: I'm sure he doesn't. I'm just happy to see him.
Matt: He presses his nose under yours and lifts your chin up and you bite your lip a little from the sudden impact from this very large bear, but it's all with love.
Liam: Yeah. It's cold. You're sure you don't want to go back in? Nah, you don't want to go back in. I know.
Marisha: (whispering) Hey, Pike.
Liam: Just nervous talking the whole way there.
Marisha: (whispering) I think Vax is talking to himself.
Ashley: (whispering) He's very nervous right now.
Ashley: This is a big deal.
Marisha: Yeah.
Ashley: This temple is very... it's lovely.
Marisha: It's gorgeous. It's very intimidating. Do you know anything about this? You've lived here for a while, Pike.
Ashley: I've never been by.
Marisha: Never been in?
Ashley: I've never been in, no.
Matt: You do know from your time here and what little you've heard that part of the purpose of this vicinity is not just to inter the dead within part of these catacombs. The library here is kind of a loose partnership between the people worshipers of her and those who follow Ioun. It is a center for knowledge and history kept within the city. But you'll see throughout the town and the landscaped outer wall that surrounds this entire portion of Vasselheim, there are repetitive glyphs that line this entire area. And from what you've heard, at the very least, most of these glyphs, which you see across the corners of roadways, and many of which surround the entrance to the catacombs, it is a perpetual enchantment that is to seal any sort of possible undeath. There once was a terrible scourge of undeath in this part of the landscape, long ago, that corresponded with a battle hundreds of years ago, and since then, the reinforcement has been put in place to prevent that from happening again. So the downside is that the power of these glyphs that prevent undeath also prevent any actual vegetation from existing in this area as well. So all the ground that you've come across: no grass, no natural vegetation. It's just dirt and ash and dust.
Marisha: Can we recognize the language in which the runes come from?
Matt: The magic itself is divine in nature, but it's based in the same very, very base Draconic glyphs that a lot of arcane magic is based on. It's very-- it's old magic.
Ashley: (laughs) It's old.
Matt: Yeah. It's based in some sort of divine ritual.
Marisha: What did you say the name was of the Raven Queen's temple, again?
Matt: The temple itself is referred to as Raven's Crest.
Marisha: Raven's Crest?
Matt: Raven's Crest, yes.
Marisha: Okay.
Ashley: How are you feeling, Vax?
Liam: I'm all right. I'm just going to talk to my sister for a minute.
Ashley: Okay.
Liam: You know, I know you want to-- I know you. I know you want to be here.
Laura: I know you don't want me to come.
Liam: I don't. I really don't.
Laura: I know. And I won't, if you're sure. I put you in this place and I feel terrible about it and I know you're extremely nervous. Trinket can sense it, too. He's very in tune with those emotions. And I just--
Liam: Listen to me. You did not put me in this place. No one put me in this place.
Liam: And everything's going to be fine.
Laura: Everything will be fine!
Liam: And I tug her sleeves and make them a little more orderly and I move a bit of hair out of her face and I do a button that's not done.
Laura: (laughs)
Liam: Everything's going to be fine.
Laura: I wanted it unbuttoned, actually.
Liam: That's all right. Just wait here I'll be out in a bit, all right?
Laura: Yes.
Liam: Everything's fine.
Laura: I know. Everything's fine.
Liam: Yeah.
Laura: You don't need to be nervous, either.
Liam: I'm not.
Laura: I will be here waiting for you when you come out.
Liam: I know. I'll see you--
Laura: I love you.
Liam: You know I love you, too.
Laura: I'm proud of you, you know. She's just going to love you so much. And who knows, you might have a new girlfriend when you come out. (laughs nervously, sighs) I've heard other people have dated gods before. I've heard it's done. That Cashew guy. Anyway.
Liam: You're going to wait here for me, right?
Laura: I'll be right here.
Liam: And then I drop the smile as I walk off towards the other two.
Matt: Okay. Which, as you turn and look, when you originally approached the stairs that lead up to the entrance of this large structure, it was just empty, doors closed. There was no guard post on the outside. It was just these two looming, almost dark glass-type doors about 12 feet tall and about 8 feet wide on each side that are just locked shut. As soon as you turn to walk towards them, the doors open and you see a figure standing there at the door, just looking directly at you. Or at least you assume is looking right at you. It's hard to see. This individual, somewhat lithe in physicality, is wearing long, dark robes and their face is shrouded in opaque black cloth, like a death shroud that just blocks the entire face. You can see the hint of a jawline, a nose. It looks to be a person of some background in there, but they're just standing there, watching you. And as soon as you react to their appearance, the hand just beckons quietly.
Liam: Were you expecting me? All right. I've brought a couple of friends. Is that permissible here? They'll keep quiet.
Marisha: I turn to Vex.
Laura: Keep him safe.
Marisha: I swear to you. We're all coming out of here alive.
Laura: I know.
Marisha: But if like an hour passes and we don't, maybe come in? But we're all coming out of here alive, so don't worry about it. It's fine.
Ashley: And I squeeze her hand. I'll make sure he gets out okay. I promise.
Laura: All right.
Ashley: Okay. Please be safe.
Laura: It'll be fine.
Ashley: It'll be fine. Yes.
Laura: I'll just be right here. Waiting here with Trinket.
Ashley: Okay.
Laura: Just calmly leaning against a wall. No big deal.
Ashley: Okay.
Marisha: We've faced way more terrifying things than a few albeit creepy men in robes.
Laura: I don't even think she's that bad. She's not going to be bad.
Liam: Guys.
Laura: Just go.
Ashley: Okay. We'll go. We'll go in with you.
Matt: All right. As you step up to the stairs, the figure leads you all inside, and as you step into the main center of this initial walkway chamber, the figure doesn't enter with you. It just closes the door behind you. (echoing thud) You can feel the hint of vibration of impact as the doors close shut.
Marisha: It's dark?
Matt: It's lowly-lit on the inside, and it's interesting. From the outside, it looks like a black, solid, impossible-to-see-through building. From the inside, you can actually look out and the entire building is made of this glass, this somewhat-warped, dark glass. And you can see almost the entirety of the outside from your position. The doors are held aloft into it. It's like a one-way type enchantment, or the construct, the material itself, is somewhat translucent from this side.
Marisha: Like an interrogation room? Like one-way mirror type of thing?
Matt: Kind of. Or like a very, very dark pair of sunglasses, but made of naturally-formed rock, almost.
Liam: Noticing that, I turn and just sort of look at my sister for 5 or 10 more seconds.
Matt: She doesn't see you and she just stands there quietly, looking around, inspecting the vicinity. Pets Trinket a little.
Liam: (hesitantly) Let's do this.
Sam: (chuckles)
Ashley: Do I feel anything, being in here?
Matt: You just feel a natural tremble stepping into a place of powerful divine influence that is not the warm comfort of Sarenrae, which has protected you before. Now, you understand the way many deities work in these lands, and your place in it, and Sarenrae's place in it, and you know enough about the Raven Queen to know that this is not an unwelcome place, per se. Go ahead and roll a religion check.
Ashley: 23.
Matt: 23. You understand the Raven Queen has also not always been the one who holds sway over the domain of death, the domain of winter, the domain of fate. Once mortal, the Raven Queen ascended as, essentially, a follower and a partner to the previous god of death, which his name has been erased from the books. This mortal ascended many, many years ago, pre-Second Spark, and has since taken what was once a tyrannical position of death and afterlife and souls and took it instead as the natural transition that it is. However, due to a lack of respect, or at least, a lack of, for lack of a better term, belief or trust from the other gods, she only gained dominion over the actual moment of transition, not of the actual souls of the afterlife. That influence was given to others. But the Raven Queen represents one of the most feared elements of life, which is the end of it, but you also know that that is a natural thing. Your personal belief is up to you. The sense you get here is that... being an individual that worships life, that worships redemption, that worships second chances, you can't help but swallow a little hard at the idea of a god that's purpose is to make sure that if you're destined to have once chance, it stays one chance.
Ashley: Okay.
Matt: As you begin to walk down this hall, ever so slow as it is, each footfall deafening in the clack. (clicking footsteps) The hallway leads on for another hundred feet or so before the glass, somewhat translucent material shifts into the next chamber, into an almost deep gray and ivory ice-like interior. The dark, coal-black exterior you've seen now transitions into what feels like a very finely-carved piece of architecture from ice and bone.
Marisha: Do I get the sense as a druid, as an Ashari, that we've switched into another plane?
Matt: Go ahead and roll an arcana check, as this is not so much a nature-based thing, yeah.
Marisha: Oh! I rolled a 19. (laughs) 21.
Liam: Oh dear, oh my.
Laura: Oh gosh, oh jeez.
Marisha: Oh goodness gracious.
Matt: From your understanding of transitional magic between planes, there has been no actual shift between planes, it's just the material itself is different upon the interior of this building. As soon as you enter this place, you do see another figure walking towards you. Similar long, dark robes. However, the veil has been pulled back, and you see before you what looks to be an older elven woman with very, very bright silver hair that just kind of falls long, past her shoulders, down to her back about mid-waist, or down to the bottom of her waist. With a smile. You can see as she walks towards you, a very welcoming grin. As she approaches, she pays very little mind to you three, but directly to you, says,
Laura: (whispers) I'm not there.
Matt: "You walk with Her sight on you. You are ever welcome here."
Liam: I've come to understand my place in Her sight.
Matt: "Then I think, perhaps, you are here for communion. Come. Our most sacred chamber. The communion pool awaits. Only you may have entry, unfortunately."
Liam: Right.
Liam: I plant a kiss on the cheek of each of the women.
Marisha: Do you need anything before you go in? Any enhancement of any kind?
Liam: Just cross your fingers for me, okay?
Marisha: Okay. I just kind of squeeze his hand.
Ashley: Same. Be careful.
Marisha: We're right out here on the other side of this door. If anything terrible happens, you have the earpiece. No one will stop Pike and I from getting through there if something terrible goes wrong. Rules be damned.
Liam: I made my bed. Now I gotta lie in it. I'll see you soon. I follow.
Matt: "Come, champion. The Lady of Fates awaits." And she turns around and leads you 30 more feet to what looks to be an ascending staircase that just enters up and out of the sight of you two.
Ashley: We'll just hang out, yeah?
Marisha: I guess we'll wait, yeah.
Matt: You ascend a few feet behind her, about 40 or so feet, until it comes to a single large doorway of deep, deep dark oak wood with what looks to be a dark iron ring in the center. As she steps up to it, she takes it and (thud) knocks on it twice. (deep creak) It just shifts open and leads into a central chamber now that looks about a hundred feet high, and it is a large steepled dome of what looks to be nothing but stained glass. It's awe-inspiring. It's beautiful: the colors, the light as it peeks through. The source of light, diffused as it is by the clouds, is sourceless in here. It seems like there are beams of light coming from all directions and all the colors are just strewn across the floor in what looks like this perpetually-shifting kaleidoscope of dots of reds and blues and purples and yellows and pinks and whites. You can see, across the room, there are three other figures that are all dressed in the same dark robes, the veils over their heads, of varying size. You can't make out what their racial background is, per se, but they are all stationed around the center of the room, in which lies, from what you can see, a very, very large round pool of some sort of deep crimson liquid.
Liam: I have come to pay a debt, and I do so gladly and without question. What would you have of me?
Matt: "You came to speak with the Lady. Well, the way is before you." She gestures to the pool.
Liam: I walk slow and straight in.
Matt: You step into it. (squelch) It comes up to your ankles, to your knees. And what catches you first is that the liquid is very thick. It is viscous in a familiar way. This is most definitively a pool of blood. And it is cold. It is ice-cold. As you step in, you can feel that as it begins to seep into your boots and begins to find its way into the crevices of your outfit as you get down into your waist, it's just chilling. You can't help but to stand up straight as you step further in, not quite sure of how deep it gets. And it gets deeper. And deeper. Up past your chest, up past your shoulders, and you're not even halfway into the center of the pool before it's going past your nose.
Liam: I keep going.
Matt: You take your last breath, hold it, and submerge yourself in the pool. Darkness around you, the cold sensation. Nothing... Nothing... Nothing...
Liam: I open my mouth and inhale.
Matt: As you do, you feel the blood fill your lungs and immediately your lungs begin to seize with the lack of oxygen. You instinctually begin to reach up for the water and pull, but you can't rise. You can't get up. And at that point, the cold, piercing pain of the liquid in your lungs becomes warm. All the liquid around you becomes warm. And in the darkness, where you cannot see, you calm, as suddenly your breathing is no longer difficult. It's natural. It's like air. And it's reminiscent of being in the womb, of the moment of birth you'd forgotten so long ago, that you're just surrounded in darkness and comfort. And piercing the center of this darkness before you, you see a very faint bead of white light just begin to spark and grow, and grow, and as that light widens out, it becomes a face. A porcelain face. A nose, lips, a chin, empty dark sockets, long dark hair that goes to crimson and surrounds you. You see a small hand reach up behind and lift you from your legs. And for what you thought was only a few feet of liquid, you look around you and it is an endless space, a space you've been before, a space that you once visited in your sleep, in your dreams. You look down below and you can see the infinite skein of threads that you were once given inspection to. As you look down, you see the very palm of the Raven Queen holding you aloft in this space as the mask pulls in close to you with a smile. The lips don't move, but you hear a voice from all directions in your head. A comforting voice. A welcoming voice. "My champion. Vax'ildan. You've come to me at last."
Liam: This was always supposed to happen, wasn't it?
Matt: "There is destiny, but you still guide your path where it must go. Especially you, fate-touched. You're one of the few that bends threads near and around you. That's why you're so interesting to me."
Liam: (haltingly) I give myself willingly to you for the bargain that was struck, although I question if the bargain was just the surface reason for this to happen.
Matt: "When one such as your... unique essence walks these realms, do not think I am the only one to take interest. And do not think you are the only one, either. But I was there to seize the opportunity when it arose, and as such, you are now mine. And I know that you hate me. I know that you fear me. Most do. But only because they are without understanding. Without death, life has no meaning. Finality drives change, innovation, greatness. It is the end that I bring that drives all of your gracious creations of this land to make the world better than we did, than those before me did."
Liam: I would learn your ways. I will learn your purpose. And I will serve.
Matt: "Then understand the wholeness of what it is you serve and what you represent, champion. Even after death, the soul is carried to another purpose, but it is that transition where it is at its most vulnerable. It is my charge, my gift-- your gift, now-- to safeguard that beautiful moment. There are those that find the immortal soul one of the most pure and powerful means of energy, of sourced power, in this world. That is an abomination. There are those that wish to halt the process and live eternally in some form of undeath or the other. That is an abomination. There is also a difference between bending your thread around destiny, fate-touched, and perverting the thread entirely, for death is sacred. But not all deaths are destined, in that moment. Some destinies require one to endure beyond the moment. To meet that moment many times before the final death is to come. We must guide these moments across this web." And as she sweeps her hand out. Where she holds you in one palm, another hand reaches out, and the entire web of threads just glows below you in this curling wave out into infinity, into the horizons, endless, to each side of you and beyond. "So, to bend destiny, to bend these fates, is within our sphere of influence. It's those that find a way to cheat this destiny, halt the progression, corrupt their thread to the point it sickens those around them. Undeath, wayward necromancy. Perversion of the sanctity of the cycle, of our very domain, is an atrocity and must be stopped and stamped out. That is our cause. Your cause, now. Do you still accept this gift?"
Liam: (whispering) I do.
Matt: "You, Vax'ildan. I've had my eye on you for some time." And the smile curls into this much wider smile. To the point it seems somewhat perturbing. "Your dual nature: rushing prematurely towards your end, wantonly throwing your life before the flames, only to pull away in those last moments. Instinct. You test your path constantly, without knowing you've been preparing for this mantle your entire life. My beautiful champion." The smile subsides. The face goes stone. Lack of expression. Blank. The hand pulls back and you now can see the full immensity of her size. Her body infinitely long, looking down before it disappears into darkness. And as you look up, suddenly the mask is there before you, but normal, human-sized. You're no longer in her hand. You're standing on a floor, a floor of the same white, ice-bone type substance that the interior of Raven's Crest seems to be built from. And for a brief moment, you see before you the woman before the god, the ascended mortal, no larger than you. From the hair that topples down the sides, the hand reaches up and grabs the mask and pulls it away. Beneath the mask you see a very beautiful, very sad-looking woman. But her eyes are cold and red in the iris. Her skin flawless and smooth. White, pale, sunless. Her brows thinned and furrowed. She steps forward and touches the side of your face. "There are those who will be frightened of you. But know what we do is one of the most important gifts of all." And she grabs your head, pulls you down, and kisses you on the forehead. At which point, suddenly your lungs fill once again with searing white pain. You find yourself scrambling about, instinctually spilling out liquid all around you, and you finally (coughs) come out on top of the communion pool. Your eyes open and you can see just red crimson pouring in your vision. You rub it out and you're in the chamber alone. Eyes wide, swimming around, you can see the figures on the side come to the edges. They all bow. The figure that led you in stands at the mouth of this pool where you entered. She's smiling. She has her hand extended.
Liam: I take it.
Matt: She lifts you out of the pool. One of the other figures runs up and takes one of the dark robes that they have and pulls it off around them, revealing just a simple dark blue and black outfit beneath. Still wearing the veil, but wraps the dark robe around you as the liquid is now back to its freezing cold sensation. Your teeth are chattering. They lead you back to the door you entered, down the stairs, and into the central chamber where both Keyleth and Pike await. You guys turn and see, descending the stairs, being flanked, essentially, by two of the members of the Raven's Crest, both of the shoulders with the dark robe wrapped around a very cold and somewhat freaked-out looking Vax'ildan, who has smeared red across his face. His hair is thick with viscous crimson liquid.
Ashley: I run over. You okay?
Marisha: I stand at the bottom of the stairs and I watch.
Liam: (hoarsely) I got answers in there, but they led to more questions. What am I to do with those questions?
Matt: The woman who had led you in there smiles and says, "That is the nature of death. We can't have all the answers, my friend. It is the pursuit of those answers that drives us. Do you trust Her?"
Liam: I do.
Matt: "Then perhaps you'll find those answers one day."
Liam: Thank you.
Matt: "Thank you." They pull the robe off and they all head back up into the chamber, leaving you all there in the room alone.
Marisha: I walk over.
Ashley: (whispering) I'm just going to stay where he is.
Liam: I'm shell-shocked.
Marisha: You look well.
Liam: It's going to be good.
Marisha: What did she say to you? Did she speak to you at all?
Liam: (whispering) Yeah.
Marisha: (shocked laugh)
Liam: Do you speak?
Ashley: Yes?
Liam: To her?
Ashley: Sometimes.
Liam: Do you understand?
Ashley: I don't think any of us can fully understand. I think, if we did, then we would be gods.
Marisha: Do you believe?
Liam: Yeah. Yeah. I do. I don't know what... I don't know why, but... this was fate.
Marisha: Is that what she told you, that this was fate?
Liam: No. I know it here.
Marisha: Why?
Liam: Everything has led to it. You and I wouldn't be standing here if my sister hadn't stolen a broom. Where's the sense in that? What else is it? I teleported into the stomach of a dragon with a gnome and I am still standing here. If it is not fate, what is it?
Marisha: I don't know. As someone who is constantly questioning mine, I don't think I'm the right person to ask. But I do know one thing-- and I grab his hands-- you were amazing and talented and special way before she found you. If anything, we can call her a god. We can also call her a great opportunist. She didn't give you anything special. The Vax that I see before me right now is no different than the Vax that I saw before me ten minutes ago. I'm not saying that what you experienced wasn't real and true. I believe you whole-heartedly.
Liam: This is real. This was meant to be. And I am on board.
Marisha: Is it what was meant to be or what you just really wanted? And it found you?
Liam: (disbelieving laughter) It is not what I wanted. Thank you. Thank you. I need to see my sister. And I head off towards the exit.
Matt: You guys make your way to the outside of Raven's Crest. The doors open once again. The figure that let you in is waiting for you, opens the door. As you see the doors open--
Laura: I jump up immediately. I've bitten off all my fingernails.
Matt: (laughs) Rushing down the stairs, you see Pike, Keyleth, and your brother in a little better spirits than when he first entered, if a little damper and redder.
Laura: Is that blood? Is that blood all over you? Did she hurt you?
Liam: It was really weird, but it's fine. I told you I'd be fine, and I'm fine.
Laura: I get out a rag and I start wiping everything off. (laughs) You're alive, though.
Liam: (laughs) Yeah, doesn't make any sense, does it.
Laura: (laughing) Oh my god, are you stronger now? Are you so strong?
Liam: I think I might be a bit weaker, actually.
Laura: Oh, I don't believe it.
Liam: I have the jelly-legs.
Laura: (laughs) Do you want to ride Trinket for a while?
Liam: Could I?
Laura: Yes!
Liam: He's going to get sticky.
Laura: No, he loves the taste of blood.
Matt: (sad moaning)
Laura: (laughs) Oh, Trinket.
Matt: Trinket comes over and begrudgingly lowers himself so you can climb on.
Liam: No, don't lick. Don't lick.
Laura: He's very light. Scrawny, scrawny, scrawny.
Liam: But don't lick, Trink, please.
Matt: (grunts)
Ashley: Just one kiss? One little lick?
Laura: (laughs)
Liam: Later, buddy. Later.
Liam: I climb on top.
Laura: Aren't you glad you got out of the Pokeball for this?
Liam: I give a quick look back at my friends. and then I take a nap on Trinket.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: So everything's good, then. He's good? Everything's fine?
Ashley: I think so... I mean, it's-- it was very different, but that doesn't mean it's wrong.
Laura: He talked to her?
Marisha: He talked to her.
Laura: Were you there?
Ashley: No.
Marisha: They didn't let us in the room.
Laura: Oh. Well, I'll find out.
Marisha: We stood outside. He didn't talk much about it. Maybe you can find out more. All he said was that he knows that this was fate.
Laura: Well, good. He has a purpose.
Ashley: Yeah.
Marisha: Oh. Yeah. Well, that's one way of looking at it.
Liam: (snores)
Laura: I keep him steady and I walk next to him.
Matt: Okay. You guys eventually make your way back to the Slayer's Take. The three of you guys... what are you doing while this is transpiring?
Travis: Eating my mechanical pencil. (laughter)
Taliesin: I've sent him with a shopping list.
Matt: Okay. What have they been sent to acquire?
Taliesin: I'm going to need a cheap gauntlet, some saddling straps, three tankards, a pick-axe, and two clocks.
Matt: All right. How much gold do you give him?
Laura: You've got--
Taliesin: That's right, I've got.
Sam: Four gold.
Taliesin: (snorts) I give--
Laura: You've also got a five-pound bag of gems, don't forget.
Taliesin: I do. I give him--
Marisha: (giggles)
Taliesin: This is what happens.
Marisha: Is that Riegel?
Taliesin: That was Riegel.
Marisha: (giggles)
Taliesin: Don't read that. That's not necessary.
Sam: (singing) I drew a dick on his picture. (laughter)
Taliesin: And I need that man's dick to finish the arm.
Matt: That'll go over well.
Taliesin: Despite the dick on my page, I'm going to give Scanlan 100 gold to take with Grog to find some junk items that they can put together.
Sam: I'm going with Grog to shop? All right, sure.
Taliesin: If you're down.
Sam: Yeah. I'll do it. Yeah, we'll go for all that stuff. Do we find success?
Matt: I want you guys to go ahead and roll-- actually, for you, just roll a general charisma check to ask around and get people to give you the proper information.
Taliesin: I love you.
Sam: What is this, just charisma?
Matt: You just add your charisma modifier.
Sam: 18.
Matt: 18?
Matt: Yeah, within a very brief period of talking to the right people and smiling and getting folks to listen back to you, eventually you're given information on where each piece of that list is able to be found. They're not too crazy items. There's a lot in general stores, general armor--
Taliesin: I don't even need an articulated gauntlet. It just needs to be a clamp.
Matt: Yeah, just a basic clamp gauntlet.
Sam: Do we also find a hat store?
Travis: Yeah, we'd better.
Laura: You want another beret?
Matt: Not in the Braving Grounds, but you can definitely find one on your journey in the Quad Roads.
Sam: If I can take an extra side journey to find a hat shop, that would be great.
Matt: Do you go with him?
Travis: Fuck yeah.
Sam: It's just hats, Grog. We're just getting hats.
Matt: You guys make your way to the busy streets of the Quadroads. Eventually, asking around, you find yourself across from what is called the Sore Socket Haberdashery.
Sam: The Sore Socket?
Matt: Sore Socket Haberdashery.
Travis: I love it.
Sam: I love it.
Matt: And the picture outside has a caricature of a guy, smiling, with a giant black eye.
Sam: (laughs)
Matt: You walk inside and it's like a small, localized bar-- not a tavern by any means, but it has like one small set-up in there for just general beer, and just loads and loads of hats. Leathers, cloth, all kinds of silly circumstances. You see some nice fancy hats with big feather plumes. You see joking hats that have multiple colors and what looks to be bells hanging from them. As you step into the room, you see two other random individuals that are looking around, shopping, and at the far end, you see coming through a big thing of curtains what looks to be a rather rotund woman in her late 40s or so. Big curls in her dark brown hair and maybe a little too much makeup on her face, who goes, "Darlings, what are you looking for? What can I get you? Are you looking for hats?"
Sam: Oh, man.
Matt: "I assume you're looking for hats."
Sam: Wow. Yeah, we've come to the right place.
Travis: The guys are missing out on this one. (laughter)
Sam: Hi, ma'am. My name's Scanlan. This is Grog. We're just-- I needed one hat, but you have such a fantastic selection, maybe we'll pick up a few.
Sam: How much money do I have left over from his hundo?
Matt: After all those materials, I'd say probably, asking around and your high charisma, you probably have about 60.
Travis: Bro, we got money.
Sam: Let's get some hats!
Matt: "My name is Deidre, dear, so nice to meet you."
Sam: It's lovely to meet you.
Matt: "You're so adorable."
Sam: We've heard so much about this store.
Matt: "Really?"
Sam: Yes, far and wide.
Matt: "Oh ho, I can guarantee you, it's all true. And you, you're so big, you're so strapping."
Travis: I am.
Matt: "And that beard!"
Matt: She kind of tousles the beard with her fingers.
Matt: "(giggles)"
Travis: (giggles) Oh, stop it.
Laura: Little food bits fall out.
Sam: I'm here to buy just one quick thing in particular, then we'll be on our way. I just want a very tall hat. Just very tall black hat with a point.
Matt: "Tall. Proportionally tall or regular?"
Sam: Like a big triangle hat.
Matt: "Hmm."
Sam: With a wide brim. Like a wide black hat just like this.
Marisha: (laugh)
Travis: (laugh)
Matt: She thinks for a second. "I don't carry anything like that--"
Sam: All right, well, it was worth--
Matt: "But I can make you something if you don't mind waiting a bit."
Sam: I could come back for it another day, perhaps.
Matt: "Oh, but at least let me measure your head, sweetie."
Sam: It's not for me.
Matt: "Do you know the size of who it's intended for?"
Sam: Well, her head's a little bigger than mine.
Matt: "I'll make it adjustable! You have to pay half in advance, a custom order."
Sam: Sure, how much?
Matt: "That will be 10 gold now, and an additional 10 upon retrieval."
Sam: More than worth it. I'll take it.
Matt: "All right."
Sam: And also, can you get something for him that would really accentuate his features?
Travis: Me? What?
Sam: Yes, you need a hat.
Travis: Oh, this streamlined. This is how the look goes.
Sam: But if it rains, Grog.
Travis: But that's part of it. My muscles ripple in the moisture.
Matt: "Nothing to block the muscles, no, not at all, but I have to say, with a fine, smooth head, it does need a little decoration, if you don't mind me saying."
Travis: Oh. You think so?
Matt: "(chuckles) You!"
Sam: Something in a yarmulke, perhaps?
Matt: "I was thinking--" And she whips out what looks like this fancy engraved leather cap with two straps on the side and just (shoomf) right over your head. It kind of folds everything in, the straps just go very long and dangle there.
Laura: (laugh)
Ashley: (laugh)
Marisha: Yes! Yes!
Matt: She takes them and snaps them underneath to where these two little danglies are dangling from under the chin. And it just has these really intricate flower patterns punched into the leather all around.
Sam: I love it, Grog. I think you look great.
Travis: (stutters)
Sam: We don't have a mirror here?
Matt: "I think it speaks of the seasons."
Travis: Is it over my ears?
Marisha: Is it like one of those old-school leather helmets?
Matt: It looks almost like the old football helmets.
Marisha: Oh, football! Yeah. Okay! Cool.
Travis: I mean, I don't know, does it do anything?
Matt: "It looks masculine. You wouldn't believe. Here, let me show you!" And she brings up a small mirror.
Travis: (screams) (everyone else laughs)
Matt: "Exactly. Men will fear you walking down the road."
Travis: No, please, more like-- a bit more like war, death, battlefield. More aggressive. This is a bit more like sheep-herder.
Travis: Here you go.
Matt: "Well, all right."
Matt: "Death. Battle. Aggressive."
Sam: Maybe something with spikes?
Matt: "Spikes. Spikes... let me see what I can do."
Marisha: (laugh)
Laura: (laugh)
Ashley: (laugh)
Matt: And she runs off down the way, gets into a bag and you start hearing things going (tink, thud) something rolls over-- "Ah, shit!" Eventually she comes out. "This is less of a hat and more of a half-helmet, but maybe it'll do." And she pulls forth what looks like this very wide metal brim, almost in a swish shape to a point in the front.
Travis: (laughing) Conquistador's helmet?
Matt: Yeah, it kind of looks like a conquistador's helmet. But it's only the front, so it's almost like a rhinoceros horn that sticks up to a point.
Marisha: Yes.
Laura: Oh my god.
Matt: And the rest buckles to the back of the head, so it's a giant metallic groove for the front.
Travis: I'll take it. I don't even care if it fits.
Liam: (laugh)
Marisha: (laugh)
Matt: "Oh, that's what I like to hear."
Travis: How much is it?
Matt: "This will be 50 gold."
Laura: (gasps)
Travis: Is the point very sharp?
Matt: "Try it yourself."
Travis: And I reach up and I... hit it with my finger.
Matt: It's all right. It can be sharpened. It's more for decor. It's not meant to slice somebody in half.
Travis: Yeah, it could be sharpened?
Matt: "Well, I mean, what are you intending to do with this hat? (titters)"
Travis: Nothing, just look sharp. (groaning)
Matt: "I can do that for you, my big muscley man."
Liam: That is the very ceiling of intelligence of his.
Marisha: Yeah. (laughs)
Travis: Oh, see that sweet jam I just dropped there.
Sam: I did, that was a good line.
Travis: Write that in a notebook somewhere.
Taliesin: We'll be cleaning that off the floor for ages.
Matt: So after about five minutes or so, she grinds down with what materials she has to a little more-- it does mess with some of the polish on the very tip of the metal, but it does come to a more solid point. "Be careful with that."
Travis: So is it one piece or is there a strap on the back or it just goes (foonk)?
Matt: It goes on and then straps tight in the back to fit your head.
Travis: Beautiful.
Laura: It's basically like a unicorn?
Matt: Kind of.
Travis: Rhino.
Matt: It's like a big old rhino horn that curls upward to a point there.
Liam: Wow. Wow.
Matt: It looks a little ridiculous.
Marisha: I'm so excited for the art!
Travis: What do you think? Hold on. What do you think?
Sam: Wow. I mean, your silhouette is magnificent. Imposing.
Liam: Is this your variant fighting costume?
Ashley: Oh, boy.
Travis: Am I fearsome?
Sam: You are. You are. We should go to a silhouette artist after this and get something drawn for this.
Travis: They have those?
Sam: They do, they cut it out.
Travis: Milady, you are a master of your trade.
Ashley: Oh, boy.
Matt: "Well. So they tell me."
Sam: Our mom only gave us 60 gold to spend. Could you give us both hats for 60? We're brothers. (laughter)
Sam: Something went wrong with him at birth.
Matt: Make a deception check with disadvantage.
Sam: With disadvantage?!
Matt: Yes.
Liam: Doesn't matter.
Sam: Well, would a 1 be bad? (laughter)
Matt: Deidre goes, "(laughs) You silly, tiny man-- No, seriously. We have a price agreed upon. Pay it."
Travis: Yeah, no, I got it. I got 50 gold of my own.
Sam: All right. 20 from me, 50 from him. We'll take them both.
Matt: "Ooh, all up front? All right. It'll be ready for you shortly." She takes the coin. "Thank you for the patronage. Return here in about... ooh, an hour, and the hat shall be prepared for you, sir-- what's your name?"
Sam: My name's Scanlan Shorthalt.
Matt: "Scanlan Shorthalt. All right, come soon."
Sam: See you soon.
Travis: Can I hit my head on the doorway on the way out?
Matt: (shoomp)
Laura: (laugh)
Marisha: (laugh)
Matt: (creak) You have to kind of pull it out. Yeah. You leave a nice big groove.
Travis: It is nice, right?
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: Okay, good.
Matt: (laughs) All right, eventually you all gather again back at the hall of the Slayer's Take. You guys have just settled in and are free to continue any discussion you like as you see Scanlan and Grog come in. Say, you've since retrieved your hat with your various wonderfully-crafted accoutrements.
Travis: 'Sup, bitches.
Laura: Wow.
Sam: Look at that.
Ashley: Whoa.
Travis: What happened?
Sam: Look at that.
Ashley: (gasps) Ohh...
Travis: I know, right? Wait for it.
Liam: (laughs)
Laura: Whoa. Grog, you're so monstrous.
Ashley: What? Grog, that is so scary.
Marisha: That's like another 12 inches to you.
Travis: I know.
Marisha: You look so tall.
Travis: It, like, changes my whole battle strategy. I'm now literally the point of the spear.
Ashley: (gasps) You're so scary.
Taliesin: How have we lived with this idiot?
Travis: (laughs) I'm a sea monster!
Ashley: (roars)
Travis: I'm like the most wicked narwhal of all time! Give me a pool! (laughs)
Ashley: Can I try it on?
Travis: Yeah, you want to?
Travis: (laughing) I put it on Pike's head.
Ashley: Whoa, it's so heavy. (all but Taliesin laugh)
Taliesin: What is the world coming to?
Travis: Is it as tall as she is?
Matt: You can see the bottom of her mouth.
Ashley: Oh, Grog.
Travis: Oh, yeah, look. Wait, turn around 180 degrees and then run as fast as you can.
Marisha: Oh, yeah, go! Go! Go! Go, Pike! Go, go!
Laura: (clapping) Go, Pike! Go, Pike! Go, Pike!
Matt: Okay, make a perception check.
Taliesin: (groans)
All - taliesin: (laughs)
Ashley: 9.
Matt: 9. You go running straight out of the door--
Laura: No!
Matt: You guys are like, "Oh. No, Pike!" She's already out the door, over the stairs (repeated thuds), outside of the hall. (sounds of dismay)
Travis: Oh no!
Laura: Oh no!
Ashley: I'm okay!
Matt: You guys rush out to go catch her and the helmet is actually embedded partway into the ground and she's kind of--
Marisha: Yeah!
Matt: And she's just laughing.
Ashley: (laughing) Grog, get me out of this helmet.
Travis: I pick her up by the feet.
Travis: That was excellent. (giggles)
Ashley: As he's holding me up like that I try to stab him with it.
Travis: I yank it off of her head and put her back on the ground.
Liam: Vax has been laughing hysterically, giggle fits, clutching his ribs the entire time. And then is there any of the staff here? Anyone that's here? Anyone else?
Matt: You haven't seen Mertin. Vanessa doesn't seem to have left.
Liam: What about underlings?
Matt: I mean, there are a few individuals here that are part of the guildhall. The hierarchy here is more like the few that run it, and then everyone else comes and goes as they please.
Liam: Yeah, yeah, come here, you. Do you have a tub? Do you have a bath? Look at me. Do you have a bath? I need a bath.
Matt: "You look pretty rough."
Liam: Yeah?
Matt: "Yeah. We could-- we got a washroom in the back, if you need it."
Liam: Is it hot? I feel like I need it to be hot.
Matt: "You get what you get. It's water, buddy."
Liam: Okay. That's perfect, thank you. Grog, put that hat on again.
Travis: Oh, yeah, hold on. (foomp)
Liam: (laughs hysterically)
Liam: All the way down the hall to take a bath.
Sam: It's crazy. Did you guys get him drunk or something?
Taliesin: I don't know what you people did, but...
Ashley: Well, he just...
Travis: People respond to fear differently.
Sam: I guess so.
Laura: He's gone insane.
Marisha: He might have saw the face of a god.
Sam: Whatever.
Travis: He did?
Marisha: Yeah.
Ashley: Yeah. The head of--
Travis: By the way, why is he covered in bloodbath?
Ashley: I think that was part of the--
Marisha: Ritual? Communion?
Ashley: Getting to know his new god.
Travis: Did he kill a lot of people?
Ashley: Maybe he had to. I don't know.
Travis: He did?
Laura: So many, Grog.
Travis: Oh my god.
Laura: Yeah. It was a giant battle.
Travis: Like, how many on two hands?
Laura: Like at least this many.
Travis: That's a legendary amount.
Laura: That's more than six.
Laura: I know.
Ashley: Yeah.
Liam: Somewhere deep in the building, far away:
Liam: This is not hot!
Matt: The gruff individual chuckles. "Heh. It never is." I need you to make a tinkering check.
Taliesin: Okay. I'm sitting with my tea and my tools, trying to ignore these people.
Laura: Can I heat water up in the fireplace?
Matt: Yeah, yeah, it'll take you a little while.
Taliesin: Please don't explode.
Sam: When I delivered the materials to him--
Taliesin: Oh, Jesus H. Fucking Christ.
Marisha: Oh no, Taliesin...
Sam: Could I have inspired him at all, when I delivered the materials?
Taliesin: Please.
Matt: Sure.
Sam: All right.
Marisha: Please inspire.
Sam: I will inspire-- oh my god, it's not even worth it.
Taliesin: (muffled) Please inspire. Do it. Do it, you bloody gnome!
Sam: Okay. So when I delivered everything, I just sang him a little song to inspire him. And I sang,
Sam: (singing) Percy's gun, won't you come and kill up all the dragons? (others join in) Percy's gun, won't you come, won't you come?
Ashley: Percy's gun! (laughter)
Liam: Percy's gun! (laughter)
Matt: Oh my god. All right, take your d10.
Laura: Ten! Ten! Ten!
Liam: Do it! Do it!
Marisha: Oh my god, it's a 10!
Taliesin: Better!
Sam: That was a 10.
Taliesin: Thank you.
Marisha: I get excited. Sorry.
Liam: Pretty good song.
Taliesin: Proficiency, tinkering, plus the--
Matt: Well, your proficiency is what you get with the roll and then it's your dex bonus.
Taliesin: Okay, so proficiency, dex, okay, thank you, god.
Taliesin: (muttering) That's 11...
Liam: (hums Black Hole Sun)
Taliesin: 23.
Matt: 23. What did you roll naturally?
Sam: A 2.
Taliesin: 2.
Liam: (laughs)
Laura: Whoa.
Sam: Plus 10.
Matt: Ah.
Taliesin: Plus 10.
Marisha: Plus 10.
Taliesin: Made it 12.
Matt: Wow. All righty.
Taliesin: It's not complicated, but I've got a good design, and it has two nifty things.
Matt: What are the nifty things?
Sam: Fingers.
Taliesin: It doesn't actually have fingers. It's a mitt piece, strap-on, it can lock the thumb and lock the hand so you can open it, lock, close it, lock. It's got little flip-locks.
Matt: Mm-hm.
Taliesin: You can detach the hand and put a pick spike on for mining. Like a mining punch.
Liam: Is it like Young Frankenstein? (mechanical sound effects)
Taliesin: It's more Dustin Hoffman "Hook", but, you know.
Marisha: Oh, sure.
Laura: Oh, that's nice.
Marisha: I was thinking Go-Go-Gadget Finger.
Taliesin: Because it's got the click, pull, click.
Matt: Right.
Taliesin: I can do it with all these things. I can graph it. So.
Matt: (laughs)
Taliesin: Reasonable. It's not pretty.
Matt: It takes you a few hours and gets you into the early parts of the evening, but you do manage to go ahead and complete it. You manage to get it finished up and you're pretty proud of your work, actually, and you feel-- the whistle you're still doing as you do the final bits, you realize is the song that Scanlan sang for you, just looping in your head. It happened to push you through your work and get your final piece completed.
Taliesin: I also carved a little message inside that will not matter unless it actually becomes pertinent.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: You don't get to know until you ask offscreen.
Sam: You don't know.
Laura: (laughs) Ohhh.
Matt: Okay. I'm excited. Okay.
Marisha: That's right, DM.
Travis: That never happens.
Matt: (laughs) Try me. Okay. Do you go and deliver it?
Taliesin: I do go and deliver it.
Matt: Okay. As the sun begins to set in Vasselheim, you make your way back over to the Braving Grounds, which as you look across, too, as the night goes dark, the Braving Grounds itself has a whole different life to it. There are so many forges and smelters going that there's-- most buildings have this bright orange glow through the ceiling and these various openings where fumes and smoke and exhaust are sent up from the various production constructs and such. It has this very luminescent look in comparison to a lot of the city. It's very interesting. It reminds you of the deep, deep portions of Kraghammer, where most of the actual fire and melted rock was being smelted and gathered and heated. So you make your way to the hovel. The roof workers are no longer there, and the door is closed.
Taliesin: (knocks) Victor? I've got your hand.
Matt: "(muffled) I'm sleeping."
Taliesin: Do you want your hand?
Matt: "(muffled) You want me to sleep?"
Taliesin: I don't see why they're mutually exclusive.
Marisha: (laughs)
Matt: You hear (scraping sound) a bunch of different locks fiddling. (series of clicks) (fwoosh) And the door opens and you see Victor, clean-faced for the first time you've really seen him before, and he has a nightcap which sort of (foomf) in front of his face, with a little puffball at the end. He's like, "I told you. I was trying-- oh! Hey. (hesitantly) Percival?"
Taliesin: Yes, that's quite good. I love your hat.
Matt: "Thank you. It's comfy to sleep in."
Taliesin: It looks it.
Matt: "Did you bring my hand?"
Taliesin: I did. I grabbed your hand and I will show you. It is very special.
Matt: "Come in! Come in! (grunts)" And opens the door. You see he's wearing this long nightgown that is covered in patches and tears in it. Most of it has been turned black through soot, but the cap is perfect. Perfect condition.
Taliesin: I have a special set of pajamas myself, so I understand.
Matt: "They are comfortable." As he walks in, still bandaged on the arm, you can see there's a small kettle of tea set by the small fireplace right there. It's a tiny little table and a tiny little stool that he's just kind of sitting on right there. And he goes and he reaches over for the kettle. "(groans)" Tries to pick up the cup and just pours the tea into it.
Taliesin: (alarmed stuttering)
Taliesin: I'm going to stop and attach and begin strapping this.
Matt: "(confused stuttering)"
Taliesin: Let me show you. It attaches like this.
Matt: "Ooh."
Taliesin: Here are the two switches. (clicking) And for your mine.
Matt: "Eh? Oh."
Taliesin: I grab, hit the button, twist, pull.
Matt: "Oh? Eh? I just got that!"
Taliesin: And I get the spike and attach it.
Matt: "Oh."
Taliesin: Remove it, put the hand back on. Tea?
Matt: (chuckle, click) (excited laughter) "Tea?"
Taliesin: Sure. Why not? Always say yes.
Marisha: (laughs)
Matt: "Need another cup. (grunts)" He stands up and goes over, still holding the kettle and splashing everywhere, and he's flipping through cabinets and knocking pieces of glass out. "Ah! Found it." Pulls out another little ceramic cup and pours the tea in, sets it down. (chink, click) "(cackles)"
Sam: (laughs)
Matt: "To new hands!"
Taliesin: To new hands.
Sam: That's a great toast.
Matt: It is pungent. It is bitter.
Matt: It has been steeped way too long.
Ashley: Gunpowder tea.
Matt: But it definitely cleans out the sinuses. And there is a hint of gunpowder to the flavoring. You get the sense that pretty much everything in this room is marinated in some way, shape, or form to be flammable.
Taliesin: (hoarsely) Victor. (laughter)
Matt: "It can put hair on your balls."
Taliesin: Ohhh, probably. Has a woman been by to buy black powder? (coughs) Has a woman been by?
Matt: "Not in, uh, weeks, maybe."
Taliesin: Weeks?
Matt: "Did you make her hand, too?"
Taliesin: I did not. Do you know where she goes?
Matt: "No. She paid well, though."
Taliesin: Did she? What did she pay?
Matt: "Are you guys in a club now? How many people want black powder? Tell me! Tell them! Bring them more. I could use money." (others laugh)
Taliesin: How much black powder did she buy, Victor?
Matt: "Uh... (mutters to himself)" (click, click)
Taliesin: Only counts to two. I'm so sorry. (laughter)
Matt: "Maybe... 12 hogsheads worth?"
Ashley: Whoa.
Travis: Oh, shit.
Marisha: Oh, shit.
Taliesin: Really? And how often does she come by?
Matt: "She only come by once."
Taliesin: Okay. (sighs) Thank you. I'm so pleased. I may stop by one last time before I leave town, just to say goodbye. Thank you.
Matt: "Please do! I have more tea. Many different flavors. This is, I call, dark roast."
Taliesin: It... certainly scalded something. Thank you. That was very lovely and that was very charming and I unfortunately have business in the--
Matt: "I want to try the other one before you go."
Taliesin: One more and then I must go, thank you.
Matt: "(click, creak) Come on, need this, too."
Taliesin: Yes, of course.
Matt: "(creak, click) (cackles)"
Taliesin: (uncertain laughter)
Matt: (thunk) He sticks it into the wooden stool and the table. Kind of breaks the wood and snaps it. "Oh. (cackles)"
Taliesin: Remember that it's attached to bone. You can still break your arm, so be gentle.
Matt: "Yes. Thank you!"
Taliesin: Thank you. Good night! Have a lovely evening.
Matt: "Good night!"
Sam: Aah.
Taliesin: Good night. Aah. Pleasure, as always. Thank you.
Matt: "(slurps)"
Taliesin: I leave in a little bit of a panic.
Matt: You leave and he's just sitting there staring at this long chisel point, going, "(quiet cackling)"
Sam: His ring.
Marisha: (laughs)
Matt: The door slowly closes behind you.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Liam: A fighter is born.
Marisha: Yes, yeah, just give him an anime weapon.
Taliesin: Yeah, okay. We're sticking around for a day?
Sam: I assume so. I don't know. We're going to spend the night, at least.
Taliesin: I'm going to take a long walk before I come back and I'm going to walk by the Raven Queen temple and just... peek inside.
Matt: Okay. You make your way past the Quad Roads. At this point at night the whole clientele has shifted. Most people coming here-- you hear laughter, you hear music. The Quad Roads is the New Orleans of the town, comparatively. It's still nowhere near as rambunctious as many places you've been, but for what seems during the day to be a rather dour and serious business type city, the Quad Roads is where the celebration of humanity hits when the evening hours hit. So you come by and there's some taverns that are open. You see, to a certain extent, what even appears to be an adult entertainment district.
Laura: (laughs sarcastically)
Matt: You make your way beyond--
Liam: (clears throat) Ring-a-ding-ding.
Matt: It's the oldest profession. You make your way all the way to the outskirts of the Duskmeadow, and there, amongst the just barely peeking through the cloudline starlight, the looming dark structure that is Raven's Crest.
Taliesin: I'm just going to gently open the door and peek inside and see if anybody's inside.
Matt: Okay. You go ahead and push the door open. (creak) Doesn't appear to be anybody there.
Taliesin: I walk in just for a moment and take a look around.
Matt: Okay. You walk in. (clicking footsteps) At this dark hour, looking around, the obsidian-type walls are translucent glass on the other side, though you can barely make out through the material the details of the outside world, due to the lack of light across the cityscape. Especially here in Duskmeadow, in which the magical lantern light that illuminates the city streets are relatively sparse on this side of Vasselheim. You take a few more steps in, (clicking footsteps) footsteps echoing across the long, thin, dark material of the floors. (creak, thud)
Laura: (gasps)
Matt: Door closes behind you.
Travis: (quietly) What would-- why would you do this?
Liam: Said the T. rex.
Taliesin: I'm going to gently look around and slowly back up and see if I can see anyone.
Taliesin: Hello? Hello?
Matt: (echoing) Hello... hello... hello.
Taliesin: What do I have to pay to fix this?
Matt: (echoing) This... this... this... this.
Taliesin: I leave.
Matt: (thump-crash) You hear the sound of some sort of low, distant hit and a rumble, and you see a distant light appear in a chamber just beyond the walkway, just faint enough to illuminate and give the presence of some sort of life or movement about a hundred or so feet ahead of you.
Taliesin: I walk briskly towards it.
Matt: You enter the next chamber, where you see the interior of this structure is ivory-white bone and glass, with a blue hint, very much resembling the interior of a very naturally, beautifully-carved ice cavern. There is a stairway that ascends, as well as other hallways that lead out from the central nerve center of the lower floor of the main structure. As you walk into this central chamber, you see, ever so faintly, at the very top of the stairs, a pair of feet (footsteps) walk and disappear up the stairs.
Taliesin: I'm going to charge after them.
Matt: Okay. You go running up the stairway. (thud thud) You get to the top, and you can see at the very top of the stairs a dark wooden door with a dark iron rim and what appears to be a large hanger or handle or knocker bolted to it and it (thud) just closes as you come underneath the top of the archway and up the stairs.
Taliesin: I knock.
Matt: (doosh) Once?
Taliesin: Three times.
Matt: (doosh doosh) With each hit, you can hear the reverberation of the echo of the knock through a much larger chamber beyond. As soon as you release the actual door knocker, the door (thump-crash, creak) just creaks open ever so slightly into a very, very dark chamber. You can see very, very little in here, other than the basic outline of what looks to be a little bit of floor, some sort of a smooth, glassy surface that refracts just a little bit of light that makes it through what looks to be some sort of broken-up glass dome-type structure above you. You can't make out much beyond that. It's very dark in here.
Taliesin: Hello? Please. (sighs) Something terrible has happened. I don't understand how these games work. I need help to fix something. Something terrible has happened! You obviously care little for this world. I start to back out.
Matt: As you step out of the room, you hear a whisper come from beyond the chamber, within the darkness. It says, "Is it yourself you wish to fix or something more?"
Taliesin: I don't think I can be fixed. There is something broken in the world.
Matt: "Then come. Let us talk."
Taliesin: ...I don't understand how these things work. I'm so sorry. Where do you wish me to go?
Matt: "Have faith."
Taliesin: (disbelieving laugh)
Matt: "Step in. Join me."
Taliesin: (sighs) ...I strip.
Travis: (gasps)
Taliesin: And put it aside.
Sam: Put "it" aside?
Taliesin: Put my clothes in the corner.
Sam: Oh. You're gonna jump her, eh?
Taliesin: You're filthy. And I go into the pool.
Matt: All right. As you step into the chamber, freezing cold as your toes--
Taliesin: We're cold people.
Matt: Your legs, your whole body eventually finds itself stepping into this thick, freezing liquid. You hear the whisper in your ears just as your head reaches the level of the blood, that says, "Come. Come to me with your questions." Just as your head goes beneath the surface.
Taliesin: (sighs) We're doing this.
Matt: You're underneath and in darkness, feeling around the thick material, kind of just swishing your fingers around, but amongst the liquid, you still hear the whisper again in your ear: "Come. Bring your questions."
Taliesin: And I swim down until it's uncomfortable.
Matt: You swim downward and you touch the bottom of the pool. You reach a somewhat concave, smooth floor to the pool.
Taliesin: I'm going to head to the surface. I don't know what's...
Matt: You head to the surface. There's no surface. It just keeps going.
Taliesin: (sighs) I do not do well with this.
Matt: You do not. You begin to panic.
Taliesin: Yes, I do.
Matt: You begin to reach around and try to swim up and find the surface, but it just keeps going. The liquid's thick and it's hard to pull through, and you can't open your eyes, and you can't see anything, and the iron-like flavor is starting to find its way to the inside of your mouth as it's seeping through your nose and your ears. You begin to panic even further as the cold is starting to take and you feel your muscles beginning to shake and seize from the onset of hypothermia. You begin to head to the bottom of the pool again, and this time, you crack your head on the bottom in the middle of your stupor, and you reach up and scream in pain. As you do, the blood fills your lungs and you begin to feel yourself drown. You begin to shake and convulse as you begin to try to find a way to force it out of your body and you can't. And at that moment, where all of a sudden you realize that this is it. This is the end. This is how the tale of Percival comes to an end. The sensation goes warm again. And it's like all that cold energy goes away, and you're now swimming in water, then air, and the pain subsides, and you're breathing normally. But you still stand in darkness, and you hear these distant footsteps. (clicking footsteps) Sourceless. No light, just shadow. And you look around over your shoulder and then right behind you, you see immediately a white porcelain face, the head is just standing there amongst the shadow.
Taliesin: (takes deep breaths) Do you know what I've done?
Matt: "I've watched."
Taliesin: I have questions.
Matt: "Then ask them."
Taliesin: First is, can we stop it? Can we stop what's been released? Is there something I can do?
Matt: "Many things are released in this world. Many terrible, many wonderful. Many things. Ask the right questions."
Taliesin: Did it choose me because I was broken, or did it break me?
Matt: The mask, which has not shown any expression at this point, pulls back a little bit from you and almost seems to grow in size. It's strange; the proportion seems to stay the same, but suddenly your vision shifts and you realize, no, it's farther away from you and is just suddenly immense, like your visual focus just changes and your whole perspective suddenly causes you to lose sense of scale and balance. The voice comes in, this time louder: "You were always broken, Percival. And you were preyed upon, just as it preys upon others, and will continue to do so until finally destroyed."
Taliesin: Can it be fixed?
Matt: "Perhaps. Your deeds will guide your path to salvation or damnation. The choice is yours. You skirt that line still."
Taliesin: But the first deed is so... there's so much, and I don't think any of them see it. I want it to die before anybody sees it. Can you help?
Matt: "I've already helped, Percival. Do not think the path that you and your allies walk goes unseen. There are many of those in this world that represent the will of us, just as there are those who represent the will of those that combat us and always have. There are a great many deeds ahead of you. It's your choice to take them. Just know: should you not watch yourself, you may not find yourself on our side."
Taliesin: I know. There is nowhere I can look for healing? Other than deeds? I like to fix things.
Matt: "All life is inherently broken from the start, Percival. Take solace in that. There is no perfection in life. Otherwise, what would be the purpose of death? It's to try to find ways to better yourself before the end that gives us purpose. You are all broken, but also understand," At this point, her voice gets very deep and very resonant. "Mortals can achieve great things. I did." And the mask pulls back into the shadows and suddenly (gasp, cough) you begin coughing, finding your way to the surface, pouring blood out of your mouth and coughing and eventually you find your way over, breathing heavily, to the side of the pool and (grunt) pull yourself onto the side. (cough) Cough the rest of it up. A little bit of moonlight peeks through, and you can see the beams refracting through the purples and reds and blues and just hints of specks of light that just shimmer across the surface of this dark, glass-like floor.
Taliesin: I'm going to take my sword and I'm going to very carefully scrape my body clean of the blood, as much as I can, and I'm going to take the back of my shirt and clean my hair off as much as I can. I'm going to take a vial of the blood in the pool. One tiny bit.
Matt: You do so.
Taliesin: I'm going to put my clothes back on... and I'm going to cast Hex on myself for my walk home and banish it before I come in the door.
Matt: Okay. All righty. So, as Percival finally wanders in, is there anything else anyone wants to achieve before the evening's done?
Sam: I'd like to go to the Raven Queen. (laughter)
Sam: No.
Liam: Are we next morning, or we're still evening, at this point?
Matt: We're still evening at the moment, if there's anything else you wish to achieve. Otherwise--
Laura: I've been slowly heating water and giving it to Vax to put in his bath.
Matt: You do manage to draw a comfortable bath for your brother and wash him clean.
Laura: I don't wash him! I just give him the fucking water.
Matt: You aid him in washing himself clean. So you specify.
Liam: Thanks, man.
Travis: Do we see Percy when he comes in?
Matt: It's going to be late.
Taliesin: I'm going to walk quiet and late and go tinker on a little thing for a minute until I pass out.
Matt: Okay. You do notice Percy enter. Looks a little frazzled, but doesn't seem to--
Laura: Do I see any of the blood? Passive perception?
Liam: You're in the tubby town, though.
Matt: Make a perception check. I want you to make a dexterity check.
Marisha: (groan)
Taliesin: (groan)
Liam: Sorry, Taliesin.
Sam: You've got him.
Liam: Rolled high.
Laura: 32.
Taliesin: 32?! Oh my god, what the-- I couldn't have rolled that. Like, that would've been a natural 20, would have been the only way around that.
Matt: You see, just faintly behind one of his ears and at the edge of his collar on his coat, just a bit of familiar crimson, and a look of... a distant stare that is familiar.
Matt: All right. Do you all wish to rest for the evening?
Sam: No, I would like to take 12 hours to read my book.
Matt: Okay, so the first 12 hours are completed, but you do not sleep?
Sam: No.
Liam: It's a page-turner.
Sam: Lots of centerfolds. (laughter)
Travis: Don't be stingy, share those with me.
Matt: Written by John Cleese. It's a wonderful piece.
Laura: I also spend a lot of time that night reading, but I'm reading the book about the Raven Queen.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Pretty much have it memorized at this point.
Matt: Yeah, fair enough. All right. You guys all find yourself to rest, except for Scanlan, who takes a point of exhaustion for going through the night without sleep.
Sam: I don't know what that is, but someone will tell me.
Travis: You'll find out.
Matt: Yeah. Basically, it means any ability checks, any skill checks until you get a full night's rest are at disadvantage, yeah. All right, as you find yourselves to rest, most of you the morning light comes, greeting you to a new day, and we're going to go ahead and take a break. We'll be back here in a few minutes, guys. Reminder, once again: Loot Crate, our awesome sponsor, check them out at lootcrate.com/criticalrole, enter criticalrole-- one word-- to get $3 off a subscription. We'll be back here in a minute, guys.
Marisha: And get your Joe Mad poster!
Matt: Joe Mad poster!
Marisha: Right now, pre-order.
Sam: Wait, there's a giveaway at the break, I think.
Laura: Oh, there's a Loot Crate giveaway.
Marisha: Oh, and giveaway!
Matt: For the DX boxes, so be active in the chat.
Liam: And please go check out the Joe Mad poster.
Laura: It's so sick.
Liam: Also check out Battle Chasers Night War. It's a beautiful-looking game. I played it today.
Laura: Also, give your friend a hug. Love each other.
Marisha: (laughs) Yeah, and a high-five.
Sam: Bathe in blood. We'll see you soon. [Critical Role resumes at 2:22:43]
Matt: Welcome back, guys. So, as we return to the game, the morning comes to you all in Vasselheim as you awake in the Slayer's Take guildhall. A brisk morning, but not too cold. The clouds are actually a little more separate this morning. You get brief moments of blue; it looks like the weather is a little clearer than you're used to seeing in this vicinity. But the day is yours. What do you guys wish to do?
Liam: What do we need to accomplish here in town? Is there anything we need to finish, or do we want to pick our next destination?
Sam: Do they sell potions and things here in town--
Sam: No, they don't.
Taliesin: No, very specifically they don't.
Sam: Then let's get the hell out of here. There's nothing for us here.
Travis: What about the Feywild?
Sam: Oh, yeah.
Marisha: We did talk about the Feywild.
Taliesin: Let's drop off our--
Laura: Don't tease me about the Feywild.
Travis: Wait, don't you have to pick up something?
Taliesin: Oh, I already picked it up.
Travis: Not you, you.
Sam: Me?
Taliesin: Oh, you have a hat.
Sam: I thought we waited for the hat.
Matt: Yeah, he picked up the hat.
Travis: Oh, shit, balls, ass. All right.
Sam: There's the Feywild. There's dropping stuff off at Whitestone. There's Marquet, which something is there in Marquet?
Laura: Is one of the Vestiges there?
Sam: I don't know, everyone just keeps talking about it.
Travis: Really?
Sam: Wait, weren't we going to go to--
Marisha: One of the Vestiges is in Marquet.
Laura: Which one?
Marisha: Hang on. Cabal's Ruin, which is a magic-devouring cloak--
Travis: Hold on, hold on, hold on. Are we alone in this room?
Matt: You guys are right now having breakfast in the guildhall. There's maybe two other individuals in the room. One of them is drunkenly asleep and snoring. The other appears to be going about their business.
Travis: I'm just saying.
Marisha: (whispering) Okay, I'll speak quietly. There's apparently a magic-devouring cloak who is being worn by the-- it's in Ank'Harel. It's being worn by...
Laura: It's a cloak that devours magic?
Marisha: A merchant warrior with a missing eye.
Sam: And there's one in the bottom of the sea somewhere.
Laura: And there's a really beautiful strong bow in the Feywild.
Travis: Yeah, let's go to the Feywild! We at least know that place.
Taliesin: I say we drop everything-- we take a pit stop in Whitestone and head towards the Feywild.
Marisha: So, technically, we don't even have to head towards the Feywild. Do you guys remember how I kind of did that thing with Grog's evil sword and kind of banished it away for forever?
Travis: Are we bringing it back?
Marisha: No.
Laura: Yeah, to the Dread Emperor's.
Marisha: Right.
Liam: Not a good idea, Grog.
Marisha: No, we're not bringing it back. I can do that with the rest of us.
Laura: You can banish us to the Dread Emperor's island?
Marisha: No, it's not like a banishment. I can Plane Shift us wherever we want to go, to an alternate plane.
Laura: To the Feywild? So we don't even have to find an entrance?
Marisha: Yeah, we just hold hands and think about it really hard.
Travis: No way.
Marisha: Yeah. It's druid magic. It's great.
Liam: And you put us in a safe spot somewhere in there, somehow?
Marisha: I can take us to where we've been before, to where it's familiar.
Liam: Have we been there before? I don't know.
Marisha: Very briefly.
Taliesin: Yes.
Laura: Is it somewhere that you have to have been, or can it be somewhere that we have been.
Marisha: It is somewhere I am familiar with, I believe, through means that I am familiar...
Laura: Syngorn is in the Feywild.
Sam: Normally?
Liam: No, not normally.
Laura: They transferred the entire city there.
Liam: I know, but you're saying we've been there, but they just did that recently.
Sam: Grog's been to the Feywild.
Matt: You can specify a target
Marisha: In general terms.
Matt: In general terms.
Marisha: Such as "City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of Fire."
Sam: Oh, is that where we're going?
Marisha: No.
Sam: Oh. Sounds like fun.
Taliesin: It does, actually.
Marisha: If you guys want to go to the Plane of Fire, that's like, a hike and a jump through a hole.
Taliesin: Ah.
Travis: No, no, not the Plane of Fire. Just the Feywild.
Marisha: All right. Yeah, I can get us there.
Sam: To the Feywild. How big is the Feywild? Is it like a football field?
Marisha: It's very big.
Laura: It's a whole other plane.
Sam: Well, how do-- do we know where we're going in the Feywild?
Marisha: I imagine we'll figure it out once we get there.
Taliesin: Do I know anything about the Feywild?
Matt: You have no knowledge of the Feywild.
Ashley: Would I know anything else?
Marisha: What about me?
Laura: Would we have learned something about it in Syngorn?
Matt: You have a general idea of it, somewhat--
Marisha: Team Half-Elf, yeah.
Matt: Somewhat, just through your learning. You never actually visited there. The Feywild is a near plane, a plane that overlaps this Prime Material Plane. It's a version of the world you live in right now that is shifted and changed in a place where time, distance is relative and shifts. Nature grows rampant and in cases is hard to really expect its direction. Things and entities exist there that prefer to trick and lose wanderers. It's a very strange place where some believe elves initially come from or craft from there, at least.
Liam: Do the two of us know enough that were you to jump from the same place here, would you necessarily end up in the same spot in the Feywild?
Matt: You have no idea.
Liam: We don't know. All right.
Matt: You don't know anything about the transition to the Feywild. You just know that certain doors open at certain times, especially with full moons in certain locations, the classic toadstool rings, areas where the moonlight in the realms can be a little thinner and the barrier doors do open, and those are where creatures can transition out or through. You do know it's a place of fey magic, it's tricky, it's difficult to follow.
Sam: Terrible.
Laura: It sounds awful.
Matt: Very, like, Oberon and Titania. Weird. Interesting.
Marisha: Question.
Matt: Yes?
Marisha: Hmm, okay.
Sam: Good question.
Marisha: It says the Wrath of the Fey Warden is what we're looking for, the bow, and that it now acts as the heart of a cancerous tree, corrupting the verdant land. Is there something I can do, maybe try and...
Travis: Hold on, is our stream up? Are we offline right now?
Lucas: (muffled, from offscreen) I'm checking. Just wait.
Ashley: Hold, please.
Lucas: It says we're still online. Hang on.
Liam: Loot Crate. Check out Loot Crate.
Sam: No one can see it.
Laura: No, it says it's offline.
Liam: Refresh it.
Marisha: It says offline?
Liam: Quit the program and go back in.
Travis: The chat is saying it's off.
Lucas: No, we're still online.
Laura: Okay.
Liam: Tell them to quit and re-login.
Sam: It's back. It's back.
Lucas: I'm not sure what happened. I'm not sure it even dropped frames on my end.
Liam: Whoa, we were in the Feywild for a second there.
Ashley: Oh, it was crazy.
Matt: You guys missed six episodes. (exaggerated sounds of relief)
Matt: Everything turned out okay.
Laura: Yay! And we got the warden thing.
Liam: Dragons are dead.
Marisha: Guys, I'm so glad we won DND. We beat it.
Laura: Yeah, that was the best.
Taliesin: Roll the credits scroll.
Marisha: Can I maybe sense a sick tree? You know what? Let's go to Whitestone. Let's go to Whitestone and drop some stuff off.
Laura: You know, because the more I think about it, I mean, we almost just died many times and the last time we tried to get a Vestige it almost killed us, and maybe we just need a little bit more preparation, maybe?
Taliesin: Let's empty our bags, let's prepare ourselves. There are certainly stories in the woods of Whitestone of strange happenings, so I'm sure there's probably some connection to the Feywild, and we'll see what happens.
Laura: Make sure Whitestone is actually preparing something underground just like Westruun.
Taliesin: Well, we have something.
Marisha: Yes, they have something underground already.
Laura: Exactly, but there's a spinning orb of death there.
Taliesin: Which, to be fair, is probably going to keep a dragon away.
Liam: But I also think we've earned more than a single day of rest.
Taliesin: Yes.
Liam: Let's go to Whitestone.
Taliesin: Let's go to Whitestone.
Marisha: All right.
Ashley: Where's the sea?
Sam: The Ozmit Sea?
Ashley: Yeah.
Matt: The Ozmit Sea is to the east of you, east-southeast, and that is a wide gulf that separates-- from your perspective, looking at me, there's Othanzia, Ozmit Sea, and there's Tal'Dorei right here.
Laura: Oh, okay.
Liam: (sneezes)
Taliesin: Bless you.
Marisha: Bless you.
Laura: Bless you.
Marisha: The Water Ashari live in the Ozmit Sea.
Laura: Are they like mermaids?
Marisha: No, I think they've got an island.
Ashley: It's also the sea that I sailed.
Marisha: Really?
Laura: (gasps)
Sam: Ohhh.
Taliesin: Really?
Laura: In your roving pirate days.
Ashley: I know it well.
Marisha: How familiar are you with the sea?
Ashley: I'm pretty familiar with it.
Travis: What if we go there?
Sam: We could.
Laura: Wait, could I see the list of Vestiges?
Sam: The one in the bottom of the sea is called Whisper, right?
Laura: Whisper?
Marisha: A blade forged from metal pulled from the Far Realm, it was the center of many dark rituals.
Sam: It now lies at the bottom of the Ozmit Sea, sunken with the lost ship, The Shrew.
Laura: (sing-song) The Shrew?
Ashley: (deep voice) The Shrew.
Sam: A storm three hundred years ago near an island of glass. Anyone know about the island of glass?
Laura: Have you heard about an island of glass?
Marisha: Have I heard about an island of glass? Have Pike or I heard of an island of glass?
Matt: I'll have both of you guys make history checks.
Marisha: All right. I rolled a natural 1.
Matt: You barely know what glass is right now.
Marisha: Guys, water isn't glass, that's stupid.
Taliesin: I would have a theory as to what it was.
Travis: She rolled a 20.
Marisha: You rolled a 20? Oh, go Pike!
Ashley: Not a natural 20. Total.
Matt: Explain.
Taliesin: Should I roll to figure out that this is probably an active volcano?
Matt: Make an intelligence check.
Taliesin: I'm down.
Liam: Come on, man.
Taliesin: No! Wow.
Sam: Onesies.
Marisha: Team ones. Whoo.
Matt: Natural 1?
Taliesin: Natural 1.
Liam: Snitch.
Matt: Doesn't quite come to you, but what it could be. The idea of a volcano possibly comes to mind, but--
Taliesin: I'm distracted.
Matt: Yeah. You have not been there, you haven't seen it, but some of your crewmates while you were traveling aboard your ship for that five, six-month period, a couple of them did mention something about on the sea, a mirage-like island that glistens in the distance, but they said to avoid it, said it was dangerous.
Sam: Did they say where it was?
Matt: No.
Sam: Damn it.
Ashley: Heard many tales of The Shrew.
Laura: Yeah?
Ashley: Yeah, the ship lost at sea.
Matt: You know of The Shrew, you definitely know of The Shrew.
Ashley: All sailors know of The Shrew.
Marisha: What's the story of The Shrew?
Sam: Come on, sailor.
Ashley: There was a storm three hundred years ago.
Laura: Near an island of glass?
Ashley: Near an island of glass.
Marisha: It was really bad.
Ashley: And The Shrew just didn't sail on.
Sam: It was tamed.
Ashley: It was tamed.
Laura: (laughs) I was waiting for it to--
Matt: Come around again? Yeah, it was good.
Laura: Come around, yep.
Taliesin: Taming of the Shrew fits, yeah.
Ashley: Good tale, but we'll get there one day.
Matt: What's the plan?
Liam: Whitestone.
Sam: Yes, Whitestone.
Travis: Can I make one other suggestion? Emon... go take Thordak right now.
Sam: Good call...
Travis: Yeah, one taker?
Marisha: You know what, Grog?
Laura: It's a good plan, Grog.
Liam: It's cheeky.
Marisha: We will put that in our back pocket and we will think about it.
Liam: That helmet is really something else.
Laura: You could really do something terrible to him with that thing.
Travis: I'm just saying, I think we have an edge now.
Laura: I think you're probably right.
Sam: (chuckle) Attaboy.
Liam: That's technically true, yes.
Taliesin: You do... have a point.
Laura: But let's make sure that Whitestone is safe before we do such a thing.
Sam: Percy, we are in a place that has an airship dock.
Taliesin: That is true.
Sam: We could go steal an airship.
Taliesin: We could go steal an airship!
Laura: We don't need an airship.
Marisha: We don't need an airship.
Laura: We have an instant ability to transport anywhere.
Sam: It would be so cool, though.
Taliesin: Then we wouldn't have to go to Whitestone. It would hold all of our things.
Laura: When we kill all the dragons...
Marisha: When we kill all the dragons...
Taliesin: We could hold all of our things on the airship, and I could have cannonades...
Laura: That will be the first thing we do when Thordak dies is we jump on an airship.
Ashley: Party on the airship.
Marisha: We'll buy it with all of the gold that we've stolen from all the dragons. It'll be great.
Taliesin: We won't need the airship if the dragons are dead.
Laura: All the fun has gone out of it.
Travis: What are we doing?
Laura: We're going to Whitestone.
Marisha: We're going to Whitestone.
Marisha: (piercing spell noise)
Sam: Before we leave, do you want to sell these stupid white dragon scales?
Taliesin: No.
Sam: All right, let's go.
Liam: Let's go to Whitestone.
Marisha: (repeats piercing spell noise) Through a tree!
Matt: All right, as you guys walk outside of the Slayer's Take guildhall, you find the nearest tree, which you've used before to traverse. As you all step through the portal, Percy and Scanlan look over their shoulder at the distant skyport and see the one airship docked there and think, "One day..."
Liam: So handsome.
Sam: Someday, it will be ours.
Taliesin: You'll make a fine sailor.
Sam: Passenger.
Liam: Swabby.
Matt: You jump through and emerge out the other side. As you step out of the portal, you find yourself jumping out of the center of the Sun Tree.
Marisha: Can I do something?
Sam: Nope.
Matt: What do you want to do?
Marisha: While I'm in the tree, can I do something?
Travis: Like kill us all? No no no. Say they go first. "Go, go, go, go." And I kind of start teleporting through the tree and while I'm in the Sun Tree I just want to be like, "Hey, boo."
Laura: (laughs)
Marisha: "I missed you. Have you heard of this whole cancerous tree situation in the Feywild?"
Sam: (whispering) You're talking to a tree?
Marisha: Shh, no. I'm in the middle of the tree. I'm in the tree.
Laura: You're stuck in the tree?
Matt: As you finish this thought, you hear this sound emerge (vacuum sealing sound) and realize it's the sound of the whole portal you've made closing behind you because it only lasts for six seconds and you should probably get the hell out of the tree.
Marisha: Aww. I step out of the tree.
Ashley: Good try.
Matt: As you step out, a voice goes, "Hey, boo, sorry.(kiss noise)" (laughter)
Matt: And it closes behind you.
Marisha: I'll talk to him later.
Matt: You guys emerge. Due to the time differences, you land here in Whitestone, looking at where the sun is in the sky, it's early afternoon, as opposed to the morning where you guys just stepped away from. There are people in the streets, and you see a few, a little bit of life has returned to this town square, though still, by comparison-- there are folks now that are bringing in actual, healthy, looks to be fruits from nearby trees. There's a little bit of trade going on. This is the first real chance you've had to see a little bit of Whitestone coming to life again. As you emerge from the tree, a few individuals nearby stop and look and smile and wave, recognizing you as you approach.
Laura: Are there any leaves on the Sun Tree yet?
Matt: Actually, no, there are not. There are no leaves on the Sun Tree.
Sam: (quietly) Because it's winter.
Laura: Whatever.
Travis: We should check with the border patrol.
Sam: There's a border patrol?
Travis: Yeah.
Laura: A wolf.
Sam: Oh, the wolf.
Travis: (whistles) I whistle as loud as I can.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: What's his name?
Marisha: I don't know. Let me find it.
Sam: Oh, boy. Harold?
Laura: I just want to go find Zahra and give her a hug and say hello and see how she's doing while he's talking.
Matt: You whistle as loud as you can for a little bit. Nothing.
Travis: Must be off doing something (belches) important.
Taliesin: Quite.
Matt: You head off and, asking around, you find Zahra is actually up in Castle Whitestone right now, just poring through one of the studies of books, and is just currently reading and reading on her own. As you eventually ask around and find your way there, entering the room, you see her with a small set of spectacles at the end of her nose. She takes them off and, "My darling Vex'ahlia!" And comes up and just gives you a big hug and picks you up and sets you down. "I'm so glad to see you're all right."
Laura: Dear, the dragon arrow you gave me? Killed him. Well, I didn't kill him, actually, with it, but I did a lot of damage.
Matt: "You killed a dragon?"
Laura: Umbrasyl. Dead. One down.
Matt: "I knew you would."
Laura: Where's Cashew?
Matt: "I don't know. He's testy these days. I'm sure he's around."
Laura: I know his name is fucking Kashaw. So he's not there.
Matt: "Probably down in the city somewhere. He's helping where he can. You know broody types."
Laura: I do know broody types.
Matt: Yes, you do.
Laura: What are you reading?
Matt: "Oh, I'm just learning about the history of Whitestone and I'm very intrigued as to the actual properties of this stone the entire town is built on. There's a lot of really, really interesting things that can be done with the materials in these mountains."
Laura: I'm sure you have ideas.
Matt: "I do."
Laura: I sit down next to her and ask, just catching up, and see if they've spotted any dragons.
Matt: You guys continue your conversation, catching up, letting her know how things happened, and vice versa. You don't get any info that any dragons have come by. Apparently, there have been a few other arcane practitioners that have been helping set up some sort of barrier to help, essentially, dissuade attention towards the city. The idea of keeping this place as far off the map as possible, should any prying eyes find their way there. It's in the process of being set up right now.
Laura: Zahra, how long did it take you to make that arrow?
Matt: "A few weeks."
Laura: If I were to give you some more money, do you think you could do it again?
Matt: "Probably, based on what-- (sighs) if I'm able to use some of the resources here within the castle, maybe."
Laura: I'll talk to Percy, but I'm sure, if it's for a good cause...
Matt: "All right, perhaps I can."
Laura: All right. I'll come find you, dear.
Matt: "Wondrous." What else are you guys trying to achieve here?
Liam: I am trying to find Shaun Gilmore.
Laura: That's his first name?
Sam: Shaun Gilmore?
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: Yeah.
Taliesin: Yeah, Shaun.
Laura: Shaun? How did you know that?
Marisha: He told us.
Matt: He told you guys that a long time ago.
Laura: I fucking know, I remember.
Matt: (laughs)
Taliesin: Tattooed at the small of his back.
Marisha: Yeah, he's got a tramp stamp.
Ashley: Tramp stamp.
Sam: Can I accompany Vax on this trip?
Liam: Sure, come on.
Sam: I want to see Gilmore.
Liam: Let's start asking around town for him.
Matt: You start asking around. You come across a few folks you recognize, you find a few of the guards who helped you with the initial reconstruction of this city and such and asking around. One of the nearby guards takes his helmet off and is like, "First off, I am so excited that you guys are back. I'm so glad you're all safe. I heard that you were off to do some dangerous things."
Liam: You heard right.
Matt: "Well, great, I'm glad that you've survived. Looking for Mr. Gilmore, he's actually down with the Realmseer. They're inspecting the ziggurat underneath the city, so you could head down there if you wanted to find him."
Liam: Thank you. I'm not terribly familiar with Whitestone, could you point us in the right direction?
Matt: "It's under the castle."
Liam: The castle.
Matt: "Yes."
Liam: Can't miss that.
Sam: Yeah, we've been there before. Yeah, let's go.
Liam: Let's go.
Matt: He puts his helmet back on. "Thank you again for all that you do." He clicks his heels together and continues walking through the city.
Liam: All right, yeah.
Sam: I guess we'll head down to the ziggurat.
Liam: Let's do it.
Matt: Everyone else going with?
Travis: Fuck yeah, let's go.
Ashley: Yeah. Yeah.
Laura: We taking a trip?
Taliesin: Sure.
Marisha: Oh, are we all going down to the ziggurat?
Laura: Yeah.
Travis: Nothing else to do.
Marisha: Sure.
Matt: All right. You make your way down to the basement area of Whitestone Castle, into the family catacombs, which have been cleaned up and you can see Cassandra has put a little bit of care into restoring it to what it was before. The tunnel that was carved in has been given a little more support, and as you're making your way down a familiar tunnel, the same tunnel where you had the showdown with Orthax, you hear a few voices from up ahead. Two familiar voices. You hear the echo of some older, gruff, elderly gentleman and a little more rambunctious familiar voice. As they turn the corner, you see them deep in conversation. It's the Realmseer himself hunched forward with his white hair and balding top, turns around, "And it's a great mystery to me that they can put a-- Oh, look! They've returned. Vox Machina themselves." Gilmore, at this point, opens his arms, standing and healthy. "My god, I've been waiting for you."
Laura: (laughs)
Ashley: Aww.
Marisha: Aww.
Matt: "And all of you so graciously clean!"
Laura: You look so healthy, Gilmore!
Ashley: Very healthy.
Matt: "Well, I have you to thank for that. Still a ways to go."
Liam: But in two or three weeks, it's not bad. You're looking well.
Matt: "Well, you all have Kima to thank for that. She's been quite attentive to my needs."
Marisha: How is Whitestone finding you?
Matt: "Curious place, this Whitestone. Well, the company's interesting."
Marisha: Sure.
Matt: The Realmseer laughs. He's like, "(chuckles) So I've heard." "We've spent a little bit of time looking at this strange oddity beneath the city, and I'm not going to lie to you, it's really confusing. I've a few theories on it, as does the Arcanist, but we're still comparing notes and we don't want to jump to any conclusions, as tests have been inconclusive and rather dangerous so far. However, before anything else goes underway, I believe there's a very important bit of business that we must attend to."
Sam: Business? What business, Gilmore?
Matt: And he walks straight up to Grog and just gives you a big hug.
Sam: Aww.
Laura: Oh?
Matt: And pats you on the shoulder and is like, "(chuckling) You big lug."
Travis: You... Gilmore. (laughter)
Matt: Walks over to you, Pike, and kneels down and gives you a little pinch on the cheek and is like, "Looking as spry and smiley as ever, I see."
Ashley: Hello, Shaun. (more laughter)
Ashley: I give him a kiss on the cheek.
Matt: "Ooh."
Ashley: (laughs) "Ooh."
Matt: He turns to you. "Vex'ahlia, look at you. I hear, if my words say correct, that you folks are a recent dragon-slaying bunch, hmm?"
Laura: That we are.
Matt: "(chuckles) Good to know."
Matt: Skips over you.
Laura: Oh.
Ashley: Save the best for last.
Matt: And goes to Scanlan and goes to ruffle your hair, and goes, "And you, you, my little bardish friend."
Sam: Little?
Matt: "No, you're actually physically little."
Sam: Oh, I know.
Matt: "You are a tinier person."
Matt: "Embrace it! It's what makes you different."
Sam: That's true, I suppose. I suppose. Yes, absolutely. We've been spreading the good word about you and your works.
Matt: "So I've heard from all sorts of interesting folk. I only hope one day to wear clothes as fine as you."
Sam: Oh! That's a nice compliment.
Matt: "Percival."
Taliesin: Good patron.
Matt: "Thank you for taking me into your home."
Taliesin: You do nothing but brighten these halls.
Matt: "I'm... happy to keep things lit. (sighs)" At which point, he goes to look towards you. The Realmseer's sitting there tapping his arm; he's like, "Right, get on with it, we've got work to be done." And, "Shh. You be quiet. These people have saved my life. Keyleth. Sweet Ashari princess."
Marisha: Hi, Gilmore.
Matt: "You've grown. I can see it in your eyes." He gives you a big hug.
Marisha: I give him a hug back.
Matt: "Vax."
Laura: (giggles)
Matt: "Vax'ildan. Light of my eye. Smiling boy." (laughter)
Matt: And he walks up and puts his hands across your shoulders and kind of cups your face. "I've missed you most of all." And pulls you in for a big hug and lifts you up off the ground.
Liam: Oh, hey, you.
Laura: You're strong enough to-- be careful of your wound, Gilmore!
Matt: As he sets you down, he’s like, "Ooh, I shouldn't have done that. My apologies."
Liam: I pat him on the ribs.
Matt: "Don't touch that. It's still very tender."
Liam: It's fantastic to see you. You're a sight for sore eyes, yourself. We're very happy to see you.
Matt: "My sight is sore, so this works out well. But please, these tunnels are dank and not becoming of us. Dinner should be happening soon and you should join us, now that you've returned, please."
Marisha: Oh, before dinner, I think we were all just curious on the state of the... ziggurat, as we were calling it.
Laura: The orb.
Matt: "Let's talk over dinner."
Marisha: Spinning orb of death, is what we call it.
Matt: "Let's talk over dinner."
Marisha: All right, yeah, sure.
Travis: Wait, you said you were doing tests on it, right? Did you throw things at it? Did it blow up?
Matt: "That is part of the test. Nothing blew up. Things did go away."
Travis: They went away?
Laura: They get sucked in, Grog.
Matt: "We'll talk over dinner. I hate to have this discussion without Allura here. I think this would only behoove the conversation if we're all present."
Taliesin: An excellent argument.
Laura: We have some delicious and very expensive wine.
Matt: "(chuckling) Well!"
Ashley: Expensive-ass wine.
Liam: Yeah.
Laura: Expensive-ass wine we could bust out with dinner.
Matt: "Color me intrigued."
Laura: Oh, I haven't got to wink in a really long time, you guys. It felt so good.
Marisha: Back to your old self.
Liam: Hard life.
Matt: "It was a good wink. Finest in the land. Well, come to the surface, then! This place is dreary."
Taliesin: Yes.
Matt: "You, too, Eskil."
Matt: "Aye. Too many smiles in this area. I like it. It's jovial. Don't see that around these places too often. It's good to see all of you. Come, now, yes, let's move!"
Matt: You all eventually make your way back to the surface, to Whitestone.
Marisha: I go to Vex and Pike and go, "Is this a good opportunity for us to break out our formal wear?"
Ashley: (gasps) Yes!
Laura: Definitely, dear.
Marisha: Okay.
Travis: Oh, jeez.
Taliesin: I genuinely have no idea what you're talking about.
Marisha: The ladies take, like, 20 minutes.
Travis: Let's be honest, it's 2 hours.
Taliesin: 40 minutes.
Travis: Fucking 20 minutes, my ass. On what plane are you right now? (laughs)
Laura: (laughs)
Marisha: Not the Feywild. But maybe soon.
Ashley: There's magic involved.
Taliesin: Same plane as the break room. 5 minutes is 15. (laughs)
Marisha: (laughing) Yes, yes, yeah.
Travis: "I'll be 20 minutes." The next day...
Liam: On the way out, as we're all walking out, I walk along with Gilmore and I give him just a gentle shoulder. Shoulder to shoulder. And say, "It's really good to see you on your feet. It's the best smile I've had in ages."
Matt: "You and me both."
Laura: While we're getting ready, I would like to talk to Pike about a certain proposal that happened. None of us have addressed it.
Ashley: I know, because I just--
Laura: What happened?
Ashley: What should I do?
Laura: What did you tell him? Did you tell him yes, did you tell him no?
Ashley: I'm just so--
Marisha: Hang on, what exactly did he say, by the way?
Ashley: I just said we'll circle back.
Laura: We'll circle back?
Marisha: Circle back.
Laura: (laughing) How did he take that?
Ashley: I think he was fine with it. He just understands that I just--
Marisha: Treat proposals like we do our dungeons? (laughs) We circle back.
Ashley: Isn't that the only way to just treat all things? I guess, I don't know. I don't know.
Marisha: (giggles)
Laura: How do you feel about him, Pike?
Ashley: I just don't know. I just feel so confused.
Marisha: I understand that.
Ashley: He wears you down a little.
Liam: (cracks up)
Ashley: And there's something there, for him.
Marisha: I don't know if that's a good reason to say yes, though.
Ashley: Oh, I don't know. He's just very charming.
Marisha: He is very charming.
Laura: He is very charming.
Laura: And I noticed, he's becoming more charming.
Ashley: Yes, I know!
Marisha: Yeah, what is with that? I didn't know that was possible.
Ashley: How? I feel like he goes to sleep and then the next morning he's like--
Ashley: Even more charming!
Laura: Even more charming!
Laura: I don't understand it.
Ashley: Why is that?
Marisha: I don't know.
Laura: Like, every once in a while I look at him and I go:
Marisha: Yeah, no, and then I feel really--
Laura: No, but he's small, but at the same time, I'm kind of interested.
Marisha: Right! And you kind of think about it for a second and you entertain it, and then you feel really gross about yourself.
Laura: You feel like-- yeah!
Ashley: Yes! Yes.
Laura: But if you're actually interested, then it's not gross at all.
Marisha: No! Of course it's not gross if you're actually interested.
Ashley: I know. I just. (groans) I've had feelings for someone for a long time, but maybe they're slowly fading. I don't know.
Laura: Wait.
Marisha: Wait, what?
Ashley: I have. I don't know if I feel comfortable talking about it. But it's fine.
Laura: We don't want to push you, Pike, but you know, it's just us girls here.
Marisha: I know! And we've been through so many uncomfortable things together.
Ashley: (groans)
Marisha: Most of life is so uncomfortable. Be comfortable right now.
Ashley: I just. I don't know. It's still something that I need to think about.
Laura: All right.
Marisha: We understand.
Ashley: I'm just.
Laura: You pray to your Sarenrae about it.
Ashley: Okay. (laughs) You do look lovely, though, in your dress.
Laura: You look beautiful.
Marisha: You look so cute.
Laura: (laugh)
Ashley: (laugh)
Marisha: (laugh)
Ashley: Thanks.
Ashley: I do a twirl. (more laughter)
Marisha: I do a little air cantrip to make the skirt poof out.
Ashley: Ooh.
Laura: I tug up my dress.
Marisha: Hey, do you guys mind tying me up a bit?
Laura: Of course!
Marisha: Nice and tight. (grunts)
Laura: Can you breathe?
Marisha: (strained) No, but that means it's right.
Laura: All right.
Marisha: All right, I'm good.
Taliesin: I assume there's clean clothes for everybody in their quarters?
Matt: Yeah, it's all good.
Travis: I'm wearing the same shit. (laughter)
Sam: And the big hat?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: (laughing) To dinner. (shoonk)
Travis: (laughing) Yeah. I paid money for this thing.
Taliesin: And I'm going to arrange for our stuff to be stowed in the vault.
Matt: Okay. Not a worry. All right, so as the sun sets, you find your way down to the proper dinner table. Gilmore is there, Eskil is there, Cassandra is there...
Marisha: We look fabulous.
Matt: You guys look fantastic.
Sam: They do.
Marisha: Yes. We do.
Matt: Fine outfits have been provided for the men, if they wish to wear them, as well. Some do not.
Taliesin: Oh, I am dressed.
Liam: I'm dressed, yeah.
Sam: Oh, I'll dress up. I'll dress up for dinner.
Matt: All righty. As you guys sit down, pleasantries are exchanged-- (yawns) Pardon me. You catch up a bit with Cassandra. Partway through--
Laura: Aw, Matt.
Matt: What?
Liam: E3, y'all.
Taliesin: Sit down, have a beer, watch our game.
Marisha: (laughs) 2 pm.
Matt: Within the next 15 minutes or so, before food is brought to the table, Allura finally enters in a very, very nice dress, and says, "It is so good to see you all are safe."
Marisha: Allura!
Ashley: Hello.
Laura: I give her a hug.
Matt: She then gives you a big, wonderful hug.
Laura: How's Kima? We haven't seen her yet.
Matt: "Well..." She looks over this way and Kima walks in, for the first time you've seen her really out of armor since you first saw her. Her hair is also in similar braids to her side and she herself is wearing a golden dress, though she's kind of like...
Travis: Yeah, I know the feeling. (laughter)
Matt: She comes in.
Marisha: Kima.
Matt: "Hello."
Ashley: Oh, you look lovely.
Marisha: Keyleth goes over and gives her a hug.
Matt: She gives you a hug and goes, "It's good to see you guys. I'm glad you're all right... This feels weird. Does this feel weird? This feels weird."
Marisha: It's only for a few hours. Don't worry about it.
Travis: What are you wearing?
Matt: "That's what I'm saying! Do I have to wear-- he's not wearing anything. Do I have to wear--"
Laura: You don't have to wear a dress, Kima.
Matt: "You don't have to wear it, Kima. It was just a suggestion."
Laura: (chuckles)
Matt: "I'm going to go change. I'll be right back."
Travis: Yeah, go change.
Matt: She darts off for a bit and Allura smiles and facepalms a bit.
Sam: You two are at the kiddie table. (laughter)
Liam: You ought to let her try that helmet on later.
Sam: Show some class, man.
Travis: (laughs)
Matt: You guys catch up a bit as Allura speaks about her and Drake's escape from Westruun. Kima eventually comes back, wearing ratty clothing. Shirt, pants, the general wear she'd pick up throughout the city. And is still carrying her small maul at her side. It's like her little comfort blanket. (thud) Next to the table.
Travis: Yeah. That's better.
Matt: She scoots up next to Allura. Gilmore snaps his fingers and wine begins to pour from the servants. Cassandra says, "Well, thank you all for coming. I believe there is much to get underway here. This,"a
Matt: And she gestures towards Gilmore and Allura; they nod. Eskil raises his hand a moment.
Matt: "So, while you've been gone. Allura, you've been doing this research for a bit." "Thank you, thank you. So, we've been trying to ascertain the nature of the ziggurat beneath the city. The ziggurat itself is built over what appears to be an ancient temple of Ioun. The glass substance, the diluted whitestone that has been reformed into glass, is used as a very strong arcane current. A lot of energy was being placed in this location, as there is an actual, what appears to be an arcane leyline, a nexus point, near and above Whitestone, hence the Sun Tree's placement."
Taliesin: Yes, of course.
Matt: "And why it flourishes so well in this region. But everything within a certain vicinity of this temple, of this dark spot, if you will, is eaten. Doesn't vanish, it's not cancelled, it's taken. Devoured. Everything placed within that small little globule of darkness is taken somewhere as well. Now, at first, we thought maybe it was just destroying, but the arcane energy we feel, the flow of it, it's drawing it somewhere. Meaning that this is not what I had feared to be a sphere of annihilation, an object of complete destruction. Instead it feels like it's a siphon. Now, a siphon. Siphons are very old. Siphons were used in the First War. They were used as a means of transferring extremely powerful... raw magical powers. They were placed strategically throughout the world's crust at these various nexus points as a means of creating extremely powerful relics. The ones that you seek, the ones that made the Vestiges themselves, were crafted through the use of some of these siphons, but they have been lost and, many thought, destroyed for a very long time, or at least inert. I have reason to believe that this may be one. And it may be active. As to where the other side lies, I do not know. Because each siphon has two points."
Taliesin: So it's fair to assume that at the other end of this is something old, something trapped, something hungry.
Matt: "Perhaps."
Laura: Would it be in this plane or another?
Matt: "I have no idea. Everything we've attempted to put through it that had any sort of magical connection, whether it be through inter-planal scrying, anything that would bring us to the other side of this, is crushed, consumed, and transferred as part of it. None of our rituals or enchantments will let us see through this spinning marble, as you call it."
Laura: You haven't put any blood through it, though?
Taliesin: Let's not.
Laura: No, I'm hoping that hasn't happened.
Marisha: So nothing survives the transfer. It is destroyed into its... purest components, it sounds.
Matt: "Seemingly, yes."
Liam: Or is it? Don't know? Is it that you have no idea what happened to things put through?
Matt: "We're still delving into it, and it may be a little while before we figure this out, but this is the best I can ascertain with my knowledge at my disposal. And the Realmseer and Gilmore can back up this research. We've all worked together these past weeks and we're all kind of coming to the same conclusion." She gestures to Gilmore. Gilmore says, "I've only been on this case personally for a few days of rising health standards in my body and I've thrown everything I can at it, honestly, and it's all just come to nothing. Gone. (pthbbt)"
Taliesin: This is disappointing.
Matt: "You're telling me."
Travis: What about a person?
Matt: "(laughing) I'm not sending a person through there."
Marisha: To be fair, Grog, I might have tried that, a little.
Sam: What?
Taliesin: Yes, that's right.
Marisha: I sort of stuck my hand in the spinning ball of death and let's just say I'm glad I'm still here standing with you all.
Laura: Was it sucking you in?
Marisha: It did a considerable amount of damage to my hand and definitely felt like it was sucking me in and I had to resist pretty hard. But it seems like anything that goes in that sphere doesn't come out the other end intact.
Laura: Gilmore-- any of you, Allura-- have you experienced any kind of draw toward the orb? Do you feel different, having been around it for very long?
Matt: Gilmore cocks a curious eye to the Realmseer. The Realmseer thinks and scratches his chin, looks to Allura. Allura looks down at the table with her arms crossed, looks to Kima. Kima's finishing her big drink. "I stay away from it. It creeps the hell out of me." "Not to my knowledge. Do you think we should be worried?"
Laura: Well, I don't know. I mean, it is a very strong relic that we don't know how it works.
Matt: "The difficulty in our research is most of our means of inspection are, well,"
Laura: Up close and personal.
Matt: "Of arcane nature."
Taliesin: I was hoping that perhaps we could talk about some engineering possibilities of finding ways that science can measure what it is where magic cannot. Something safe.
Sam: (scoffs) Science, Percy?
Taliesin: In this sense, as it stands.
Matt: "We're open to all possible suggestions. We're kind of at the end of our rope for the time being. We may send a few of us across the way to, well, a few different places for more information. May do a bit of traveling ourselves, it seems."
Taliesin: I'll sketch something with my copious free time.
Matt: "Hm. Please do."
Sam: No dragons have buzzed by here in our absence?
Matt: They kind of look to themselves. "None yet, but we've been very careful. We're in the process of installing some semblance of, (sighs) for lack of a better term, sort of a screen. Ways to reflect and perhaps cloud anyone who attempts to peer too far into the northern regions of Whitestone. The last thing we need is any of these dragons finding their way up north where you've kept all of us and the refugees safe, so we're trying not to piss any of them off, while also trying to make sure that maybe they're not really looking behind this curtain of cloud."
Taliesin: Any fortifications would be helpful.
Laura: Don't dragons sort of see past those things?
Matt: "We're doing our best to try and meet those standards."
Taliesin: I have another request in that direction that might help. If there was a way to spread the word in this city and amongst those who travel, to not speak of us. We should probably not be hailed in this city at all. Our names should be stricken from any record of it.
Matt: Allura leans forward on the table. "No, I see. You're right. There is merit in that, though it will be difficult. Many here look up to you. They see you as the salvation of this city. But I believe we can go about and speak with them and help instill the idea that it's for the better good that you are not mentioned."
Taliesin: Best to be nameless, at this point.
Marisha: It's for their own safety.
Taliesin: It's for everybody's.
Laura: We-who-must-not-be-named.
Sam: The Unmentionables.
Taliesin: (cracks up) You're a terrible person.
Laura: (gasps) I love it.
Marisha: Yeah. My choice is The Unmentionables. I like it.
Matt: Allura says, "I did find some research on some of these Vestiges you are seeking."
Taliesin: Oh!
Laura: Yes!
Matt: "From what I could bring forth from the Cobalt Reserve in Westruun, there is an artifact that lies in the Feywild, swallowed by a terrible tree."
Laura: Yes, the Warden.
Matt: "Is that the name of it?"
Laura: The Wrath of the Fey Warden.
Matt: "So you've found some information yourself?"
Laura: Just the name.
Sam: And that it's in the Feywild, but nothing more.
Matt: "(sighs) This tree that holds it, it's a tree seeded by the betrayal of an archfey whose hatred burned into a black heart of disease. The cleansing rivers of the Gilded Run prevent the spread of the Shademirk Bog that seeps from it."
Travis: Sounds nasty.
Matt: "It doesn't sound very fun, no."
Sam: The Shademark Balg?
Matt: "The Shademirk Bog."
Sam: Ugh, it sounds awful.
Matt: "It seeps from this tree. It is held at bay by the rivers of the Gilded Run."
Marisha: The rivers are called the Gilded Run?
Matt: "Mm-hm."
Sam: Okay. Well, that helps us. Those are clues.
Laura: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Marisha: And the Shademirk Bog pours out of the tree?
Laura: Out of the cancerous tree.
Marisha: The tree is responsible for a swampy bog.
Matt: "From best I could ascertain from my research, yes."
Laura: And Fen-wraths? What's the name?
Sam: Fenthras, Wrath of the Fey Warden.
Laura: Fenthras is inside of the tree that is terrible.
Matt: "It is very possible."
Taliesin: Oh no.
Sam: Okay.
Liam: Do you know anything about the Vestige itself?
Matt: "I don't, unfortunately. Most of the Cobalt Reserve was destroyed and I was under siege at the moment from the return of the dragons. (sighs)"
Laura: Did you happen to find in your research what, perhaps, we might face in the Feywild? I mean, we've learned a little bit of it, but I know that it's going to be rather dangerous.
Matt: "I've not been there myself, to be honest. It creeps me out."
Laura: (laughs)
Travis: (laughs) No? Sorry.
Matt: "I did find also about the Spire of Conflux. It is a staff that can bend the elements and was taken into The Abyss by Joran the Sea-Speaker, hero of the Verdant Expanse, about four centuries back, and was never heard from again."
Marisha: Joran the what?
Matt: "Joran the Sea-Speaker."
Sam: He speaks to the sea?
Matt: "Perhaps."
Taliesin: Or just the letter C.
Laura: (laughs)
Sam: Cookie Monster.
Travis: Hero.
Matt: "I do have some research about the dragons, as well."
Laura: Oh.
Matt: "I've done a bit of looking into the personality types, the habits of some of these chromatics you may be coming up against. The black dragon, you seemingly already dealt with, if word has come to me correctly."
Laura: Yes.
Matt: "Which is magnificent and well done. Very dangerous. Let's hope they don't decide to strike back soon."
Laura: Good thing we didn't provoke them in the cave at all, Percival.
Taliesin: If they came there, they would've been provoked, I figured.
Matt: "I did find that the white dragons, they're more primal. They're overall less intelligent than other chromatics." And some of this information you know.
Laura: Yeah, why am I writing this down? I know this shit.
Matt: "But what they do is they-- (sighs) well, don't let the lack of intelligence lull you into comfort. They are also unpredictable and raw. Dangerous hunters, they stalk in ruined lands of ice and vengeance. Their memory is eternal. They recall every slight defeat and have been known to hold vendettas for centuries and centuries. They despise other dragons and this loose alignment with Thordak is stranger than the others for the white dragon. Though Vorugal's distance to the others is intentional, most likely. I mean, the entire alignment between them is strange, anyway, but particularly with the white dragon. They generally steer very clear of, or are bent on destroying, any other types of dragons that may wander in their midst."
Laura: (whispering) Interesting.
Matt: "Green dragons, in particular, are manipulative. Liars, by nature, finding pleasure in power over others. Through deceit and promises of wealth and glory, they corrupt. They play subservience to other dragons, then plot their demise to claim their hoards. They're the seedy underbelly of the chromatic world, if you will. They amass powerful allies, human and beyond, to their will, bending them and using them as tools. Their life and their very presence is poison to those around them, and is the very basis of their danger. They corrupt the air around them to be venomous. I found a bit about this Raishan you mentioned, and word has spoken, though little that exists out there, that she is also a very practitioned weaver of the arcane arts, so be warned."
Marisha: So much so that she could almost pass as a druid wielding natural magic?
Matt: "I can imagine that's quite within her grasp. I've heard rumors of her calling the sky down upon her enemies. Previous individuals that hoped to raid her space were swallowed in quaking earth as she laughed from above."
Sam: Druid-y things.
Marisha: I want to kill her so hard. (strained) I want her to die.
Taliesin: Do we know where these-- where these dragons have been all this time, where they were banished to?
Matt: "I mean, most of these dragons lived their lives wherever they once were before. Raishan used to exist in the mountains outside of Syngorn and actually had amassed a sizeable horde of followers, lizard-men. Lizardfolk, all sorts."
Taliesin: Wait, then Thordak was banished to the Fire Plane?
Matt: "Thordak we had banished, yes. Thordak, in particular. Now, red dragons are true tyrants, built on impulse and rage. Arrogant to the core, they see themselves as rightful rulers over all. And Thordak, the king of all other dragons, as well. He is powerful enough to amass networks of spies and followers far beyond just the dragons that we've battled, I'm sure. So the more time that passes, the more powerful that network will become."
Laura: (muffled) Oh, fuck.
Taliesin: I've had a terrible thought, and it is sort of my business to have terrible thoughts. What else has been banished to the Fire Plane?
Travis: The djinn?
Taliesin: Well, I say this because if I were to slowly open the portal to the Fire Plane and power it and make it bigger and bigger and bigger, eventually it would be a hole into that dimension that's big enough for a dragon to fit through, but still not big enough for me, so I need to keep eating, to make it bigger.
Laura: (gasps)
Taliesin: And maybe they might be looking for what's down there so they can feed it and make a bigger hole. Just a thought. It may be nothing.
Laura: You think there's something bigger than Thordak in the Fire Plane?
Taliesin: I have terrible thoughts. It's a terrible thought.
Marisha: I mean, I'm sure there is something bigger than Thordak, probably in the Fire Plane, but the Fire Ashari closed the portal.
Taliesin: That may not have been the portal.
Marisha: That was the portal that Thordak came out of. It ripped apart my entire--
Taliesin: That may just be where he escaped. That power may still be flowing.
Marisha: Well, Allura, how did you lock him in the Fire Plane to begin with?
Matt: "Well, we had, through clever subterfuge, managed to have a member of our team work as a follower of Thordak, work into his greater trust and convince him that to perpetuate his wealth, his growth, his strength, that he needed to truly embrace the essence of fire. And there are crystals, there are remnants of the First War that exist in this world and others. The very core of the elemental chaos itself, the hearts of the titans left behind. These heart-stones are the very basis, or, at least, shadows of the basis of what made the elements when creation came to be. We had found one of these on the Fire Plane, but the nature of these is that they cannot be removed. If they are brought beyond the plane themselves, they generally shatter, and the few that can be brought across temporarily, the magics that contain them do weaken, and those that attempted to harness their power leave it to ruin, destroying all around them before it whirls itself into a frenzy of uncontrollable arcane mass and destroys everything nearby. These were many of the fools who ushered in the beginning of the Second War. So. Essentially, we convinced Thordak to find one of these in the plane and convinced him that he had the power to contain it. Once there, all of our forces gathered and we attacked him, pressed him down, and the gem that we had convinced him-- the heart-stone that we had convinced him to take into himself, well, we found a way to seal it, to banish it permanently to that plane so that he could not escape."
Marisha: All right. So, that's all good. But he did escape.
Laura: Could he still potentially have it inside of him?
Marisha: Exactly! That was my question!
Sam: Well, she asked it, so, technically, it's hers.
Matt: She turns and you can see Gilmore's sitting at the table like this. "I got a very good close at that dragon. A very good close look, to finish my sentence. I've been drinking plenty of wine tonight; don't judge me."
Ashley: Expensive-ass wine.
Taliesin: It's the best wine.
Matt: "It is very expensive, fine wine."
Travis: Matt’s Vineyard is the best.
Matt: "Thank you, Grog, it's wondrous."
Marisha: (laughs)
Matt: "But his mass, his unforeseen size to a creature like that. I couldn't help but notice that within his torso there was a pulsing heart... of red glass."
Laura: All right.
Taliesin: Look how clever food makes all of us.
Matt: He looks over to Allura. Allura nods. "Well, if that is the case, then it's, I think, there's very much a chance that he did escape with the heart-stone intact."
Travis: I have a question. We've got one of the Vestiges in these Titanstone Knuckles, made from the heart-stone. If I left the plane with these, are they gonna blow everybody up?
Matt: "An intact heart-stone is the true source of power. Those have been carved from one, an inert one, or, at least, they carry but a smidgen of the power. I think you're safe, Grog."
Travis: Oh, thank god.
Ashley: Phew.
Laura: Which one?
Travis: Kord.
Laura: Oh, Kord. I got it. (chuckles)
Matt: Allura leans in again. "I have been keeping an eye on Emon from this distance, as well. It seems that Thordak's very essence twists the land with elemental magic."
Travis: (whispering) Oh, shit.
Matt: "My distant views of the city have shown the center of the town cracked with volcanic fire as he digs and burrows beneath the city itself."
Taliesin: (whispering) Fuck.
Laura: Oh, fuck.
Travis: Wait, why is he digging and burrowing?
Liam: He's reshaping the land as he sees fit.
Travis: Or is he looking for something?
Laura: Because he's a dick.
Travis: Is he not looking for something?
Taliesin: He might be looking for something, or might be making--
Marisha: So these heart-stones embrace the essence of where they reside?
Matt: "Their essence is created where they reside."
Marisha: And he has the heart-stone of the Fire Elemental Plane living inside of him.
Matt: "A heart-stone. There are many."
Marisha: A heart-stone. Right.
Laura: I'm confused.
Travis: I need more wine. Do you think he was just making himself at home, or do you think he was looking for something?
Matt: "I don't know. He seems pretty lax. From what I could tell from my investigations, the major step in the Conclave's plan is already over."
Laura: Take over everything.
Matt: "Now they settle into the divided territories and forget each other. Now, I feel that Thordak is far too old and covetous to be content with just Emon. Now, this was vengeance, which is now complete. Who knows what the next stage in his terrible design is."
Marisha: So you're thinking the Chroma Conclave was simply a temporary alliance?
Matt: "There are very few permanent alliances between chromatic dragons."
Laura: Well, that's good.
Marisha: We can use this.
Laura: Maybe they won't take vengeance.
Ashley: Maybe we can get one of them on our side.
Taliesin: We can only be so hopeful that they tear each other apart.
Laura: Maybe the white one will want to help kill Thordak with us.
Marisha: Turning them against each other is not a bad idea.
Taliesin: Our best hope, at this point, is just to amass power. We are not strong enough.
Laura: No.
Taliesin: But we will get stronger.
Laura: Does the heart-stone make him even stronger than he already was?
Matt: "I don't know, but he was not that large when we sealed him."
Laura: Shit.
Travis: Seize.
Marisha: So we can take-- yeah.
Laura: If we can pry it out of his body, we could shrink him down. Perfect plan.
Sam: Then we could go inside a dragon again.
Laura: We can go in another dragon.
Liam: Every one of them, one after the other.
Travis: You seen any dragons on the outskirts of the town? Have there been any flyovers or close calls within, say, 50 to 100 miles or so? Any reports?
Matt: "Hundred miles. There were reports of the white dragon a week ago, south of us. Far south of us."
Travis: Far south.
Laura: Doing what, just flying?
Matt: "Just flying. Flying east."
Taliesin: Unless they know what's underneath the castle, there's nothing of value here.
Liam: Do we know where Vorugal has taken up roost? No one knows?
Matt: "No. I've tried to scry, but they're apparently protected against that now."
Travis: What about means of protection for Whitestone. Do you have a defense planned? A warning system?
Matt: "We're just getting now to that point. It may be a few weeks before we're ready to go. It's a lot to build and it's a very big space to protect, but me and Drake are working on some ideas. (sighs)"
Marisha: Do you know exactly how these heart-stones are forged?
Matt: "They're not forged. They existed. They were the hearts of the primordial titans that existed on this world before the gods even came here."
Marisha: Oh, that's right.
Laura: Wow.
Matt: "They were the true denizens of this world, before any of us."
Sam: This is an awesome dinner, by the way. Super good.
Laura: So good.
Taliesin: I love game meat.
Matt: "I'm sorry, it's been a very tense time."
Laura: This wine is pretty good.
Ashley: It's very good.
Matt: "Perhaps rest is in order for all of us. It's been a lot. I'm so sorry. It's good to see all of you."
Travis: You, as well.
Laura: You've done so much.
Matt: Allura brightens up a little bit. You can see that she feels guilty that she just did this information dump and is like, "(sighs) It's good to see all of you."
Marisha: It was good to see you.
Matt: "(sighs) Well, let us rest for the evening." Drinks the last of her wine, stands up. "We'll talk on the morrow." She gets up. "Kima?" "I'm coming, let me finish."
Laura: (laugh)
Marisha: (laugh)
Matt: "No, seriously, it's good to see you all. I'm glad you're all right."
Laura: You should have been with us.
Matt: "I should've been with you. I didn't know you left!"
Laura: Sorry, Kima. We're dicks.
Matt: "Is Westruun okay?"
Laura: It's... better.
Marisha: (whispering) It's not great, though.
Laura: It's getting better.
Taliesin: It lives. It lives.
Sam: That's true.
Marisha: It stands.
Matt: "Does my house still stand?" (hesitant noises)
Sam: What's a house, really, but a bunch of bricks.
Matt: "Oh, it's fine."
Marisha: Home is where you make it, Kima.
Matt: "Object impermanence. (glug glug) Next time you're going there, you tell me."
Laura: Oh, yes. We will.
Taliesin: We will be returning.
Travis: On one condition. Don't wear any more dresses.
Laura: (laughs)
Matt: "You saying I wasn't pretty, Grog?"
Travis: I like you in your armor better.
Matt: "That's why I missed you." She reaches out and smacks your cheek.
Travis: Yeah. (laughter)
Matt: "All right, kiddies, sleep it is." Kima gets up and joins Allura, and they both leave. Gilmore stands up, Realmseer stands up. "All right, everyone. Rest well. See you in the morning. And, ah, glad you're all safe."
Liam: Good night, Shaun.
Matt: "Good night, everyone."
Ashley: Good night, Gilmore.
Matt: "Sleep well."
Matt: They all leave.
Sam: So we rest here for a night or two and then, to the Feywild?
Travis: Yeah, Feywild.
Sam: Or to the--
Travis: We even have a geographic-- demographic location to like--
Sam: True.
Marisha: We do.
Taliesin: I feel like the Feywild calls to us.
Liam: What do you say we go get you a new bow?
Laura: We could go get me a new bow. There's also the ocean.
Sam: Yeah.
Liam: Nah. Let's get you a bow.
Marisha: Let's go get you a bow.
Ashley: I'm going to pour another glass of wine.
Taliesin: Ocean next.
Sam: Pike could go off to get the ocean one herself.
Laura: No! You're crazy.
Liam: That's a shitty idea.
Matt: (laughs)
Travis: I think you've had too much to drink, Scanlan.
Laura: Or the two of you together.
Sam: Yeah, I like the ocean. I don't really like the ocean. (laughter)
Matt: You guys all going to rest?
Marisha: I have one thing I'd like to do.
Matt: Okay, what do you want to do?
Marisha: I want to go back to our little cave that we dug out under where the Sun Tree is. Is that still there?
Matt: Yeah, it's still there.
Marisha: I want to go there, and I want to kind of sit down and meditate for a second. And I want to cast Speak With Plants and have a little chat with the Sun Tree.
Matt: Okay. (laughs) You cast the spell, you reach out and touch the roots of the tree, the roots of which have more color than they did before. The dull gray has become more of a full brown. The earth here smells of fresh, damp earth. The tree, while still in the winter phase, is definitely teeming with life, to where it once didn't.
Marisha: I reach out and I touch the roots. Can I just kind of feel, sense the arcane ley-lines that Allura was talking about that the tree's in the center of?
Matt: Mmm... not really. In speaking to the tree, you can ask questions, but you're not quite-- you find yourself unable to tune into that or tap into that source of magic. At this place, at least.
Marisha: Okay. So I just reach out, touch the tree, and say, "Hey, old friend. How are you feeling? Doing better?"
Matt: "Hey, bud. Much better." (laughter)
Marisha: You're pretty cool, Sun Tree.
Matt: "Sun Tree, A-OK." (laughter)
Marisha: Hey, Sun Tree?
Matt: "Yeah?"
Marisha: I was just wondering if you knew-- if you could tell me anything about this terrible cancerous tree in the Feywild, if you knew anything about it? He might be like your brother or something.
Matt: "Tree cancer? What?"
Marisha: No! No, okay. There's this tree in the Feywild and it might have a man living in it called Fenthras.
Travis: (quietly) The bow.
Marisha: No, sorry, that's the name of the bow, the bow is in it, named Fenthras, and it might be a really sick tree. Can you tell me where there's a really sick tree, maybe in the Feywild?
Matt: "That sounds sad, but no. I don't know a tree like that, sorry. I've been here in Whitestone since day one." (laughter)
Liam: Want to play hacky sack?
Taliesin: Born and raised.
Matt: So I graduated from Berkeley and made my way to Whitestone. (laughter)
Travis: My twigs smoke the doob.
Sam: "Barkeley."
Marisha: "Barkeley!"
Ashley: Put a pair of Birkenstocks on its branches.
Travis: "Birkenstalks."
Matt: (groans)
Laura: "Birkenstalks?" I like it.
Marisha: Hey, Sun Tree?
Matt: "Yeah?"
Marisha: You apparently kind of live in the middle of all these arcane ley-lines of the world.
Matt: "Yeah."
Taliesin: (cracks up)
Marisha: How far do those stretch?
Matt: "Long way, Kiki. Long way." (laughter)
Marisha: Can you kind of give me a rough idea? Do they go to the other side of the world? Can you stretch all over the world?
Matt: "Nah, just right here. Pelor put me here for a reason."
Marisha: Who? Pelor?
Matt: "Yeah."
Marisha: Right. So you're not a natural tree, you're a tree from the gods?
Matt: "Sure."
Marisha: All right. Well, anyway, you're really awesome, Sun Tree.
Matt: "Speak for yourself, Kiki."
Marisha: Yeah, you're so cool. Okay, so it was good talking to you.
Matt: "You, too."
Marisha: I'll walk through you soon. Okay, bye.
Matt: (laughs)
Marisha: And then I leave.
Matt: All right.
Laura: I want to make a once-over on Vax and make sure that-- So you did, you got all the blood off, then?
Liam: What are you doing? Yeah, I took a bath.
Laura: I mean, we got all cleaned up for tonight. I just want to make sure you didn't ruin it by keeping some of the blood in your freaking hair.
Liam: Don't I look all right? I'm fine! What's your problem?
Laura: Nothing! Just making sure you're doing all right.
Liam: Yeah.
Laura: All the blood's gone.
Liam: Yeah. It's all gone.
Laura: You're great.
Liam: I'm doing much better.
Laura: Good.
Liam: Much better. You ready for the Feywild?
Laura: Fuck, no, not ready, but we can do it.
Liam: Oh.
Taliesin: Stupid to settle.
Marisha: (snorts)
Laura: I walk over to Percy.
Taliesin: I was about to walk out the door, but if you're walking--
Laura: Before you leave, I whisper in your ear, "You still have a little blood behind your ear."
Travis: (gasps)
Taliesin: Do you want to take a walk with me?
Laura: (sighs) Sure.
Taliesin: We take a very quiet walk around Whitestone. I want to pass all of the temples that are either still standing or destroyed. I just want to take a temple tour. Not stopping, not talking, I just want to see what they look like. Pelor looks good. The one in the cemetery?
Matt: The one in the cemetery is still under construction. That one needs a little more work.
Taliesin: While in the cemetery-- I assume that it's still a mess.
Matt: Most of the graves have been refilled, the corpses have been brought back. Most of the dead that were brought forth from the previous owners have been returned. That was one of the first orders of business that people who live here did, was to return their families to the earth.
Taliesin: There were a couple of lords' crypts in there. Was there an Anders family crypt, at one point?
Matt: There would have been, yeah.
Taliesin: Cool. All right. I'm going to walk back to the castle, with you in tow, and I'm going to find Zahra.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Are you going to tell me why you went and saw the Raven Queen?
Taliesin: Yes. Come.
Matt: All right. You come back to the study where you originally found Zahra. She's still there poring over books, but is now half-asleep. She has a little candle that's starting to flicker out and she has her feet up on the desk and her tail's kind of curled up and she's falling asleep into the book as you walk in.
Laura: (whispering) Dear--
Matt: "What?"
Laura: We all need sleep sometimes, hon.
Matt: "Sleep's for the boring."
Taliesin: I have a task for you, if you have the time and energy for something a bit quiet, but necessary.
Matt: "What do you ask, Percy?"
Taliesin: I'm going to have the deeds to the Anders family crypt transferred to your name. I want you to clean it out. Throw the bodies wherever; he has disgraced himself. Clean them. And if you can, if you can find people who can do it, I want to very quietly, in that crypt, create a small shrine to the Raven Queen. This will help. And I bring out the vial of blood from the pit. Perhaps they will know what to do with that.
Matt: "Intriguing."
Taliesin: But I would like her to have a quiet mark in this city.
Laura: Is this for you, or for my brother?
Taliesin: ...It's for your brother, so that he can help us. We're apparently all in this together.
Laura: I give Percy a kiss on the cheek.
Taliesin: Oh. Thank you.
Matt: "All right."
Taliesin: We need all the help we can get.
Matt: "Very well. I'm sure it can be done. I never owned a crypt before. I'm excited."
Laura: It's exciting. (laughs)
Matt: She takes the vial and puts it on the table.
Laura: I think it suits you.
Taliesin: Tell anyone you'd like where I went. It's not a secret. I just wasn't ready to... I don't think your brother-- I would hate for him to think I'm competing. I just had some questions.
Laura: I won't tell anyone, Percy.
Taliesin: Thank you.
Laura: Your business is yours. And mine, because I noticed. (chuckles)
Marisha: (snorts)
Taliesin: Thank you for noticing, and... I'm trying hard not to make it my business. It's hard to remember sometimes.
Taliesin: (sighs)
Laura: (quietly) We're all family.
Taliesin: That's awful, isn't it. (sighs) I'm going to go to my room--
Laura: Oh! Percy!
Taliesin: Yes?
Laura: Sorry. If Zahra wanted to make some dragon arrows, could she use stuff here in the castle?
Taliesin: I'll talk to my sister on the way out. I'll write her a letter and see if they can-- they may have to delve into our materials for it, but I think we're good.
Laura: Yes.
Taliesin: We'll talk about using our materials for such a thing, and I will talk to her about that.
Laura: All right.
Taliesin: I'm going to do my little thing and if it works, great, and if not, we'll speak not of it for a while.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and make your tinkering check.
Taliesin: Better! 30.
Matt: That'll do.
Taliesin: I craft a brooch. It's not even a brooch, it's a clasp. I had built these pieces of it earlier on in the game. For the last three weeks I've been working on this. I've taken the raven skull that you gave me and made a mold and poured melted silver into a bird skull, a silver bird skull. Taken a ruby and set it behind it, built it into a clasp that does not reflect, and in it, put a sachet of-- satchel...
Marisha: Sachet.
Laura: Sachet.
Taliesin: Thank you. My brain? Coffee. Of myrrh and--
Sam: Frankincense?
Taliesin: (snorts and laughs) Myrrh, sandalwood, opium, and dragon's blood. Not real dragon's blood, but dragon's blood--
Sam: True blood.
Taliesin: Sap. It's a sap. It's a tree sap. Put the whole thing together.
Liam: You've had opium this whole time and you never...
Taliesin: It's not, it's just poppy.
Laura: What does it do?
Taliesin: You will find out when I present it.
Matt: All right. Everyone else going to rest?
Travis: No. I ran out of dinner super fast and I ran outside of Vax's room and I took the jug and I whispered into it, "oil," and I poured one quart of oil on the ground outside of his door. Looked around real quick. Is there anyone in the hallway?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Travis: 10.
Matt: Looks clear.
Travis: (giggles) And I run away. (laughter)
Matt: All righty.
Liam: That was super awesome and I can't wait to see the outcome, but before that happens, I was standing right here when these two walked off, so I am waiting in the exact same spot for my sister to return.
Matt: A lot of time passes.
Liam: It's fine.
Matt: A few hours pass before she returns, but she eventually does.
Laura: Are you still here? You should go to bed.
Liam: I will. I took a little bit of a nap.
Laura: In the dining hall?
Liam: Yeah.
Laura: What?
Liam: You're a grown-ass woman, and you're twice as strong as I am.
Laura: I know.
Liam: So your business is your business. Just... both eyes open, yeah?
Laura: Always. (chuckles) I'm very perceptive.
Laura: (cackles)
Liam: Don't do that to me.
Taliesin: That's two. Two winks! Ah hah hah.
Liam: Please don't ever do that to me again.
Laura: I love you so much.
Liam: And if you do, you will never use that wink on me again. It is not for me.
Laura: All right.
Liam: Just... he's charming, but both eyes open, please.
Laura: I don't know what you are talking about.
Liam: Yeah, the fuck you don't. I'm going to go to my room now and see if I splat on the floor.
Matt: All right, make a perception check.
Travis: Come on, big money, no whammies. (laughter)
Laura: Ohhh.
Liam: Sorry, buddy, it's a 31.
Matt: As you approach the door, you look down and see a smear of dark, reflective oil across the walkway about two feet leading up to your room. You guys have a cluster of rooms in this long hallway, and it arcs around like an L. So you guys are in this big L of all your rooms scattered throughout.
Liam: How thick is it? Is it viscous?
Matt: Yeah, it's pretty slippery.
Liam: Put my hand in it. Does that stay?
Matt: The hand stays for a minute, then--
Liam: Goes away.
Matt: Yeah, it's pretty thick.
Liam: All right.
Matt: Also has a fume to it.
Liam: Okay. I'm going to scrape a bunch of it up just into my hand, so I have a big handful of it, and I'm just going to go to Grog's room, and I'm going to slowly, just at the door, take time to write, Grog smells like farts and--
Laura: I walk by him as he's doing this and say, You know he can't read, right?
Marisha: (laughs)
Liam: I picked specifically small words! (laughter)
Liam: Poo.
Taliesin: Oh, he can read that.
Liam: And I draw-- No. I'll tell you what I do. Pull down my breeches and I put the oil on my butt and I go (squelch). (laughter)
Liam: A little signature.
Matt: All right. Well done.
Taliesin: Preschoolers run amok in my gentle abode.
Liam: Get busy living or get busy dying. Butt-print.
Matt: All right. You guys all get into bed. Anything else you want to get done?
Sam: I just told Pike she looked real pretty tonight and I go back to my reading.
Matt: Okay. You guys all find yourselves back to your respective rooms, resting for the night. Some doors adorned differently than others. Partway into the evening's resting, we'll say the wee hours of the morning, post-midnight or so, your door opens slightly, Vax. You hear a little (knocking sound) on your door.
Liam: Yes?
Matt: You look over and you see Gilmore pop his head in with a soft smile. "I'm sorry if I'm waking you up."
Liam: It's all right.
Matt: "Here." And he produces what looks like a folded pile of material and throws it on the foot of your bed and goes, "Come, Vax, I made you a gift. Put it on, come walk with me awhile. We have a lot to talk about."
Liam: I open it up.
Matt: It's a very well-crafted silk robe of dark blue and black. Beaded, nice against the skin. It's really, really nice.
Liam: (quietly) Give me a minute. (louder) There's a wooden screen in the room. I go behind it and wipe any oil left off my butt. (laughter)
Matt: That's fantastic.
Liam: Everything looks all right. And I put it on.
Matt: All right. He waits for you patiently in the hallway. So he begins walking along. Puts his arm out to you.
Liam: Take it.
Matt: You take his arm. You guys walk up along the hallway. He leads you to a staircase that leads up further, and he goes, "I know a lot has happened these recent months. I've been watching from afar, keeping tabs on your journey best that I can. But I still know so little." You ascend the lengthy staircase and you make your way to the higher floor. You eventually open an intricate door and walk out onto a wide balcony on that tower that overlooks the grounds and the castle before you. Beautiful moonlight, the night air. You see the moon is nearly full and the white light illuminates the densely-forested countryside surrounding the castle. He closes the door and walks up to you at the edge of the balcony, looking over it all, elbows on the edge. "Some time has passed, Vax. And much of the world moves on to newer, greater threats. But true pain never really heals." He turns to you and steps up to you, looking you close in the face. "You hurt me deeply. And continue to hurt. Agony, for weeks, months. Pain I had never experienced. (deepening to a growl) It's all I can think about."
Liam: Can I make an insight check?
Matt: You would, if you had time.
Marisha: Oh my god!
Laura: (gasps) I knew it. I knew it.
Marisha: No!
Matt: The pain hits you suddenly, before anything else does, as you're lost in that face and the sudden feeling, the sensation of terror and horror. You suffer 18 points of piercing damage, and I need you to make a constitution saving throw.
Liam: Oh, that's my specialty.
Taliesin: (whispering) We don't know what the hell this is.
Liam: Constitution save?
Matt: Mm-hmm.
Liam: 11.
Matt: You feel the poison--
Liam: I'll use luck.
Matt: Roll again.
Liam: 18.
Matt: You feel what should be a pulse of poison hit your system and you manage to fight it off as suddenly you look down and there is Gilmore holding a blade thrust into your stomach, your robes now beginning to fill with crimson red around the wound. It's at that moment you see him pull you in and stare into your face with a very low growl, "It's all I think about." And you watch as a flicker to his form happens and you see for a second there's a flash: not skin, but fur. You see teeth, you see whiskers, and the hand holding the dagger is facing the other direction. That's where we're going to end tonight's session. (shocked exclamations)
Marisha: Nooo!
Laura: The rakshasa?
Marisha: Is it a rakshasa?
Matt: (laughs)
Laura: Oh my god.
Travis: Ohhhh.
Matt: We'll be back next week.
Liam: That fucked with my head, Matt.
Liam: What are you doing?
Taliesin: Wow.
Matt: What a rakshasa does.
Sam: Good job, man.
Laura: Oh my god.
Marisha: What the fuck?!
Taliesin: Wow.
Marisha: Has he been a rakshasa the whole time? Wait, is it the rakshasa who's different? Is it not Gilmore? So many questions!
Liam: (laugh)
Matt: (laugh)
Matt: Perhaps this will be revealed next week as we kick in at this very moment.
Laura: Oh my god. Why does it always leave off when he's about to get killed?
Marisha: Right! Why is it always you?
Sam: Because he's always almost about to die.
Liam: This one did die!
Taliesin: Because he runs into all the rooms first and he makes out with everybody.
Laura: Because you do. That's the thing.
Taliesin: That's why it happens.
Taliesin: He runs into the rooms first and he puts his tongue exciting places.
Marisha: (laugh)
Laura: (laugh)
Matt: You also happened to lean in real close--
Taliesin: I'm not yelling at you, man. I'm envious.
Matt: And whisper in the ear of the rakshasa as he slowly slit its throat across the floor.
Travis: Oh, that's right, you did do that.
Laura: Oh, so what did you do? What did you do?
Liam: I slit its throat, yeah.
Matt: Yeah.
Liam: It's all right.
Marisha: Hang on, wait.
Matt: It just wants to come back and show you the same love.
Marisha: Oh, wait, did you get the final blow in the rakshasa in the Slayer's Take?
Liam: Yes, I did. Yeah, I cut his throat.
Laura: And you said something shitty to him.
Liam: He threatened my family and I said, "Say something about my sister again," and I slit his throat.
Laura: Oh, nice!
Matt: Oh, boy.
Taliesin: It's about to drop.
Marisha: But he was dead. What the fuck is going on?!
Laura: Was he? Did you chop him up?
Marisha: No, because I'm not a psycho.
Sam: This is exciting.
Matt: This will be interesting next week when we kick in.
Taliesin: There's a fine line between psycho and practical.
Marisha: I can see chopping someone's body up might be psycho.
Taliesin: It's not psycho if you drive a very small car with not a lot of trunk space.
Travis: Nicely done, Matt.
Laura: Nice, Matt.
Matt: Guys, great game tonight.
Laura: Thanks, guys.
Travis: That Raven Queen, whoo.
Liam: Whoo.
Laura: That can be the name of the episode: Yas Queen. (laughter)
Matt: Awesome. Well, guys, we're going to go ahead and get home and rest. Hope you enjoyed tonight's episode.
Taliesin: Is there going to be one more giveaway?
Matt: Is there?
Laura: Are we doing another giveaway?
Liam: There were two Loot Crates, one--
Lucas: We'll do a giveaway afterwards.
Matt: Okay, we'll do a giveaway afterwards. Perfect. One more DX Loot Crate box coming your way.
Laura: Thanks, Loot Crate!
Liam: Thanks, Joe Madureira, for the art!
Laura: Thanks, Joe!
Ashley: Get your posters!
Taliesin: It's so cool.
Laura: Thanks, Critters, for being awesome!
Matt: Hope you guys got to enjoy our silly E3 couple hours we did earlier on GameSpot. I'm sure that'll go up soon, anyway. But anyway, guys, we'll see you next week. Until then, rest well and, is it Thursday yet? See you then.

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around, roll dice and play Dungeons & Dragons. This week, not in costume, to the joy of all of my players. So welcome back. We're going to hop in here in a moment, but first, let's get through our announcements. First and foremost, this week's sponsor is the continuation of Loot Crate being our awesome sponsor. (cheering)
Matt: Thank you so much Loot Crate. I think we announced the new theme for this month's loot crate last week, but Sam, if you would like to give us a couple of words on our sponsor, please.
Sam: I am running out of things to say. So instead, I composed a little song, and I thought that Miss Ashley Johnson could help me with it.
Ashley: Okay?
Sam: I'm going to sing a couple of lines, and it will be very apparent what the rhyming word is, and you chime in with that. Little known fact, Ashley Johnson, beautiful singing voice, she's a soprano.
Ashley: I am! Yes, and?
Sam: Here's a song for Loot Crate. Okay. Ashley, I need you to focus here. It's to the tune of the Beverly Hillbillies. (singing) Well, yeehaw for nerd swag, let's all give a big hoot. You get a pretty crate and they fill it with--
Ashley: Loot!
Sam: Very good! (singing) With gear and apparel that'll make you look real cute. You'll even be attractive when your butt makes a--
Ashley: Toot!
Sam: Very good. (singing) Subscribe with the link that pops up on your computer. With the dough that you saved, buy some hot wings at--
Ashley: Hooters!
Sam: Very good. (singing) You'll be all hot and bothered even if you're spayed or neutered. So pull down your skirt, and stick that loot in your--
Ashley: Cooter!
Sam: No! It's in your crate. You put your loot in your crate.
Ashley: Oh, sorry.
Sam: That's disgusting. That's disgusting, Ashley. Jesus!
Matt: That's really inappropriate.
Sam: Jesus, why would you stick it in your cooter?
Ashley: It made all the sense.
Sam: Holy shit! Loot in a Loot Crate. Good God! Anyway, magic everyone. Sign up and use the exclusive promo code-- Wait a second, there's a new promo code?
Travis: It's new, yeah. Five dollars off Loot Crate and Loot Crate DX if you use promo code CHAOTICGOOD. All caps, one word.
Sam: Go check it out guys. I'm done.
Liam: Sam Riegel, you are against the law.
Travis: The code is only good for 48 hours.
Sam: Wait, is that true?
Travis: It is true. 48 hours only.
Sam: I should read these before I do the ads.
Travis: CHAOTICGOOD!
Matt: Thank you, Sam; I appreciate it. Ashley, you really need to clean that mouth.
Ashley: You know, there is only one place to put loot.
Matt: Really, keep it in your crate, guys, highly recommended.
Taliesin: Keep it in your crate.
Laura: Keep it in your crate.
Ashley: Keep it in your crate.
Matt: #keepitinyourcrate. So yes. Thank you Loot Crate for being our awesome sponsor. Other announcements: BlizzCon this weekend! For those who are going to be there, a number of us are going to be there. There are panels Friday. Who is going to be there Friday?
Liam: Friday! There.
Matt: There you go. Me and Liam will be there Friday. A number of other of us will be wandering the halls.
Travis: I will be in the bathrooms.
Laura: Just hanging out.
Matt: Just chilling. Just looking to massage folks as they come in? Taking tips?
Travis: Ask if they need their hands dried.
Matt: So look for that at BlizzCon. Those of us who have our schedules and have posted them on our twitter, and will probably post it tomorrow as well, so keep an eye out. Hope to see you guys there. Also, new GM Tips went up today, on YouTube. You guys can check it out; it's every week Wednesday on Alpha and then Thursday on YouTube. This week's episode deals with trying to get your players to engage more in actual roleplaying, in-character in your sessions. So go ahead and check it out. Hopefully it will be helpful for some of you new and old GMs out there. And let us know what you think. Also, Marisha, if you want to talk about the new Spotify playlists that we have coming up here.
Marisha: Oh yeah! We did those awesome playlists like a year ago, and if you didn't know, by the way, we did playlists about a year ago, each one of us, for our characters. You should go and check them out. They are deep somewhere in the Geek and Sundry website.
Laura: What's this?
Marisha: Our Spotify playlists.
Laura: Dude, they were so good!
Marisha: They were really good!
Laura: And they give really good background into our characters.
Marisha: Yeah, they actually give a lot of insight, if you pay attention. So yeah! Go look at our playlists, because we are going to be doing a round two, starting next week. Because it has been like 50 some odd episodes, and a lot of shit has happened.
Travis: Mine is just going to be animal noises. (braying)
Laura: What animal was that?
Travis: You wish you knew. Check out the playlist to find out!
Liam: It's just 12 tracks of whale song? (whale song) (whale songs)
Liam: (Grog impersonation) This is me when I'm sad. This is me when I'm happy.
Travis: He found a tape recorder.
Matt: It is all Sesame Street. All the time. All right, well, awesome! Keep an eye out for that. Starting next week, we will have info available on the Geek & Sundry website and our Twitter, as soon as that becomes available. Anything else that anyone wants to announce? So glad you could be here with us this week, Ashley! (cheering)
Ashley: Very spur of the moment. That's it. (laughter)
Sam: Are we going to do this thing at the break? Is that happening? What are we going to do?
Laura: Yes!
Taliesin: Oh, that thing.
Laura: So our critical costumes contest. We are announcing the winners after the break!
Liam: After we choose them on the break.
Laura: No, we have all been looking at them. We all have our personals, but now we have to fight amongst ourselves and duke it out for the winner.
Ashley: We need to fight. We are having a real battle.
Travis: We have Nerf Guns.
Marisha: And Jello.
Taliesin: And sticks!
Travis: You brought Jello?
Matt: It is going to be fantastic. For the record You guys are ridiculous!
Laura: They are amazing!
Matt: Those costume entries, every single one was amazing!
Marisha: Yes.
Taliesin: Cats.
Matt: There were cats in costume!
Laura: Victor cat!
Matt: I can't even.
Taliesin: Scanlan cat.
Ashley: Can we do one with just animals, sometime? Like during the Westminster Dog Show?
Taliesin: Just cats! Critical Cats!
Laura: Critter Critters!
Matt: We have already lost control. This has already gone. We are over it. We have peaked. We are done.
Travis: Also Talks. Talks Machina will be live every Tuesday at 7:00pm on Alpha. Every week, there will be like two to three of us on there, answering questions, giving insight.
Laura: When does it start?
Travis: November...
All: 15th!
Travis: It will be on there, and you can find out all of the juicy details, who Grog is really in love with. And you can follow @talksmachina on (shouts) Twitter! There are so many cool things! There will be gift giveaways and all sorts of stuff.
Marisha: Yay.
Matt: Thank you, Travis! It's exciting.
Marisha: It's fun.
Travis: Yeah, it's going to be fun. We are going to haze Brian Foster every single week.
Marisha: Oh no, he hazes us, man.
Taliesin: Yeah, it was kind of intense.
Liam: He's an OG D&D player, though, right? Like decades of Dungeons & Dragons.
Laura: Yeah, he's old school. He's old school.
Liam: Always checking me in my rolls, on my choices in the game.
Laura: He's off-camera laughing at us.
Liam: Who I talk to on any given afternoon. It is all I hear about. I'll do what I want, Brian! It's D&D!
Matt: So you can look forward to more of that on Talks Machina.
Taliesin: D&D  there's no wrong way to play except our way.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: Indeed. Well then, on that note, let's go and bring us onto the happy day-glo lives of Vox Machina right now, and Exandria, as we step into tonight's episode of Critical Role
Taliesin: Sparkle, sparkle, sparkle, friendship! [dramatic music]
Matt: Hello, and welcome back. While we were away, we learned much about the anatomy of the basilisk. Thank you, Liam.
Liam: Welcome!
Matt: All right. So bringing us into tonight's episode. Vox Machina, in their attempt to take down the Chroma Conclave, have slain three of the five dragons. They've made a tentative alliance with a fourth: Raishan, the Diseased Deceiver, in the hopes of taking down the fifth, and most powerful master of the entire Conclave: Thordak, the Cinder King, who currently resides over the now elementally corrupt city of Emon, with the ground itself beginning to boil and crack with fire elemental energy. You all sit within Whitestone, deciding upon the coming rush to the final battle, considering what allies you have at your disposal, what locations you want to put this battle in. You've had these conversations. You've revealed Raishan to the rest of your allies within Whitestone, and you've previously spoke about taking this to Fort Daxio to the north of Emon. And that was where we last left off. As you finish your conversation with the rest of your current temporary council on the ziggurat beneath Whitestone, you've made the choice of Fort Daxio as being your next grounds of conflict. What do you wish to do? (laughter)
Sam: You think we finished our conversation, but we have about an hour of more talking to do. (laughter)
Marisha: What if we get an airship, and put the ziggurat inside of it?
Sam: Oh, okay!
Laura: What?
Taliesin: What?
Ashley: I have an idea! (laughter)
Laura: We should go to Fort Daxio then. And talk to them.
Sam: Did we need to send word to all of our allies that that is where we are going? Has that been done already?
Marisha: I feel we need to scout the location first?
Taliesin: Let's scout first, let's head there and then if everything seems copacetic.
Sam: How do we get there?
Taliesin: By airship!
Laura: By the fabulous Keyleth.
Marisha: Let me scry, then we will bamf through a tree. Sound good?
Laura: Can you scry here though? We are by the Orb of Death.
Marisha: No, we have to go.
Sam: Hold on! Let me go get Pike.
Marisha: Yes!
Sam: I got her, guys! She's here!
Ashley: Hey! Oh man!
Travis: Oh, Pike. Good to see you. High five!
Sam: Wow! We almost left without her.
Ashley: Wait, so he said we were going to Fort Daxio?
Laura: Yeah. We are totally going to Fort Daxio.
Ashley: Okay! That sounds--
Laura: That's where we are going to amass our forces. Potentially.
Ashley: I think it is a great idea. On our walk, we talked about it, and I think that it is a really good idea.
Travis: The Monstah has spoken.
Sam: Now it's unanimous.
Liam: Sure.
Sam: Wait, can she scry? Do you need to scry? Do we have scrying things?
Marisha: I can scry. Yeah. I got my Scry Ball.
Matt: Who are you scrying?
Marisha: I am-- Do we know someone in Fort Daxio?
Taliesin: We do! We do.
Laura: We do?
Taliesin: Because your--
Laura: My shit father?
Taliesin: Yeah, your shit father.
Laura: Yeah, he knew somebody there, but I don't remember who it was.
Taliesin: Oh, shit. Hold on.
Sam: But wait! Anyone from like when we were with the 'fugees? The refugee camp? Didn't some of them go to Daxio?
Laura: Oh! Oh! What about that guy that was running the refugee camp? The leader! Bernard, or Reginald, or--
Marisha: Well, Reginald is dead.
Laura: Not Reginald.
Taliesin: Most of our friends are dead, let's be fair.
Liam: Yeah, we have met a lot of dead people.
Laura: What was his name? Bernard?
Matt: Who are you referring to?
Laura: The guy who was running the refugee camp that was like a blacksmith, not a blacksmith, but he had stepped up to--
Sam: Wait! Rothfuss?
Laura: No.
Liam: No. I know who you're talking about.
Laura: Yeah. We found his brother? His son?
Liam: When we left the orc camp, and we headed out into the snow--
Matt: Oh!
Liam: It was close to when we found Tyriok without an arm.
Laura: They were heading to Fort Daxio, weren't they?
Matt: I don't recall if they were heading to Fort Daxio.
Marisha: This was after the goliaths?
Laura: Yeah.
Sam: This is the part of the show where we look through our notes.
Liam: It's D&D! It is a Dungeons & Dragons game.
Travis: You guys actually write notes? I just draw pictures.
Taliesin: They write notes. I draw pictures.
Liam: I listen to them read their notes.
Travis: Oh, good.
Ashley: I look over her shoulder and read her notes.
Laura: Well, they're empty right now.
Sam: Mine are terrible! Arbiter Brom?
Matt: No!
Sam: Tristan the cleric? Gern Blanston? (laughter)
Sam: Spireling Shenn?
Travis: Orc skull?
Laura: But you know who I'm talking about. Yeah?
Matt: This will be Cornelius. Maybe? I'm trying to--
Taliesin: Wow!
Travis: Cornelius.
Laura: Cornelius.
Sam: Oh wait! I got it, I got my page! Cornelius! Leader of the refugees. He is a bookbinder. Drez Vena! Magic guy. Elowen, the mom. Simon, the son. These are people who were in Daxio, right?
Matt: No, these are people who were sent to Kymal.
Sam: Shit balls! Master Quall?
Matt: Also Kymal. Or Westruun. One of the two.
Marisha: Do we not know anybody at Fort Daxio?
Matt: No one that you know of. Fort Daxio--
Laura: Is Allura still here? Is Allura still around?
Matt: Allura is still around.
Laura: Allura, do you know anyone in Fort Daxio?
Matt: "Unfortunately, the one member I know is the Warmaster, Mikael Daxio, the father of Riskel. But as far as I know, he is currently sealed off in Syngorn with the rest of the army."
Laura: Right. Shit.
Marisha: Okay, hang on, wait. Is Fort Daxio near Syngorn?
Laura: No. The army, remember, part of the army got sent to Syngorn, and then Syngorn bamfed away.
Matt: Yeah. Three of the regiments in Fort Daxio were sent to Syngorn, with the supposed dragon incursion in the Stormcrest Mountains. Most of them went with Syngorn when it got pulled back to the Feywild, and one regiment still remains at Fort Daxio. Fort Daxio is north of Emon.
Marisha: Are there any guards from Emon here? Because the guards were also the guards from Emon went to Syngorn. So maybe someone in one of the guards knows one of the guards in Fort Daxio.
Laura: This is a lot of work.
Marisha: Yeah. Is there an easier way to go about this?
Matt: You could ask around?
Marisha: I am going to go and see if I can find one of the Whitestone guards.
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Marisha: Oh! I am not good at these. I think that it's a 12; let me double check my investigation. I don't do this a whole lot. Yeah, 12.
Matt: Okay. You spend the next 30 minutes asking around for various guards, and the few that you do know that are from Emon are like, "I don't really know anyone from Daxio. It's very regimented. I wasn't interested in the military, I wanted to more sit around the city and get paid to wear armor."
Marisha: So they're more militant? Or like, the army?
Matt: "It is where the military is, yeah."
Marisha: You don't have any army friends? Are there any army friends here?
Matt: "I think there are a few here that at least might know that, but I am not one of them. Sorry."
Marisha: Where? Where? Point me.
Matt: (shouting) I don't know! That way!
Marisha: (shouting) All right! I go that way!
Matt: Keyleth spends the better part of the next hour or so without luck, unable to really find anyone to match the description from before.
Marisha: Guys, this sucks! We don't know anyone in Daxio!
Laura: Should we just fucking go there?
Liam: This is like when you're on a level in a video game, and you run around and around and around. You can't find that thing that triggers to the next section of the video game.
Sam: Wait, Gilmore knows everybody. He must know someone in Daxio.
Laura: I don't know if he knows army people.
Liam: Well, he knows a lot of people.
Marisha: All right. If Gilmore doesn't know anybody, then we are going to the nearest location, and then we're hoofing it.
Laura: Yeah.
Sam: Kraghammer is near-ish.
Marisha: All right, let's go talk to Gilmore.
Laura: That's true.
Matt: Okay. As the rest of your council has essentially scattered throughout Whitestone Castle since your meeting, Gilmore is easy to find, beginning to make his way out of the castle down towards his homestead, and prepare what he has for the coming struggle. So as you intercept him walking down the outside, he says: "Oh, hi! I'm sorry. What did you need?"
Sam: Do you know anyone in Fort Daxio? Please say yes.
Matt: (chuckles, sighs) "You know, I believe I have had a couple of people come through my establishment."
Travis: Is that what they call it? "Come through my establishment?"
Taliesin: Yes, that is exactly what they call it when you have an establishment.
Matt: "That is actually exactly what they call it, Grog."
Marisha: I mean, we don't necessarily need to know anybody if you happen to know a very fast way to get to Daxio.
Matt: "I mean, there are magics that can get a person there quickly, but--"
Laura: Are there trees? Are there lots of trees? It's grassland.
Liam: Shaun, could you send one of us there? Is that possible by any chance?
Matt: "Let me think."
Laura: One? Why one?
Liam: Because if one of us goes with the Gatestone, Keyleth can jump over, she can see trees there, she can tree her way back here. I mean, I don't know; I'm spitballing.
Laura: It seems like a really long process--
Liam: Yeah, all right. Where's your great idea?
Laura: Well, one of us goes there, finds a tree and then bamfs back, and Keyleth brings us all over--
Sam: No, Keyleth can scry on you once you're there, and see the tree.
Laura: Fabulous. Send one of us over there.
Marisha: Yeah! Yeah.
Matt: He says  "Well, I can't. But Allura might be able to help with that. Ask her?"
Marisha: All right. Back to Allura.
Sam: (sings Yakety Sax)
Liam: Chickens with our heads cut off, eh?
Travis: In and out of the doors.
Taliesin: Like a Monty Python animation. Back and forth.
Marisha: Trip three times.
Matt: Exactly. Apparently, Gilmore doesn't seem to have access to the type of translocation magic you're asking about.
Marisha: All right.
Matt: You eventually find your way to Allura in Whitestone Castle, who is currently having a conversation with Cassandra. She turns back to you, and as you ask the same question, she responds with a: "I actually do have prepared-- I can bring up to eight other individuals with me."
Laura: Oh! How perfect!
Travis: Wait, wait. One... Somebody else do this.
Laura: We're good.
Ashley: I think we're okay. It's just right.
Marisha: Are you fine doing that?
Matt: "Yes. I can only go there, so we have to have some way of returning, which I believe you can handle that. All right?"
Marisha: I can get us back, yeah.
Matt: "All right. Then whenever you are ready, I suppose."
Laura: Great.
Liam: Now's as good a time as any. Yeah.
Matt: "All right, gather round." She puts her arms out and gestures for you to reach in like a hand circle.
Ashley: Come on Grog.
Sam: Are we taking Kima?
Laura: Kima! Can we take Kima?
Sam: Do we want to take Kima?
Matt: "Of course! I have to go get her"
Liam: One too many though, isn't it?
Laura: No. This is perfect.
Liam: I swore she said eight. Or eight along with her?
Matt: "Eight along with me."
Travis: We're just reconning.
Laura: Yeah, it's fine. Let's just go.
Liam: You know, we always take her and leave you. Why don't we flip that?
Matt: "Just don't tell her. She gets a bit testy when she's not included. All right, very well." She takes your hands. Some of you close your eyes, some of you don't. That familiar rush of warmth underneath your stomach begins fill--
Travis: (fart noise)
Matt: Your chest cavity... (laughs). Grog poots out the side and it distracts you momentarily, before you watch the ground beneath you; this line of blue arcane energy begins to link each one of your feet together in a circle. As it does, these star-like extensions begin to appear out in the center, and as soon as they all meet into one crystalline structure, there is a flash of light. Your vision goes white, and as it slowly adjusts to the daylight, this light breeze soothing you, you look around and see yourselves now standing in the Othendin Pass, which is this large rocky ravine that rides up on each side of you to these tall, cliff side edges of the very very southwest side of the Cliffkeep Mountains. This is far north of Emon. While you see the ground itself is very cracked land, you can see dry and long dead bushes, you can see bits and pieces of dead trees that have for a long time been petrified, broken over or been left without much of an actual fertile ground to exist in. You glance off to the eastern side of your direction, and you can see a very large cluster of reddish-brown trees; a forest there that has long died, or at least is definitely in the fall season type of color change. But the vegetation around here is very sparse, very scrub and in some cases very dry and dead. You do see to the immediate northwest of your current location, clinging to the side of the mountain cliff, what you assume is Fort Daxio: a massive stronghold, built of gray and brown stone, an outer wall perimeter that completely surrounds it, buttressed against each side of the cliff, and within, you can see a multi-tiered fortress structure within, built specifically for defending against any sort of army siege or incursion.
Laura: Wow, that is way bigger than I expected it to be.
Taliesin: That's what I'm talking about.
Travis: Can I check the skies? Anything flying around?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Travis: Hey! This will go well. Three!
Matt: You begin to look up, and you see a small bird, and it's really small and it'ss really cute, and your eyes watch it, and you watch it fling off that way.
Travis: (gasp) Pike!
Ashley: Oh lookit.
Travis: What?
Ashley: It's a little--
Travis: It's tiny right?
Ashley: It's so cute.
Travis: Yeah, he chirps I bet.
Ashley: It's a little thorbilly. (laughter)
Travis: Can you make thorbilly land on your finger like a Disney princess?
Ashley: Can I? This is so dumb. Yeah, I'm going to try.
Sam: Animal handling check!
Taliesin: Animal handling check!
Matt: I was going to say. Make an animal handling check.
Laura: Wow! Have we ever rolled this?
Sam: One! We have done one.
Taliesin: We have done one?
Sam: One. I don't remember why, or who did it.
Laura: Oh my God, you've got really good animal handling!
Ashley: Well, all right!
Travis: And you rolled a dick.
Laura: Is it a dick?
Ashley: It 's a four. Okay, nine.
Marisha: That's kind of a dick.
Matt: You make three (clunks) clomping plate armor. Pike steps before the bird-- [no audio]
Matt: Into the sky.
Ashley: It was a baby thorbilly. They're a little more shy.
Travis: Yeah, no yeah. He was very scared. (laughter)
Travis: It's all right. Next time.
Laura: Does it look like anybody's in the fort looking down at us? Are we far enough away?
Matt: Make a perception check. You're a few hundred yards away.
Laura: Fucking shit balls. 16.
Matt: 16. Okay. Best you can tell, you do see some shapes along the top of the outer battlements; the wall that surrounds the structure. However, from this distance, you're not sure if they have seen you yet.
Laura: All right.
Liam: Best you can tell, it's shit-balls.
Laura: It's shit-balls up there. Just lots of shit.
Marisha: What's a shit-ball?
Sam: Hey, if we walk up to the fort, what's our cover story?
Taliesin: No cover story. We tell them who we are and what we're doing here.
Sam: We're dragon fighters bringing the fight to their town?
Laura: We're not bringing the fight here.
Sam: We are looking to fight here.
Laura: Oh shit, we are. That's the plan, that's my plan
Liam: It's not a town. It's--
Taliesin: It's a fort.
Sam: Well, whatever it is, I don't think we should tell them that we're dragon fighters bringing the fight to their fort.
Marisha: Well, actually, that's a good point. Whose fort is this?
Laura: Daxio's, who's in Syngorn. No, it is!
Matt: Well, that is the warmaster, who has been assigned by Emon. This is technically where the majority of the military of Emon is stationed.
Marisha: So this is Emon's military? Not Syngorn's.
Matt: Yeah, this is Emon's military.
Laura: And we have got Allura with us; she's on the council.
Taliesin: And they are at war as well.
Ashley: This is already going well.
Liam: We're protecting the world.
Laura: Super good.
Marisha: Well, yeah. If this is for Emon, then it's for Emon.
Taliesin: This is specifically where you want things to attack, as opposed to towns.
Laura: But they might be skittish, so we should probably have a little protection as we go up there.
Marisha: Do we have any idea on who we're talking to?
Laura: Dudes. I think their commanding officers are in Syngorn. For the most part.
Travis: Do we need a white flag as we approach?
Laura: Sure.
Liam: Do you want to hold up Pike, as we walk closer?
Ashley: I can whip my hair.
All: (singing) I whip my hair back and forth. I whip my hair back and forth.
Matt: Yeah, it's 5th-level, you can do that. (laughter)
Matt: As you guys begin to approach the outside of Fort Daxio, you can see a number of the figures on the wall beginning to move faster and gathering at edges. You can see one of a few defensive ballistae being locked in. Allura begins stepping into the front, and she puts her hand out and says: "Don't worry, let me do the talking for this."
Sam: Ooh, okay!
Matt: As you guys begin to approach the gate, you hear a small horn give off this arrival notification. This: (pathetic horn noise). But deeper and much cooler sounding than that. (laughter)
Liam: (air horn)
Ashley: (air horn)
Travis: Come on, man!
Matt: (air horn)
Sam: (air horn)
Matt: Because I am not a war horn.
Marisha: I imagine a kid with a kazoo. (laughter)
All: (kazoo)
Taliesin: (deep and cool horn)
Travis: Of all the sounds you could make!
Matt: Fort Daxio is very sparsely run right now.
Sam: All their horns were broken in the war.
Matt: They left the regiment behind with a small conch shell that is partially broken.
Taliesin: Piggy's got the conch.
Laura: (pathetic horn noise)
Ashley: (pathetic horn noise)
Liam: Did we just find your Achilles Heel?
Marisha: Horn noises?
Liam: Man of a thousand voices  animals, creatures-- can't do horns.
Taliesin: And no horns.
Matt: (deep and cool horn sound) (cheering)
Matt: There you go! To make you happy.
Liam: I don't do horns; they sicken me.
Matt: That's more hit points on Thordak. Just keep a tally. All right. As you approach, and begin to gather and Allura steps forward, she takes a few more steps and then stops, puts her other hand up to give you a signal to hold back. She speaks out across the expanse: "Arcanist Allura Vysoren, member of the Tal'Dorei Council, here with allies to speak with who resides within. Will you allow us passage?" There's a pause. You hear the sound of the ballista crank being loosened. And then you see the two front gates slightly open. She puts her hands down. "Very well, walk with me."
Laura: They didn't even check us out; just letting us in. Be on your guard. They're too trusting.
Sam: Okay.
Matt: As you guys approach the gates and begin to walk through, you can see there is about 15 guards stationed above the top that all have cocked crossbows, that are trained on you guys--
Laura: Never mind!
Matt: Not directly ready to fire, but cautiously watching you as you progress. Allura leads through, leading you guys into the main entryway, and as you walk into this front area, the pseudo-courtyard or central area between the wall and the stronghold itself, the same cracked exterior. But you can see there is a trebuchet over there. There are countersiege weaponry. Some of it unused for a while and probably in need of some level of repair. You do see a number of other armored individuals, and the armor you see on the military stationed here is much more than the armors of Emon, or any of the local guard that you are used to. These are very heavy, regimented plate, tower shields, you can see spears that are very nasty looking and very strong in construction. A lot of these almost resemble a lot of the dwarven make you saw in Kraghammer before. So whether this is an alliance through Kraghammer and Emon that came to this, or the design was borrowed to some extent, a lot of the armor is more square and bulky than the more refined armor you have seen in more southern areas of the Tal'Dorei continent. Immediately, as you step in, while the guards still have their weapons trained on you on the other side of the wall, you see ten individuals approaching, armored. You can see these individuals, their shields are large, heavy tower shields, with a goldish, circular symbol on the front that has an inlay that's almost like a polished mirror. Like, a big old oval mirror as part of the center shield itself. As these armored individuals approach, one of them in the center has her helm off, and seems to be leading this push to greet you at that front. You see a woman, very stern look, dark skinned, very short ebony hair and a very tough, dour expression on her face as she quickly brushes up towards the front, and as she steps forward, she slams her shield into the ground, and gives a nod as the rest of the soldiers stop. She bows her head, and goes: "Allura. We finally have answer from the council. It's been silence for weeks." Allura bows her head, and says, "Well, General, let me introduce you to our allies here. These are Vox Machina. They are friends. They are--" And the general breaks once more into the conversation, and says: "That's fine! So you are here with your allies. Any word from Mikael? Any word from the rest of the regiments?"
Laura: They're in Syngorn.
Matt: "Still? In Syngorn?"
Laura: As far as we know.
Matt: "All right. Well." (sighs) You see the tension that's been building in her since she approached you guys begins to slowly fade with this sense of digesting the difficulty of the situation. There's an awkward pause and Allura says, "Can we speak in less--" She looks up at the rest of the battlements, "--less armed circles, if you don't mind?" The general looks up and nods. "Very well. My apologies. I am General Elle Gorgofon."
Laura: Elle Gorgofon?
Matt: "Elle Gorgofon. I am the commander of the Aegis Regiment and I welcome you, for the time being, to Fort Daxio. Follow me." She turns on her heel and begins to march at a very brisk pace back towards the stronghold itself. The other soldiers turning around as well. Allura gives you all a head nudge to follow suit.
Sam: Okay! Yeah! Let's go. This is going great. We haven't even done anything wrong yet.
Taliesin: Give us time.
Matt: As you're walking around, Keyleth, Vex, and Vax, looking over the number of soldiers that are here, you have roughly 20 or so you see on the top of the wall, maybe 25 to 30 that occasionally are stepping around the base of it or the interior of this main courtyard. For the entirety of the army of Emon, the regiment that's here, doesn't seem to be very busy or very well--
Marisha: Stocked?
Matt: Staffed. There aren't a lot of people here. This regiment is not extremely large. It looks like this may be the defensive regiment that was left behind to guard the fort, when other regiments are sent out on whatever duties.
Marisha: You said we saw 40?
Laura: 50 people.
Matt: 40 to 50 soldiers on the outskirts of the stronghold. You don't know how many are inside necessarily.
Travis: It's like the Alamo.
Matt: It's fairly lightly guarded right now.
Travis: Which ended well.
Taliesin: It depends on who you ask, really.
Matt: As you guys enter the stronghold, it's beautiful in its construction. It also looks like it's been in some level of disrepair. It's definitely built for function. The furniture and decor on the interior is very simple, very pragmatic. It is made for function more than presentation. You're led through two small hallways to the right to one central chamber where there are a series of benches and chairs, whatever has been assembled to the area and pulled to the center area. It would be considered a conversation room or war room in some circumstances, but it's very haphazardly thrown together. You also do notice that there are a couple of rooms that have a foul stench, and as you glance off to the left into the inside, you can see there are piles of folded dark material.
Laura: Toilet paper. (laughter)
Matt: It's your favored terrain. But you guys are led into this main chamber.
Sam: Do we just pass by those things?
Matt: As you begin to walk by, you glance over and see it as you go.
Laura: Can we see what it is? It looks like dark folded material?
Matt: If you want to stop and look behind, you can have a closer look. It's a hide-type material. It looks folded, and then as you walk in, you can see it's actually a series of piled corpses of some sort of leathery creature or creatures that have been pushed into an area there.
Taliesin: I'm going to take this moment to change out my attunement for my gloves from my sword. I'm going to put my gloves on and unattune to my sword.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: General, how many soldiers does this fort support?
Matt: As she enters the chamber ahead of you and turns around and sits in her chair, her shield set to the side. "We currently now, as the Aegis Regiment, have a grand total of 225 soldiers."
Sam: Pretty good.
Laura: And how many can be here?
Matt: "As far as all the regiments?"
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: "We're looking at, between how many survive or return from Syngorn, close to 2,000."
Laura: (quietly) All right.
Sam: So you have 225 here currently?
Matt: "We do."
Sam: And how is morale? Everyone have enough supplies and ready to defend the fort if needed?
Matt: "To be perfectly honest--" And the door closes behind you as two of the guards step in front and watch it as you all find your seats or at least stand in the space. General Elle goes, "To be perfectly honest, we are very low on supplies. Any of the trade routes to and from Kraghammer have been constantly harried by wyvern riders. We've had to defend our location a couple times by some errant wandering sentinel wyvern riders. It's been-- (sighs) We're on the edge of starvation."
Travis: Shit. Pardon my bluntness, but any flybys by Thordak himself?
Matt: "Thankfully, no. He would tear into this place in but an instant. We only have bits of information we've had from few scouts we've sent southward. We've had some conversations to and from Emon, but only half of them have even returned, and those that have say that it's a very dire situation, so we've been awaiting any word we can from Mikael-- sorry, from the Warmaster-- and nothing. So as far as I know, and have known, we are on our own and left possibly to die while the rest of this entire country burns to the ground. So seeing some seemingly friendly faces--" And she nods towards Allura, "--is the best news I've had in a very long time."
Laura: In your Warmaster's defense, it might be beyond his control to get back here.
Taliesin: Things are dire.
Marisha: Thordak is changing the entire landscape to be very similar to the Fire Plane.
Laura: And he's stuck in the Feywild.
Matt: "Who's stuck in the Feywild?"
Laura: The Warmaster, here.
Matt: "Mikael?"
Laura: Yeah, Mikael.
Marisha: All of Syngorn, actually.
Sam: Are we telling them this?
Laura: Why not?
Taliesin: Why not?
Matt: "Well, at least I know that they weren't wiped out, and that's good news. But still, we're not enough to even attempt an incursion on Emon by our own."
Taliesin: Well, that is true, and that is the purpose for our visit.
Travis: We may be able to help, though. At least where resources are concerned.
Taliesin: Oh, I would say so. We have to. That will be job one.
Marisha: How is the land around the fort? Do you have any farm land currently?
Matt: "What little bit grows here is not of the edible variety. We have to rely on the farmlands of Emon for most of our produce, and those have dried up, so we've been left to hunting and slaughtering what is available, which is not much these days, as we're constantly in battle with the giants of the north to keep some semblance of food intake to keep our soldiers fed and living."
Sam: (quietly) We can help a little with that, right?
Taliesin: Oh, yes. And we'll have to.
Laura: Maybe throw some food through a tree when we open it up, just chuck some corn.
Taliesin: Sandwiches!
Laura: Take some spaghetti!
Travis: Could we load up a cart, though, and wheel it through?
Sam: Well, but can't Keyleth make some farmland, right here in the fort? Little small garden sort of a thing?
Marisha: It takes eight hours, but it seems like we might have to do some field trips anyway.
Taliesin: The airship will be heading here anyway. We can load it with supplies as well.
Travis: To here?
Taliesin: To here. Everything will be coming here, if things go the way that we hope they will.
Travis: General, can I ask, are you close with Mikael?
Matt: "I've been under him for 15 years, yes."
Travis: Consider yourself friends?
Matt: "Friends?"
Liam: You're the worst.
Travis: I mean, it didn't even take a second. Not one second. Have you no decency?
Taliesin: I specifically looked left, hoping.
Matt: (clears throat)
Laura: Sorry. You've been under him for how long?
Matt: "15 years."
Laura: 15 years. Long time.
Travis: Pick a fight. Pick a fight with the general, then. Good. That's good.
Matt: "Allura, are these trusted?" And Allura nods. "Very. They have a thought. More of a plan. A plan that if it works should put us in a much more advantageous position in the conflict with the Chroma Conclave. Please, give them your ear. Give them your respect. They've proven time and time again to be capable."
Marisha: Forgive us, we've just been through a lot, Elle.
Taliesin: We've actually already killed three of the five Chroma Conclave.
Matt: She leans back in her chair. "Is this true?"
Marisha: I reach in and I pull out one of the teeth and throw it on the table.
Taliesin: You can't just keep giving those away.
Matt: She catches it in the middle. She gives you a very stern look, and eyeing you over, trying to give you a read and then slowly it goes from group to group. "Well, then perhaps this is our salvation." Throws the tooth back to you.
Marisha: Did you see that?
Laura: That was a good catch.
Marisha: Thanks, guys.
Taliesin: Before we get ahead of ourselves, our hope is that we think we can lure Thordak out of the city, and we think we can get him into a piece of terrain that gives us the advantage. We were hoping this would be where we consolidate our forces and make a stand against him.
Matt: "You wish to bring the Cinder King here?"
Sam: Not just the Cinder King. We would also bring allies to support you and to buffer your forces and hopefully with enough planning time to get you and your men back on their feet, well fed and ready for a fight.
Laura: We're hoping we'll be able to bring Mikael and Syngorn's army back as well.
Sam: Mikael's navy.
Liam: Yes.
Taliesin: I hate you all. We either face him in his home, in his terrain, with his guards everywhere, with people we cannot trust everywhere, or we lure him out and we bring him somewhere where we know the terrain, where we have places to hide, where we are prepared for him.
Matt: She nods and leans forward, putting one hand over the other and her elbows on the edge of her knees on her chair. "And what makes you think a creature of such power and intelligence would ever leave such an advantageous position to be vulnerable?"
Sam: To kill us. We are the bait, and we are also the dragon killer. So he will come here to kill us, or to at least investigate our whereabouts, we hope, and when he arrives, we'll wait in ambush.
Matt: "Very well. If you're confident, you have Fort Daxio and the Aegis Regiment behind you. I just hope you know what you're doing."
Travis: Oh, we do. We've killed, like, a number of them and none of us have died yet.
Laura: Not even a little bit.
Travis: We started with this many, and this many is still here, is what I mean.
Sam: I mean, technically, we started the day with this many, that's for sure.
All - travis - orion - liam - ahsley - matt: Yeah.
Marisha: What's unconsciousness? (nervous laughter)
Matt: You can see her expression drop a little bit into a curled eyebrow of confusion.
Laura: Three down.
Taliesin: There's no guarantees, but this is the best bet. This is the best place for us at this point. I'm sure you understand. There are no guarantees.
Laura: Do you have underground facilities? Something that guards against dragon fire?
Marisha: We noticed a few of the trebuchets when we walked in. How many of those do you have?
Matt: "Functional? Three."
Taliesin: We can work on that.
Marisha: Percy?
Laura: How many non-functional?
Matt: "12."
Taliesin: We can work on that.
Matt: "Very not functional. Look, siege warfare hasn't been necessary for a very long time, let alone counter-siege. Fort Daxio hasn't been under attack in close to 200 years."
Laura: It could happen. When was the last time ancient dragons took over the land?
Matt: "Which is exactly why we don't have any dragon fire-protected subterranean tunnels. My apologies, but, you know, even our budgets are limited."
Taliesin: Well, we can get to work. We can get people in. We can start making this place ready and we can start making a plan. We have a lot of power and a lot of energy at our disposal.
Travis: Yeah, it's a montage waiting to happen.
Matt: "How soon do you imagine this to transpire?"
Laura: The montage?
Marisha: Oh, we can get started right now!
Matt: "No, I mean, call-- wait, wait, wait!" She waves her hand and interrupts the montage. "Wait, wait, wait, wait."
Travis: (singing) Going to build some tunnels, make them look real cool!
Sam: It will take us a few days, if not weeks, to summon all of our allies here, and we'll need to get your forces ready as well. Is this something that you can fully support? Would you rather fight bravely against a dragon than die a slow starvation death?
Matt: "We exist here as protectors of Emon and the Council of Tal'dorei. With the current state of things, what's left of those things we choose and have given ourselves to protect, if we can we will. So yes."
Sam: Okay.
Taliesin: Well, step one is food, then.
Travis: Yeah, resources and food.
Marisha: What time is it here? Just creating farmland all over the world.
Matt: I'd say it's midday.
Laura: We need some source of water, too.
Sam: We have one pitcher of water whenever we need it.
Travis: Yeah, baby!
Taliesin: Actually, they might already have a well here.
Marisha: Yeah, like a well?
Matt: Yeah, it still rains here, and it has watershed elements that come through the Othendin Pass from the Cliffkeep Mountains. It's the ground in this particular valley, like elements of the Cliffkeep in the north, it isn't very fertile for any sort of vegetation to take root.
Taliesin: There's no food you can grow underground, is there?
Travis: I saw this movie called The Martian. If we shit all over everything, it'll grow. Yeah, lots of potatoes grow from shit.
Ashley: Maybe if we could make a composting system for them.
Sam: So you can't grow anything right now?
Marisha: Can I get someone to take me to a courtyard, or something like that?
Matt: The courtyard is the area between the outer wall and the fortress itself, which is all built into the side of the mountain.
Marisha: Can I do some sort of druidy soil test? pH test, or something like that?
Matt: Make a nature check.
Marisha: See if I can grow stuff here? With a Plant Growth spell. Just a nature check? 15.
Matt: 15? I mean, it doesn't take too much for you to find out that the dirt here, the land itself, is very nutrient-devoid. It is a near salt and rock land, which is why a lot of it does not facilitate--
Marisha: Can I not fix that with a Plant Growth spell?
Matt: Do you have a spell that could fix that?
Marisha: Does Plant Growth fix that?
Matt: Let's read the spell.
Taliesin: We have options.
Sam: For at least a day, I could create a soup kitchen. People could come in and take a bowl and leave.
Laura: Could they have something with veggies, too, though?
Matt: Plant Growth affects plants that already exist, as opposed to the actual land itself.
Marisha: All plants in a half-mile radius--
Laura: Isn't there something that turns the land fertile?
Ashley: Poop.
Taliesin: That's like, 5th level.
Ashley: Do you have horses? Lots of horses?
Liam: But I mean, Scanlan, until we are ready to pull the trigger--
Sam: Yeah, I mean I could create a soup kitchen, basically.
Liam: Once a day, yeah?
Sam: Sure. Yeah. We can have a bread line going in and out.
Travis: In the meantime, Percy could take a look at some of the weaponry. Maybe look at building a tunnel, or a bunker.
Sam: General, when's the next feeding time for your next shift of men?
Matt: "We've had to relegate it to just morning and afternoon meals to help ration our supplies. So I would say four hours til dusk, that would be the next allotted mess time."
Taliesin: Can this actually work? Can we use the spell this way?
Sam: What, the mansion? Sure, I think so. Right?
Matt: It's a unique way of utilizing it, but I don't see why not.
Laura: It's a Sizzler. I like it. (phone ringing)
Sam: Oh, shit! Shit balls! I can't--
Matt: We talked about this.
Sam: Sorry. I had an alarm to take off my shirt.
Laura: Oh, you did?
Sam: I have to wear four shirts tonight because of reasons. (laughter)
Travis: Really?
Sam: Yeah, it's an anal thing. I've worn 70 different shirts on 73 episodes of the show, so if I wear four tonight, that's one for every episode.
Travis: Oh my god.
Liam: That makes sense. That's time well spent. (laughter)
Travis: Liam and I will give you a dunking in the bathroom after the break.
Liam: You'll get a swirly forthwith.
Liam: Are we going to double back to Dad?
Laura: We have to, right?
Liam: Yeah, soon.
Taliesin: We have to at least send word. That's the first thing we have to--
Laura: I don't know how we send word to the Feywild without going to the Feywild.
Marisha: I can Plane Shift us there after we sleep and I learn it the next morning.
Liam: Now that you've brought us there, do you think you could get us closer?
Marisha: I could take us straight there, yeah.
Travis: Percy, what do you think of looking at all this weaponry?
Taliesin: I'm going to look at the battalions. See if I can drudge up some people who actually know how these things function and start seeing how difficult it would be to get the ones that are broken working.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Can I figure out if the ground is sturdy enough if I start digging little bunkers, that would be okay?
Matt: Bunkers for?
Marisha: Underground bunkers for hiding from a flaming dragon breath.
Matt: I mean, you could, probably. It's hard packed, very solid ground. Westruun, is where you did it.
Marisha: Westruun. We did the bunkers.
Laura: Didn't we do underground stuff in Whitestone, too, though?
Marisha: I did a bunker under the Sun Tree, kind of.
Taliesin: We do a lot of bunkers.
Matt: At this point, Keyleth almost has a burrowing speed.
Marisha: It's like that Fallout minigame that they came out with, the app. Basically that.
Travis: Do we want to crack out the mansion?
Sam: Yeah, sure. I'll crack out the mansion. Where should I put it, General Elle?
Matt: "I'm not entirely certain as to what you're attempting to do here."
Sam: Oh, I'm sorry. Through magical means. We are all, not to brag, we are all super powerful. We're like a band of traveling superheroes. One of the things that I can do is make a room or a home, a magical home, where everyone can go in and get a quick meal and then go back out to work again. So with your permission and a location, I can create this magical dwelling.
Matt: Keeping her eyes trained on you, she leans over towards Allura. "I can't tell, is the little man fucking with me?"
Taliesin: He gets that a lot.
Matt: Allura goes, "Usually, yes, but no, he's being completely honest right now." "Then, by all means, yes."
Sam: Is there a spot where you would like your men to--
Matt: "Follow me to the mess hall." She seems legitimately spooked and unsure what to make of you, but leads you on anyway.
Sam: Most women are.
Matt: But yeah, you can set up in the mess hall entranceway. There is a large hall with long tables and she says that would be probably the most optimal place to go ahead and set up shop there.
Marisha: Question.
Matt: Yes?
Marisha: Legi-- logi-- (fumbling words) Logistical question. That's the word I was looking for.
Matt: There you go.
Liam: Stuff and things.
Marisha: Stuff and things. Things and stuff. They are low on meat because they're low on animals?
Matt: Most of their food was being brought by the trade routes. Since then, they've had to hunt for food and go off of whatever stock and store they had, and even that's running really low. They're hard-pressed to maintain.
Marisha: Could I do a Conjure Woodland Beings and conjure a bunch of deer?
Travis: Fuck yes.
Marisha: And then we could play shooting range?
Laura: Do they disappear when they're dead?
Marisha: Oh, right. They disappear.
Matt: Yep. They would watch that meat go (poof). Sorry.
Marisha: Oh, that's mean. No, I don't do that, by the way. I was asking ahead of time, because that would be mean. Never mind.
Travis: Also awesome.
Matt: This one druid got to level three and then opened its own hunting emporium and never became an adventurer again.
Travis: Supply for days.
Matt: Yeah! So you're setting up the mess hall. You're checking in to see-- go ahead and make an investigation check, Taliesin, if you don't mind.
Taliesin: Ew. Seven.
Matt: Seven? Asking around over the next couple hours or so, it appears that most anyone who would be a specialist in any sort of siege weaponry was part of the other regiments that are no longer part of Daxio. Even so, some of the weaponry that was here looks like it was ordered partially just to get the money in. A lot of the trebuchets that are functional are very dry-rotted and have seen many rainy winters and haven't really been kept up, and you're not even sure if they'd fire. The ones that have broken down, a lot of the wood rotted. There isn't a lot of weaponry. It looks like the three could be fixed up and be functional, but the ones that aren't, it would take you weeks with new lumber and new materials to even get them remotely functional.
Taliesin: All right, we can make do. We can make do. I will definitely start making plans for the three that are functional to get them in tip-top working condition.
Matt: With successful tinkering checks on this, with a few borrowed hands for manpower, you could probably repair one per day of work. That's a full eight-hour day of work. So be aware of that.
Taliesin: All right. How many more of them were disheveled and broken?
Matt: About 12 of them.
Taliesin: And they each had their own spot?
Matt: The three that are still semi-functional are pulled back about 60 or so feet from the edge of the walls, and then the rest of them have actually been wheeled over into the corner and have all been jammed up on the edge, unused and not to take up space.
Taliesin: Okay. That'll start, at least. I'm going to look for any improvements that can be made in defensive measures against flying creatures in any way. If we use some Stone Shape, we can make this even more defendable against flying creatures, et cetera.
Travis: General? Just because, like, I'm an inquisitive mind, what is the travel time from here to Emon on foot, on a beast? Those two.
Matt: "On foot, I'd say it would put you at about five to six days. Horseback, straight through without sleep and running the beast into the ground, you could do it in a day."
Travis: Wow. Cool. Good deal.
Marisha: Are you trying to think of bringing back supplies?
Travis: No, I was seeing if I could run there in a night and back.
Marisha: Just to scout it out?
Travis: No, I'm not fucking running over there. Are you crazy? I was just curious.
Matt: Anything else anyone else is looking to do?
Marisha: I guess I can start on the underground bunker. For tonight, I guess.
Taliesin: I'll start on one of the-- oh god, my brain has completely turned to mush.
Matt: Trebuchet?
Taliesin: Trebuchet, thank you. I love the word.
Matt: Go ahead and make a tinkering check.
Sam: What are you guys going to do?
Travis: That mess hall-- is there a gathering quarters for the soldiers?
Matt: There is a barracks built into the stronghold where many of the soldiers sleep. Where there is a common area, with general tables, card games, and things to pass the time. There is a small library, with various books. You get the sense here as you begin to walk around and see the soldiers, since these guys are essentially the defensive reserve for Fort Daxio, and Daxio doesn't see a lot of military action, it's very much a train-and-wait type circumstance. And many of the soldiers, though they have grown a little gaunt in the face from lack of resources, also appear to be emotionally drained from having nothing to do. And this constant stressful uncertainty about their future fate has this air of very low morale within the fort.
Travis: General, please don't take this the wrong way. Do you trust your men?
Matt: "I do. I trust their ability. I trust that they've stayed with me in the face of all this opposition and believe that my orders and requests to stay vigilant in the face of such possible destruction, having been met with continued agreeance that they will follow me as needed to our end."
Travis: And there are none that you worry about, none that have expressed a lack of confidence, none that you're keeping your eye on? Giving you a weird feeling?
Matt: "None that live."
Travis: I like that answer. Shit.
Sam: Oi, twinsies.
Laura: Oi.
Sam: Maybe you should fly up, and if Thordak's going to attack from the air, see where the spot is that he would attack, like a spot of weakness from above?
Liam: Well, that's not a bad idea. We're thinking about tomorrow, though, as well. In the morning, yeah.
Laura: Maybe we should pop into Syngorn.
Liam: Could you take the two of us, Keyleth?
Laura: But yeah, we'll fly up. Let's do that.
Matt: All right, so you guys go ahead and coast up, to do what?
Liam: To see if there's anything of use, see if there's anything to be gleaned from a bird's-eye view.
Laura: Because it's on the cliffside, right?
Matt: Yeah, if you look at the large ravine that is carved through this portion of the mountain there. From your perspective, looking at the map down this way. It is on the western side of the ravine, against the mountain. You guys coast up, looking up. Matching the very height of the mountain, the bluff that leads down into the ravine itself, and you can see over the edge the ocean of the Ozmit Sea that heads off westward. You can see a little bit of the light as the sun comes down to a sunset. You can see it glittering across the waves in the distance. You can see the little mountain range to the north of Emon, peering over the edge. And you can see a little bit of a dark spot in the very distance, over the horizon that you can gather where Emon is. You can see it from this high up. Even though it is but a small spot.
Laura: (sings) From a distance...
Liam: (shouts) What?
Laura: (shouts) It looks peaceful up here.
Liam: (shouts) Sure.
Laura: What are we doing? Do we see anything interesting?
Liam: Not enjoying the view, I start to look down around, is there anything?
Laura: That seems useful, for, like, if we put something on the cliffside or something? Maybe a hideout, somewhere to hide from view, something like that?
Liam: Is there anything we didn't see coming up? Or is it all plain to view?
Matt: Both of you guys make an investigation.
Laura: Almost awesome. 19.
Liam: 23.
Matt: You guys take the next hour or so coasting along the edge of the mountain range, the top of the ravine itself.
Laura: Is it a mountain?
Matt: There are, it is a mountain range and the ravine itself carves through a portion of it, so the right and left side, yes.
Liam: At the 59 minute mark I fly over and sit on the back of my sister's broom
Laura: Is it favored terrain?
Matt: Is your favored terrain mountains?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Then yeah, you get advantage on that.
Laura: 20.
Matt: But still. You do have the advantage at the top of these mountains of a wider range of view. It's good for somebody who's expecting an incursion from flying creatures. It'd be a great place to put a scout, as a warning system, should anything begin to make its way towards the fort from Emon or beyond. There are places where you could in theory drop things down the edges of the mountain that would use the ravine almost like a bowling alley, essentially, large boulders and rocks. Which is a favored tactic of many stone giants and other giants who use mountain terrain to their advantage. But beyond that, there's no other terrain that you think would, outside of you coming up with a creative use of it, there's nothing that is glaring to you as an advantage in the coming fray.
Laura: We could put somebody in a hidey-hole up here. And if they see anything, they drop a stone down to a designated area and let people know.
Liam: Yeah. They could throw out one of those flare-like gem-y thingies. Ring a bell.
Laura: Oh yeah! We have those. A bell is probably the best idea.
Liam: Any of those. You want to take us down? This broom always rides up my ass when I ride on it.
Laura: Oh, because your little wings are dead?
Liam: Yes, they are.
Laura: All right. I'll float us down on my ever-flying broom.
Liam: Ow!
Matt: Okay, so you guys descend.
Laura: I go down pretty slow to make this last a little bit longer.
Liam: Getting close though, yeah?
Laura: What?
Liam: What?
Laura: To take out all of this?
Liam: Yeah.
Laura: Yeah.
Liam: Kill 'em, or die trying.
Laura: That's right.
Matt: Both of you guys, make a perception check.
Laura: Oh, that was so close to a one, but it wasn't! 20.
Liam: 22.
Matt: 22, okay. As you guys come down--
Laura: Oh, wait, no! 26! My math was wrong.
Matt: That's okay. As you guys come down into the bottom of the ravine you make it down safely into Fort Daxio to gather with the rest of your compadres for the evening. You at this point, by the way, Scanlan. You are currently, because you have to be present to designate anybody who can enter your mansion. You are like the one-person homeless shelter. You are bringing through soldier after soldier into there. And they all look confused, bewildered. And many of them stop and be like, "What's going on?"
Sam: Name on the list? What's your name?
Matt: (stuttering) "I am--"
Sam: Name?
Matt: (stuttering) "Are you--? What is--?"
Sam: Listen, man. Do you want some food or not? What's your name? I've got a big list here, there's no girl with you.
Matt: "Trevian Simtin. Please, I'm hungry."
Sam: Do you have a plus one?
Matt: "I have a plus?"
Sam: You're in.
Matt: "All right!" One after another, after another. Some of them seem genuinely spooked and freaked out by the spiritual servants, and avoiding them as they go on. The smell of food hits them, though. The ever-smell of chicken cooking through does catch them. And they all seem to eventually get past their fear of the servants as the fantastic meal of relatively neutral flesh is served to them in your dining hall.
Laura: There's still no veggies, huh? They could probably use some vegetable nutrition.
Sam: I'm sure they boil the chicken in like an onion sort of water.
Laura: Do they? Or is it like a chicken broth that they boil them in?
Sam: They have the fusaka now. They put a little bit of that in. Spices it up a bit.
Travis: They've got a 300-year supply. (laughter)
Matt: All right, Keyleth. Explain the bunker you're building for me, if you could.
Marisha: Should I do it on the inside? In the courtyard, make an underground pod. Think Fallout.
Matt: Right. Is it closer to the wall, or closer to the actual fortress itself, the entrance that leads to the underground pathway?
Marisha: I imagine closer to the fortress, right? On the inside.
Laura: Deep in there.
Matt: So you have a gradual decline near the fortress, in the courtyard, that goes underneath. And then mirrors the curvature of the wall? Or does it travel perpendicular to it and go underneath the wall?
Marisha: I imagine we wouldn't want to go underneath the wall.
Matt: Right, so here's the fortress. With the mountain. Fortress, and here's the wall around it. You're essentially building it in the same curvature parallel to the outer wall.
Marisha: Yes.
Matt: Okay. So you build this bunker, you take the better part of the evening, and probably the next morning or so to complete whatever the spell's maximum effort is.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: Okay, cool. I need you, with the manpower you have, possible with you, Taliesin. Go ahead and make a tinkering check. This is going to be with strength. It's very large physical activity. This is less about your intellect or your manual dexterity, this is about tools and having to apply it. You do have advantage because you have other men helping you with this. But the DC is relatively high.
Taliesin: That'll do. 25.
Matt: 25, okay. While the rest of you are finishing up your events of the evening and preparing to go to sleep, Percy is working tirelessly into the wee hours of the morning. You finish, probably like two hours after midnight, with the rest of your crew sore, sweaty. But you have one functional trebuchet that looks like it could handle many, many shots within one battle and still be serviceable.
Liam: Shirtless, covered in soot.
Marisha: Mm-hmm.
Sam: He wipes his brow.
Matt: As he slowly takes his glasses off--
Travis: Yeah! Takes the water skin and just--
Matt: All the soldiers are like--
Laura: Oh, Percy!
Matt: There you go. You guys take your evening to rest. The next morning, you find yourselves awake. Spells restored. Hit points restored. Allura comes in and greets all of you. "All right, so! I can also bring us back to Whitestone. I've restored the teleportation spell that I had. Thus, what do you wish to do now?"
Laura: Number one. (whispers) Never say "Whitestone" in public, ever.
Taliesin: Around us, especially. We could still do work here. Here's what has to happen now. We need to send word to as many people as possible that we are meeting here for the final confrontation. We have to make sure that work continues here. And then, if there's time, while our forces assemble and things prepare, we have several things we can do in the meantime.
Travis: Right. Keyleth is necessary to get to the Feywild.
Laura: Or Allura.
Marisha: Could I theoretically open a tree and send people in?
Laura: To the Feywild? But how would we get back?
Marisha: No, not to the Feywild. If we need to see someone to--
Sam: Whitestone?
Marisha: Yeah, or Marquet. Or wherever.
Taliesin: We have the stone, as well.
Travis: So it's going to be Keyleth and one of the twinsies go to the Feywild, right?
Sam: Can you do any plane shifting things, Pikey Pike?
Ashley: I don't have it prepared.
Travis: I don't have it?
Ashley: I don't have it prepared.
Travis: You know, there is that fire elemental plane with the last Vestige, eh?
Taliesin: We could. That is absolutely on the table.
Marisha: Could we? Do we have time for that?
Sam: Sure!
Taliesin: It's going to take us a week to get this place even remotely ready for this confrontation.
Matt: Allura at this point, by the way, says, "A week? I don't know if we have a week."
Travis: Why?
Taliesin: What happens in less than a week?
Matt: "The minute that the information of Vorugal's death finds its way to Thordak, what do you think is going to happen? Their vengeance is going to fall."
Taliesin: It's going to take a few days for that to happen, to be set in motion.
Marisha: Are you kidding? I don't know. It could be any minute now. They've been spying on us this whole time. What makes you think it will take a few days?
Sam: Also, throwing it out there. If you guys go to the Feywild, isn't there a chance that you don't come back until a month later or something crazy like that? Doesn't time shift weirdly?
Matt: Make an intelligence check. Add your intelligence modifier.
Sam: Oh! 18.
Matt: 18. And you could technically add--
Sam: I did.
Matt: You added your d12 to it?
Sam: Oh, no, not my d12.
Matt: You could use one of your bardic inspirations to inspire yourself, if you wanted to.
Sam: Sure, why not? I'll do that. All right, 22 then.
Matt: Having journeyed once to the Feywild, and with the little bit of research you've done since then. There have been people who have been to the Feywild who do speak of some sort of temporal anomaly when traveling to and from. So yes, you are certain that there can be some sort of flexibility as to the time spent there versus the time that has transpired in the Prime Material plane. Not a sure thing, but there is some variation to that.
Travis: What's life without a little risk?
Laura: Maybe Syngorn will have control over that. They can transfer back when they want to.
Taliesin: Let's see what we can do.
Laura: They have a huge army.
Travis: And they've got werewolves in their woods.
Laura: I don't know how we'll be able to get word to them.
Travis: You howl.
Laura: All right.
Matt: Allura sneaks in a bit and says, "My only suggestion here is make sure that you do the things that are absolutely necessary for this because we don't know when this is going to kick off."
Laura: Well, we have to get armies here.
Matt: "Then let's do it."
Laura: That's what we're trying to do.
Matt: "All right."
Sam: Well, wait. Don't we need to send word to other places as well? How do we do that?
Travis: Yeah, I don't know how to reach my herd.
Sam: Isn't there a big horn you blow or something?
Travis: No, they wander to and fro.
Sam: You could find them, probably?
Laura: They were wandering somewhere specific, though. Into the riverlands or something?
Sam: We can scry and find out where they are and then send someone as mist-form you, or something, and go catch up with them.
Laura: We'll spread the fuck out and then Thordak will attack and then none of us will be here!
Marisha: All right.
Taliesin: Stop rolling, that's really disconcerting when you sit there and roll at us.
Marisha: Well, how do we know that Thordak will even come here, by the way? He has no reason to come here unless he's deliberately looking for us. Which we have no reason to believe that he cares to come find us.
Sam: Quick list, people. Quick list! Who do we need to contact, Slayer's Take?
Laura: -Ish. Yeah. Bottom of the list, because I don't think they would--
Sam: Ravenites?
Laura: Yes.
Liam: Syngorn.
Sam: Syngorn. That's a big one. That's a biggie right there.
Laura: And that's a biggie because it's also got these soldiers.
Sam: The wolf pack?
Laura: Also there. We can howl.
Travis: The Herd.
Sam: The Herd.
Travis: The Platinum Dragon.
Laura: Bahamut?
Sam: J'mon Sa Ord, sort of? -Ish?
Marisha: We've got that thing--
Laura: Yeah, we've got that whistle. What about Bahamut's people in Vasselheim?
Matt: That's the Platinum Sanctuary.
Laura: Yeah, what about the Platinum Sanctuary?
Travis: That's what I'm saying.
Laura: Oh, I thought you were talking about--
Travis: No, no. I said the word "platinum." I was there. And you robbed me of it. I did it right.
Laura: Sorry, Grog. You're so smart!
Sam: Is there anyone else who's pledged their allegiance to us? Any other band of traveling idiots?
Taliesin: We could ask for help from Kraghammer, as well.
Laura: Yeah, it's so close.
Marisha: I could ask, potentially, my father and the Air Ashari. I'd have a hard time asking the Fire Ashari, there's so few of them.
Travis: Didn't the werewolves want to leave the Feywild, right? They wanted out.
Laura: I think so. I don't know. I think they just wanted out of those woods, but-- Maybe we could find Artagan while we're there. Maybe he could pop over and we'll have an archfey helping us.
Marisha: We also have a 2,000 person capacity here. I mean, we can always push it and make encampments on the outside, but what's our ideal number we're trying to hit?
Sam: 2,000.
Laura: A jillion. As many as we can.
Liam: It feels like it's a risk, but the most bang for our buck, our gold piece, is Syngorn. There's the most people there.
Travis: And as far as we remember, the people of Vasselheim. Their general temperament is Vasselheim takes care of Vasselheim.
Liam: Yeah, that's what it felt like when we were there.
Matt: Vasselheim and the continuation of civilization, and that being the Dawn Cradle, the city that's existed for as long as civilization has, is to be protected at all costs. So while they do and can offer aid occasionally outside of it, not to the detriment of their own defense.
Travis: Right.
Laura: Is that it? Is that everyone?
Travis: We could go talk to that Earthbreaker Groon.
Sam: Where is he?
Laura: Vasselheim. This is a lot of different places in like a day and a half.
Taliesin: We could write an awful lot of letters.
Laura: Yeah. And hopefully they'll show up like Game of Thrones at the last moment. We'll think we're overrun, and then all of a sudden another army shows up, and it's wonderful!
Marisha: Allura, do you have some way of messaging people and sending messages like super quickly?
Sam: An instant message app?
Matt: "Actually, depending on who it is."
Taliesin: Fassbender?
Marisha: Fassbender. He's with Wilhand.
Matt: "To be perfectly honest, if it's a creature that I'm relatively familiar with, I could send it to them instantaneously. Any distance. Across the planes."
Sam: How many people per day?
Marisha: Across the planes?
Matt: "Across the planes."
Sam: How many times could you do that per day?
Matt: I could probably muster it three times.
Laura: Oh, this is major! This is huge!
Liam: Allura, did you ever meet with our father in Emon?
Matt: "Yes, many times, actually. Yes, he was an interesting individual of the council. Especially back when Sir Gregory was with us. But they were friends. Yes, I did meet him."
Taliesin: Well, dwell on that one. Well, that would save us an enormous amount of energy.
Marisha: That would be great! And me, two seventh-level spells.
Matt: Sir Gregory Fence. That was when you first came to Emon. He's the gentleman who was part of the council. You were hired by their father to go and inspect because he went missing.
Laura: Remember demons in the succubus' house?
Marisha: It'll take me a 7th-level spell to get there, and then I'll have to burn my 8th-level spell to get back.
Laura: Well let's send word to them. Then save us the talk.
Matt: "All right, so. You require word to your father?"
Laura: Yes.
Matt: "Who else?"
Sam: Who's next on the list?
Marisha: Bigger allies.
Sam: The Ravenites? The Herd. What about the Herd?
Marisha: I don't think she knows anyone.
Sam: Well, we can describe them?
Laura: It's got to be somebody she knows.
Matt: "I have to have met them."
Sam: Kraghammer?
Laura: Have you ever met somebody in charge in Kraghammer?
Matt: "I have a number of individuals I've met there, yes. I cannot guarantee they'll be eager to jump into this fray. I can try."
Taliesin: That's possible, let's put that on the possible list.
Sam: What about that town that we saved from dissolution?
Taliesin: Westruun, they have the--
Marisha: Westruun was decimated.
Taliesin: They have Fassbender, they could send a soldier with the Fassbender.
Laura: Yeah, they have Fassbender.
Sam: The Air Ashari? Do we need to talk to any of them? You could do that.
Marisha: Theoretically.
Sam: The Ravenites? You don't know any Ravenites, do you?
Marisha: I was going to say, what about Tooma? Who's the dragonborn in Vasselheim?
Liam: Tofor!
Marisha: Tofor!
Laura: Wow, nice pull!
Marisha: Do you know Tofor?
Matt: "Tofor? Yes. Tofor's in Emon right now. "
Travis: She is?
Laura: Yeah, she is.
Matt: Tofor is a member of the Tal'Dorei Council. She's one of the council members, one of the survivors who is currently working with-- apparently, from what you've heard--
Laura: The Clasp.
Marisha: Is the person at the Slayer's Take Vanessa?
Sam: Vanessa, from the Slayer's Take, do you know her, Allura?
Matt: "I've not met Vanessa, no."
Laura: Well, who do you know that's really powerful, that also maybe has an army that could help us? Anyone you know that we don't?
Matt: "I think we've tapped out most of our resources at this point! I've reached out to members of the Arcana Pansophical, but many of them have their own issues to deal with."
Laura: They're dicks, aren't they?
Matt: "No, they're just busy."
Laura: Oh, that one guy we met, he was a real dick, though.
Sam: Any underdark-y type people? Do they like us?
Liam: Long, white hair.
Laura: Purple eyes. He was in Marquet. Is that what we're thinking of? Am I thinking of a different place?
Matt: "I don't know if he's a member of the Arcana Pansophical."
Laura: Just kidding!
Sam: Let's start with Syngorn and then see how it works, all right?
Marisha: Have you ever met my father, Korren of the Air Ashari?
Matt: "I've had no correspondence from the Air Ashari. My apologies. I'm doing what I can."
Marisha: Yeah, no, you're great.
Taliesin: You've saved us a trip to the Feywild and back. Send word that if they can contact the werewolves, the werewolves owe us a favor, I suppose. Not that they would help with that.
Matt: "If that's the information you need sent, that would require me to make two messages. Just to cover both those bases. To their father--"
Sam: Let's just get the father.
Matt: "What was his name again?"
Liam: Syldor.
Matt: "Syldor. Syldor, right. Two messages, to gather the army of Emon. And Syngorn, to return and head towards Fort Daxio."
Laura: Yes, if they could get pop Syngorn over to Fort Daxio, that'd be killer.
Matt: "I don't know if that's how the magic works, but I'll put a message in there for that and to look for werewolves."
Taliesin: As part of the message, that if there's a pack with the werewolves---
Sam: Is that vital? Should we care about that?
Travis: He fucked some shit up.
Sam: All right, sure. Yeah. Why not? Second message: Bring-- what was his name?
Travis: Spike!
Laura: No.
Sam: Indala.
Laura: No.
Liam: Michael J. Fox.
Travis: Ukurat.
Laura: Ukurat!
Marisha: Ukurat!
Matt: "All right. And I'll enquire about bringing Ukurat and the werewolves. All right! I've got some messaging to do."
Taliesin: And when you're back in Whitestone, send the airship our way loaded with food and supplies if you can.
Matt: "Very well."
Laura: Tell them to be on guard!
Sam: Put Kima on there, too?
Taliesin: And anybody who wishes to come fight.
Travis: Kash, Kima.
Laura: On the airship? Or send them through a tree.
Sam: Or Zahra!
Liam: When you write to our father, will you tell him his children need him?
Travis: Gross!
Matt: "I can do that, yes."
Laura: I don't know if that will help at all.
Matt: "I'll call for Kima, I'll bring our allies with us. Either me or Shaun have to stay behind to maintain the illusion, so your choice."
Sam: Shaun.
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: "All right, so Shaun will stay behind--"
Sam: Wait.
Taliesin: Yes.
Laura: Yeah.
Sam: That's certain death.
Taliesin: Staying in Whitestone is the exact opposite of certain death.
Laura: He's protecting everyone.
Matt: "Our purpose is to stay to make sure that they do not see Whitestone."
Taliesin: That is the opposite of certain death.
Matt: "All right, I'll get these messages off."
Laura: Oh my god is this happening right now?
Matt: She takes two steps back and puts one finger in the air, and as it curls her eyes glaze over with crackling blue energy. And you watch her tongue click across her mouth like she's speaking quietly to herself. Her eyes come back. "All right, I've notified your father, Syldor." Once again her eyes glaze over with crackling blue energy. Her fingers trace in the air, and it looks like she's speaking--
Sam: Quick, everyone hide when she's doing this! So when she comes back, we'll all be--
Travis: Yes.
Laura: She goes back we're like--
Liam: It's like she's putting on a VR helmet.
Matt: "All right." Her eyes return. "Both messages have been delivered to your father. Who else should require a message?"
Sam: You don't know anyone else on our list, do you? The Slayer's Take, you don't know.
Laura: It might be smart to send one to Warmaster Mikael as well. I know he's in Syngorn as well, but it might be good to have a couple of people there bringing word.
Liam: That's not a bad idea.
Matt: "I can do that." With that, once again the energy crackles and you can see she's trying to find the location of someone's presence. It hits, and she begins to speak quietly to herself. Finishes. "Very well! The army's been notified."
Sam: Just one more message!
Matt: Let me see if she can.
Sam: But wait, what about the Clasp or something?
Matt: Nope! That is all that she can do. Actually, no. She can cast at a higher level, so she can do more.
Sam: The Clasp? Do they like us or hate us?
Laura: They hate us, but--
Taliesin: I think that the Clasp are going to be far more useful once they figure out the dragon has left the city. And I don't even think they necessarily need to be notified of such a thing.
Laura: If the dragon leaves the city.
Sam: All right, then we're good for now. We just keep buffeting up this place? Do we have to plan an ambush? How does this work?
Travis: We go in. Emon, right now. Full ball.
Sam: All right. You and me.
Travis: Full blush.
Taliesin: We could go to the Fire Plane really quickly.
Liam: We're hoping to tempt him here.
Laura: Yeah.
Taliesin: Yes.
Travis: Why are you so anxious to go to the Fire Plane all of a sudden?
Taliesin: There's an object. It's from the Fire Plane. We are facing a fire dragon, which means it's something unbelievably useful or not useful at all. We need ice weapons, we need cold weapons, and we don't have any.
Marisha: And you think that we're going to find those in the Fire Plane?
Taliesin: Either that or in that ship that we left behind.
Matt: You have knowledge of dragons quite well, actually, Vex. You do know that red dragons are not vulnerable to cold, by any means. They're just resistant to fire.
Laura: They're just resistant to fire.
Taliesin: So it doesn't matter, then.
Laura: Are they vulnerable to anything that i know of?
Travis: Insults, cheese.
Ashley: Love.
Marisha: Peanuts.
Travis: Bruised bananas.
Matt: (laughs) Bruised bananas.
Travis: Hey, Pike! Did you know that we have all the Vestiges except for the one in the Fire Plane, and you'll never guess what it is.
Ashley: What is it?
Travis: What is it? I forgot.
Sam: Some plate armor?
Travis: It's some plate armor!
Laura: Of the Dawn Martyr.
Ashley: What?!
Laura: Which might be clutch for you.
Ashley: That might be a long-- I don't know. Allura was saying we don't have time--
Sam: One day! What's one day?
Marisha: You don't know if it's going to be one day.
Sam: Well, when we get there we'll find out! If it's taking too long, we'll pop back! These messages are going to take a while to deliver.
Marisha: I'm not like a Wonka-vator, man!
Laura: We'd have to spend the night there.
Ashley: That makes me a little nervous.
Sam: All right, one night. They've all eaten today. We're fine.
Matt: As far as you know, no there is no vulnerability--
Laura: Fuck, really?
Matt: Just fine with fire.
Travis: Just pure death and destruction.
Taliesin: Well, at least that's a bonus in that means that anything will work as well as anything else.
Travis: That's true.
Laura: Right.
Liam: Can we go back to the plan about how we intend to get Thordak here? We were playing with the idea of fooling Thordak into thinking that Raishan had been killed.
Taliesin: Raishan was going to feed him the information that he thought that we were here, and then vanish.
Liam: And that's it? We think that's going to pull him out?
Taliesin: I think Raishan will be clever enough to give him just enough to get him here.
Liam: Do you think Raishan would be willing to let us hack off a little bit of flesh to send?
Laura: You'd have to ask Raishan.
Taliesin: You'd have to ask Raishan. She might be willing to let me do such a thing.
Travis: Did we establish a way to contact her?
Marisha: We have no way to contact her.
Sam: No wait! Didn't we send her on a mission?
Travis: Oh, we did! She was checking on--
Sam: She was going to bring us back some dude. And we're not even there!
Laura: Oh, fuck! Asum was going to come back!
Sam: To not where we are right now!
Laura: Fuck.
Travis: It was two things. It was Asoon and...
Liam: Asoon?
Travis: Bassoon, whatever. And what was the other thing?
Laura: Some other guy. Was it some other guy?
Travis: Oh, shit nails!
Sam: The last time we talked to Raishan she said, "All right. I'll be back in a day." And then we got out of there.
Laura: Well it's still a day. It hasn't been a day yet. We haven't spent the night here yet.
Sam: Yeah, no. We haven't spent the night yet.
Travis: Oh she was going to Emon to hold up the bluff that everything was cool was Thordak, right? She was going to bluff, and then she was also going to try to bring back Seeker Asum.
Taliesin: It's all right. We can head home from here. Someone has got to go home.
Laura: Somebody's got to go.
Marisha: Some of us can go, and some of us can stay.
Laura: Well, all right.
Sam: All right, I'll go talk to Raishan.
Liam: And you can't leave because you're building, or can you go?
Taliesin: I can leave, we've got one working. If I stay, I'll have two working. If I stay longer, I'll have three working. But I'll go where we're most useful.
Ashley: But you want a chunk of her? Or like, a little piece of her?
Liam: Something, like a claw or something to drop at Thordak's feet. It'll help with the bluff.
Marisha: What makes you think that he would lead the charge to come find us? In his eyes he could just send one of his peons to come smash us.
Travis: Thordak?
Marisha: Yeah.
Taliesin: He's sent all of his dragons and nothing's worked.
Laura: That's the goal. We kill the peons, and then he comes.
Taliesin: And the more he sends, the more we kill.
Travis: What if we go mess up something on the edge of Emon, and then we're like, "Yeah! Fuck you!" And then we take off. Or like bamf back.
Taliesin: I don't believe he'll suffer that much indignity.
Marisha: If we tell Thordak where we are he'll probably come with that wyvern army that almost took out Whitestone, correct?
Laura: That's why we need to have a lot of people here. To fight them.
Travis: Yeah, to balance that out.
Taliesin: And that also means that the Clasp will have an opportunity to take back the city.
Marisha: While he's gone?
Taliesin: If he leaves with his army, yes. If he leaves his army to actually manage the city--
Laura: That's what we talked about.
Taliesin: Either way, it's stretching him thin.
Travis: Is it a bit of a practice round if we go to the Fire Plane? Let's say we get there and it's a total shit show, right? Nothing but death waiting for us. We change our mind, we leave. But at least we see where Thordak's been all this time.
Marisha: And the other thing that we could glean from the fire realm is possibly figuring out a little bit more about the connection he had with it and to the heart stone, ember seed thing?
Laura: All right. Allura, can you send a message to Gilmore, or Cassandra, or Kima even? Maybe just those three. They're the only ones who know about Raishan. Let them know that Raishan is bringing back Asum.
Taliesin: They were there.
Laura: I know, but just to make sure everything's fine with that.
Matt: "I can do that, yes."
Sam: And then we're going to the Fire Plane?
Travis: Yeah. Just give it a look-see.
Sam: Just pop on down for a bit to the basement.
Travis: Yeah! I've got a timeshare there. It will be killer.
Marisha: I'd like to bring Raishan with us to the Fire Plane.
Sam: No fucking way.
Laura: No. What are we going to do? She's not going to come.
Taliesin: She's not going to come to the Fire Plane.
Marisha: She knows it better than anybody else.
Taliesin: She's not going to come to the Fire Plane. But you're right, she does. If I were her I wouldn't come.
Laura: Would you want to go, Allura?
Matt: "What, to the Fire Plane? I mean, I can. My skills are probably better used elsewhere. But whatever you think is wisest."
Taliesin: We need agents on the ground right now.
Travis: True.
Laura: All right.
Taliesin: Things need to move forward here.
Laura: Okay, then you stay here and keep running things.
Taliesin: If opportunities present themselves to bring more people here or to gather more allies, take them.
Sam: Let's pop on down!
Marisha: My gosh, you guys, the Dawn Martyr is in the City of Brass. Which I'm pretty sure is overrun with fire elementals.
Travis: It's just a "myth," though, right? And that was probably written a long time ago which means shit could have totally changed.
Sam: Plus now we have a lot of money. We can buy our way through the Fire Plane.
Taliesin: That works.
Laura: Is this stupid? Are we going to die in the Fire Plane?
Liam: I think it's a bad idea. I don't think we have time.
Travis: Never tell me the odds!
Laura: But there's a Vestige there for Pike.
Marisha: I mean, we can go. We can hit the Fire Ashari first and see if Cerkonos is there and maybe see if Cerkonos wants to help us out?
Liam: If we're all alive in two weeks I'd be happy to go and get armor for Pike, but there's dragons on top of our backs right now.
Marisha: Allura, you're certain as soon as he finds out about Vorugal's death that he's going to seek retribution?
Matt: "I'm not certain, but as soon as he found out about Umbrasyl's, that's when he sent things looking for us near Whitestone. That was when Vorugal and the rest of the armies swept through. That was two days after Umbrasyl's fall."
Liam: We've also totally spilled our spaghetti with Raishan. She's not going to wait, she's going to push things forward. I don't think we have time.
Travis: All right, Vax. Do you have a suggestion in place, then?
Liam: I think that we talk to Raishan. These two chuckle-heads convince her to let us take a pound of her flesh, or ten. Somehow dump it insultingly at Thordak's feet and brace for the worst.
Travis: I'm okay with that, but how do we get in touch with her?
Sam: We can get in touch with her when she goes back to the place that shall not be named. But all of that is going to take days. And we can't do that until the armies have arrived here in Fort Daxio, which could take another few days. I don't know where Syngorn lands when it comes back to this plane. I assume it's not next door. They're going to take days to get here.
Laura: The thing is, Thordak's going to send out look-sees like he did over Whitestone, as soon as he finds out Umbrasyl is dead. It doesn't mean he'll launch an attack, because where is he going to attack? He doesn't know where we are.
Sam: Yeah! And if he's searching for us, what better place to be than on a different plane?
Travis: Let's go to a different plane.
Marisha: Do you think he went to the place which shall not be named because Raishan tipped him off that we were there?
Travis: No.
Taliesin: No.
Marisha: Why did he go to the place that shall not be named, then? Why did he look there?
Travis: Vorugal?
Taliesin: It was a place to be looked at. And they flew over and didn't see it.
Marisha: You think they were just scanning?
Taliesin: I do.
Sam: All in favor of the Fire Plane, say "Aye."
Sam: Aye!
Travis: Aye!
Sam: That was only two! Wow, that's pretty rough.
Travis: No, that was four. They're pansies and won't say anything with their voice.
Ashley: I don't know.
Sam: All in favor of staying say, "cooter."
Taliesin: That's not fair.
Sam: Two to one.
Travis: Let's go! Even if it sucks, we can just come right back.
Laura: We just bamf right back!
Marisha: We can always come back. And I would like to maybe see if we could find out more about the ember seed. Fire Plane!
Liam: I mean there's nothing else we can do today, is there?
Travis: Right. No.
Sam: Feed more soldiers.
Taliesin: Supplies are on the way. Soldiers are on the way.
Travis: Cows eat hay.
Taliesin: Do what you can-- Cows eat hay, neigh neigh. Hey! So we say.
Liam: Gather ye rosebuds, while ye may. Vox Machina is dying.
Laura: If you hear back from anyone in Syngorn or anyone anywhere, will you send us a message?
Matt: "Yes, and I will notify the general of these plans before I head on that way. Very well. Good luck."
Laura: Pretend like we were never here. Let them know. Pretend like we were never here.
Matt: "Understood."
Laura: All right.
Matt: "Stay safe, friends." She turns and leaves the room.
Laura: We are so stupid. This is going to be fun.
Taliesin: Yes! I love it.
Travis: Do we hold hands again?
Marisha: Oh boy!
Laura: No, it's a tree stride.
Marisha: Nope, well, okay. If we are--
Liam: Plane Shift.
Sam: Plane Shift.
Marisha: Hang on, do we want to stop off at the Fire Ashari, and pick up Cerkonos? I think it's not a bad idea.
Sam: No.
Marisha: We are not going to bring along our ally who knows the Fire Plane better than anyone alive?
Laura: No, I think we should. Because they were there.
Liam: Yeah, and you said we can instantaneously jump over, grab him, and shift--
Marisha: Once I tree stride we can, there's that portal there, and we can go through the portal.
Travis: Yeah, yeah. I am a big fan of the tour guide.
Marisha: The tour guide. All right. We're going to tree stride to the Fire Ashari.
Matt: All right. Most of the trees near or within the courtyard of the fort are thin, and maybe like a foot to a half a foot wide, and--
Ashley: Get skinny, get skinny!
Matt: You did see that cluster of brownish-red forest canopy across the ravine. But that's the only real--
Marisha: Across the ravine?
Matt: Yeah, on the opposite side.
Travis: Let's hoof it. I need to stretch my legs anyway.
Marisha: Well, how big was the ravine, like crossing the Grand Canyon?
Sam: How long to get there?
Matt: It's about a third of the width of the Grand Canyon, maybe? It's a big ravine.
Laura: Can you Plane Shift us over to the Ashari? It has to be to another plane.
Marisha: It has to be to another plane.
Liam: Scanlan, can you turn us into a bunch of hummingbirds, or something?
Sam: I can turn a couple of us into some things.
Laura: Just something little? So that we can pop to the tree?
Sam: You two can fly, right?
Matt: It would take you a handful of hours to walk to this.
Laura: Oh, yeah. So let's fucking do it.
Travis: Told you.
Matt: At a brisk pace on foot you'll get there in three hours.
Travis: I put Pike on my shoulders because I'm getting ready for my Rocky training montage.
Taliesin: We'll get as many of us on the carpet as possible.
Marisha: (groans) RIP the carpet.
Taliesin: You should feel bad!
Liam: I should feel bad?
Matt: All right. You guys eventually make your way to the outside of the forest here in the Othendin Pass. You can see, it's a living forest. But the trees themselves, it looks like there was a waterfall that actually breaks down off the top of the cliff that comes down and forms a small pool. Most of it's dried up, but the ground here is damp. And the forest does seem to exist in this climate. However, a lot of the leaves have turned and they're hitting the delayed end of winter, a few months after the Winter's Crest Festival. You find a number of trees that are perfectly serviceable for your spellcasting. You guys wait as Keyleth completes her ritual. You can see the tree suddenly shifts open on the opposite end. You can see the caldera itself, where the Pyrah Ashari exist on the top of this mountainous volcano. You all step through and find yourself now on the cracked, dark, ashen ground landscape amongst the various rock-like structures that house their people. You can see the Cinder Grove in the distance. Nowhere near as tumultuous as the last time you encountered it. And you now stand amongst the remaining Pyrah. You do now see the survivors that you met earlier, and a few other survivors that previously had not been found have gathered. And whereas previously you only thought maybe a little over 20 existed, it looks like maybe there's a good 50 or 60 that actually are beginning to rebuild the Fire Ashari.
Taliesin: We're going to blow it up again, woo! Table flip!
Laura: Look at that! Keyleth! There's so many more people than you thought!
Marisha: There's still kids!
Matt: Like two.
Marisha: Like two kids! One of those days they might grow up.
Taliesin: We're going to take like, 20 of them to the fight. And they'll be fine.
Marisha: (nervous laughter) Come on, kids! Have a sword!
Liam: That's a big "if."
Matt: It doesn't take you long to find Cerkonos, who at this point in time has regrown his arm.
Marisha: Yeah, I knew he'd be all right.
Matt: He approaches now, his darkened skin tattooed, his long hair past his shoulders. He approaches with an expression of surprise and mild confusion. "It is good to to see all of you. I ask, what brings you to the doorstep of the Pyrah Ashari?"
Marisha: Cerkonos, Thordak has taken over Emon. And in the time that he has broken out of the Fire Plane, it seems there is a certain magic that is allowing him to essentially turn Emon into a second Fire Plane. We believe he still has some sort of connection here based on the binding magic that was used on him in the past. Something called an ember seed. Have you heard of this?
Matt: "This does not stir my memory reserves. I'm sorry."
Marisha: Do you remember if Raishan, when she was moving in and out of the Fire Plane, do you remember her mentioning anything about it? Or anything suspicious about wanting to learn about the connection to the Fire Plane?
Matt: "There were inquiries, yes. I was surprised by one so young seemingly to be so interested in the inner and outer planes and their interactions. She found much of her time in solace in the Cinder Grove. She was not quick to pick up the druidic magics, but her research was in depth. She spoke with many elders, myself included."
Marisha: Where is the Cinder Grove? Did we pass through the Cinder Grove?
Matt: The Cinder Grove is in the center of the caldera. That's the petrified forest that is surrounding where the actual tear in the boundary is. Where the Fire Ashari hold vigil.
Laura: Wasn't the ember seed connected to the-- Didn't we knock down some pillars when we came to the Fire Plane the last time? Isn't that part of the reason his hold was broken?
Marisha: It was opened more. The portal got weak when it was around the solstice.
Laura: Right. But remember, we were here for your--
Marisha: We fought Cerkonos, who was essentially a giant elemental. I don't remember us breaking anything.
Matt: No, when you first came here it was part of your Aramente, and you guys just passed through the tear. And you battled Cerkonos and the other druids in elemental form as part of a test. There was some stones on the other side but there was nothing--
Laura: Okay, maybe you just thought that and were freaking out a bit.
Marisha: Yeah, I got a little panicky at one point. Yeah. Thordak was connected by the soul gem. And we know he busted through. You know the Fire Plane better than anyone. We are also looking for the Plate of Dawnmartyr in the City of Brass.
Matt: When you say the City of Brass, you watch his demeanor change. His arms cross, and he leans back into himself. "That is not a place for the Ashari. It is a place of tyranny and greed. It is a unique mix of those who exist there, and if you are intent on going, I am happy to escort you, but it is a different experience than we are used to, and perhaps yourself as well."
Laura: Is it a large city?
Matt: "It is quite big, yes."
Taliesin: This is the direst of situations. Extreme measures must be taken.
Matt: "The choice is yours. You have come this far."
Marisha: How long is the journey to the City of Brass?
Matt: "From the tear, it is about three days' foot travel." Your Plane Shift spell can bring you directly to a location as long as you're aware of it.
Marisha: Right.
Sam: We can go right there. Be right in the center of the city. Land right in Main Street, next to the Reebok store.
Liam: I have a sweater. I've hidden it in Manhattan. Go find it. (laughter)
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: Let's do it.
Laura: It feels like it's going to be really hard.
Travis: I mean, everything we do is, right? I mean every time we've faced a dragon, we go find another Vestige. It feels like the rhythm is right on this. Let's go!
Marisha: Here's the worst-case scenario though. We're gone, we come back, Thordak has obliterated everything, including Fort Daxio.
Sam: Yeah, but good news. We're still alive.
Travis: We're alive! High-five, Scanlan!
Taliesin: The stones don't work across planes, do they?
Liam: The gatestones? No.
Taliesin: But Allura's ability to send messages does.
Matt: This is true. From what she said, yes.
Taliesin: So if things start going very haywire, we can let her know that she is to call us immediately and we will drop what we're doing.
Sam: She could probably figure that out on her own.
Laura: Yeah, whatever we're doing. Even if we're in the middle of fighting some really big fire elementals we just--
Taliesin: Plane Shift.
Liam: Of course, we'd have to get a message to her to tell her that.
Sam: She would probably figure that out.
Travis: Yeah, she'll figure it out. And we've got an amazing tour guide. It's set up for us. Can't fail. 0% APR.
Liam: You big lovable lug. I still think it's a very bad idea. I'll go if you all want to go.
Matt: Cerkonos turns to you, Grog, and says, "I do not mean to be misunderstanding. I will take you to the city, but I will not enter it."
Travis: Yeah. I'm good with that. I mean you'll take us there, right? You'll give us a couple of warnings, maybe point at something if it's terrible, and then you've got to go because it's going to mess with you?
Matt: "I am of no use in that city."
Travis: Now why is that, like you've got feelings about it? Or you're afraid of it? Or you'll be powerless there?
Matt: "Most of all of that."
Travis: Powerless?
Matt: "There are many powerful entities that exist in the city. I am not a man for cultured places."
Travis: You've been before?
Matt: "I've been near."
Sam: Let's just pop in, pop out, guys. What could go wrong?
Taliesin: We're gathering forces at Fort Daxio to fight this dragon. And if you can lend any of your power, or have any power you can send, we'd be forever grateful.
Marisha: Do you think you could reach out to Korren?
Matt: "I could. How soon?"
Taliesin: Soon. That is where we will head immediately when we are done here.
Matt: "All right. Then I will lead you, if you choose to go to this city. And then I will call for your father, we will send what we can spare."
Marisha: Well, if you don't want to go inside, I can Plane Shift us there. We don't necessarily need you, I guess? I mean, we need you, but I'm wondering if you'd be better here.
Matt: "No offense taken. If you wish to continue your journey, I can go and try and round up the Ashari that can fight."
Sam: Let's do that.
Marisha: Do you know anything of where Thordak was held?
Matt: "I did not know Thordak existed until he tore through our people. So unfortunately not."
Marisha: Is there anyone here left that Raishan spoke to the most? A confidant? Someone who might have been aiding her?
Matt: "It's hard to tell. Many who were near those discussions were slain, I'm sorry."
Marisha: Well, that's fair.
Travis: We're good.
Laura: Scanlan, will you be able to do the mansion inside of the Fire Plane? Or did you already use it--
Sam: Sure, right? I can do my magic wherever. I have no idea, I've never been to the Fire Plane.
Laura: No, I mean, but did you already use it today?
Sam: No, I used it yesterday.
Matt: Correct, you would still have the ability to use it today.
Taliesin: All right. I think we've done an enormous amount towards getting prepared for this.
Laura: Does everything over there fight with fire?
Matt: "Not everything. But many things there have fire by nature. Or at least, the ability to live among it. There are many parts of the Fire Plane that you should not traverse. It would destroy you immediately."
Laura: The City of Brass sucks, but we'll be okay going there, ish?
Matt: "It's one of the few places that can support a city, so yes."
Liam: Kind of hot?
Matt: "It is very hot there. The longer you stay, the more difficult it is for such frail beings as us to exist."
Travis: Speak for yourself.
Laura: In and out.
Travis: Pull the trigger, travel agent.
Marisha: Let's do this shit.
Matt: "Stay safe. I will see you soon at this Fort Daxio."
Laura: Thank you so much.
Sam: This was a worthwhile trip already.
Liam: I'm setting my armor to fire resistance.
Ashley: Is there anything else we need to know, to be safe, to look out for while we're there?
Matt: "Nothing which you haven't already seen. Just know there are many denizens there that enjoy the tyranny, so be careful. Don't start any wars."
Laura: Can I say while this whole talk's been going on, that I've been unattuning my coldsnap armor and reattuning my bracers of archery?
Matt: Sure. It will take you guys a short rest to do all that. Plus, with your reattune there. You guys take a short rest while Cerkonos takes a couple of the other nearby Pyrah with him and they head off towards the Cinder Grove. Presumably, to communicate with your father.
Marisha: Cool.
Laura: Can I ask you a question?
Matt: Yes.
Laura: If I have two bows that are awesome, and I'm attuned to both of them, how easy is it to switch in a battle?
Matt: If you have two bows that are attuned to you?
Laura: Yeah. If I chose to attune to the Sky Sentinel and Fenthras instead of the bracers?
Matt: I mean, it's possible. But the idea of having one wielded and one on your back, pulling it out. You're not proficient and fast in bow-drawing.
Laura: It'd be an action to switch them out in a battle?
Matt: Maybe. Probably. You could drop one, but then pulling the other one out, getting it around you, arrow out. It would probably take you an action.
Laura: Cool.
Sam: Let's just go, man.
Travis: Yeah, I'm standing there with my eyes closed and my hands out.
Laura: Hey! That all happened in a millisecond. I was considering things in my brain.
Travis: I'm showing my willingness to go.
Marisha: Let's go. City of Brass, yo.
Matt: All right. So focusing on the City of Brass. You all gather hands. As Keyleth concentrates, you feel the already warm air of the cauldron of this volcanic mountain. You feel a blast of heat surround you, this whirlwind of hot air that causes your eyes to close instinctually. You feel the edges of your skin, the hairs begin to curl. Your brows begin to singe. As you close your eyes instinctually, you open them again. And looking around you see a familiar broken landscape of shattered stone rock, reddish and iron-like in coloration. You see various stone obelisks that are jutting out of the ground from broken and at some points seismic earth that had been pushed up from underneath where gouts of flame occasionally spill out and burst into the sky. The air itself carries a sulfuric and ionized scent to it. You can see darkened clouds of smoke and soot that slowly shift in the distance. Way off towards the horizon, almost the equivalent of a darkened storm in the distance, except it's a sheet of roaring fire. Just taking up an entire quarter of the skyline, miles and miles away from you. You don't know if it's coming closer or further away, but it's frightening. As you glance over your shoulder, you see behind you a glimmer of whatever source of light this land takes into itself reflecting off of dozens upon dozens of reflective metallic buildings and towers and domes. And one large, dark metal wall that surrounds the exterior. You see upon this, what you assume to be the City of Brass. And that's where we're going to go ahead and take a break.
Travis: Shit.
Marisha: Shit.
Matt: Be right back here in a few minutes!
Laura: Oh, right! With the announcement of our winners!
Matt: It might be a little bit of a longer break, we'll be back here shortly, guys. Be patient, see you in a minute. [break]
Matt: Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. Before we get into the game, we're going to go ahead and announce our winners for the Critical Costumes contest we ran! (cheering)
Matt: Once again, every costume put out there was fantastic. Seriously, you guys, it was one of the coolest things to see, a bunch of characters in our silly little D&D game realized, physically, by other people is crazy.
Liam: It's also, I amass everything and I couldn't get in all the awesome, even into what we put into the slideshow in the episode and in the gallery on Geek & Sundry today. There were so many good costumes and we're blown away by-- I mean, it was a massive amount.
Marisha: A lot came in at the eleventh hour, too, so if you didn't see yours in the slideshow-- we still probably saw, but that would be why.
Laura: Yeah, because we've been looking at the hashtag like crazy.
Matt: Which, by the way, if you haven't looked yet, go look at the hashtag CriticalCostumes and marvel at how many awesome, talented people out there made crazy Halloween costumes. So do it. We're going to go ahead and begin with our personal choices, across the bay. You want to start over here?
Travis: Sure! I chose @couple_cosplay for his white, muscular version of Grog. Grog got abs, y'all. (cheering)
Ashley: I chose the most lovely and wonderful @KinnVelier. Her picture of Pike had the perfect pose, the most wonderful costume, everything was there. Winner, winner, chicken dinner.
Laura: My personal choice was @sara-rokhov! I don't know if I said that right, but she did the costume that was closest to the outfit that we wore in the opening credits, which is really cool because I know that's really intricate, and I saw the sleeves. There was crazy pleated sleeves happening on that costume!
Marisha: Yeah, she got, like, real close.
Laura: It was awesome!
Liam: I'm going to cheat. I'm giving mine to @missbelletrist and @miss_riahne for doing Vex and Vax throwing money around and flipping daggers and climbing trees. Great photos, great costumes, great attitude.
Laura: Yeah.
Ashley: Yeah.
Marisha: I'm going to go with Woodson Schindler AKA @CriticalCorrupt for his Manleth. He did a bearded Keyleth.
Ashley: What?!
Marisha: Oh yeah, it was legit. And his eyeshadow was on point. I just want to say. So @CriticalCorrupt, you're awesome.
Taliesin: Wow, okay! I'm going to go with Karin Rindevall, @karrey over in Gothenburg, for the amazing Percy being very, very busy and at work and reading.
Laura: Upper crust?
Taliesin: And very upper crust. Very fancy. The fanciest. So fancy.
Sam: My choice was an obvious one. It's @cat_cosplay for the cat version of Scanlan, or as I call him, CAT Scan. And for those asking, we're not putting up these pictures right now because we literally just picked them one minute ago, but we'll be retweeting our current, our personal picks of the evening. So you can watch our twitters, or maybe @CriticalRole can tweet them out or something? Okay.
Matt: Yeah, well done. My personal choice is @jettiebettie who did an amazing Ripley. Not just costume and presentation, but the intensity of expression, the personality. It was a fantastic capturing of the character and the minute I saw it I was like, oh, there she is.
Liam: Straight out of Central Casting.
Matt: Yeah, it was amazing. Awesome job.
Liam: So those are our personal picks and we also all picked a third place, a second place, and a first place.
Marisha: Overall winners.
Liam: (dramatic voice) Overall winners. Here they are. Number three: (normally) @kwwins, who is also an artist for us all the time, was chosen for number three for her Minxie/Keyleth transformation pic.
Laura: That was so cool! Good concept.
Marisha: That was so well done.
Liam: Number two goes to @norfrosch who did the amazing Victor with crazy eyebrows.
Laura: So good!
Matt: Yeah, it takes a lot to shame my Victor. Not really, I threw mine together. And then that one, the day after, I saw that picture and went, "Well, damn. I lose." It was amazing!
Marisha: He was like, "Oh, she did way better than I did."
Matt: It was amazing.
Liam: And in first place--
Marisha: We have to go to a commercial break! Stay tuned.
Matt: No.
Liam: Loot Crate!
Laura: Close up on all of us looking at each other like, who's it going to be?
Matt: Oh, god.
Liam: Yeah, so for an amazing Percy in bird mask, both an amazing photo, amazing costume--
Laura: Amazing weapon.
Liam: Amazing weapon, @calahammer is our first place winner. (cheering)
Ashley: That one took my breath away a little bit. Rad.
Travis: (singing) Take my breath away... (a capella version of Take My Breath Away)
Matt: And a gathered round of applause for all those amazing costumes. Everyone did an incredible job. Seriously.
Laura: And just so you know, all of you winners, @CriticalRole on twitter will follow you so you can DM your mailing address and get your wonderful prizes.
Sam: Some of the prizes include shirts that I've worn on the stream, some of which I have laundered.
Laura: Oh, god. Some prizes may include part of my dice hoard.
Taliesin: We're going to send a weird little Halloween cornucopia of weird. It'll be great.
Marisha: We're going to raid our closets. Hook you guys up.
Travis: Hook it up!
Sam: All right.
Matt: All righty.
Laura: Oh no, oh no, oh no! Okay, City of Brass, City of Brass, here we go.
Taliesin: (singing) City of Brass! City of Brass--
Travis: Nobody's with you.
Sam: (singing) City of Brass!
Taliesin: Thank you! Just one Doors fan.
Matt: As you guys take in the intensity of the atmosphere, looking up at the one blaring, bright sun in the sky, locked in that reddish-orange atmosphere above you, you look around as the wind picks up, the heat carrying ash and black soot through, forcing you to wince and keep your eyes somewhat closed. You immediately begin to pull scarves up in front to try and filter this aggressive and caustic air.
Marisha: I'm going to go ahead and cast Protection from Energy on myself with fire.
Sam: Good for you.
Laura: Yeah, right? It's a concentration spell, or else I would've taken it too. You can't do it with anything else.
Matt: Looking as to where that giant wall of fire across the horizon is, you see it begin to merge closer and closer, the edge of that sea, until eventually it comes to the City of Brass, which you see behind you-- this large, amazing, vast city of various reflective, metallic surfaces. You see pointed spires, round domes, and hundreds and hundreds of these buildings that sprawl out beyond the wall that you see on the outside of it. What would you guys like to do?
Travis: Before we go any farther, if we want to pull the ripcord, what does that look like?
Sam: What do you mean, if we want to go back?
Travis: Yeah.
Marisha: We have to, I think, be in a fairly safe space and give me a minute?
Travis: One minute.
Marisha: Let me double check before I say that.
Sam: Are we already backing out of this, Grog?
Travis: No, I'm making sure that we're not like, "Oh, we've got to go! Oh shit!"
Marisha: Nope, I lied. It's instantaneous.
Travis: But we all got to be touching?
Marisha: Me and up to eight willing creatures who link hands in a circle.
Laura: Okay.
Ashley: Okay.
Travis: Okay.
Laura: What's our Jenga?
Marisha: Yeah, what's our code word?
Sam: Super Jenga!
Laura: "Super Jenga" means everybody run towards each other and link hands.
Liam: So "Jenga" means "I fucked up, my name is Vax." And "Super Jenga" means we have to link hands and bounce.
Travis: "Duck, duck, goose" means it's playtime.
Laura: Yeah.
Sam: Let's walk into the City of Brass.
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: All right. As you guys begin stepping towards this, and it is hard to gauge distance on this city's size, even from just arriving in this place.The more you walk, the slower its arrival comes as you begin to take in the sheer immensity of its sprawling expanse. You see little occasional bursts of flame off from the opposite side of the wall, some small shapes coasting over, a little glow pass. And as you get close enough, I'm going to have everyone roll a perception check.
Travis: I got this, you guys.
Laura: 27.
Marisha: 25.
Taliesin: 15.
Liam: 27.
Travis: 12.
Sam: Bullshit over here.
Ashley: 21!
Travis: 12.
Matt: Okay. Keyleth, what did you get?
Marisha: 25.
Matt: 25, and you got--?
Taliesin: 15.
Matt: All right, so Keyleth and the twins. You guys, looking ahead, you're beginning to see these darkish shapes moving towards the edge of one of the first gates that you notice amongst the reflective surface of the outer wall. It is a solid door, like two large doors that are affixed to each other with a cross-chain circumstance. You see six figures currently mounting, shifting, and walking along the side of the wall. As you get closer still you can make out: they look humanoid: two arms, two legs. It's hard to make out their size in respect to where you are, and in paying attention as you approach you do notice that some of them have varying shades of colored skin. They wear loose silk outfits: wide, baggy air-filled pants with long robes or vests that dangle below. Muscular. The skin on a few of them appears to be deep crimson or orangish-red. Two of them, the skin actually almost goes to more like a black, a deep soot and ash color. You begin to see more details in the skin. You see horns and large fangs from underneath. You see large, scimitar-like blades to the side. You've seen one of these creatures before. It emerged from the tear in the Fire Plane last time you were there. There are six efreeti that are currently standing guard outside of the gate to the city.
Liam: Genies.
Laura: Basically. They're really powerful.
Ashley: They're very smart.
Sam: Think we can talk to them?
Travis: Yes, let's parlay.
Laura: Should we go and talk to them?
Travis: Only one should talk.
Sam: Why are you all looking at me?!
Liam: Because you have the gift of gab.
Laura: You are really good. Go talk to them, Scanlan. Be super cool.
Sam: Greetings! Hello! Hi there!
Travis: Oh shit, you're doing it.
Matt: As you say this haphazardly from the distance, you see three of them all of a sudden, their attention right over in your direction. Two of them immediately begin to lift up off the ground and their legs vanish into a plume of flame and smoke as they (whoosh) almost like rockets in the sky, heading over in your direction. The other one goes into a run towards you.
Laura: Oh, Jesus!
Sam: Are they attacking?
Liam: You don't know.
Matt: You don't know.
Laura: I keep a hand on the bow, just in case.
Matt: Okay.
Ashley: Steady.
Laura: Steady.
Matt: As you all very nervously sit there and wait, the two that are cruising through the sky go slamming into the ground to the immediate right and left of Scanlan, not far from you guys, leaving these small craters. The flaming smoke, the lower portion of their body poofs outward, scattering ash as you see now their legs, muscular and thick like trunks of reddish-black muscle. They both stand and glance downward at this tiny little gnome by comparison, each of them standing about ten to 12 feet in full height.
Laura: Oh, fuck!
Marisha: The efreetis?
Matt: The efreetis.
Laura: They're so big.
Matt: The one that's running eventually catches up to you and slows his gait and puts his hands behind his back, puts his chin up, and begins walking. You can see now he has these two long tufts of black hair that are braided into this long braid that floats gently as the heated breeze continues to blow past you. As he begins to approach, he looks out among the rest of your group and then down at this tiny gnome that has stepped up to greet them.
Sam: We request passage into your city.
Matt: "What is your business?"
Sam: We are travelling salespeople and we are here to sell our wares.
Matt: "What wares are you here to sell?"
Sam: One item in particular, which could be of much value to the people in your city.
Matt: "Then show me this item of value."
Sam: I don't think you want to see it.
Matt: "Then you don't want to enter the city."
Sam: All right. It's a pet of ours that we've been travelling with. It's right back there. And I point behind us to an empty space.
Matt: He glances over towards the empty space.
Sam: You don't see it? Oh, I forgot. We've made it invisible. Let me drop the spell. And I will cast Major Image, and I am making a goristro, right behind us, that looks a lot like Yenk because that's the only one I've ever seen. (laughter)
Travis: Oh, I love you.
Sam: 20 feet tall, snarling, growling, just a fucking nightmare.
Matt: Okay. So is it just standing there snarling?
Sam: Yeah, looking real mean and ornery with spit coming off of him.
Matt: Okay. All right. At this point, the three efreeti are glancing in that direction. First off, go ahead and make a deception check.
Liam: This is the weirdest day.
Laura: Ever.
Sam: 28.
Marisha: You don't think the day when we were cows was far weirder? That was pretty weird.
Matt: They glance over. They all very intensely inspect from a distance this goristro that has now appeared, that is snarling approximately how far away from you? The range is 120 feet in the spell.
Sam: Let's say 60 feet back.
Matt: All right. The central one looks to the efreet to his left, or to the right of you, gives him a nudge, and that efreeti-- that efreet begins to step away.
Sam: Ah, ah, ah! You don't get to touch our pet. Please allow us entry to your city and we will find someone who can afford to touch him.
Matt: "Hmm." The efreet that you halted takes a few more steps, not paying heed as the one that's in front of you goes, "So you're looking to sell this as a servant. This beast will work as a servant, or does it work in servitude?"
Sam: It works for me, for the moment, and I can get it to work for someone else for a price. But if your man goes over there, he's going to die, because I will tell my goristro to kill him.
Matt: "Hmph. It is rare to see something so small able to control something so vicious and dangerous." And you see him leaning in now, closer to you. You see these tiny little burning beads of red flame as the center of his eyes, against a black iris. You see, as he gets closer, the grin begins to curl across the rows and rows of sharpened, white, gleaming teeth. He says, "You, such a small, easy-to-crush creature, can seem to hold dominion over something that exists in places that would rend your mind asunder."
Taliesin: I reach into the bag, and I'm going to grab a little chunk of dragon and a chunk of the previous goristro that we still have some bits of, and drop them in front of him on the ground.
Matt: (dull thud) (sniff)
Sam: Those were my other pets.
Matt: (slurping) (spitting) He throws them to the ground. He begins speaking in a language that you don't understand. It sounds very much like the slow, rolling fire-bursts of magma pouring down the side of a mountain.
Laura: What is it?
Marisha: Can I recognize it, as a druid who has spent time as a fire elemental?
Matt: You recognize the type. It is the same language spoken by the fire elementals, but you do not speak the language. But the efreet that stepped away has stopped and is taking a moment to look from about a 40-foot distance from the goristro.
Laura: (distressed sounds)
Matt: (loud sniff) And begins walking back toward the other efreeti. The one before you, whose face is still up in front of you, is reading you. His head is about the size of your entire body. And he goes--
Sam: I'll put my hands behind my back and stand up a little taller to meet him.
Matt: "If you wish to walk the city, then pay the toll."
Sam: How much would the toll be?
Matt: "How much do you think the toll is worth?"
Sam: Vex?
Matt: "If the toll is insufficient, and I find offense at the offer, then you will have bigger problems than entry. But generosity goes a long way."
Laura: So like, money? Is it money, then?
Sam: The money that we carry with us is from a far-off land. Will it still be good here? It's gold and platinum.
Laura: Or would you rather gems?
Matt: "Gems are good as well. Money is money. We work and deal with many creatures from many places here. What do you offer?"
Laura: Should I just, you know what, fuck it? I'm going to put the 20-pound bag of gems in his hand.
Matt: He takes it and closes the fingers of his hand around it, then shakes it a little and listens.
Sam: 20 pound?
Matt: He begins to pour the gems out. He takes a very keen look at them--
Travis: Who are you and what have you done with Vex?
Laura: The world is fucking ending, you guys. How else am I going to use these things?
Sam: Who are you right now?
Matt: He pulls the tiny drawstring taut once again. "May you enjoy your time in the City of Brass. Now, I suggest your wineskins be full." And he turns around and the efreeti all begin to walk away towards the entrance to the city.
Sam: Loudly and conspicuously I say  Stanley, invisible! And then he poofs away.
Laura: Scanlan, I think you let a little bit of scry on the ground there.
Sam: Let's just get in the city and buy me some new pants.
Taliesin: I pick up the dragon scales and put them back in the bag.
Liam: (Stan Lee voice) Greetings, true believers!
Travis: We pick up the dragon parts and we move into the city.
Taliesin: That was a very good call.
Laura: Fuck.
Sam: I throw up a little.
Ashley: You did really well.
Taliesin: Always tip the doorman.
Liam: I'm patting Scanlan on the back and wiping his mouth.
Sam: Great, now we're inside this stupid city. Now what do we need to find, a wall?
Marisha: No, we have to-- hang on. Let's do a quick refresher on the impossible needle we have to find in this haystack.
Laura: Oh, wait! Because I took a spell.
Sam: A 'Find Item Anywhere' spell?
Laura: Locate Object.
Sam: Holy fucking shit.
Marisha: Hang on, hold. I brought that spell as well.
Laura: Oh, okay.
Marisha: It has to be within 1000 feet. 1000 feet isn't a whole lot in this really large metropolis, correct?
Travis: We go to the front door, we do it once, go to the middle, we do it again. Totally covered.
Sam: If you guys go 2000 feet apart, that's essentially a mile spread.
Laura: Right? How many miles is the city?
Matt: You have no idea, you haven't walked inside! You've got no idea.
Taliesin: We are walking towards the door. What do we know?
Marisha: So wait, there's a Beacon of Protection for the Chosen of Pelor. It is gathering dust on a wall somewhere in the City of Brass. It was a trophy won by a fire giant in a card game from the Suutan bloodline that once donned it.
Travis: Fuck. We got to go find--
Marisha: It could be hanging on a pub wall somewhere, correct.
Travis: No, it's a trophy. It's too valuable to be in a pub.
Marisha: Do we know where fire giants might hang out? Or anything about the Suutan bloodline?
Travis: It's on somebody's wall as a trophy.
Laura: Maybe we should ask somebody.
Marisha: I mean, it could be in a noble's house, for all we know.
Liam: Do we see anyone who looks remotely like us, who's not from the Fire Plane, here?
Matt: Well you're just now approaching the front gates where the six efreeti currently stand. As the three that have returned, the central one takes his hand up and does this with his finger. And as he does, you watch as the criss-cross chains that hold the gate shut suddenly shift, and you watch dust and ash get shaken free from the chains as they're all suddenly pulled upward through these rings to the very top, and the doors shift open very slowly, giving just enough space for people of your physical width to pass through. Grog, you have to squeeze a little.
Taliesin: Good sir, one question before we enter your city, since you are such a good friend and we look forward to possibly being friends again someday. Where would one find people who enjoy the sport of watching large creatures battle? If you could think of such a thing?
Matt: (laughs) "Welcome to the City of Brass."
Taliesin: I love your answer.
Matt: As you guys walk in, the doors close behind and you watch as the chains that were pulled free, that now dangle loosely, automatically, on their own, strike up like snakes, instantly, and flash back through on the other side. You can hear them retying themselves between the ring-loops to seal off the doorway once again.
Liam: We are in a city where everyone is going to despise us.
Laura: Not necessarily. Act really fucking tough, dude.
Marisha: Yeah, everyone wants to kick our ass.
Travis: Should we get some jail tattoos before we continue?
Sam: I can make us all look really rough and ragged.
Taliesin: I think there's a lot of magic here. Well, no, let's--
Matt: So as you say "let's" and it trails off, you all take a moment to look into the city around you. Marquet offered Ank'Harel, a very beautiful city of ornate culture. This city has been around far longer, and has been constructed by far more intricate artisans since. You see hundreds of buildings of different sizes, all constructed from various types of materials, many of them metallic and brass or bronze in color, reflecting the ever-present sunlight from the sky. You can see buildings carved from dark black obsidian. From other forms of darkened stone you can see natural rock formations of blackened rock and stone jutting outward, where, crafted from that, you can see communities of maybe dozens of buildings and homes that have been constructed from it. You can see towers that are impossibly high, hundreds of feet up in the sky, some broken from previous conflicts and never constructed since. You can see a series of streets that intertwine out before you with these tiny little cobblestones that all seem to have a matching, ruddy, brownish earth tone with a dusting of ash and red earth scattered across them. You see throughout here human beings occasionally. You see dozens upon dozens of efreeti, walking around, crusted with jewelry and wearing fine robes and linens. You can begin to notice quickly that many of these efreeti walk along with some of these humans, these humans walk at their sides, some in chains.
All: Oh, shit.
Matt: You can see a number of individuals pedaling small carts through, also in comparable levels of enslavement. But not all are enslaved. There are individuals from other areas you've never recognized, various features. You see two humanoids that walk around by themselves, their features are human but not. There's something about them that's a little off, but you can't quite pick up what, and they walk off in the distance. There is a gathering of many cultures that make their way through here, but definitely the dominant culture here appears to be one ruled by the elemental fire djinn that you've already encountered.
Liam: The servants, the humans, and I don't know if there's any elves, dwarves, halflings, or anything in the mix, but people who are not from here, how does their health appear?
Matt: Fine, if perpetually uncomfortable in the current weather, which is, for the record, we're hitting somewhere between 110°F to 120°F in the air at all times here. I'd say, actually, in fact, at this time, I'd like everyone to make a constitution saving throw.
Marisha: Do I get advantage because of the fire resist?
Matt: You're fine. And actually, you having fire-resistant armor, I would say you do not have to make it, Vax. You feel naturally more comfortable in here based on the resistance you've given your enchantment.
Marisha: Do I have to roll? Or am I good to go?
Matt: No, you're fine.
Taliesin: Six! I'm going to use one of my Resolves.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: And slightly better  15.
Laura: 15.
Ashley: Seven?
Travis: 19.
Matt: Okay. For the time you've been here, it's been an unwelcoming atmosphere, but not one that has been so harsh as to press down upon your physical constitution. You all seem to withstand the current atmosphere for now, but you do gather that the longer you are here, the more difficult it will be to endure this atmosphere without detrimental effect.
Marisha: I meant to note I wanted to put my Ring of Protection on and put the cloak away when we took that short rest. I don't know if I said that out loud.
Matt: You did not say that out loud
Marisha: Can I do that now?
Matt: Sure.
Marisha: And it takes some time.
Matt: It's fine. So what do you wish to do now that you've gained entry into the City of Brass?
Laura: Let's find that armor.
Travis: Keep walking. Let's keep walking and see what we see.
Laura: Yeah, we walk the fuck forward. Should we get a little farther into the city or should I cast it right now?
Taliesin: I think the city's huge.
Marisha: Hang on, how long does that spell last?
Taliesin: That's the other question.
Marisha: Grog, could you recognize fire giants if you saw one? Are they akin to stone giants?
Travis: I don't think so. I don't think I've ever seen one.
Matt: You have not seen a fire giant in person in all the time that you've spent on this plane.
Travis: I bet I can pick it out, though, if it's giant and it's made of fire.
Marisha: And you're like, that's a fire giant. All right, yeah, totally.
Taliesin: Ten minutes-- and the other question is if you can change into a flying creature.
Liam: Are there any humans around right now who look like they're not slaves? Who look well-off, relatively?
Matt: Right now, you have not encountered any. You've literally just walked into the city and this is your first glance at the first street that you've encountered. As you guys begin to walk farther into the city, one thing that you do notice, too, is there are these stationary torches that meet at various crossroads. And at the top of these torches there is a ball of flame that is flickering and shooting off spurts here and there, and every now and then you hear one go (flaring) in the distance and that's what you were seeing on the other side of the wall. These flames cause this dancing light source effect throughout the entire city due to the vastly metallic nature of the building construct here. And so as you--
Sam: Sorry.
Laura: Oh, wow. That might be the worst shirt you've ever worn on the show.
Sam: Yeah, I'm out of shirts, guys. 74 fucking shirts. How many do I own? 74.
Liam: Wow.
Laura: Wow.
Laura: You'll be shirtless.
Liam: I'm bringing you a new shirt for your birthday, man.
Travis: "Okay, I farted. It was me."
Ashley: "Okay, I farted. It was me."
Liam: Holy moly. Bring it back, people. I'm specifically looking for a human who is not a slave, who looks reasonably well off.
Taliesin: I'm looking for social gatherings, pubs, and otherwise.
Marisha: I'm going to talk to Vex as soon as we get a hot second, whenever that falls.
Matt: Okay, so as you guys are walking, keeping your eyes out before yourselves, you guys engage in conversation as you continue into the city.
Marisha: All right, so we both have the Locate Object spell. It lasts for ten minutes and we can both fly. We could both cast it and maybe do like a perimeter run, maybe?
Sam: Wait, how long does it last?
Marisha: Ten minutes.
Laura: Ten minutes.
Taliesin: Ten minutes.
Sam: We can get a long fucking way in ten minutes.
Marisha: Yeah, if we're flying.
Laura: As long as, you know, nothing attacks us. Right. That's clutch.
Marisha: Well, I could also potentially Polymorph into something or Beast Shape into something that-- Has there been any type of creatures?
Laura: Flying creatures here?
Travis: In the air?
Laura: Maybe wyverns or something?
Matt: You haven't seen any, at the moment. You have seen, so far, efreeti being capable of flight, both from your previous encounter and the two at the gate that just jettisoned off in your direction before landing.
Marisha: Okay, are they considered humanoid-ish? To where I could Alter Self to look like an efreeti?
Laura: A teeny, tiny efreeti.
Marisha: Teeny, teeny efreeti? No?
Matt: No. From your Alter Self ability? No. They are far too different in size, physiology, and appearance to pass off as an efreet.
Marisha: Are there any humanoids like, like--
Taliesin: A fire elemental?
Marisha: Or like dragonborn, or like what's the thing that Zahra is? I'm drawing a blank right now.
Sam: Wyverns? Lizardpeople?
Laura: Tieflings?
Marisha: Tieflings, are there like any tieflings around?
Matt: You can keep an eye out as you continue walking forward. You don't see any yet.
Marisha: I want to look for the most unsubjugated humanoids.
Matt: Okay, so you keep an eye out as you progress. And you're looking for--?
Liam: Anyone who looks like they're not a servant, who looks like they're maybe getting by well.
Marisha: Yeah, kind of the same thing.
Matt: Okay. Continuing farther into the city. This whole city has this vibrant life to it, from the way it reflects light from the ever-changing, flickering skylight from the sun, to the flames that adorn every single conjunction of roads that make their way through the city, to occasionally, you will see cracks in the ground where a flame will flare out then retract within. Go ahead and make a perception check.
Laura: Can we also keep an eye out for anything flying? I want to see if anything's flying around the city at all.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: 22.
Matt: 22. No more than maybe five minutes into your walk into the city, you do notice two efreeti have begun to follow you from about 20 feet behind. They're both walking and talking to themselves, keeping an eye on you guys. Well, they're about 25, 30 feet behind. As you continue walking forward, you do bring your attention ahead and at the next street junction, which is more like two alleys that collide, you do see two individuals that walk out. One of them is a similar humanoid as to the strange-looking ones you saw go walking by there. They have a thin figure, sallow, elongated features, their hair is wild and red and stringy and upward behind them. Their eyes tend to have a non-human appearance to them, the iris a light-orangish color. They have long white and gold robes and are walking alongside a tiefling of similar red skin to the color of the efreeti here, with deep gray, long hair that goes behind a ridge of horns that curl into almost like ram horns in the front, and the long, gray hair extends to the mid-back. They both walk along side by side, their arms within their robes-- both are wearing matching white and gold robes-- and they each step out from the alley and begin to walk ahead of you guys about 60, 70 feet.
Liam: So it's these two strange beings with strange eyes and a tiefling.
Matt: There's one entity that's the strange being and the other is a tiefling.
Liam: Oh, okay. So one is one and one's another, thank you. I'm going to walk up to the tiefling, like ten feet away. Excuse me! Sorry, can I trouble you for a minute? I've just come to town. I know, that sounds ridiculous, it is, I'm a stranger in a strange land. Could I borrow you just for a minute?
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Sam: I just got to hell, haven't even unpacked my bags--
Laura: No warning, huh?
Liam: That's a 20.
Matt: 20. They both turn and look towards you with a curious glance. The strange, alien-looking one gives a half-cocked grin and shakes his head. The tiefling looks you over for a second. "Stranger, I mean you no offense, but--" And as he looks past you at the rest of the group walking behind you. "You know what, follow me."
Marisha: Oh, shit.
Taliesin: Well, here we go.
Matt: They both continue to walk in the direction they're walking.
Liam: They're together, right?
Matt: They're together, but they face away from you. He's just, "Follow me." And they both continue walking ahead of you guys.
Liam: All right, so I trip along behind them, and then I turn around and to the group I go--
Taliesin: I'm all right with this. This is a great way to die.
Sam: We're following along behind them.
Laura: Yes.
Ashley: Yes.
Travis: Yes.
Marisha: Yes.
Marisha: Can I do like an insight check, like size up this tiefling from a distance and see what they might be about, get any idea about what they might do or be?
Matt: Go ahead and make an insight check from what very little bit of body language you can see. It's going to be very hard to read anything.
Marisha: That's really bad. That's the Gil dice. 15.
Matt: 15? Unfortunately, at the distance that he was from you, about 60 feet or so, and what little bit time he was faced away-- his interaction with Vax was so short, it's a blank slate. Nothing you can read off of him.
Laura: Are they looking and talking to each other at all?
Matt: They're not talking to each other, they're looking, facing away from you, and walking the same pace they were. However, Vex, since you were looking up in the sky, you do see, for a brief instant, a large, avian-like entity--
Laura: What does "avian" mean?
Matt: Bird-like.
Laura: Oh, got it.
Matt: --but massive. And it looks to leave some sort of flame-like trail behind it as it (fiery whooshing).
Liam: (whispering) A phoenix!
Laura: (whispering) A phoenix!
Marisha: (whispering) A phoenix!
Ashley: What!
Laura: Harry Potter!
Travis: Fawkes!
Matt: Make an intelligence check.
Laura: Okay! Oh. Intelligence?
Matt: Yes.
Laura: Ew. Eight?
Matt: Eight? Yeah, it's a flaming bird!
Laura: That's a fucking bird, y'all!
Marisha: So they have birdies.
Sam: So is it one of those-- what were they called, Ashley?
Laura: Ah! Natural 20 on the--
Ashley: Always.
Matt: Just don't do that because it doesn't matter! All you're doing is killing yourself, Laura!
Laura: Every time.
Matt: All right, as you guys continue to follow these two--
Liam: Yeah, where are they leading me?
Matt: Do you guys keep the same distance? Do you catch up with them, do you stay behind, what are you doing?
Sam: How far back are we?
Matt: You're about 60 feet behind them.
Sam: Someone should--
Laura: Get a little closer.
Liam: I'm going to wave them away a little bit.
Travis: I think we're cattle. I'm going to lag. I'm going to drop another 20 feet back from the group.
Matt: Okay. As you drop back from them, you come pretty close to the two efreeti that are following you from behind, and one of them puts his hand out and grabs you by the shoulder and pats you and goes, "So friend, you are--? You are--?"
Travis: What?
Matt: "Who are you?"
Travis: I can't hear you.
Sam: Oh no!
Taliesin: No.
Marisha: No.
Matt: Make a deception check.
Travis: 17.
Matt: "Heh. I like this one. We'll keep him." And he pats you on the shoulder and they both walk--
Travis: Hey! And I smash the Titanstone Knuckles together and I cast Enlarge.
Matt: Okay! You guys hear what sounds like a small crack of thunder behind you (thunder crack sound). As you glance over you can see Grog has swollen to his enlarged size and is now walking shoulder to shoulder with the two efreeti that began to flank from behind. They both take a step back. "I double down on my statement. We keep him." And they keep walking shoulder to shoulder to you. They're not doing anything, they're walking shoulder to shoulder.
Marisha: I stop and turn around and wait for them to catch up.
Ashley: Yeah.
Sam: Oh god. I hang back as well.
Matt: All right, so you guys, hanging back--
Laura: I'm going to try to keep a little closer to the two in the front and try to see if I can overhear their conversation at all if they talk.
Ashley: I'm going to hang back until they come up.
Taliesin: I am not hanging back; I am right in the middle. I'm trying to, like, be that middle point that keeps everything connected.
Laura: This is like when your friends start to drink at the Ren Faire and you're like, should we keep going forward, or what do we do, do we wait?
Marisha: We'll meet you at the axe-throwing, just go ahead.
Liam: To the oubliette!
Taliesin: To the oubliette!
Marisha: To the oubliette!
Liam: Just put it all out on the table.
Travis: So are they keeping pace with me, or are they standing next to me?
Matt: They're keeping pace with you as you're walking. You're walking shoulder to shoulder as the rest of you begin to slow down and catch up except for Vex, Vax, and Percy, who continue forward. We have Pike, Keyleth, and Scanlan beginning to catch up with Grog, and as you guys eventually get to the point where you're walking slow enough that the two efreeti catch up behind you, they keep walking with you.
Marisha: I light up my flame hand and I turn to one of the efreeti and I go: Fist bump.
Laura: Oh no.
Marisha: Pound it, man. Pound it.
Matt: Make a persuasion check with disadvantage.
Laura: Oh, it's at disadvantage. Come on, Keyleth!
Liam: Roll high, come on.
Marisha: What did you want? Persuasion?
Matt: Persuasion.
Marisha: Ten.
Matt: He looks at your fist and flicks it. It does sting a little. It doesn't do any damage but the flame goes out. In fact, it's strange. Normally the flames would stay, but it's almost like he willed the flame in your hand to extinguish.
Laura: Oh shit.
Ashley: I have a question for one of you fine gentlemen.
Sam: Oh boy, we're all getting in it.
Matt: The other one on the other side of Grog, that wasn't interacting with Keyleth, grunts. "Hmph."
Ashley: Do you guys--?
Sam: (imitating efreeti) We're both women.
Ashley: Oh, I'm so sorry. Anyway. Do either of you happen to know where the temple of Pelor is?
Matt: They both slowly look at each other and grin. And slowly nod their heads.
Ashley: You do!
Matt: They turn back and one of them goes, "Yes, we do, actually. Would you like us to take you there?"
Ashley: You can just show us where it is. I think there's going to be a couple more spots we're going to stop.
Matt: "You seem like you are not from around here. It is dangerous to wander these streets unaccompanied."
Ashley: Well, I got this guy.
Matt: "This one?"
Travis: Yeah! Hi!
Marisha: Man, we've been here five minutes.
Matt: He extends a hand next to you, a very large hand, and he says, "Come. I will carry you to your destination."
Ashley: I don't like to be carried. I don't like to be made to feel smaller than I am, thank you.
Matt: "Then let us continue to walk. We will want to take a left at the next big juncture." They both keep walking alongside the two of you. While this is happening, you guys are keeping behind and glancing over your shoulder and seeing the rest of your party slowly gather at the knees of these two walking, haughty-looking djinn.
Liam: (clears throat) Yeah, I was hoping for a little bit of advice about town. This is starting to feel a little kinky. Where are we going? I don't need to talk that bad. Where are we going?
Matt: This is to the tiefling?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: The tiefling looks over his shoulder towards you and goes, "We are going to-- (groans). All right, this just got very-- If you look ahead, one alley, we are going to dart to the right. Follow, quickly."
Liam: Follow you to talk right now?
Matt: "Yes!"
Laura: Okay. I go.
Matt: So they begin taking up their pace a little bit, quickening their walk, almost like a light jog.
Liam: Okay.
Matt: Do you guys keep up?
Liam: Yeah. What the fuck are we doing?
Laura: I don't know, I don't fucking know!
Matt: Okay. You guys look ahead and you see the other three members, the rest of your party, beginning to get farther away from you at a faster pace.
Laura: So it's me and you. Are you coming? Are you still in the middle?
Taliesin: I'm keeping pace, but I'm trying to be at the back end of it. What's happening?
Liam: Percy, we're going to go in the alley up ahead to the right.
Laura: Dart to the right.
Taliesin: Well, all right.
Marisha: I'm going to keep pace with Grog.
Sam: I'm with them, yeah.
Travis: (exclaims) Just trying to be even simpler than I am. Maybe then they won't want me.
Marisha: You're probably making it worse.
Travis: Oh, no.
Matt: Okay. Following up at pace with them, you get past a couple of small intersections and the two figures dart off into this small alley, right off to the side.
Laura: I go.
Liam: I'm going to stealth.
Matt: Stealth by going into the alley?
Liam: Before going into the alley. I mean, I don't know how dark this is.
Matt: What are you stealthing behind?
Liam: Are we in broad daylight?
Matt: It's a pretty-- heh. I'm not going to say it, but the sun is high in the sky.
Liam: Yeah. Okay. (laughter)
Sam: (McCree voice) It's full sunlight.
Taliesin: (McCree voice) It's lunchtime.
Liam: Okay, so no changing in lighting in the smaller alley.
Matt: Correct.
Sam: (McCree voice) It's just turned to PM.
Laura: The efreeti behind us, are they paying attention to us, or are they completely distracted by all of the--
Matt: It's hard to tell. They don't seem to be paying any mind, and when the two figures darted off in the alleyway, there was no--
Laura: Anything?
Liam: And how far away from the other group are we at this point?
Matt: At this point, you're about 80 feet in front of them.
Liam: All right, I stop her and stop at the corner and look around. Do I even see them if I look around the corner?
Matt: The two figures that darted off?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: Yeah, they're about 15 feet back and they're both waiting.
Liam: We saw them dart to the right. I don't know what's in there! I go running in with my eyes closed. That's how I do.
Matt: Okay. Percy, do you follow suit?
Taliesin: Oh, yeah, I follow suit, yeah. I'm running in there.
Matt: Okay. The three of you dart in. You guys watch as the three of them vanish into that alley.
Marisha: Do the efreeti react to them vanishing?
Matt: No, but that's about two intersections ahead. The ones immediately before you, the efreet goes, "Turn left. To Pelor's temple."
Taliesin: For god's sake, you two, tell them that you have to meet your owner!
Travis: Oh! Do it. Tell them that we've got to meet our owner.
Matt: "Left to Pelor's temple, small one!" As you guys are coming to the intersection--
Ashley: I'm so sorry, what did you say? Left at where?
Matt: "Right here."
Ashley: We're supposed to meet out master at the temple of Pelor, so--
Matt: "Then I am taking you. Take a left."
Ashley: I'm going to cast a Zone of Truth and ask him some questions.
Matt: Well, hold on a second.
Taliesin: Yeah!
Ashley: Is that a bad idea?
Taliesin: There are no good ideas anymore.
Marisha: It's all bad ideas in Dungeons & Dragons. It's really true.
Liam: Well, what I would have done was--
Marisha: Sometimes you get lucky with a bad idea.
Taliesin: That's all the game is is getting lucky with bad ideas.
Sam: We're Cubs fans walking down Cleveland Boulevard.
Matt: Well, as you begin casting your spell-- because casting a spell is a very physical thing-- you begin to whisper your various divine incantations beneath your breath, and your holy symbol of Sarenrae begins to glow, though diminished this far from the Prime Material plane, still effective. You get partway through your incantation before the two efreeti who are flanking grab Grog by the shoulders and forcefully push, like a giant wedge, trying to shove your entire group to the left down the street. You, being at the immediate brunt of that, basically are getting shoved in the shoulder and off to the side. I need you to make a constitution saving throw to see if you maintain concentration on the spell.
Ashley: Okay, okay, okay.
Marisha: You busting out the Hand Cone?
Sam: I'm busting out the Hand Cone, ready to go.
Ashley: Seven.
Matt: Okay, yeah, so as you're partway through the incantation before it gets completely scattered halfway through and the spell is lost. You still used the spell slot, though.
Ashley: Okay.
Matt: But they're now using Grog as the base point and all three of them are pushing you all to the left forcefully. Scanlan, what are you doing?
Sam: Are these humanoids?
Matt: Nope.
Sam: Okay, I'm going to start singing. I pick one, the stronger of the two, and I'm going to sing at him. Or her, I don't even know.
Matt: You turn around and sing in their face.
Sam: Yeah, yep, singing at them. (singing) I make you want to leave the one you're with, start a new relationship with me. That's how it's going to be, make you go--
Travis: Usher! Usher from 1999!
Sam: A little Usher. I'm going to cast Dominate Monster on it.
Matt: Oh shit, okay!
Laura: Oh god. Do they know they're being dominated?
Sam: Of course, but hopefully it'll give us a getaway.
Matt: What's the DC on this?
Sam: Well, it's my spell, right? 21.
Matt: Jesus Christ, dude.
Taliesin: That's the angriest thing I've ever heard.
Matt: Fucking Scanlan. Let this be a lesson to all DMs out there: be careful about creating magical items that increase spell DC. So that's a wisdom saving throw--
Sam: You can always break it or something.
Matt: Let's not break it, but be careful, be mindful. All right, so, wisdom saving throw. Two on that. All righty. The efreet that is on the left side, the one that is directly behind you-- the other one that's pushing Pike off to the side is separate-- the one that's behind you, as you turn around and begin singing up to it, it stops in its tracks and nods its head to the beat as you're singing and its eyes half-close for a second, and you get the assertion that the spell has taken effect. The other ally is still pushing Grog and Pike and basically scooping you guys into this alleyway to the left.
Ashley: Can I cast Hold Person on that one? I think I can do it on a humanoid.
Liam: But he's not a humanoid.
Laura: But he's not a humanoid.
Travis: But he's not a humanoid.
Ashley: He's not humanoid, never mind! That's what you literally were just talking about.
Sam: Can I command him?
Marisha: All right, am I standing by Scanlan? Are they in front of us now?
Matt: No, they're behind you, basically you got like shoved off at the point. Scanlan turned around and did that as Pike's being shoved off to the side. And Grog, they're both shoulder to shoulder shoving you in that direction. So that was your action.
Sam: I can't also command him to do anything?
Matt: Hmm?
Sam: Can't I command him to do something?
Matt: You can, I'm getting to that point. All of this is happening simultaneously. As you're doing that, singing in the face of that efreet, you just got knocked out of your spell, so you're going to have to take a moment to do that. Keyleth, Grog, what are you doing?
Travis: I'm going to trip and fall flat down onto the ground.
Matt: Okay, so you (grunting) and intentionally fall prone on the ground. All righty. Keyleth, what are you doing? If anything.
Marisha: Oh, I don't want to do something I'm really bad at, which is talking to people. I have ideas. Okay, is this what I want to do, I'm going to do Alter Self and I'm going to change myself into a tiefling?
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: And then I-- oh god this is really terrible, oh my god, I am really bad at deception-- I'm going to turn around and say, I'm sorry, there seems to be a miscommunication. These are my slaves. They are already owned and my property. Release them immediately.
Matt: Okay. So as Scanlan's in the middle of singing a song, and the one efreet stops in their tracks, you turn around and your form shifts. What do you want your tiefling to look like?
Marisha: You know, I don't have a lot to go off of except for Zahra and that one that was in front of us, so I'm going to do Zahra, like a red. You know, a red, with like devilly horns, definitely give it a tail. I want to look intimidating. I want to look like you wouldn't want to meet me in a back alley, but that's where we are.
Ashley: A bad bitch.
Marisha: A bad bitch.
Matt: Bad bitch tiefling.
Marisha: Bad bitch tiefling.
Matt: Which is still, like, an eighth as intimidating as an efreet. But you whip around and you say this, I'm going to have you go ahead and make a deception check.
Laura: Come on, Keyleth! You got it.
Marisha: It's just a straight roll. Oh, god. Oh Jesus Christ. Nine.
Matt: Okay, as you're talking up to the one on the left, as Grog falls forward, he's looking off down and he's going to reach for him as you shout in his face. (scoffs) And palms you in the face with his hand, and I need you to make a strength saving throw.
Marisha: A saving throw. Oh, that was almost so good, that was almost great! 13.
Matt: 13. Basically his hand grabs you and, like, his fingers close around the back of your head, holding you like a ball, and lifts you a little off the ground and throws you into the alley. So as Keyleth gets chucked off to the side of the alley, you're finishing getting pushed off. Scanlan, what are you doing with your command over the efreet?
Sam: I say to him  Hey sweet baby. Look at me. It's all going to be okay if you yell at your friend to let us go.
Matt: The efreet that you control turns around and goes, "Hey! This is not our business. We need to let them go." The other efreet goes, "What are you talking about? They're at our disposal!" He looks back at the first one who goes, "It doesn't matter. Let them go. Now." The other one looks down at you and looks at the other one. That's cocked. And glances down at you, Scanlan, and goes, "What have you done to my friend?"
Sam: I say to him  I'm just a mere slave and-- kill him! Kill him now! Kill him right now! (laughter)
Laura: Oh, no!
Taliesin: Oh, no!
Matt: I need to make a-- actually, for Dominate--
Laura: Get up and run, you guys. You better fucking run away.
Travis: Is anyone else in this alley?
Matt: Right now, from what you can see-- You can't see anything, you're on the ground prone right now. You're surrounded by everyone shouting at each other at this moment. From what you can see, nobody else is in this alleyway at the moment.
Laura: It's crazy city, people fight all the time.
Ashley: They're used to this, this is everyday life.
Liam: Yeah, there are fights on every corner.
Matt: Okay, yeah, so the efreet that you control, who's still staring at the friend, looks at you as you shout this, grins, and grabs the other efreet by the throat and slams him into the wall.
Marisha: Run!
Matt: You just go running? (laughter)
Matt: Down the alleyway?
Marisha: I want to go catch up with them!
Matt: So as it's holding the other efreet against the wall, his thumbs pushing into his throat like (choking), it's reaching up and grabbing the back of the hands, its legs flailing as bits of smoke and ash being cast off, Keyleth runs past, this tiefling fucking running as fast as you can down the alleyway. What are you guys doing?
Travis: Can I pop up, grab Pike, and start running after Keyleth?
Matt: Yeah, so you grab her by the back of the armor and lift her up off the ground. Pike, you start running, but all of a sudden your feet are off the ground, you're running in the air, as Grog is like bounding with you.
Travis: And I'm hoping that as we get towards the door I can shrink back down to go through any doorway that they're headed towards.
Laura: We're heading towards an alleyway.
Matt: There's an alleyway, is what you can see, that Keyleth darts off into.
Travis: Good deal.
Matt: Scanlan, what are you doing?
Sam: I am staying put until my friends are far away. I'm watching them, watching them, back and forth.
Matt: Okay, you watch as the one efreet holding his friend against the wall there is like (strained grunt). The one that's being choked goes, (choking) "What's this?" He reaches down and pulls a blade out of the side and begins jabbing it into the arm of the guy who's holding him.
Ashley: Run. Run!
Taliesin: Run. Run!
Matt: Which does six damage there, and he gets to make a saving throw because he took damage. So he's like, stabbing him in the arm repeatedly. The other guy's like (grunting), still pushing into his throat, and he takes him, lifts him up, and slams him into the other wall, causing him to drop the dagger in the other hand, and begins to push him down towards the ground. You can see his eyes, still intense, but controlled by the spell as he's pushing the other efreet into the dark stonework and you can see it cracking and breaking against the force. The other efreet now is being held against their-- (foreign language) and begins chanting something beneath his breath.
Sam: Oh, shit. They do magic shit?
Taliesin: Yes, they do.
Sam: I thought they were just big and scary.
Taliesin: No.
Matt: So he's currently chanting under his breath and you watch as the words begin to emit, his form begins to shimmer and change.
Sam: How far have my allies gotten?
Matt: If you're glancing around the alleyway, at this point in time, full pace, full round, you see Grog and Pike have just now disappeared around the corner of that alleyway.
Sam: And Keyleth is gone?
Matt: Keyleth is gone. She got there before they did. Actually, you guys would have caught up pretty fast because of Grog's speed. So Keyleth would have gotten a head start and then Grog bypassed her, so you just see Keyleth disappear behind the corner of the alleyway.
Travis: I'll snag Keyleth, too. I've got them both.
Sam: All right. So my work here is done, so I'm going to tip my beret, good day to you both, and I'll Dimension Door into the alley with them or wherever they went. Actually, I don't know that alley, so I'm going to go in that direction the number of feet I think it is.
Matt: Okay, so you'll be appearing at the mouth of that alleyway and you can dart into it. I would say go ahead and make a stealth roll to see if the one who is currently casting even has a glance of seeing you out of the corner of his eye.
Sam: Oh, wow! That's the best roll I've ever done. 21! Stealth!
Matt: Okay. At the moment as you disappear into the door, you watch as the efreet that's being choked, his form turns into reddish-white gas, like a cloud of mist, and escapes the grip of his friend, who then looks up and-- let's see here. Okay, yeah, he's going to go ahead and angrily look up and his legs turn into that burst of flame and begin to rise up. And he begins clawing at the gaseous cloud as you disappear and vanish, leaving them both still fighting. You pull into the alleyway and you guys are all there for a moment. You see the rest of them further down the alleyway now. You continue following them, I imagine?
Sam: Yeah.
Laura: Do we need to hide?
Marisha: Yeah, do these alleyways connect? Does it block around?
Matt: The one that you were pushed into, essentially as you were walking forward, is to the left. You guys continued forward past two more alleyways and then went to the second one to the right that way and so this one continues down and seems to curve around after about 100 feet or so through a series of buildings that are built right next to each other, giving you one pathway that curves out of sight.
Laura: Let's go as far away out of sight as we can.
Matt: Okay, so you guys continue forward down that alley. You hear in the distance the muffled sounds of some sort of weird, echoey scuffle and it seems to vanish into the rest of the atmospheric sound of general wind being blown through tight passages and the occasional flare of flame. You all turn the corner as it begins to curve and suddenly there's another splinter alleyway that descends into stairs and, you guys following the two humanoid individuals you originally followed, continue down that path and they lead you into a small, enclosed room. There's a door that's partially ajar and they've shoved their way into it and disappear inside. Do you follow?
Laura: I think that's the option. Everybody's running for their lives right now.
Matt: All right, so you guys all dart into this same room. As you guys all charge into here--
Sam: We all die.
Matt: Yeah, it's filled with spikes and fire. As you go charging into this room, immediately it's much smaller that I think you all anticipated and it would be Vex and Vax getting there first. You guys charge into the room and your darkvision helps you as you adjust to the change of light, just in time for you to run into the two individuals that had led you in there. This is some sort of a storage room, filled with a series of metallic boxes. And this room could comfortably fit five people. And as soon as you charge, you ram into their shoulder and before you can turn, all of a sudden, you watch as Grog with two other people comes slamming in and you've all very tightly squeezed into this dark space.
Laura: Sorry.
Ashley: I climb and sit on top of Grog.
Matt: As Scanlan comes around the corner--
Sam: Right in behind Grog's butt. Just smooshed on up.
Matt: And you do. Sweaty cheek. Reverse motorboat. It's a terrible thing.
Liam: Is it tight enough that the two strangers are smooshed in as badly as we are?
Matt: Yeah, they're like, (strained) "Okay-- please-- "
Marisha: Is this dark?
Matt: It's dark. There's no light in here, yeah.
Marisha: I lift my hand and I light it up to give us a little bit of light.
Travis: Could we close the door?
Taliesin: Scanlan, close the door!
Sam: (muffled) Why are we in here?
Travis: Are there any windows or anything?
Matt: No, there's just the door you guys entered. It's a storage shed.
Liam: This is a little more than I think I was asking for, but what is there to see in the City of Brass?
Matt: You're asking this right now? He looks at you. "You're asking this right now?"
Liam: So we're out of sorts. We're not from here, obviously.
Laura: Hi.
Liam: Hi. That's my sister. You can tell because she looks just like me.
Marisha: Aw, Grog.
Travis: It was Pike!
Ashley: That's not true.
Marisha: It's a very small room!
Liam: You don't look like many of the larger folk-- thank you, dear-- that we've seen around here either. Are you from here? Are you strangers here?
Laura: How are you not slaves right now?
Liam: That.
Matt: Let me change this to a bit of a calmer circumstance, here-- the tiefling says, "Shh!"
Laura: Sorry.
Matt: "Shh! Close the door!" And it is like--
Laura: Can I climb up on one of the boxes to give more foot room?
Matt: As you all inhale, the door finally closes. Vex climbs up. A minute of quiet passes. Eventually, as silence passes for a bit, you hear a voice, a very soft and gentle voice that you haven't heard yet, break the darkness. He goes, "I think it's safe to speak now." The lithe-looking individual you saw earlier with the wiry red hair and the somewhat reddish-black eyes says, "Well, it was uncommon to see individuals wandering this city with a look of absolute victimization."
Sam: (muffled) We don't look that bad, do we?
Laura: I pick up Scanlan and put him up on a box.
Liam: Those aren't pillows!
Sam: I don't think Grog wears underpants!
Travis: Who does?
Matt: "I'm Senokir. This is Uten, my business partner. We are jewelers here in the City of Brass. And if I'm not mistaken, you now owe us a favor."
Liam: Maybe we could do a bit of business. Percival, you were looking for a jeweler, right?
Taliesin: Well, it's a little far away at the moment, but we could do a bit of business because we have other business to attend to.
Marisha: What caught your attention on us, aside from the utter look of pathetic-ness?
Matt: "Favors are more useful when you're not in chains."
Laura: Yes, this is true.
Matt: "So. Let us wait here about ten, 15 more moments. Let any immediate chance of you running into those thugs pass. We'll have a more private conversation at our place of business, if you don't mind."
Laura: Why do you wear those white robes? Do they signify anything?
Matt: "They signify our freedom."
Marisha: Were you once in chains?
Matt: "Few that come here manage to escape that fate immediately. We found our way."
Marisha: That's ominous. Can I do an insight check? Does that mean he murdered a lot of fricking people?
Matt: Make an insight check.
Marisha: Let's go druid dice. Oh god. Ooh, it's an 18! What was it, insight? Right? 29.
Laura: Whoa, you've got really high insight.
Taliesin: She know shit.
Sam: Whispers! Loot Crate, everybody! Loot Crate is a wonderful sponsor, a fine, handsome company.
Laura: Magic!
Sam: Their theme is magic. You'll get a box of magic shit.
Taliesin: Doctor Strange is part of this one.
Laura: And I think Magical Beasts.
Sam: These are movies that I will never see, because I have children.
Taliesin: In about 15 years, we're going to sit down and show you everything. It's going to be great.
Marisha: Which one was the tiefling, and which one was him?
Matt: The one that's been speaking to you is the other humanoid of strange racial origin.
Marisha: Senokir is the humanoid?
Matt: Yeah, Senokir is the humanoid.
Marisha: Who is, something's off about him?
Matt: Something's different. You don't recognize his race or background.
Marisha: Uten, how long have the two of you been in business together?
Matt: "Shh, let us wait. We will continue this conversation at our establishment."
Laura: Is this your room?
Matt: "No."
Laura: Whose room is it?
Matt: "I have no idea. Which is why we shouldn't stay long."
Ashley: Do you know where those thugs were trying to take us? Or have an idea?
Matt: "I have no idea, but I imagine they would have called in some friends to meet you and you would have found yourselves in a very tough position."
Liam: All right, it's really starting to smell like Grog in here, so why don't we go--
Matt: "A few more moments, please."
Travis: It was really hard not to fight, man. I do terrible when I don't fight.
Matt: "Shh." You wait in awkward silence for the next five minutes, with any sort of sound, utterance, or conversation being immediately shushed by Senokir. Eventually--
Ashley: (fart sound)
Matt: --Senokir perks up and the slightly pointed ears of his form seem to almost twitch. "I think passage is safe. Very well, open the door. Follow us, please." As you guys filter out, they continue, a quick pace, and lead you through a series of winding side streets and momentary pauses to pass as a number of other creatures and individuals walk by. Passing efreeti, passing occasionally some sort of giant, winged, red creature that stalks down the street, dragging behind it a large cart that has bars in it. You can see a number of smaller, almost, I wouldn't say fey-type creatures, but things that are definitely not of this realm, that are all bound by neck irons. You do also see a few small families wander through, laughing, that appear to be humanoid, but once again their physicality is very similar to the individual Senokir. Eventually, you are led back to a simple exterior. It's a back entrance, leading away from this main street. They both enter to this iron doorway. Senokir pulls something from a pocket and glances at the rest of you. He pricks his finger and places it to the edge of this object, some sort of a disk, and it has a small point on one end that he uses to prick his finger. Once he's smeared his blood on the disk, he presses it against the door, and the iron door opens up a little bit. Places it in his pocket. "Come inside, so we may speak, please."
Taliesin: All right.
Liam: All right.
Laura: I want to look in his eyes as we are about to go through and see if-- how honest he looks.
Matt: Make an insight check.
Liam: I mean, everybody in this city wants us as slaves, so it's not really any more dangerous in there than it is--
Sam: Kind of flattering, really.
Laura: 21.
Sam: It's like one of those beefcake slave auctions for charity.
Matt: Glancing at him, he's a very hard individual to read. He has this awkward, stilted conversational cadence to his way of speaking, and whenever he speaks to you, he's not quite looking at you.
Laura: Hey, my eyes are down--
Matt: He doesn't seem dishonest, just hard to read.
Laura: All right. I like your hair. And I walk in.
Matt: Okay. As you guys enter, these wall sconces begin to come to life on their own across the walls. On the inside, you can see this gorgeous workspace for all sorts of small-level metallurgy and metalcraft. Percy, you really appreciate this. You see small furnaces and a number of metals laid out in ingots, some used in different volumes. Many substances and things that you've never seen before. A couple of small boxes to the side of rough, uncut gems, currently at this distance--
Taliesin: My word.
Laura: I walk up and smack Percy on the ass and say, "Feel like making a home here?" and walk past him.
Taliesin: I'm certainly thinking of some plans.
Matt: As the door closes behind and the two individuals walk in, they rummage around and begin finding some small stools and arrange them so they can present to you more like, treat you like a guest. He sets them down. "Please, sit, and we shall speak."
Travis: Okay!
Laura: How long does Locate Object take to cast?
Sam: Well, that's not something you would ask him. I think he's just our host here.
Matt: "I have no idea these words you speak." All right, Locate Object. Locate Object is one action, so it takes six seconds to cast.
Laura: Can I try to cast it as we sit down and see if it's in our vicinity?
Sam: You can cast that shit all the time?
Taliesin: How often can you cast it?
Laura: Well, it's a 2nd-level spell, so I can do it a bit.
Matt: So as everyone's sitting on your stools and getting ready, you close your eyes for a second, concentrate, mutter beneath your breath. You extend your understanding in this dark space around you, waiting for the warmth of any sort of call to the Dawnmartyr Plate. Eventually your mental expansion reaches the limitations of the spell, with nothing coming back.
Laura: Tight, tight, tight.
Matt: As you've all sat down and assembled, Senokir sits as well, hands crossed very pleasantly in front of him. Very up straight, strange head cocked a little to the side. "So you've found yourselves here, out of place, and we've helped you once. We will discuss the terms of our repayment for our aid. But before then, I must ask why you would come here so unprepared."
Marisha: So unprepared? Does the name Thordak ring a bell? The Cinder King? It's a pseudonym, maybe?
Matt: "I have heard this name."
Sam: Alias.
Laura: Did he hang out around here?
Matt: "No. He stayed mostly over the Sea of Fire."
Laura: Hmm. Anywho!
Sam: What about that Plate of--? No? Maybe? I mean, I don't know, what are we here for?
Matt: "What are you here for?"
Marisha: Thordak has escaped into our realm--
Matt: "Good. Keep him away from here."
Marisha: All right, that's what we want as well.
Liam: You have a distaste for the wyrm?
Matt: "No, I just don't trust dragons."
Taliesin: He's currently still linked to this realm.
Matt: "Hmm."
Taliesin: We are trying to take care of as much of it as humanly possible.
Matt: "Heh. Humanly."
Taliesin: As much as humanly possible. Perhaps a little bit more. We are here for the little bit more. We seek powers to help us defeat the dragon.
Matt: "Perhaps I can be of aid. What powers do you seek?"
Laura: What powers can you do?
Matt: "I asked my question first."
Sam: So creepy!
Taliesin: Perhaps it is time to lay it on the line. Time is of the essence.
Liam: Sure, go for it.
Taliesin: Let's make a deal.
Liam: If this goes south, we can just wrap it up.
Taliesin: We seek a set of plate armor.
Laura: A trinket, really. Nothing huge. Somebody won it in a game of poker, I believe? Cards?
Sam: A card game of some sort.
Taliesin: The Plate of the Dawnmartyr.
Marisha: It used to belong to the Suutan Bloodline.
Matt: "Suutan, now that I am aware of."
Marisha: Yes?
Matt: "Does it still belong in the possession of this Suutan?"
Laura: I don't think so.
Sam: Our information says it does not.
Marisha: It was won by a fire giant.
Matt: "A fire giant within this city?"
Taliesin: That is our belief.
Sam: Are there any fire giants in this city?
Matt: "That narrows it down. There are only three that live here--"
Sam: Oh, well that's great!
Matt: "--not under subjugation."
Sam: Happen to have their names?
Laura: Do people under subjugation own a lot?
Matt: "Generally, no. Those that own them, own what they own. So maybe it's one of them. We can go ask."
Sam: Are they close?
Matt: "Relatively. Depending on which one you ask first."
Sam: You could just give us their addresses or something and we could go check it out. If you had a Thomas Guide--?
Laura: Where's Uten? What's Uten doing?
Matt: Uten is sitting back, arms crossed.
Laura: He seems totally chill? This is the way this dude talks all the fucking time? (laughing)
Matt: Completely unfazed.
Taliesin: Depending on how things go, we may even speak of perhaps commissioning some pieces. Your work is astounding.
Matt: He suddenly leans forward, steps up from the stool, and walks over to you and begins to look very closely over your clothing. "Can you afford what I make?"
Taliesin: Possibly. I would like to think so. Depending on how the next few weeks go, there will be much to celebrate, and your work is celebratory.
Laura: Do you require monetary compensation, or is it something more?
Matt: "Depends. I have plenty of money, but you owe me, and if I help you find this giant and this armor you're seeking, you will owe me even more. So. To keep this interesting, how about we go find this armor?"
Liam: You don't even want to hint at what you're looking for?
Matt: "Where's the fun in that?"
Liam: You cheeky bastard, Matthew Mercer.
Matt: "So. To the giant?"
Laura: Should we make ourselves not look like us? Should we maybe look like something different?
Travis: Yeah, how will you keep us from being harassed in the streets?
Matt: "Well, I mean no disrespect, but--" He lifts his hand and snaps the fingers. You watch as Uten goes, "Oh, right, sorry. I got you." He goes rummaging through a case and you hear what sounds like the dragging and clanging of many pieces of small metal. Procures a series of chains and neck irons. Senokir looks up. "There's not much else I have to offer but, for the most part, you won't be bothered."
Ashley: Oh, you love it.
Taliesin: Let me put forward a theory for you.
Travis: You son of a bitch.
Taliesin: I hate those eyes. I can't look at them. I hate you. Whatever deal we make with you here, for the record, none of us will be staying. We may be coming back to fulfill some service, we may be coming back to fulfill some favor, and we will if that is the deal we make.
Matt: "If that is the deal we make."
Taliesin: But the deal we make will not include any of us. Is that understood? Is that agreeable?
Sam: Unless it's for a one-time sexual favor of some sort.
Taliesin: Only with him.
Laura: In which case, take your pick.
Sam: I'm up for that.
Travis: I'm up, too.
Taliesin: Oh my god, you people.
Matt: "I think you will find our arrangements agreeable."
Taliesin: And I may have some things to excite you with, as well. Stop it! I know you've been doing it all game!
Ashley: That was me.
Marisha: He said in accent.
Matt: "It seems we've found some semblance of an accord for the time. Come, place these gently upon yourselves and we'll be on our way."
Laura: Don't you have any white robes you can give us instead?
Matt: "I'm sorry, no. Those come with station, and station requires recognition. None will recognize you here. You'll be found out immediately."
Sam: Should we chain ourselves to each other, or to you? How does this work?
Laura: Check out those chains and see if they're magic?
Marisha: A few of us could look like you, to keep all of us out of chains? Maybe a few exceptions?
Laura: You can get big and then look like an efreeti?
Marisha: I can look like one of them. Very simply. I think we'd all feel a little bit comfortable if some of us were free.
Matt: "Sure. If you are confident."
Marisha: I study him and I change to like a--
Laura: Maybe somebody that is better at talking?
Marisha: I don't have to talk, I just have to look like someone else. That's not that hard.
Taliesin: Oh for god's sakes.
Sam: I'm going to go look at the chains and arcana check them.
Matt: Go for it.
Marisha: I change myself to look like one of him. I'm like, eh? Eh? Passable?
Sam: Oh, 22! No, just 20.
Matt: Just 20? The chains appear to be mundane. They are heavy, they are thick, they are definitely functional, but they are not enchanted.
Sam: I'm going to slap some on.
Liam: I'm going to slip on my ring of invisibility and spend the next 20 minutes attuning to it.
Matt: He looks you over. "Impressive. I think you will get no concern from myself when the other genasi cross your way."
Marisha: (slowly) Do all of you talk like this? Do I also need to talk like this?
Matt: "I don't know what you mean."
Marisha: Never mind.
Travis: I go put the chains on, as well.
Taliesin: I put the chains on.
Laura: I want to put them on, but I don't want to click them. I want to hang them and make them look like they're attached, but I don't want to attach them.
Matt: Okay, make a sleight of hand check.
Sam: They fall to the floor!
Ashley: Are they wrist or--
Matt: There's one for each wrist and then a neck iron.
Laura: 11?
Sam: I'm familiar with these because I have a set in my room.
Matt: Of course you do. The idea is, your hands are chained, and the chains attack to the neck iron about there, so you don't have a whole lot of arm movement, and then the neck iron has a chain from the back that is held. And actually, Uten begins to gather all the chains at the very back and runs them to a singular ring, which is held by him.
Ashley: Can I put on, if I put on my Glove of Storing, does that mean I have to take off one of the gauntlets?
Matt: Glove of Storing, yeah. You wouldn't be able to have both attuned because they're both on the hand.
Ashley: Can I wear one?
Matt: No, sorry.
Taliesin: Just for insanity's sake, before I slip them on, I'm going to take a little bit of gunpowder out of my pouch and sprinkle a little bit in the locks and have some on my hands.
Laura: You're going to blow your little hands off.
Taliesin: Oh, it's going to be awful.
Matt: (Victor voice) "Learn from my mistakes!"
Taliesin: Not enough to blow a hand off, but yes.
Matt: Okay. Vex, you manage to get them clicked on, and as soon as you feel confident, they go (clank) and hang open.
Laura: Oh. I must have not attached them quite right.
Sam: Do you want me to do it for you?
Laura: Oh, no, that's okay.
Travis: Please?
Matt: As all of the chains are attached, some time has passed. You've attuned to your ring. What have you un-attuned to?
Liam: My boots have gone slack.
Matt: So you have the ring on. You're maintaining your altered appearance. Uten takes all the chains and clinks them onto the one ring. Gives it a tug, just to check, and you all feel the tug from behind. "Very well. It seems we are prepared. Come, now, let us all go speak with Whaska."
Liam: He didn't chain me, though, right? Am I chained? There's no invisible floating chain?
Matt: No, he doesn't seem like he's intent on chaining all of you. He just chained those that couldn't pass.
Sam: Whaska the giant. Whaska the giant, right?
Matt: "Yes."
Liam: Is Vex chained?
Laura: I am.
Liam: I tweak her nose and give her a wet willy, and then dart six feet back.
Laura: You fucking dick!
Matt: (chuckles) (laughter)
Matt: "Now come! Uten, come." And he walks out the front door, this time. As you guys are led through the two front doors, as they open, as Senokir pushes them, you see this wonderful thoroughfare in front with a giant fountain that has this molten rock, this lava fountain, that pours out into this large, open pit that descends into darkness below. You see these giant, black, obelisk-like pillars that jut out in the center, and probably about two dozen entities from all walks of life walking through and having conversations and talking, many of which having their own chained slaves at their side. This appears to be one of many central social civil places within the City of Brass. And that's where we'll end tonight's session.
Travis: Did the people that have the people in chains, are they wearing the white robes and stuff?
Matt: Different outfits. It appears that it isn't like, the white robes signify that a person is free. Just for these two, it's a level of station, it seems, in the way they've described it.
Sam: Had we stopped in one more minute, I would have had to take off this shirt, revealing nothing underneath.
Matt: Shit!
Taliesin: Not even his bare chest, just nothing. The void.
Sam: Lava pouring in.
Liam: We'll grab Ashley, run into the fire plane, the armor will be right there, for her visit, and then it'll be done! One shot.
Matt: You're not filming next Thursday, are you?
Ashley: I hope not. That's the first day of that next episode, so I don't have the schedule yet.
Matt: Let me know. If you're not scheduled, we'll try and Skype you in, because I would still like you to continue this.
Ashley: I will. I'll have to Skype, but--
Matt: That's fine. Just having you here.
Travis: Good to have you back, man!
Liam: It's better when you're here!
Ashley: Oh, well, okay!
Sam: It's really better when you here. It's not good when you're not here. In fact, don't watch when she's not here.
Ashley: I felt like, maybe to everybody watching, but I didn't feel like we were playing that long. So you ended the game and I was like, "No! What? We just-- oh."
Matt: It's been four hours! I know. Well, guys, thank you for watching. I hope you had fun, as we do, in this insanity.
Ashley: I love this character so much.
Taliesin: He's my new favorite. The week after Halloween? The week after?
Matt: That's just how it worked out, guys!
Taliesin: I'll never see Victor again. I have a new best friend.
Matt: Guys, you're awesome. You're awesome. I'm going to go home and sleep. Thank you, Loot Crate, once again. Thank you to all you amazing Critters in your amazing Halloween costumes. Still blown away by all of that. Have a wonderful night, and is it Thursday yet? See you next week. [music]

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons & Dragons. We have a bunch of announcements; try and get through them as fast as possible. First and foremost, Taliesin Jaffe is on his way, he's playing the part of Sam Riegel and being late today.
Sam: Yeah. Clever.
Matt: But he'll be here shortly. And we do not have a Travis Willingham tonight, unfortunately, he is out of town shooting something pretty awesome, so yeah, boo indeed. Not watching Avengers this time.
Laura: That was the only time he's missed.
Matt: That was the only time he's missed it, yeah. And he was not happy. I know. He's like, why is everyone else leveling and not me yet? Nah, sorry dude. Anyway, so we'll miss you Travis, sorry you're not here. Oh, it sounds like we have a Taliesin. Get in there, Taliesin. We have two sponsors--
Sam: Wait, what, Matt? Two sponsors?
Matt: What? Two sponsors. We're splitting this up, is what we're doing. First, the new tonight-only sponsor we have is Puzzle Quest, Magic Puzzle Quest, actually. If you've watched any other programs this week, Me, Marisha, Liam and Taliesin all did a show that was on Tuesday. Before Talks Machina. Game the Game, with Rebecca and Ivan, where we played it, as well as a number of other ridiculous games. But it's great, I grew up playing Magic, it's very much a mutually--
Sam: Oh, Taliesin has it on his iPad right there!
Matt: There you go, and it's facing sideways. But it's a puzzle drop game, but mixed in with the mechanics of Magic. It's free, you can check it out, and they're being awesome, sponsoring us tonight. If you're into fantasy and that type of three-match games, totally up your alley, and if you click on the link in chat, which is bit.ly/criticalquest and try the game out. That's where you can go ahead and find it. So--
Liam: You should totally play that during the Thordak fight.
Taliesin: This is my plan, while you guys are doing your stuff, I'm going to be playing Puzzle Quest.
Matt: Oh and Taliesin, also I have left a sheet there for your updated Cabal's Ruin.
Marisha: Yeah, we have updated stuff.
Taliesin: Wow, you nerfed me. Okay. I'm just kidding.
Matt: No, in working on the campaign guide, and the section about the Vestiges, while also seeing how things played out through the game as we've gone through, there's been a slight balance tweak to a couple of them, most in your favor. Enjoy.
Taliesin: I think you were giving me a little bit of this drunkenly during Westworld, if I recall.
Matt: I think so, actually, yeah.
Marisha: The main thing that has changed on the Spire of Conflux is that I now gain plus one bonus to spell attack rolls and my spell save DC increases by one.
Matt: It's a benefit to you.
Marisha: Yes it is.
Matt: It's a benefit to anybody who uses it in their own home campaign, it is not just specific.
Laura: And Fenthras is a plus five to attack? And plus ten to damage rolls?
Liam: 12 hours of wings, Matt? Thank you!
Matt: All the Vestiges suddenly turn to dust. In your bag. And your tears.
Liam: You have chosen poorly.
Matt: Exactly. So yeah! So aside from Magic Puzzle Quest, we also have our secondary sponsor, Loot Crate!
Sam: You know, guys, I always do a little fun Loot Crate thing, but this week I'm not going to be doing the Loot Crate announcement. This week, my new character that I've been workshopping, Brody Slater! Of Malibu, California is going to be doing the Loot Crate ad. I've been workshopping this, I've been doing some acting coach work with it.
Taliesin: How you never did a rhyme on SNL is beyond me, man, I don't know how--
Sam: It's a showcase for Loot Crate, but it's also a showcase for my acting. (laughter)
Sam: Let me get into character real quick. Yo surf bros and bunnies! December can be a mondo bogus bummer! You want to lock in on a maxed out cruncher, ride an outside breaker, shoot the curl on an epic set, but you can't! It's too cold! The beaches are blown out, the swells are glassy, and you feel like you're getting a sand facial, like some gremlin poser, amirite? Well not for long! Get amped again with December's radical Loot Crate. The primo duds'll get your heart beating like a gnarlatious double spinner, toes on the nose! The geeky gear will make you feel like you're droppin' in on the wedge, pruning out at Pendleton, or taking a face goofy-foot at Sano, outrageous! So don't wipe out, sign up! For Loot Crate! At lootrate.com/criticalrole, promo code "critical role" for ten percent off your first month. Bonzai! All right. (cheering)
Matt: That's pretty good! A little Scottish at the end, though.
Taliesin: Somewhere in Topanga Canyon right now, Dweezil Zappa is bleeding from the nose, going: oh! What?! What?!
Laura: That blonde hair did something for your complexion, though.
Taliesin: Yeah, no, you were glowing.
Liam: No wonder you're in voiceover!
Sam: I mean, we're versatile actors, and I just want to showcase that to the people!
Matt: I hope that's a sneak peek of your character in the next campaign, Sam.
Sam: Definitely.
Matt: Thank you Loot Crate, thank you Magic Puzzle Quest-- Check 'em both out, guys. Couple quick announcements! Talks Machina will be up next Tuesday, and every following Tuesday simulcast both on Twitch and Alpha! So you guys can still get a chance to watch it, the Alpha supporters will still have all the access to it. It's going to be awesome, glad you guys get a chance to follow us along with that and to try out the platform, and enjoy it on Twitch. So yay! So, next Talks will have a couple guests, which you might meet later on this evening, will be joining the next episode this Tuesday at 7:00pm here and on Alpha. You're welcome, Brian. Next up! Next Monday December 12th, from 4:00pm to 6:00pm, there's an extra special holiday season episode of Dick and Johnson happening here. Dick and Johnson Save Everything Ultra Holiday Special-- such a specific title-- going to be a bunch of guests, including Chloe Dykstra, myself, I will be showing up for a little bit, with some ridiculousness in characters, so you guys need to check it out if you haven't already, it's-- how do you describe the game? It's like a shark riding a reindeer shooting a minigun, while waving an American flag and playing D&D.
Taliesin: That's a great tattoo.
Matt: That's a challenge to you guys. Show us your pictures of your great amazing Dick and Johnson tattoo. Wherever it may be on your Dick and Johnson. But tune in next Monday, December 12th, at 4:00 to 6:00pm, check it out, I'll see you there. All right.
Sam: So many announcements.
Matt: I know! We're getting there, we're getting there. New GM Tips came out today! (cheering)
Matt: This week's topic is specifically on running an evil campaign, and curbing modo-- herber-- murder herber-- murder hobo behavior in games. Check out the good times. That's out now on YouTube and the Geek and Sundry website. Also, at the break today, we have a very special video from our good friend Patrick Rothfuss and plays Kerr in the world, as we're helping support his Worldbuilders charity, which has been doing amazing, gangbusters, and they're setting up a specific Critical Role page on that, with a few prizes that we're providing from our end as well for people that enter and donate, that you can win. So he's going to put together a video and information about the page will be available very soon. Go check it out, it's an amazing charity, I've talked about it here before, and the money's being matched, dollar for dollar, by a number of corporations for everything you donate. So check out the break for a special message from Patrick Rothfuss.
Liam: He's a good human being.
Matt: He's a good man. And he wanted to be here tonight but he's unfortunately in a-- I say unfortunately-- fortunately in a tux, at the, I think it's the game-- what? The--
Taliesin: Gamer's Choice Awards?
Matt: No no no no. Child's Play, I think, charity event tonight.
Taliesin: It's the gamer's Shorty Awards.
Matt: So the whole cha-- no, it's the charity! It's all about charity, apparently. Speaking of charity, we have the pleasure of once again, as a fantastic example of this community that's sprung up around this channel and this show, so many of you guys have been so generous, and supporting of all the charities we've spoken of, and other charities you've gone on to find, we have one amazing Critter who is here tonight, named Mark Kuro, who has donated an amazing amount to 826LA in the name of this show-- (cheering)
Matt: --and you guys, so say hello to Mark everyone. Mark, I'm blown away by your generosity, and I think it's a fantastic example once again of the power of community that you've all put together and helping support other people who don't have the opportunity.
Mark: Well, and I also want to thank you guys for the inspiration. I mean, you get to throw inspiration dice around all the time, but when you do it in the real world, it makes a big difference. So I think 826LA is an amazing charity, and I think I would do sort of a Christmas Critter Charity Challenge, for all the Critters out there at this time of year especially, to go ahead and donate to your favorite charity, donate to 826LA in the name of Critical Role, and again, make a difference. World's gotten a little wonky, time for love and generosity is never better than now, so thanks guys.
Matt: I completely agree. Thank you, Mark. Really appreciate it, thanks buddy.
Mark: Kill the dragons, he's got to die!
Liam: He said, he said, Mark said, he's got to die. He's got to die, Matt, he's got to die.
Matt: Well, you know, maybe I gave you a damage bonus, I don't know. Thank you, Mark.
Marisha: And yeah, and as always, 826LA is amazing, and there might be a local branch in your city, I know there's one in San Francisco, I know there's one in New York, I know there's one in Chicago.
Taliesin: You should totally check it out, you can also-- they have web stores, and you should go onto their web stores because there's a lot of really good Christmas stuff that you can buy that's fun and arty and poetry-ish, and kids poetry that you can buy books of that's actually really good, and it's a great Christmas gift, and you're giving to a good cause. It's amazing.
Marisha: Yeah, it's amazing.
Matt: Hell yeah. Oh, and I forgot to mention this too, for the Talks Machina announcement too, while it's remaining on Twitch, also they will have an enhanced version on Alpha in the new year as well, so you'll have that positive element of it, too, and get to see what the platform is capable of doing with that show. So. There you go. Spotify playlists are still rolling out. We had Laura's go up last Friday.
Liam: It was so good, it was so good!
Laura: Did you think so?
Liam: I did, I liked it.
Laura: Is it maybe because you had a song on there?
Liam: Well, that's part of it, but the whole thing was pretty good!
Laura: Thanks, bro.
Sam: It's all Debbie Gibson.
Laura: You had a song on there, too, Sam.
Sam: I did?
Laura: Yeah, I know you didn't listen to it.
Sam: No, I haven't. I will tonight. I'll go down to Spotify, or Geek and Sundry, or wherever you get them, and--
Marisha: Did you ever listen to any of the first playlists that we put out?
Sam: Of course I did! I listened to mine. (laughter)
Liam: You are on a show called Critical Role, where a group of nerdy-ass voice actors--
Sam: My best friends, who I support, by showing up! (laughter)
Sam: No, I listened to them. I read your little blurbs. I did, I did those things.
Liam: Oh, I just got the Christmas spirit all up in my heart. Nice.
Taliesin: Let's get some seltzer, we'll get that right out.
Marisha: Thank you for your click on the Geek and Sundry website, I guess!
Taliesin: Just a click, not a like.
Matt: And, last--
Taliesin: Who is the Spotify playlist this week?
Marisha: You.
Taliesin: Oh, it's me? Oh, that's great.
Sam: Have you done it yet?
Taliesin: Yeah, I know I did it, I did do it-- It's good, it's good music.
Liam: Sam will listen to it in five months.
Matt: Last but not least, me and Marisha are guesting at MagFest in January, 6th to the 8th, MagFest is one of my favorite events and has been for many years, it's a video-game music festival. We're going to have a bunch of panels over there, and there's a bunch of great concerts and shows going on, it's a general awesome, fun experience. If you haven't been before, I recommend it, if you have been, go again! We'll be there. Come and say hi.
Laura: There's also a couple more announcements.
Sam: More and more and more and more.
Laura: I know, I know, but these are good. Well, last weekend was PSX and there were a couple awesome projects that were announced there, which is the new Uncharted game! The Lost Legacy! What what what! I play Nadine, what what what! (cheering)
Laura: And then, also announced at the same time, was Last of Us 2, starring one Ashley Johnson, so we're all very very very excited about it--
Matt: Our D&D show book-ended PSX, that's cool, actually.
Laura: Yeah, it was pretty frickin' cool. And those are going to be a long time before they're out, but you know, it's still really awesome. And then! Finishing announcements tonight with some special, special treats, which is--
Matt: I haven't even seen that.
Laura: A Critical Role hat. Yeah, you've been in here the whole time. This is out, in the store, right now, as well as Critical Role dice! So, I have heard tell that if you get these ordered-- if you live in the United States, at least, I'm sorry international Critters-- but if you live in the US then you should be able to get these before Christmas!
Marisha: Yay! Stocking stuffers.
Laura: Yeah, great stocking stuffers, great under the tree presents too.
Liam: This is a fine-ass baseball cap. On the inside it says: How Do You Want To Do This? Oh, and your head is so small, and my head is so large.
Marisha: And it's all embroidered.
Sam: And it's perfect for when we play all the other Dungeons & Dragons Twitch shows in our softball league!
Laura: Right? So we have a certain amount. And I by the way rolled these dice, before the show, and I got a critical on my d20, so--
Matt: No guarantee.
Laura: They're in the store right now. There's a limited amount, obviously, like it always is, but! As soon as they're gone we're going to order more. But if you want 'em for Christmas, then you know, probably get them soon.
Matt: All righty. I think that's it, right? Okay, good. Wow. Front-loaded them this week. Thank you for your patience, guys. It's all good! Good announcements. Good things. Good holiday spirit kicking forward. And in that same spirit of good positive fun, let's bring it down here into the current dramatic, rocketing conclusion of the Chroma Conclave, for tonight's episode of Critical Role! [dramatic music]
Matt: Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
Sam: A lot happened. A lot happened in that break.
Matt: Apparently! I missed most of it.
Laura: Pure chaos.
Matt: I'm so removed from most events at the table before the game starts, I'm like: what happened? What?
Taliesin: Do you phase out so you don't hear the terrible things we say?
Matt: No, I'm focused on the rest of the shit that's happening tonight. Anyway. So, to get you up to speed, our fantastic band of adventurers, Vox Machina, had been battling against the Chroma Conclave, a collection of evil, dangerous chromatic dragons, led by Thordak, the Cinder King, who has been reigning over their home city of Emon for quite some time, terrorising the community, and apparently slowly undergoing a change based on the elemental stone that is embedded in his body that once locked him into the Plane of Fire. You've defeated most of the dragons, and allied yourself with one of the only remaining members, Raishan, the green dragon. You guys have since acquired a number of allies, you made your way to the Fire Plane to the City of Brass, you returned to find Fort Daxio under attack. You managed to defend it, you saved a few friends, returned to Whitestone, and it seems like everything is gearing itself towards the final conflict in Emon, with Thordak the Cinder King. Last we left off, you were meeting underneath Whitestone at the ziggurat, with the current standing council, the War Council, of both Whitestone and this entire endeavor. You decided a couple of people to come with you, and now is your time to spend the next day or so wisely, as the army from Fort Daxio and Syngorn will be arriving at Emon by about sundown the following day. Your airship was in transit to Daxio, and has been rerouted to Emon as well. Everyone is converging to the city. What do you want to do to prepare?
Laura: Oh god, it's all happening!
Marisha: Okay. They're all going to the city.
Laura: So, what time of day is it right now?
Matt: Right now, I'd say about mid-afternoon.
Marisha: Are we still down by the ziggurat?
Matt: Yeah, you guys just finished your meeting at the ziggurat.
Taliesin: I have some guns to repair, because everything broke, and many of these things cost money now.
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: That's small picture. We're big picture.
Liam: How long is the trip, did we say? To get to Emon from here.
Sam: Instant for us.
Laura: Well, we have to go through a tree.
Sam: Or a teleportation circle.
Liam: Then we're meeting with Dad?
Laura: Yeah, he's marching to Emon right now.
Marisha: Are we going to have a meeting spot outside of Emon? We should probably have a plan.
Taliesin: We should probably get close to Greyskull and see if we can enter through the tunnels.
Liam: I think that's our way, yeah.
Sam: Yes, but we do have to rally with your pops, and also didn't we cut loose 55 soldiers to wander free in the desert from Daxio?
Laura: They're meeting the other armies.
Sam: They're just going to form up?
Laura: Trust in them. They're soldiers, they'll be able to find their way.
Sam: Right. But can we scry and figure out where this other army is? Maybe we'll go there? Or maybe we should scry on our old keep and go there. Those seem like two good locations.
Taliesin: I think scrying on the old keep and then letting everyone know-- we don't necessarily want everyone arriving at the same place as well, as long as there's a coordinated movement towards the city.
Laura: They can all start attacking and we can come in from the bottom.
Sam: Sure, but we've told the approaching army nothing about any plan whatsoever.
Taliesin: We can call them if we need to.
Marisha: So we probably want different regiments flanking the city in different areas?
Taliesin: And then maybe the 50 men coming into the sewers to fight.
Liam: I feel like we want to catch up with our father's army before they're anywhere near the walls of the city, because, well, that'd be stupid.
Taliesin: We can go meet them if that's the next move.
Sam: And strategize when we get there? Once we see their forces, and what they have to offer?
Marisha: Percy, do you still have that map of Emon?
Taliesin: Yes, somewhere.
Laura: We should probably talk to Gilmore as well, and let him know that he has to fucking join us.
Marisha: That he drew the short straw. We drew the short straw for him.
Taliesin: We should also collect some other allies, if we're going to head in this direction.
Laura: Of course.
Sam: All right. Do you want to go talk to Gilmore, Vaxy-poo?
Taliesin: We're going to need a painter, you know a painter, we should bring a painter with us.
Sam: A painter? To paint our exploits?
Taliesin: Yes, to paint our exploits. You have that portrait--
Marisha: Once again, Percy, I feel like that's small picture--
Taliesin: Is it small potatoes? Is it really, though?
Liam: We could find a jeweller right now. If that's what you're into.
Sam: I have a man at a casino that I really need to get revenge on.
Taliesin: You might as well get it all done now, because you're not going to be able to do it later.
Marisha: 24 hours left alive!
Liam: Kynan? Kynan!
Sam: All right.
Taliesin: But no, stock up on what-- again, Whitestone doesn't necessarily have a lot for us to gather--
Sam: But we should bring any potions. How we doing on potions? Did you ever divvy up our last several potions?
Laura: I did divvy up our last potions, I feel like it might be smart to get some more, but the only place to really buy any is Vasselheim.
Sam: Is that true?
Laura: I mean it's the only city still standing that we have access to immediately. We don't have a lot of time. The thing is, I feel like people in Vasselheim said they would help us, but I don't know how they'd get to Emon to help us in time.
Sam: I know, an airship! Oh shit, where's our airship?
Laura: It's on its way.
Sam: To where?
Liam: Emon. To Emon.
Sam: Did we say Emon, or did we say Daxio?
Matt: It was on its way to Daxio--
Marisha: They're redirecting to Emon.
Sam: Thank God. We're sending it to a dragon instead of a fort on fire.
Taliesin: It does have weaponry.
Laura: Yeah. It's made to take on things attacking it.
Taliesin: It's designed to help keep him on the ground.
Marisha: Uh-huh, yeah, it's a giant balloon in the air--
Laura: It's not a balloon, actually--
Taliesin: Well, no, it's a giant crystal. It's-- I know I keep saying--
Marisha: I always think of it as a high-tech Hindenberg.
Taliesin: I know. Please don't say that. That's not funny.
Liam: That's a metaphor for Vox Machina.
Matt: There you go. If there ever was one, yeah.
Sam: All right. Besides gathering our forces here, gathering our potions here, and telling Gilmore, where are we going? Let's put it to a vote, as we always do, democratically. Grog?
Matt: "Yes?"
Sam: Grog, where would you like to go? To the army waiting just outside of Emon, or to our old ratty keep with nothing in it?
Taliesin: "I'd like to go to the--" I don't know.
Laura: I don't know what he wants.
Matt: Percy's getting a little strange off to the side.
Laura: Wait, Travis is watching, so he can just text in, yeah. Grog is thinking about it. Grog is thinking really hard.
Matt: He considers it for a second and goes, "Whatever makes me kill things faster."
Laura: That's good.
Marisha: Wait, have we rested?
Matt: You did rest before coming here. You spent the evening in Fort Daxio.
Marisha: And then we teleported. No, Allura brought us here.
Sam: Okay, putting it to a vote. Three choices. Ready? To your dad, to our keep, or to Vasselheim. I don't know why, but it's been mentioned.
Marisha: Hang on, I can scry on our keep.
Laura: Can't Allura send a message to them and let them know what our plan is, and then we don't have to actually bamf there?
Sam: We don't have a plan!
Taliesin: Wherever we go, we can let everyone know what the plan and where we're going is.
Laura: I feel like what we need to do-- okay, here's what I think our plan should be.
Sam: Lead us, O Mighty Vex.
Laura: I feel like we should tell the armies gathering to prepare to attack. We enter in where the Clasp is; we come in from the bottom up.
Sam: So they're going to create a diversion for us?
Laura: Exactly. They take on the armies while we head straight to Thordak.
Liam: Dad creates a shit-storm at the wall, and we take advantage of that chaos.
Sam: We have to communicate this to them.
Taliesin: Easy to do. We just send a message.
Laura: We could send a message, or we could bamf there and then bamf another place. It seems a lot of time wasted.
Taliesin: Yeah, easier just to send a message.
Matt: Allura has been in communication and has been the information hub between most of these individuals.
Liam: How long did we say before Syldor reaches Emon?
Matt: By about dusk the following day.
Liam: Dusk the following day. And you said afternoon right now? So a little more than 24 hours.
Taliesin: We can at least get into there and start communicating with the Clasp.
Marisha: We're not really in good standing with them.
Taliesin: I'm sure they'll be happy to see us, regardless.
Marisha: You think? I guess. Sure. It's like seeing that person you hated in high school after something terrible just happened. Happy for the familiarity.
Sam: But now they're a little bit overweight and they work in an Applebee's.
Marisha: Sure, and it's a little gratifying?
Sam: Yeah.
Liam: They can hate us, and we can deal with that afterward, if there is even an afterward.
Taliesin: They're businessmen; I doubt they hold grudges.
Laura: I'm sure they hold grudges.
Taliesin: Not until after the dragon's been taken care of.
Laura: Then they'll make us pay?
Taliesin: Yes. It's not profitable to kill us before the dragon is dead.
Liam: Also, somewhere in all this fracas, we need you to take care of us with food.
Taliesin: When it's time.
Liam: Right, when is the time?
Taliesin: I think once we're there.
Marisha: It lasts for 24 hours.
Laura: Before we head in.
Liam: In the keep, for old time's sake?
Laura: I don't think that's very smart.
Taliesin: Or in the sewers, for old time's sake. (laughter)
Liam: I mean underneath.
Taliesin: Hopefully, in the keep.
Sam: So we have a clear plan, then?
Taliesin: We have a plan for dinner.
Liam: There's no guarantees, Scanlan.
Sam: Where are we going? That's all I care about right now.
Liam: We're going to hell. Where do you think we're going? It's going to be fucking awful. You're probably going to be dead in 48 hours.
Sam: Yeah, but we'll be together, and I don't think that I'll die.
Liam: You're adorable.
Taliesin: You're going to be in front, if anything.
Marisha: This is the worst of two extremes.
Taliesin: You should scry on Greyskull.
Marisha: Is anyone still there?
Sam: Last time I looked in, there was some movement, or it looked like people had recently been there.
Marisha: Wasn't it Drexel? Dranzel?
Sam: Nope, they're off somewhere else.
Laura: You said by sunset tomorrow is when they'll be at Emon?
Matt: That's when they'll be there and ready.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: If you want more information, you might have to talk to somebody who has that information.
Laura: Right. What we need to do is plan a time that they start the attack.
Sam: Sure. We've got to get there first and suss it out, too. We haven't done any recon. This army of your father's, we have no idea how big it is, if they have archers, if they have an elite SWAT team task force--
Taliesin: How do you feel that will affect our plan?
Sam: If we know we have an elite SWAT team task force, we can take them down with us into the sewers!
Taliesin: I can almost promise you they do not have an elite SWAT team task force.
Laura: They might have some stealthy--
Taliesin: Some stealthy individuals.
Marisha: We have friends of our own.
Sam: Also, if we do any recon, we might know that oh, there's a big thing we need to have taken out before we can even get in. What if our keep is being surrounded?
Marisha: Okay. Hang on. Let me scry on the keep. This will answer plenty of questions, and then we'll go from there.
Laura: Scry away, Keyleth.
Marisha: Did we leave Laina there? Did we leave anyone there, or is it completely vacated?
Liam: It was chaos when we left.
Matt: Yeah, it was absolute chaos. You pushed your servants through. Your staff still currently exists somewhere in Whitestone.
Marisha: I can't scry on a building, correct?
Matt: Correct.
Liam: We fought Vorugal and then high-tailed it out of there; inside and gone.
Marisha: I can't scry on a building.
Taliesin: Can you scry on a plant?
Sam: Can you scry on a dead thing?
Marisha: Can I scry on a plant?
Taliesin: There is a tree.
Matt: Because you are a druid, being a nature-based entity and it is a living creature... (laughter)
Matt: Don't steal my thunder!
Marisha: One that I've had personal communications with.
Matt: I would say, due to the fact that you are a druid and nature is your basis, if it is a specific plant-based entity that you are very familiar with, sure.
Sam: Do we have anything like that at our keep?
Matt: You have a number of trees in the front; you have the garden that you built in Sarenrae's temple.
Marisha: That's what I want to scry on. I want to start there.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: You know how it's always, "you zoom in really fast, and you zoom in really fast--" Can I slow down?
Matt: It doesn't work that way.
Marisha: I can't pull focus?
Matt: In theory, scrying is only supposed to show you what's there. I narratively let a little bit of a journey happen. You can't control the journey, sorry.
Sam: DVR it.
Marisha: It's the worst. Okay.
Matt: All right, so where are you doing the spell?
Marisha: Where?
Matt: Where are you doing your Scry ritual?
Marisha: Not near the ziggurat, if we're still there.
Matt: Right, so are you guys heading back to the castle, then?
Laura: Yeah, let's go to the castle.
Matt: While you guys are heading back to the castle from underneath the tunnels, you are briefly headed off by a familiar dwarven fellow in robes and a crystalline staff: Elementalist Drake Thunderbrand. "By the way, before you leave, we've been working on a few things for you. They should be of assistance to you. Come find me in the common room whenever you're ready."
Sam: Yeah, sure. Wow, fortuitous.
Marisha: I like presents.
Matt: You head to your quarters to do the Scry spell? Okay. Your vision clarifies on dark clouds. Your vision sees a gathering of grayish mists, and you slowly transition through them to see shapes that are either extremely small or extremely distant. Your vision begins to funnel through it quickly, like you're passing over the edge of a waterfall. There's a rush, and you see, as the clouds dissipate, a glimpse of the overhead of Emon. You see the once-gleaming city of white across the Bladeshimmer Shoreline pockmarked with black and tall towers of curling black smoke. You see flames that still burn unfettered, unstopped throughout the town, and what looks from the distance like small clouds of gnats or flies that you realize are much larger flying entities doing small passes over various neighborhoods to keep watch or find food. Your vision jumps again, this time careening down even faster. Below, you can see, from an overhead view, Greyskull Keep. You begin to rush in that direction, and as it gets closer, you can see the same damage it took from the wall from the initial attack of the Conclave. You see elements of rubble around the outside, though it's still pristine, being repaired by the celestial entity that was summoned by Pike shortly after. Your vision jumps again, this time through the repaired stained-glass exterior of the temple of Sarenrae, and it comes to rest there in a moment, amongst the strangely contrasting, peaceful greenery of this temple. There's such a sense of hopelessness and horror on the outside of the city, this one little moment of time here is almost like a time capsule of how things were before. It's sad, but hopeful at the same time. As your vision swivels over to the tree, there in the temple, while contained here for as long as it's been, it seems to be healthy. Looking in the vicinity, most everything seems in place.
Marisha: Do the trees look overgrown? Do the plants look overgrown?
Matt: As much as being away for the handful of months that you have been. They look like they haven't been trimmed or tended to recently.
Marisha: And the temple is intact? It looks like the keep is still intact from where we rebuilt it?
Matt: Correct. It has not fallen.
Marisha: Do I sense any movement?
Matt: Make a perception check with disadvantage through your Scry spell.
Taliesin: No, I can't help. Yeah, no.
Marisha: I rolled two ones. Both ones. I'll say that's just flushing it out.
Matt: Strangely, somehow through a Scry spell, something got in your eye in the temple.
Marisha: I hate it when the VR goggles short out. (laughter)
Matt: You don't know if it's divine energy interference or what, but it stings a lot, and you feel the essence of the spell begin to shiver and quake, and as you try and clear your vision through, it remains blurred.
Marisha: Shit.
Matt: You're still there; your presence is there, but you don't have the capability of seeing anything beyond the tree you're focused on. The Scry spell is focused on the tree, and everything around it has this hazy fog-of-war feel about five feet beyond it.
Sam: Good scry.
Marisha: Good scry, guys. Good scry.
Laura: What did you see? Anything good? Are we safe?
Marisha: It's still standing, for the most part. I saw Pike's-- wait, her celestial being wasn't still there.
Matt: No, it was temporarily summoned for the reconstruction of the ceiling portion.
Marisha: Looks okay. Looks like home.
Liam: Still standing? There wasn't anybody around it?
Marisha: I couldn't tell.
Sam: How's my comic book collection? Is it still there?
Marisha: Burned.
Taliesin: Mint in box.
Liam: That's as close to a guarantee as we're going to get.
Marisha: I told you to get a fire box.
Laura: Do you think Drake would join us?
Sam: Who? Little guy? I'd like to be the shortest on this trip, please.
Laura: Got it.
Liam: You are.
Sam: Oh.
Marisha: Where's Kash?
Laura: And Zahra?
Marisha: Kash was really mad at us last time we talked to him.
Laura: So maybe we shouldn't ask him.
Taliesin: Let's not.
Marisha: I talked to him last time.
Laura: I don't even want Kash to come. I don't even want him around.
Sam: When we walk near his residence, let's walk around.
Liam: That guy is a badass motherfucker, and we do want him.
Sam: I know why you want him to come.
Liam: Well, he's got those brown eyes.
Laura: No, he's got one brown eye and one blue eye, I think.
Taliesin: We are this loopy because we're genuinely terrified, and we're doing everything we can not to go.
Liam: It's called gallows humor.
Laura: I'm going to go ask Zahra if she'll join us. Can I go talk to Zahra?
Matt: Sure.
Liam: I'll go find Shaun, after her.
Marisha: You guys are forcing me into going and talking to Kash, aren't you?
Laura: Scanlan can ask him. It doesn't have to be you.
Marisha: Scanlan?
Sam: Would you prefer me to go? We do have a rapport.
Laura: I do want to ask Jarett to come too, though.
Sam: Oh, I need to go see Jarett. (laughter)
Sam: You're on Kash duty, Kiki.
Liam: Scanlan, do you need a little resolve for this fight?
Sam: I just want to see Jarett. He's our most solid ally, and most dependable friend.
Liam: There's no other reason?
Sam: He's been there for us in our time of need.
Liam: Still no other reason?
Sam: I feel like it would be a big pick-me-up to see him. (laughter)
Liam: Solid. You do that.
Taliesin: I'm going to talk to Cassandra about one last dip into the vaults to see if there's any potions. We know we have to leave them with something in case everything goes wrong, but anything we can take with us will be helpful, and then I have to fix this giant mess of parts that are currently in my bag. I may need to spend a little money. I do apologize.
Laura: Darling.
Taliesin: Okay, just letting you know. It might be a bit expensive to get everything working again.
Liam: Percy, spend it all.
Taliesin: I will not spend it all. I promise.
Laura: I gave an entire bag of jewels to a random efreet.
Taliesin: That was brazen, yes.
Marisha: We got armor out of it, though. It's not like we didn't get something from it.
Taliesin: If anyone asks about the plan, the plan is chaos, if everyone agrees with this. We want to break up their forces as much as possible. We want them sending ten percent of their forces to every edge of the city. They know where we're going; they know we're eventually heading to the center, and he's not going to leave anymore, but we're going to make it very difficult for them. They're either going to be fighting us in every corner, or they're going to be letting the entire city fall back to us.
Laura: I'm going to go find Zahra.
Sam: Splitting the party five ways.
Marisha: I go find Kash.
Matt: Okay. Vex, as you progress up to the secondary floor to the outside of Zahra's room, the door is closed.
Laura: Zahra, dear?
Matt: Zahra, you hear a knock at your door.
Mary: Hello? (laughter)
Mary: What is it, darling? I'm trying to sleep.
Laura: Oh!
Sam: This is where the live studio audience is supposed to applaud. (laughter)
Marisha: You had one job, pit crew.
Taliesin: You had five jobs--
Matt: You had 12 jobs, pit crew.
Mary: Anything in my eyes?
Laura: Not much time to sleep, I'm afraid.
Mary: Unfortunately, I've been buried in books.
Laura: Yes, and plans are moving ahead much faster than we anticipated.
Mary: First off, I heard word about a white dragon. Sister killer! (laughter)
Mary: Yes, we have to go get tattoos. Tell me, what's the news? Catch me up.
Laura: We're marching on Emon tomorrow.
Mary: Oh! I was going to get my hair done. All right.
Laura: That's how it is. All the way.
Mary: I haven't heard much. I've been reading, I've been decorating, and I've been enchanting and making things. Tell me, what's the news with Thordak?
Laura: Well, he's terrible. He's even worse than we thought. Armies are marching on the city, and we plan on coming in from underneath, maybe striking at him where he doesn't realize. And we'd like your help, if you're willing.
Mary: I don't think so. Oh, all right. Yes, I'd love to. I would love to. I've been craving dragon meat since Rimefang, so yes.
Laura: I don't know if we'll succeed, and I'm sure we won't all make it out alive. It's a big ask.
Mary: (sighs) Isn't death supposed to be a wonderful adventure, as well?
Laura: I think so.
Mary: Fuck it.
Laura: Fuck it.
Mary: Fuck it. Durr 'n' durr. Fuck it. Let's do it. Yeah, all right. I've been sitting for too long; I need some action.
Laura: Did you make any dragon arrows?
Marisha: Buy her a drink first.
Mary: I'll get back to you on it.
Laura: I plan on it. So many drinks.
Mary: What next? What do we do?
Laura: We prepare tonight, and we leave tomorrow, I assume. You know us; we don't have a plan, really. I have no idea what's going on. Be prepared.
Mary: Isn't that the secret to adulthood, that we're all winging it? Yes, all right. Good.
Laura: I'm glad you're joining.
Mary: Darling, I'm with you wherever you go.
Matt: With your recently joined into your crusade tiefling ally, you go to gather the rest of your party. Who's going to Kashaw? (laughter)
Taliesin: Kiki, what are you doing?
Matt: You take a long, slow, careful walk down through town to the guard barracks.
Marisha: I try not to step on any cracks in the sidewalk on the way. It's very important.
Matt: It's a warmer and more humid day than you're used to in Whitestone. A couple of insects are out and about. There's a lot of aspects of Whitestone that you're noticing for the first time, because you really want to focus on anything else, and yet suddenly, without warning, you stop and realize you're standing right outside of the barracks. You see that recently there had been a finished training session with the up-and-coming guard, and there, sitting off to the side, partially armored and currently sharpening the edge of his spear, is Kashaw.
Marisha: He's on the outside? Oh shit.
Matt: And he's watching you. (laughter)
Matt: Kashaw?
Sam: Ladies and gentlemen. (cheering and applause)
Marisha: I drop to one knee and start tying my boot. I start retying my shoe.
Will: You're five feet from me. Am I not supposed to see that?
Marisha: Oh my god! Kash! Whoa, I didn't see you there.
Will: Really? Interesting. It was the looking at me that threw me.
Marisha: Sorry, I've had something in my eye ever since this scrying spell earlier. Shit's been blurry. Yeah, no. You're clearly in focus now.
Will: Okay.
Marisha: Hi. Hey, how's it going, man?
Will: Everything's been great. Life's been awesome. What can I help you with? (laughter)
Marisha: Okay, Kash, I'm sensing a little bit of underlying aggression.
Will: Really? It's underlying? (laughter)
Marisha: Okay, look. I know we fucked you. Look.
Will: Why don't you send me out to get some milk and go save the world while I'm out there doing that? What's up there, lady? What? What do you want? Speak!
Marisha: (stammers) I'm trying to think of what to say. Please help us! We're going to die, and we need you. I'm sorry!
Will: I've got nothing to that. Help you what, first of all.
Marisha: Okay, you know how we've been hunting down those dragons?
Will: I vaguely remember it, yes.
Marisha: We've been doing an okay job, because we've killed a few, but now there's the big one that's left, Thordak, and then we might be working with the one that killed all my people, if you remember that there was one that killed them, so now we're working with her, and we're gathering an entire army, and we need as many talented and charming and gifted people that we can get, so I thought-- I'm really sorry we made you be an errand boy. I didn't vote for that, by the way. I was trying to--
Will: Keep babbling. This is fun.
Laura: I'm sweating for her. (laughter)
Sam: This is just how the Patrick Rothfuss conversation went.
Mary: This is how it's going to go with you and Jarett.
Will: Why should I help you? Give me one reason.
Marisha: Why did you bring back Vex?
Will: Because I thought Vax would kill me if I didn't.
Marisha: Maybe Vax will kill you if you don't help us.
Will: Now I'm not really that scared of him.
Marisha: That's not true. You did it because you're a good person. You ultimately want to see change in the world. I know you do. And I know you care, even though you pretend like you don't. So that's why.
Will: In all fairness, dragons bring change.
Marisha: Kash, that's not the type of change-- there are better ways to bring change than through death and destruction.
Will: Who else is helping you?
Marisha: Everyone, and then Zahra.
Will: Z? I'm in. Where is she?
Marisha: Wow.
Will: Let's go. Where is she?
Marisha: Should have led with that. All right, let's go. This way. Glad I spilled my soul and everything, and I just splashed coffee in my face. Come on, Kash. Come on!
Will: On my way. Let's go.
Matt: All right, as you gather your implements of war and your supplies you may need for this journey, you two head back to the castle, a nice, solid six feet between you as you walk.
Will: I'm hitting the wall constantly over here.
Laura: I can't scooch any more!
Liam: You don't have any guests over there.
Mary: We got it!
Will: You comfortable over there?
Mary: You got enough room, Sam?
Taliesin: We're working on getting a bigger cup.
Mary: There's no swiveling.
Sam: I'm going to give a seat just to my cup, because we have the space here to do it.
Laura: We're turning into one person.
Mary: The twinsies will finally be conjoined.
Laura: Sorry.
Matt: Scanlan, you are off looking for Jarett. Go ahead and make an investigation check.
Sam: 18. 28.
Matt: 28. All right. You know exactly the type of people that he talks to. Because he's been put in this position of power within the guard hierarchy here in Whitestone, within the Pale Guard, there's really only three people that he hangs with. One of them's Kashaw. One of them's a guy who you never remember the name of, who's fun. That's the guy you're going to go bother. You go and talk to him for a bit, and he points to one of the few currently functioning, non-destroyed taverns in Whitestone. There you find him sitting there drinking alone; not heavy drinking, in his cups, but staring off at the wall and sipping a midday ale.
Sam: Friend Jarett.
Matt: "Ah. It is good to see you alive and-- right. Hi."
Sam: Just coming to check on my main man J-money. It's J, right?
Matt: "It is, yes. Otherwise, it would be Garett."
Sam: You're right.
Matt: "I'm good. I'm a little nervous, to be honest. I like to shoot things from a wall. I don't like to go through a wall to shoot things, and that's been happening a lot recently, and from what I've been hearing, tomorrow is looking to be a very big day."
Sam: Well, it's going to be quite a fight. Can we count on you to come with us, perhaps?
Matt: "I'd assume that would be the case. I would not want to have all of you disappear into darkness and fire without me yelling behind you, 'don't die!' I figure that's the very least I could offer for this circumstance."
Sam: We would be honored to have you with us, and as you are still technically our employee, there'll be a bonus for you at the end of it.
Matt: "Another bonus?"
Sam: Oh. Yes. I wasn't aware there was a-- yes. Two bonuses.
Matt: "Oh yeah, there was like four bonuses."
Sam: You deserve all of them.
Matt: "Damn right."
Sam: The other thing that we had talked about, did that ever come to fruition?
Matt: "No, it was unfortunate. You see, my sister is engaged recently--" And he stands up and walks out of the tavern, putting a coin down on the front of the bar. "No worries. I'll find you another lady." And he walks outside.
Sam: Oh. Oh, we're speaking in code. Okay. Yes, I need a lady so bad, and you were going to find me a date.
Matt: "You're so much better at this when other people are involved. Why are you so bad when it's me?" (laughter)
Matt: He goes outside and guides you into a shaded portion of a nearby alley and leans against the wall, waiting for you to follow in.
Sam: So. Is she a brunette?
Matt: "We're out of the tavern."
Sam: Okay. I don't know how long to keep the cover going.
Matt: "It's fine. Look, it is very difficult to find anything right now, the way things have been. But I did manage to scavenge a little bit of suude."
Sam: Suude?
Matt: "Yes." And he pulls out a small brown pouch, maybe about the size of a d20, really. Like a little nugget there, and it's tied tightly, and he pockets real fast. "Now, don't ask me again to do this."
Sam: Wait, are you a cop? You have to tell me if you're a cop. Are you a cop?
Matt: "No."
Sam: Okay, good.
Taliesin: That's a myth, for the kids at home, by the way. Just want to get that out there. Sorry. Can't fill their heads with bad ideas. Carry on.
Will: Kids arrested all over town tonight.
Taliesin: Are you a cop? No?
Sam: All right. How much do I owe you for this?
Matt: "No, don't worry about it. Simply the bonus. Whatever you feel you owe me for it. But not again, please. It's harrowing."
Liam: Heroin?
Matt: "Harrowing. It was harrowing to acquire this for you."
Sam: Jarett, thank you for this. Thank you very much. And I'm cool and all, but do you put it up your butt, or snort it, or do you burn it somehow, or wrap it in something, or eat it? I'm pretty cool, but-- (laughter)
Offscreen: Ha! (laughter)
Screen: Ha! (laughter)
Matt: He leans in really close, one eye half-squinted, going, "I will never understand you, Scanlan Shorthalt. You're a smart boy. How do you think you use it?"
Sam: In a pipe of some sort?
Matt: "Sure." And he walks out of the alleyway, really embarrassed that he even did this. The minute you said that, he was like, oh no, I just bought beer for a 12-year-old. He's like, ooh.
Taliesin: I'd like to think that "ha!" was passing that guy coming out of the pub, and getting a second--
Sam: All right, when you get her number, call me or whatever, so we'll meet her later.
Matt: He walks away and puts his hand up with a-- and keeps walking. You can almost see the hanging head shake as he continues back towards where he was in the tavern.
Sam: That went well.
Taliesin: That went very well.
Sam: I got that.
Taliesin: You did that.
Sam: I did it.
Matt: (laughs) Mark down one small pocket satchel of suude. S-U-U-D-E.
Liam: That's for after the dragon.
Laura: It's his own drugs. He's made his own drugs up.
Taliesin: Here you go. Right there.
Mary: He made drugs?
Laura: Well, Matt made drugs.
Taliesin: Put a glove on if you're going to get high if you hold it for too long.
Matt: There is a society out there. People are going to continue to find ways to smoke, swallow, or inhale substances.
Will: Definitely not a cop.
Matt: Definitely not.
Will: Definitely not a cop.
Mary: Sometimes you ride the dragon before you kill it.
Will: (laughs) Exactly.
Taliesin: Got to ride the dragon before you ride the dragon.
Marisha: That's right.
Mary: You've got to ride the dragon before you kill it.
Will: That's right.
Mary: It's going to be great to watch Scanlan take drugs. (laughter)
Matt: How do you think herbalists of previous generations found out which plants are poisonous? Huh? That's bad. (laughter)
Matt: It's culture, man. All right, Percy, we need to make some checks for you.
Taliesin: Actually, do I have to check even if I'm spending money?
Matt: You're spending money to fix it, but--
Laura: How much money are you spending?
Taliesin: How much do we have? Sorry, I'll stop.
Laura: You tell me what you need.
Taliesin: We'll find out.
Marisha: You're the prince of Whitestone. Can't you tap some taxes or something?
Matt: You could, actually.
Taliesin: I really try not to do that. That's a dick move. People are already iffy on these things, I imagine.
Liam: Spend everything right now.
Taliesin: Wow! That made five decisions and landed on a really good one. That's 28.
Matt: Okay, yeah. This is for Bad News?
Taliesin: Yeah, Bad News is the only one that is broken. The rest survived.
Matt: Yeah, that's fine. For Bad News, the original cost I have here... sorry, have to pull up the PDF to remind me, so I get it right.
Liam: Two electrum.
Matt: (laughs) I'd put it about at maybe 500 gold worth of materials.
Taliesin: Oh! Okay. Feel better about that.
Matt: It's not a magical implement, but it is expensive.
Taliesin: It is. It's got a lot of moving parts. And then I'm going to go and talk to Cassandra, quickly.
Matt: All right. As you make your way to try and find Cassandra, she is actually currently in her room talking with Allura. Talking with Gilmore, with Brom and Drake. There's guards rushing in and out. There's a general sense of ramping energy, as everyone is gathering everything they have at their disposal in preparation for what's going to happen tomorrow.
Mary: Where's Raishan?
Matt: (laughs) You can go look for Raishan, if you like.
Mary: No, I just wanted to know.
Matt: You don't know where Raishan is right now. As you enter the room, over in the corner, mid-conversation, Cassandra is currently rolling up some papers and handing them to a guard. Turns and finishes a quick bit of conversation whispering off to the side with Drake. Turns around and her eyes meet you and she goes, "Brother."
Taliesin: My lady.
Matt: "Yes. What can I do to help you?"
Taliesin: We're preparing to leave. We are preparing to have a small strike force go underneath the city and do what we can while the other armies hopefully distract, thin the forces and give us a shot at taking care of this once and for all.
Matt: "Right."
Taliesin: Is there anything left in the vaults, potion-wise? Especially healing potions. We don't want to drain you, obviously, but I thought I would make one last push.
Matt: "We've provided what we can. Drake, and a few of our helpful supporters here in the city have been providing for this purpose. It's not much, but we do have--" and she snaps her fingers and points to Drake. You see he's currently putting together a big leather package. "Oh! No worry." And he lifts it up on the table. You hear the clanking of glass around on the inside of the satchel. He pulls it down a little bit over the front, pushes to the side and you can see there are two cushioned racks that contain various sizes of vials. "All right, we've got three greater healing potions, one basic healing potion. That's as much as we can find, to be honest right now. There hasn't been a lot of trade, and our supply's been limited, and most of what we had has been used by you or folks here in defense of the city."
Laura: You said one basic?
Matt: "One basic. Yeah, regular healing potion. However, I've spent my time, knowing what's coming, and being a focuser of the elemental arts, brewing a few helpful bits here. I wish I had more time, but our timeline has been a bit accelerated." He pulls out the second cushioned grouping here. The vials are different shapes. It seems like the glass has been scavenged from what was available, but the coloration is similar, and you recognize these. You've had these before. These are four potions of fire resistance.
Sam: That's huge.
Laura: That's great.
Marisha: That's massive.
Taliesin: We will be grateful for you till the end of our days.
Matt: "Oh, I count on it."
Taliesin: It may only be a day, but you will have it. (laughter)
Matt: "Just remembered for these in particular, they don't last a terribly long time. One hour. Make sure you don't drink it too soon."
Taliesin: One hour will be all that is necessary.
Matt: "I certainly hope so. So. That's what I am able to provide for this. I'll be there helping with some of the distraction, so we'll figure out some of the details for the specific attack, but we're pulling all that we can for this, and we'll figure out who's going where, who's attacking when and in what way, I guess, if not tonight, tomorrow." And he looks over to Cassandra and nods. "I'm going to go pray." He leaves the room.
Laura: Can I ask a question?
Matt: Yes.
Laura: With potions, do they stack? Can you take multiple ones and get multiple benefits, or is it like you take one potion and that's the one potion you get to take?
Matt: I mean, if they're different types of potions, I'd say they could stack, to a certain degree. If you just begin to chug four potions in a row I might be asking for some constitution saving throws.
Taliesin: Or like a mixed drink, that can get weird, right?
Matt: Yeah. Things might not--
Mary: Long island ice tea of death.
Matt: Yeah, exactly. Some effects might not mingle well or the urge from your body might reject that much ingestion of enchanted fluid.
Laura: Okay. Cool. Just checking.
Marisha: Don't mix your darks with your clears-- Pick one.
Matt: Don't eat the giant toenail at the bottom of the bottle.
Taliesin: Water breathing before fire, never been higher. (laughter)
Taliesin: Exactly. I think that was the-- Yeah.
Sam: True.
Matt: Anything else?
Taliesin: I'd like to just grab Cassandra really quickly and take her aside.
Matt: Okay. "Yes, brother?"
Taliesin: I will only take one moment of your time. I've not had a moment to repay you for my part in all of this yet, and if we survive, I owe you much. And if I don't, seal off the city. There is room underneath. Prepare for siege. Prepare to be a safe haven. Do not be-- do what you can to save the city. Do not get involved in the aftermath of this if we fail.
Matt: "That's actually what I'm discussing with Allura, and the reason she's staying back is to help us continue should such an occasion arise. But I am confident, knowing what you're capable of, that we worry for naught. We're doing our best here, and I know you are doing your best there. Just come back to me."
Taliesin: I will do my best. We've-- for centuries, you must know we have survived as realists. And it is very hot down there and I do not like it. Good luck, see you soon.
Matt: "I need you. Return."
Taliesin: I shall. And I go pack.
Matt: Okay. As you leave, Vax crosses you in the doorway, as Gilmore is in mid-conversation. Right now with-- well, it was with Drake and then when he'd had the conversation, he watched and Drake left and so he was on his way out following Percival. And you caught him.
Liam: Can I steal you for a second?
Matt: "Certainly."
Liam: Over here.
Matt: "All right."
Liam: Hi, again.
Matt: "Hi."
Liam: Remember how we just saw each other a couple of days ago, and I tried to say goodbye, and you told me to promise you that I would see you again?
Matt: "Yes. And much to my delight, you've kept your promise. And you better keep keeping it."
Liam: You know what would help with that? Boy, have I got an offer for you. You want to help us save the world? My family and I, we're going to him. And I wasn't sure the path that would take us there. I thought we might be on our own. But we're back here. And you are easily the most impressive arcane user I've ever met in my life. And I want us all to still be breathing in a week. I can't think of anyone better to stand with us than you, Shaun.
Matt: His eyes look off for a minute. And he reaches up and rubs the back of his neck, and you can see there's still a scar there. He goes, "If I'm to be honest, I've felt a bit useless here in Whitestone for quite some time. I was there when this all began. It destroyed not just the thing I've been working to build for so long of my life, but friends, home, for all of us. So it is my just honor, and vengeful glee, to join you on the siege to Emon, if you will have me?"
Liam: I grasp him by the back of the head. Gesundheit. I'm so glad to have you with us, friend. So glad.
Matt: "Just stay alive. Keep that promise."
Liam: It will be a little bit easier now.
Matt: "Good." And he smacks you on the cheek.
Liam: Good time for a musical quote.
All: (singing) Stay alive.
Matt: He smacks you on the cheek and goes, "Learned that from you. All right then, I guess I've got to gather my supplies and-- Oh, it's been a while since I've seen some-- I've never actually seen combat on this scale before when, you know, I wasn't just trying to run away? So let's see if I can knock off the old dust."
Liam: I'm sure it will be glorious.
Matt: "Oh, I can guarantee it."
Marisha: Plug.
Matt: "All right."
Liam: Let's do it.
Laura: I'm wondering if we should eat a Heroes' Feast tonight, and then just eat one again tomorrow? 'Cause we just don't know what's going to happen during the day anymore. Just a Heroes' Feast every night. Be ready, and just, you know.
Sam: Yep. Do we have the money for that?
Laura: It's, yeah. We're fine.
Sam: All right.
Taliesin: I was looking forward to a Heroes' Brunch, personally.
Laura: Either one.
Sam: Bagels and lox?
Matt: Heroes' High Tea.
Mary: Eggs Benedict with lots of extra hollandaise.
Taliesin: Capers of might.
Matt: What else do you guys wish to prepare, if anything?
Liam: Holy shit, man!
Laura: We have our potions. Should we split them up?
Sam: Who needs fire giant, I mean fire resistance, the most?
Laura: Okay. We have five potions of fire resistance.
Sam: We do?
Laura: Yes, because we already had one. Now, we have two superior, five regular healing, and three greater. What we also have is a potion of invulnerability, which is clutch, and a potion of speed. We need to decide who to give the potion of invulnerability to, because it lasts for ten minutes?
Matt: No, one minute. I'm pretty sure, I'll check, but that's a powerful-ass potion.
Laura: You can't die, right, when you take it?
Matt: You wish!
Laura: I mean, can you take damage when you've got it going? It's like a minute of no damage?
Matt: You take damage, you have resistance to all damage, so all damage you take is halved.
Mary: Should that be decided mid-battle? Clutch.
Sam: That one seems like a specific task.
Laura: That's a specific task kind of thing. So we'll decide that later?
Taliesin: There is an item. And I'm currently holding it, and I don't know if I'm the best person to be holding this. But I'm just going to pass this down the line to see if anyone has an opinion.
Marisha: It's the sword.
Liam: This is too bad, I can't wield this fucker.
Laura: I can't wield a sword either.
Taliesin: It's a dex-based sword, correct?
Matt: The Sword of Dragon-Slaying?
Taliesin: Yeah. Or it can switch.
Matt: I'm allowing it to switch if need be.
Taliesin: So it can be strength- or dex-based. Maybe this is the thing to hand to Grog. And one minute of invulnerability with that is possibly the cruellest thing that dragon will have ever experienced.
Laura: The thing is, if he's raging, I don't know if he'll think to switch over.
Taliesin: Well, it's an attuned weapon.
Matt: He isn't resistant to fire while he's raging.
Marisha: No, but he has resistance to physical damage, and if he takes a potion of fire resistance, is he pretty much covered the same way if he's raging and has a fire potion?
Matt: Possibly.
Liam: I could use this because it's dex-based, if I so choose?
Laura: But you can't do three attacks with it, because it's bigger?
Matt: Well, yeah. You would have one attack with that.
Liam: One attack, but not-- I can't do longsword and then a dagger?
Matt: You could do longsword and then a bonus.
Laura: That's pretty cool.
Matt: Let me check, I don't know if he can do them all.
Laura: Could he do Whisper and then attack with the dragon sword?
Taliesin: I don't know how many items you have attuned at the moment?
Will: Just two, I believe.
Taliesin: So you could go for a triple?
Will: I could. Well, I have my shadow spear. But my nec, so you'd want the nec damage from that, is what you'd be looking for. I don't know if I could wield the two of them together?
Taliesin: It's a one-handed sword, so I'm not sure. What is your--
Matt: It has to be a light melee weapon in both hands, it looks to do this, unless you have a feat to fix that.
Taliesin: Which I do.
Matt: You have the-- Do you have Dual Wielder as a feat?
Liam: Yes.
Matt: Yeah, so yes, you can use the longsword and Whisper in the other hand.
Liam: But it's attunement, so I have to choose something.
Matt: You'd have to chose that over--
Liam: This would supersede Whisper. Yeah.
Laura: What? Whisper is a Vestige.
Liam: I understand that, but this is very strong, and with wings I could go anywhere.
Matt: Do note. As part of the rogue ability-- I'm just double-checking here, but I'm pretty sure-- The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon. Technically I'm allowing-- Actually, no, I'm allowing it to be a finesse.
Liam: You're allowing it? You're allowing it?
Matt: Well, because it's strength or dex. I'm sticking to my choice.
Liam: Okay. So it's light.
Matt: It's not light. It's finesse. Meaning you can choose strength or dexterity.
Mary: I have a question. Last time I saw you, you were looking for the Vestiges.
Laura: Yes.
Mary: Did you find them?
Laura: All of them! All of them! Well, all of them that we know about.
Mary: Do you know what to do with them?
Sam: They are all super powerful, and are awesome, and you'll see them in battle tomorrow.
Laura: That's all we know, is that you fight with them. That's all we know. Why, do you know more?
Mary: Is there any information we can glean from Osysa at all, in Vasselheim, of how to use them?
Laura: Well, it would mean traveling to Vasselheim.
Mary: That's true. Is there any way to get there, just quick and bamf in and just--
Taliesin: Last time we went somewhere quick and bamfed in--
Mary: It was a long time?
Taliesin: Things went poorly. But we could speak to her. We could talk to her.
Laura: One of us could go and bamf back. And be back tomorrow morning.
Will: Well, you said you used them.
Marisha: Yeah, we've been using them
Will: So then you know what they do, for the most part, right?
All: Yeah.
Will: Why waste a trip?
Mary: What if there's a way to combine them?
Marisha: We tried. We put them all in a pile... (laughter)
Will: That didn't work? Piling them on top of each other didn't work?
Sam: They didn't become a robot.
Laura: Not as much as we hoped it would, no.
Marisha: Yeah. There are other Vestiges, too, that are out there.
Liam: You have a potion of haste, yeah?
Laura: Yeah, potion of speed.
Liam: What if you gave me that and I gave you my boots?
Sam: Real quick, who needs the fire protection?
Mary: I don't; I'm resistant.
Marisha: If we have plenty of potions, I'll take it so I don't have to use a concentration spell.
Taliesin: Ditto. My plan is to stay away from the fire, but if I can't, that would certainly help.
Will: My plate is partially fire resistant.
Sam: Vex? You don't need it.
Laura: Fire resistance?
Sam: Didn't I give you that? Oh, I gave you cold resistance.
Laura: Yeah. I need fire resistance.
Sam: What did you give me?
Mary: Chlamydia.
Sam: Acid resistance.
Laura: Oh, yeah, that's right.
Mary: Sorry. I was just in Australia. I got it from a koala. I'm kidding.
Laura: I could take off my bracers--
Liam: It's up to you. I don't want to--
Marisha: There's also the discussion--
Sam: What. More discussions?
Liam: You take the boots, I'm on the potion. I have Whisper and this sword.
Marisha: Are we going to try and lure Thordak out of his lair as a challenger?
Sam: No, we're going to sneak into his lair, right?
Will: You're going to corner it.
Taliesin: He's not going to leave his lair anymore; he knows we're coming
Mary: So, just very briefly, what is the plan?
Sam: The plan, as I understated it, is  we send a vicious army to attack at the gates, all over the place, drawing out Thordak's forces in an epic battle. Blood, sinew, and gore everywhere, while we slip under the city, unbeknownst to Thordak, in the tunnels with the Clasp leading us. Leading us right to the center of town where we pop up, and surprise Thordak! He didn't know we were coming! He thought that there was an army at the gates! And we stab him real quick and leave.
Laura: Done. And we also find whatever it is he's protecting and kill that too.
Sam: And at some point Raishan comes and helps us.
Laura: Hey! What's up?
Will: How you doing?
Laura: I'm really sorry. About all of that.
Will: No, it's no problem. It's great.
Mary: I have a question. Do I know about the machine? Have I been told about that? Did Raishan tell me about that?
Matt: Which one?
Mary: The machine that Thordak is building, or whatever the heck he's--
Matt: Thordak, as far as you know, has let nobody down there, Raishan included. And you have no idea what machinations Thordak is--
Mary: But I do know about it.
Matt: I mean, you know as much as they do. It's come up in conversation previously, yes.
Will: And you said we're going into the tunnels? Does anyone know the way through the tunnels?
Sam: The Clasp does. They're an order of rogues and thieves who hate us. But they're going to help us.
Mary: Do you trust them?
Sam: We totally trust them because they are scoundrels and liars. And we have no other choice.
Taliesin: It doesn't serve them to lie to us.
Mary: This sounds like a wonderful plan!
Will: It doesn't serve the scoundrels and liars to lie and be scoundrels?
Taliesin: It doesn't serve them in this moment, no. You know, if you're always a liar and a scoundrel, then no one will ever trust you to do anything, they're only conveniently liars and scoundrels.
Will: I love this plan, this is great.
Sam: (laughs) It's pretty air-tight.
Will: Yeah. I don't see any room for problems. So you want to go in and corner the dragon where he lives and is most powerful--
Sam: Yes, yes!
Will: His back to the wall, and no escape--
Sam: He can escape at any moment, he can fly.
Will: Just us, though? Not the entire army which we are using as a diversion?
Sam: Just a partial group. Yes!
Will: But the scoundrels are going to lead us to him?
Taliesin: Well, he has his own army.
Will: Of course.
Taliesin: So we need to keep his army distracted so we're not fighting a dragon and an army. So those armies will hopefully either distract the armies or; if he chooses not to send the armies to fight the rest of the armies that we've brought, all of our armies also converge on the dragon's nest and then we have everybody there.
Will: You're engaging all of your forces in one play? If he holds his forces back, why not send in skirmishes to see what happens first?
Laura: Oh, I like this plan. He's good.
Taliesin: No, we have people that we can do for that. Although, it's not just one army we have. We have groups of them, technically. I was just--
Will: Attacking in one place?
Taliesin: Oh, no. All around the city.
Will: Is there a weak point?
Sam: Our plan. (laughter)
Taliesin: Don't you laugh! No! No! You don't get to laugh. That scares us. Sadly, the only weak point is--
Liam: We either go with the shitty hand we've been given, or we lie down and let him steamroll over us.
Marisha: Yes, but we can also try and formulate at least a vague plan, so that we all don't die within a single--
Taliesin: I think this is a vague plan so that we don't all die.
Marisha: All right, okay. Let's build off of what Kash has.
Taliesin: If it's too specific, then it's going to go wrong too quickly--
Marisha: Hang on, hang on. He's right.
Mary: Plus we don't know what to expect. We have to be ready for anything.
Will: We feint the city. Send skirmishes in to feint the city so they don't know where the main attack is coming from. They'll have to defend every wall. What you then do-- what you want them doing, because they're defending the wall, they won't know when the serious attack is coming from. Then you send them towards one fortified position. That would draw everybody to the one fortified position, but that's also a feint. And you come in the backdoor. That's always the way you do it. Meanwhile, we'll take the scoundrels and liars. And hopefully they're going to take us to corner the giant thing that wants to kill all of us, in the place where he is the most powerful.
Laura: Yeah, that one!
Taliesin: I'm actually very okay with this plan.
Sam: We should have him with us always! (laughter)
Mary: I totally agree.
Laura: Do it! Let's do that, let's do that!
Will: Let's do that! Okay! Great plan! Oh my god! Who's in charge? Who's leading your ground forces?
Sam: We have no leader. Except we do have a secret weapon: we have a dragon who definitely wants something that we don't know about. Who might or might not be working with us.
Laura: We also have another secret weapon!
Marisha: We have two dragons.
Sam: We have a sword that is a dragon-slaying sword.
Liam: A whole other dragon.
Marisha: A whole other dragon.
Will: We should just kill each other now and just save the trouble. We got to plan something!
Laura: Scanlan, you do remember the flute, right?
Sam: Yeah, I carry it with me always. I use it all the time.
Laura: I wonder how long it'll take? To bamf over when we play the flute? Is it instantaneous or is it like, it takes a day?
Sam: We'll never know.
Laura: We'll find out. (laughter)
Sam: I'll be dead long before it works.
Taliesin: Six months later, "Where is everybody?" (laughter)
Marisha: I told you we were going to die if we didn't have you.
Will: No, you're going to die even with me! But I'm going to be the guy going, "Hey, we could have planned this better!"
Marisha: Right, yeah.
Mary: I think you've given them a really good plan.
Laura: Yeah, no, that's great! Let's do that!
Taliesin: There is no situation that anyone is going to come up with where we're looking good, and this is going to work well. There's just-- there's a dragon in the middle of the city with an evil army and we have to deal with it, and there's just no positive way to deal with that.
Mary: Are we taking Raishan with us?
Sam: Raishan, I feel like she's going to meet us there.
Marisha: It just seems so highly defeatist to already plan for-- you know, defeat.
Taliesin: It's not planning for defeat. It's recognizing that no matter what, ten minutes into it, everything that we thought we knew is going to be wrong anyway.
Will: At least tell me you're not going to send all your forces in at the same time. You're saving a reserve.
Laura: Of course.
Marisha: Okay. Then we need to talk about the forces that are going in. More armies are talented than others.
Sam: We're not sending them all in?
Taliesin: No, we're not. We are going to surround the city.
Will: I need one supreme general who's going to be in charge of everything. Who stays back as we're attacking.
Laura: Daxio is going to do that.
Mary: All right.
Will: And the men trust him?
Laura: Yes. He's the leader of the army.
Will: Okay.
Taliesin: He's all right.
Marisha: Then we need to get this plan to him.
Laura: Yeah, we need to talk to him.
Taliesin: We have communications.
Marisha: So we're going to have waves of assault from one position, have other people flank in from another position--
Will: And you're attacking a fortified city?
Taliesin: Fortified-ish. Well, the hope is actually-- also we have the 50 men from Fort Daxio. We can bring them in underground as well, and just have them pop up--
Laura: And open the gates?
Taliesin: --all sorts of places. Also open the gates.
Will: So you could bring forces with us to come up in the middle of the city?
Laura: Yeah.
Will: That's good. We should have talked about that in the beginning.
Sam: I also think there's a SWAT team that's available to us.
Taliesin: He thinks there's a SWAT team.
Will: You should-- you should talk less.
Sam: Smile more? (laughter)
Taliesin: I think you smile just the right amount.
Mary: I use my Awakened Mind to speak to Kash telepathically. You can't respond out loud, so don't. You know how I feel about Raishan. You know what I've experienced with her. Keep an eye on her. Don't trust her. If you see anything while we're out there, you let me know and we'll take her out. All right, darling?
Sam: Kash, why are you drooling and staring off into space? (laughter)
Will: Was-- was I drooling?
Sam: Oh, just a little.
Will: That's my bad, I'm sorry.
Laura: You were talking so much a second ago, and--
Will: I was thinking about how I can't wait to die tomorrow. Yeah.
Sam: Well, why don't we finalize this plan tomorrow when we meet with the general who will be-- what, commanding half the forces?
Marisha: I think we need to meet with the general, like, tonight.
Sam: Okay. Let's go.
Marisha: Right now.
Taliesin: Meet or telepathically communicate?
Laura: I think we should send a message through Allura. She can just scribble a note and send it to him.
Taliesin: Also that way, he'll have less time, less effort defying us.
Sam: Why-- why not go talk to him?
Marisha: Yeah. I feel like you can't really scribble an elaborate battle plan in a 25-word message.
Taliesin: It's not written down, it's all telepathic conversation.
Marisha: But the Message spell that Allura is using only allows for very minimal conversation. It's not exactly-- She can't have a full-blown conversation with them.
Matt: It's a long-distance Twitter.
Marisha: Yeah. A hundred percent.
Sam: Let's go to him.
Laura: All right, let's go. Right now. I still think we should eat a Heroes' Feast before we go. Just in case.
Sam: When Vex wants to spend money, I'm in agreement.
Laura: What's the difference, really? Just to be prepared.
Marisha: Well, it blows a spell.
Laura: But the day is almost up. It will protect us all day tomorrow.
Marisha: What time is it?
Matt: After this much conversation, it's getting closer to sunset, probably an hour after--
Sam: Oi, Pike! Can you do a Heroes Feast for us?
Matt: "Sure!" (laughter)
Sam: Thanks, Pike!
Matt: "No problem!"
Mary: You're so tiny, I didn't even see you. (laughter)
Matt: Yeah, she then goes ahead and casts Heroes' Feast. Same cost. Same cost as-- It also cost her 6th-level spell slot. Which I'll mark.
Laura: You don't have to, we have party funds for this, dear.
Matt: All right. So Heroes' Feast has been summoned for you guys.
Laura: Did you just give me 800? I'm just pocketing your 800, and I'm putting it in the party gold. So thank you.
Liam: It's the same thing.
Matt: So you guys are going to speak to Allura, then?
Sam: No. We're doing a Heroes' Feast.
Will: I was told there was brunch.
Mary: I was promised brunch!
Marisha: Do we know exactly where the Syngorn army is? How far away from--
Matt: That, you would have to talk to Allura about. She's acting as the information nexus for everyone. It takes an hour. You all have to sit and devour the meal for an hour, for 12 people.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: For your party, your two allies there, and Gilmore, and Jarett, Drake, anybody else you want to bring along. And as you guys, for the next 24 hours--
Laura: And Trinket.
Sam: Do you need it?
Laura: No.
Will: Wait. That was you at the beginning? (laughter)
Laura: Shh-shhh--
Matt: Kima-- you'd have to choose between Kima or Jarett.
Taliesin: Or Kima or Trinket.
Laura: We have to choose between Kima and Jarett to come? Or to eat?
Matt: To eat. You only have up to 12 people for the meal.
Marisha: Kima. She's in the fray.
Taliesin: Yeah. He can stay back, he has a crossbow.
Matt: All righty, so, that being the case, gonna roll 2d10 to see how much everyone's maximum hit points increases.
Sam: Oh, we don't need to do Grog.
Laura: Yeah, we do.
Sam: He's not here.
Matt: That's a really good roll. That's an eight and a nine. So there you go. All of you gain 17 additional max hit points for the next 24 hours.
Marisha: Wow, that's awesome.
Matt: That's actually really, really good. So keep a note on that.
Laura: And then we're immune to fear and poison, right?
Matt: And you're immune to poison and the poisoned condition.
Sam: And we have advantage on wisdom saving throws.
Matt: All right, I'm marking this here.
Will: I feel so much healthier. And the bacon is great. Fresh lox.
Sam: Zabar's.
Laura: I'm so hungry now!
Mary: Hollandaise wasn't that blender stuff, it was the real thing.
Matt: All right, so you finish your meal. You summon Allura, she comes and enters the room. She looks a little frazzled, a little sleepless, but she's keeping it together. "All right, what do you require?"
Marisha: We were curious if you knew the location of the Syngorn army?
Matt: "Yes, we've been keeping in contact. They look to be arriving about early afternoon tomorrow, at a far enough distance from Emon. Their illusionists have been keeping a blanket in front of the army to dissuade any visibility and giving away their position in advance."
Laura: Oh, that's so comforting.
Will: You have numbers?
Matt: "They are at-- let's see here, they're at 2,000 troops."
Laura: Okay. All right.
Matt: "Give or take, and--"
Marisha: Do you know the status of the other armies?
Matt: "Well, that is the Syngorian force and the three Daxio-- the Dusk regiment, the Tide regiment-- The Dusk, the Gale, and the Tide regiments with the Syngorian forces."
Liam: And all together is 2,000?
Matt: "Yes. A little over 2,000."
Will: Are they all foot?
Matt: "They are all foot, yes. Unfortunately, with the time given, and the transition to and from the Feywild, there was an inability to bring with them most of their beasts of burden and horses. Many of them were left to scatter shortly after the Conclave's attack."
Sam: Is there an elite SWAT team task force?
Matt: "I believe that's-- there is one, and they are called Vox Machina."
Mary: I've heard of them.
Will: Are there shields?
Matt: "They do have shields."
Will: How big?
Matt: "Uh, depends on the regiments. I mean--"
Will: Can we form a phalanx, is my question.
Matt: "I-- Yes, that is--"
Liam: He has been training military in Whitestone.
Matt: "Specifically the Tide regiment is a frontline shield phalanx."
Will: And how big is it?
Matt: "I don't actually have numbers on that. You'd have to talk to Mikael on that. The Warmaster."
Will: And they're going to be attacking a fortified location?
Matt: "Yes, the outer walls of Emon are guarded by a wall. The wall has sustained damage through the Conclave's initial attack and there has not been, as far as I know, intent to rebuild, or at least a force to be able to since then."
Laura: So if we could get in, talk to the Clasp, and have them find a way to open the gates, it would help the armies.
Will: Well, that's the thing, is you'd have to hold the gate once it's open. That's gonna be the hardest part. But 50 men could easily do that.
Laura: Plus the Clasp, which hopefully will be willing to fight.
Sam: Hey, where's our stone golem?
Taliesin: Far away.
Sam: He's gone.
Will: How many-- do we know the numbers that are inside the city?
Matt: "Not specifically. As far as the lizardfolk army-- from what we've heard from Asum, from Brom, from Raishan, the estimates are somewhere in the neighborhood of eight to nine thousand, and at least five to six hundred wyverns that are--"
Will: So we don't control the air?
Matt: "Not on a wide scale, no."
Taliesin: We have a single battleship.
Will: We're attacking a fortified location with no siege engines, outnumbered three to one.
Taliesin: Their fortified location also does not have siege engines, just air force.
Marisha: Their air force is also giant wyvern beasts.
Matt: "Now, understand, lizardfolk are not the most hearty, the most well-trained. They're a chaotic force at best and even the bit of unification they've had under Thordak's banner is thin. You've already had luck cutting down a few of their main sources of tactics; I believe the general that you slew outside of Daxio was one of their main organisers. That's a big blow to their tactic brigade. Who knows who else is in cahoots with Thordak since he took power, but we've been, in previous encounters, chipping away at their capabilities. Thordak also does have under his command a number of fire giants that he brought with him from the Fire Plane. However, you also slew their general."
Will: Are they superstitious?
Matt: "Not to my knowledge, no."
Will: Any type of religion; a devil figure in their religion?
Matt: "There are. They exist among many various devils."
Will: I'm wondering if we have the illusionist drop the shield when the army gets there and create an illusion of one of their giant beasts that they're afraid of on one side of the wall. Scatter fear among all of them.
Taliesin: It could work. The big fear there of course is that they work for a creature they already fear quite a bit.
Laura: I think Thordak might be scarier than any of their gods at this point.
Will: Thordak will be busy, hopefully. We want to move them away from the gate so that the 50 men can come up through the city and hold the gate.
Taliesin: I think a carrot would be easier than a stick. I think it would be better to find a force for them to rush toward, than to find something for them rush away from.
Marisha: Do we know how many spellcasters are in the Syngorn army?
Matt: "I do not have those numbers, unfortunately."
Will: That could be interesting.
Taliesin: More carrot, less stick.
Will: You might not even need to see the soldiers, just the dust rising from their boots.
Mary: And the horses charging, if you can make that kind of illusion.
Marisha: We need to figure out how many spellcasters.
Matt: "That would be a conversation with the Warmaster."
Marisha: They can throw down long-range, large, covering spells.
Sam: Let's go talk to the Warmaster.
Laura: Well we don't know where they'll be exactly until tomorrow.
Matt: "Have that conversation at the ready."
Marisha: All right, hang on, how about this? We know that they're to arrive in Emon by the afternoon. We can just try to connect with them in the early morning and march in with them, then split when we get closer to the gates.
Taliesin: And then meet the 50 men at Greyskull Keep.
Will: Do we have access to anything that goes boom?
Taliesin: A little bit. Do I have anything possibly still leftover at Greyskull, any of my supplies?
Matt: You do have a small cache of blackpowder at your disposal. It's about a cask.
Taliesin: I make it myself, half the time.
Will: A cask in the right place against an already damaged wall could punch a hole.
Taliesin: It could.
Will: And if we're underneath, and the foundation is already weakened, we'd be trapped but the army could get inside.
Taliesin: Do you still have that siege arrow or is that gone now?
Laura: I do, I have a siege arrow. And Grog does extra damage against buildings and walls.
Matt: "Yes I do!" (boom) slams his fists together, and as they hit you hear what sounds like a very localized sound of a rockslide. Just like (boom).
Marisha: Rad.
Taliesin: So we do have a siege arrow which will basically do the damage of-- It's a wall-shatterer. It's designed to bring down stone.
Laura: So it damages stone, specifically? The siege arrow?
Matt: Yes. It damages anything that is liable to siege.
Will: And it can be fired by anybody?
Taliesin: Yes, but it is weirdly weighted and she's probably the one you want firing it.
Laura: I'm a really good archer.
Will: I remember, when I brought you back from the dead.
Laura: Yeah, oh my god thank you so much.
Will: You're welcome, not a problem.
Mary: What am I, chopped liver? I get nothing? I think it was both of us, I believe.
Will: That could be interesting, though.
Taliesin: Yes it could. I'd forgotten about that.
Will: Well because what they'll be expecting is for 50 men to come in and hold the gate. What if holding the gate is actually a distraction? And then we punch a hole through the wall and go in the back door.
Laura: Yes. I like it.
Will: But we're going to be in the tunnel, we're working about the top right now.
Mary: But if we can scatter their forces front and back, we'll have the center to come in underneath, and that way if they figure it out they'll have to come from either side.
Will: The 50 men holding the wall, the chances of any of them getting out are slim, but they're going to know that going in.
Laura: These guys are legit!
Sam: We are the worst people.
Laura: Apparently! Which is terrible. It really, really is.
Will: It's the end of the world, they know what's happened.
Mary: You've been dealing with dragons, we've been thinking about it.
Marisha: I'm still concerned we don't have enough air support for the 500 wyverns.
Mary: I think we might have to let that go.
Matt: Allura chimes in and goes, "As far as I understand, that's part of the reason you're bringing the mages with you."
Marisha: Yes, well I'm thinking--
Taliesin: Ground to air.
Will: How big is the airship?
Marisha: I wasn't wanting to necessarily tap into this resource unless necessary, but I think it's necessary. I can contact the Air Ashari and have them specifically on air support.
Liam: And they can get themselves here quick, like you?
Laura: They can go through trees, instant!
Taliesin: It can hold two dozen people on that ship, right?
Laura: We need all of the Ashari.
Taliesin: It's about three cannonade?
Mary: Is there anyone that could put an illusion on the airship to make it seem like another dragon?
Sam: I could put a slight illusion on it but it'd be pretty easy--
Will: I'm just wondering if there's a way to draw their air force to the airship and then blow it up?
Liam: We also supposedly have a green dragon as an ally.
Sam: Oh yeah!
Laura: I fucking forgot the Ravenites said they would help us, too! I just remembered.
Sam: Well, we sent word to them, didn't we? Didn't we send word to everybody?
Matt: You sent word to a few specific entities, not the Ravenites.
Laura: How long would it take?
Taliesin: Vox Machina, swearing that they're going to call you back for four years. (laughter)
Laura: Fuck. Are they too far?
Matt: They're like a continent away.
Will: Wait, you can bring in air force?
Marisha: I can contact my father at the Air Ashari.
Sam: Do that. We also need to contact Gilmore.
Will: If you control the air, you control the battle.
Matt: "Gilmore is accompanying you, and I believe Kima is going to come along as well".
Taliesin: We also have your friend.
Matt: "The airship we don't know quite exactly where it is and when it will arrive. I don't know if we can count on it being there by the time you make this assault, but they're going there as soon as they can."
Taliesin: It has cannonade as well and it is designed to hold sieges in the air, so it will keep many of them busy, and they're not that bright.
Will: If it's not coming though, you can't count it among them.
Taliesin: We can't count on anything.That would be--
Will: Huge.
Marisha: Can you message Korren?
Matt: "I've not met Korren."
Marisha: Oh, shit.
Matt: "If you could take me to him--"
Marisha: Uh-huh. Yeah, right. Yes. Because we're not leaving until the morning now. Sure, yeah. Oh man (gasps) who wants to go see my hometown, you guys?
Sam: (dubious noise)
Marisha: Okay. You know what? I wasn't looking at you, Scanlan. Okay. I can show you where I went to school!
Mary: Keyleth, we need to get back here as soon as possible.
Will: You went to school? (laughter)
Liam: That was catty.
Taliesin: We were like back in school suddenly, that was great!
Will: I formally apologize.
Taliesin: That went so John Hughes, so quickly. (laughter)
Laura: Are we expecting you back tonight?
Mary: And the rest of us can rest, yes?
Matt: "Rest and prepare for everything you can, for tomorrow this happens." (liquid pouring)
Taliesin: I swear if you're aerating wine under there I'm going to be so upset. (laughter)
Will: I just saw it out of the corner, it was great!
Matt: All you had to do was ask, I'm working toward getting the break, buddy!
Sam: (sigh) Feels so much better!
Mary: Before we go to bed, I would like to talk to Vex very quickly.
Matt: As you guys are going to prepare to make your way to the Air Ashari, Zahra pulls you aside.
Mary: Darling?
Laura: Yes?
Mary: I have major concerns about Raishan. I don't know that we can trust her, I just want you to keep your eyes on her. While you were gone, I tried as hard as I could to glean anything from her, and the closer I thought I got-- I found out that I knew nothing about her. And she knows everything about me.
Laura: She knows everything about all of us, dear.
Mary: Don't trust her.
Laura: Not even for a minute.
Mary: Don't trust her. If it comes to it, I'll go down taking her out.
Laura: I'd rather you didn't.
Mary: So would I.
Laura: I have to do it, I have to insight check Zahra to make sure she's really Zahra!
Sam: Oh shit.
Matt: Make an insight check.
Liam: No that's good. That's good.
Laura: I love you.
Liam: Pretty good.
Taliesin: I can also say there's an easy way to do this--
Matt: Turn that way real fast.
Taliesin: Just go downstairs.
Sam: (in surfer accent) Hey guys, don't forget December's theme is "revolution!" Featuring items from Assassin's Creed, Mr. Robot, Firefly and more! Don't forget to go to lootcrate.com/criticalrole, and enter 'critical role' for 10% off, my bruh!
Matt: That's the worst use of Seeming I've ever seen! (laughter)
Matt: All righty.
Laura: When did you even speak to her?
Mary: While you were gone. You know I've been spending time-- she's been down in the ziggurat.
Laura: Yes?
Mary: So I've seen her. I've seen her form, as I guess you have as well.
Laura: Yes.
Mary: After Rimefang, I sort of became obsessed with dragons.
Laura: I know the feeling. (laughs)
Mary: Yes, it's a wonderful feeling, isn't it? But I also know that she was part of it, and the minute a dragon says 'trust me' is the minute you don't.
Laura: Especially her.
Mary: Especially her. So while you were gone, I tried. I tried to find out as much about Thordak as I could.
Laura: Just know that we don't trust her.
Mary: All right.
Laura: I don't even know if she's really sick.
Mary: I actually believe her in that respect. But Thordak is the only one that can cure her, and if that's the case-- if she believes that-- then we are nothing. We are expendable to her the minute she sees Thordak. That's the carrot that he has put in front of her, is that 'I will heal you', and he hasn't done it yet. I don't think he will.
Laura: I don't think he really can.
Mary: If he does, we're fucked. That's all.
Laura: You're not alone in this, at least.
Mary: Good. That's good.
Laura: She's not our friend.
Mary: She can be persuasive. Thank you, darling.
Matt: You separate for the evening to gather your mind, gather your supplies and prepare for the coming battle. While the rest of you find yourselves resting for the evening, Keyleth and Vax find yourselves walking towards the Sun Tree to make your journey.
Marisha: Is Allura coming with us, too?
Matt: If you want to ask her to come with you.
Marisha: I thought she was.
Matt: I'm sorry, yeah.
Marisha: She doesn't have to.
Matt: You're right, no, she goes with you.
Marisha: Okay, come on, Allura, let's go!
Matt: "Of course! Certainly."
Marisha: It's great, we have these really great crepes that we make. It's like our hometown special.
Matt: "If there's time, I would love to have some. Don't know if we'll have time."
Marisha: Okay, okay!
Matt: So you all walk your way down to the Sun Tree. You open the portal. Immediately on the opposite side you see-- as it is nighttime in this part of Exandria's hemisphere-- what looks to be a beautiful, simple village made of curved wood, almost dome-type structures, but not huts, there's no thatch. They're really well-crafted, long, intricate strips of wood like it's been grown to a specific shape. It creates these interesting domiciles that are all built, you see beyond that, on the edge of a sheer cliff, and the minute you step through the wind hits you. There is a strong wind immediately on the outside of this tree, and you feel your cloak being blown to the side. You look over behind the tree that you just stepped out of, and it's another cliff that vanishes into darkness below. The Air Ashari village of Zephrah lies at the very top of this mountain range. For a brief second, you get vertigo, glancing over your shoulder. Keyleth steps through with a big smile on her face. You see Allura step through, and as soon as she sees this happen she clasps and keeps her hair down, not wanting to be like you right now with your hair (blowing) in the wind. You take a few steps toward the village. Probably close to 100 homes at most, built into the mountainside. It goes up into a hill with trees that surround the outskirts of it. You see small lights that are lit throughout so it has this firefly feel glimmering through. As soon as you step maybe ten or 15 feet from the tree, the wind just stops.
Liam: What happened to the wind?
Marisha: I mean, we're Air Ashari, we don't have to live in a hellscape our whole lives! Come on, we control it, it's great! (sighs) Doesn't it smell good? It smells so fresh up here, you know? You don't have to deal with the pollution down there. Oh look! Over there, that's where I learned to shapeshift into a squirrel for the first time--
Matt: "Keyleth? Keyleth. We're here on business--"
Marisha: Yeah no, then let's start walking!
Matt: "Please lead on."
Marisha: Okay, yeah. And over there was the first time that my dad taught me how to fly. He just pushed me off the cliff--!
Liam: I have my hand on her back and I just start--
Matt: (laughing) Pushing her forward? You eventually make your way back. There are a number of trees that are grown through some of the buildings, or buildings are built around them, or from them. It's a very beautiful, simple, natural-looking series of structures that are all so smooth in their design that it was obviously bent with some druidic magic to craft this space. Currently there is nobody you see visible walking through the city, most everything is closed off for the night. The little lantern-like lights you saw before are coming from the inside of these buildings.
Marisha: It's a quiet mountain town, everything closes at like five, it was actually annoying growing up.
Mary: You live in South Pointe?
Liam: That explains so much. (laughter)
Marisha: I told you it was remote!
Matt: I want both of you to roll a perception check.
Marisha: 14 total.
Liam: 22.
Matt: Okay. As she's talking and you guys are walking, you notice a little dark spot, just covering past the stars, arcing quickly in your direction.
Liam: I spin her around and tilt her head back. What's that? Do you know what that is? Is that normal?
Marisha: Do I know what that is, is that normal?
Matt: Once you see it, you recognize the trajectory of it. This is a person rocketing toward you.
Marisha: Oh, that's a person! (laughter)
Marisha: No really, is this normal?
Matt: It's normal for you, because this is a person riding a skysail.
Marisha: Oh, it is normal for me? Oh, like a--? Yeah!
Matt: As the person swoops up and then lands-- it's a sort of glider. It resembles a pogo stick in the fact that feet are placed on top of it, and elements are grasped on the side. It's a large, leather-winged structure that immediately folds up and is held like a staff to the side.
Liam: Whoa, that's nifty! Hi!
Matt: Standing before you is Korren, your father.
Marisha: Dad!
Matt: He looks surprised. He lands in a very aggressive, coming-to-see-what's-going-on-type way, and as soon as he looks, "Keyleth! I wasn't expecting--"
Marisha: Hi! Village looks great! I see you guys have been keeping up with the landscaping, this is awesome. Hi, how are you?
Matt: He hugs you, but it's a tense hug and he pats your shoulder. "We're good. I--"
Marisha: What's wrong?
Matt: "Well, things as they are, I know you're probably here for not a passing visit. Am I correct in this assumption?"
Marisha: I mean, I guess you could say it was going to be passing in that we don't have a lot of time. We're here to ask for help, for the Air Ashari's aid.
Matt: "We were waiting for specific word based on our last conversation. We have ways of finding information about what's going on in the world, with the armies that have been mounting making their way towards Emon we've been keeping a watch on the gathering energy toward the west coast of Tal'dorei. We were preparing ourselves. So if you've come to ask for our aid, we're ready."
Marisha: Why do I sense trepidation in your voice?
Matt: "Because we know what we face. Because my daughter is going to war against something that we watched tear through the countryside not long after you were born. I'm just concerned as a parent. That is all."
Marisha: You sent me on this path to prove myself worthy and a hero. I'm following what I thought you wanted of me.
Matt: "You are, and I'm proud of you. I just want to do what I can to help safeguard that."
Marisha: I will continue my duties as I promised from the beginning.
Matt: "Of course".
Marisha: As those supersede being your daughter.
Matt: "Of course."
Marisha: And I am here for unfortunate reasons, and I wish I wasn't. We need the best. We need as many of the top soldiers that we have. I'm looking at you, at my people, for air support. There's about five, maybe six hundred, maybe even more wyverns covering the city. So far we don't have a lot of options.
Matt: "We know wyverns well, that's the good news. We can probably facilitate this request."
Marisha: I was hoping maybe some of the best nature manipulators could create a hazardous storm ahead of time? See what we can do to take out as much in bulk.
Matt: "We can do that. Yeah."
Sam: (whispering) She went to school.
Marisha: I know, I got educated!
Matt: "We can do that. When is this set to happen?"
Marisha: Tomorrow afternoon.
Matt: "All right, we'll get our conjurers together and begin building a storm front. We'll send it mid-day tomorrow. Then what sign should we look for to enter the fray?"
Marisha: Oh shit.
Sam: Just anything.
Liam: A flare, we have flares. Kiki, we have flares.
Marisha: We have flares. (laughter)
Matt: "Very well." (laughter)
Marisha: We're spitballing this as we go, dad. So we can work on a sign together, right?
Matt: "Sure, I mean, if we're creating a sky of rain and darkness, just make the sky itself a sign."
Marisha: I can do that.
Matt: "All right. Something I'd know, something I'd recognize."
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: "We'll go in there and tear as many of those wyverns as we can to the ground."
Liam: You're not alone, there is an army of elves marching as we speak.
Marisha: The Syngorn army.
Matt: "We've seen them traversing. Their illusions are strong but their illusions are faced towards the city. We have the luxury of knowing their magic. So, yes."
Marisha: With all due respect, if you have seen through their illusion, does that mean-- I'm sure many of Thordak's spies could do the same?
Matt: "It depends on who he has on his side. I hope that's not the case."
Marisha: Yeah, me too. Are you going to come as well?
Matt: "I do not wish to live in a world where the dangers that continue to press upon the free peoples of this or any land draws my daughter to the front lines to fight, kill, and possibly die, and I stay back and do nothing. So yes, I will be there." MARISHA What about Zephrah? What about the village? Who is going to watch it while you're gone?
Matt: "We have enough to spare for this and protect our people. Besides, as you well know, the protections in this village prevent wayward fliers."
Marisha: Okay. This is Vax, by the way.
Matt: "We've met."
Marisha: Yeah, you have.
Matt: "Good to see you."
Marisha: He came with me. So--? Yeah. See you tomorrow, I guess?
Matt: "See you tomorrow."
Liam: A great many people are grateful for your aid, as am I.
Matt: "And I'm grateful for yours."
Liam: You're a good man.
Matt: "Prove to me you're one as well." (laughter)
Taliesin: Cleaning the shotgun.
Matt: "But we have a lot to plan, I'm sure you do as well."
Marisha: Yes.
Matt: "Good night." He pulls you in and kisses you on the forehead, and gives you a long look.
Marisha: I just give him a big hug in response.
Matt: He holds you there for a second, then looks back over at you as he's holding her.
Liam: I just nod my head.
Marisha: I miss you, Dad.
Matt: "I miss you, too. When all this is done, do you still intend to finish your Aramente? Do it quickly. Come back to us, please. You're missed."
Marisha: You have my word. I won't let you down.
Matt: "I know. Anyway." He slams on the ground and the leather flares out into arcing-looking fingers, and he steps on.
Marisha: Are these the new models? They've really upgraded them.
Matt: "No, you've just been gone for a while."
Marisha: Have I been gone that long?
Matt: "You've been gone a while."
Marisha: Well, they look great!
Matt: "Thank you."
Marisha: Okay, all right, okay, bye.
Matt: "Good night." As the wind picks up under him, the skysail begins to lift and glide off. He heads back toward the village.
Liam: That is fucking cool. We should get out of here.
Marisha: Yeah, we should.
Liam: Allura?
Matt: "Yes, I believe we should. Well, it was nice to meet him."
Marisha: Yeah, that's right. Sorry, I should have introduced you, I guess.
Matt: "I was waiting." (laughter)
Matt: "As are the expected pleasantries of diplomacy. But it seems you had it all taken care of, so it's fine."
Marisha: Sorry, I got distracted by talking to you as my father and not as Allura!
Liam: It was so weird though, you were standing directly behind him. (laughter)
Matt: "It's all right, don't worry, it is a bit cold, if we could get back please?" She's rubbing her shoulders and arms a bit.
Marisha: That was my dad, let's go.
Matt: All right, you guys head back, exiting out the Sun Tree, making your way back.
Liam: I catch her by the arm. I can't wait to come back. Let's go!
Marisha: When we come back, I'll have to show you the first time I--
Liam: Let's go! Let's go, please! (laughter)
Matt: You make your way back to castle Whitestone, preparing your materials, your weapons, your minds and your disposition for the coming war tomorrow.
Taliesin: I have a quick thing!
Sam: Shit, Taliesin, shit!
Taliesin: I knock on Vex's door. I have a bag, and I go to Vex's door and knock on her door.
Laura: Hello, who is it?
Sam: It's a bag of dicks.
Taliesin: You're terrible. It's me, I have something to show you.
Laura: (faux surprise) Percy?
Taliesin: No, I'm an evil green dragon, let me in.
Laura: Are you here for our later talk?
Taliesin: No this is a very-- open the door, I have something to show you.
Laura: Fine. I open the door completely naked!
Marisha: Ooh!
Laura: What was it, dear?
Marisha: (laughs) It's a power play, I love it!
Taliesin: I don't remember but it was mostly to head in this direction. Can I come in?
Laura: Sure, of course! Would you like to talk before, or after?
Taliesin: I open the bag. (laughter)
Taliesin: I pull out the first bottle. This is called Dire Heart. I pull out the second one. This we simply call Courage. I pull out the third one. And this is a snow mead. And this is Green Tear Whiskey.
Liam: Drink the Courage one now.
Taliesin: We're going to start with the Courage and not talk about dragons. And I run in and shut the door. You just stepped on the whole thing, didn't you? (laughter)
Matt: That was beautiful!
Mary: I can't wait for the artwork! (laughter)
Taliesin: I will be expecting labels for all of them.
Liam: You can't always be in control, Percy.
Taliesin: No, I can't. It's beautiful.
Mary: Not when Vex is around.
Matt: Awesome. While you guys rest, most of you rest for the evening, we're going to go ahead and take a restroom break. We'll be back here in a few minutes to continue the story. Stick around for the break for a wonderful video message from Patrick Rothfuss about the Worldbuilders charity that we're supporting. Information will be coming up here shortly. See you in a bit! [break]
Matt: And welcome back, everyone, to Critical Role, as we come back from the break. We will have a winner from the chat room giveaway from our friends at Wyrmwood. We are giving away an awesome English Wych Elm Burl Personal Dice Tray winner if you guys were in chat. It's actually, this is really cool. If I pull it out of the box there. It's got a leather interior, it's awesome. And it goes to Jaanro. (cheering)
Matt: So we'll get that to you very soon. Go ahead and make sure to contact some of the crew here, or the mods, and get your information to get this out to you ASAP, so congratulations. And thank you once again, Wyrmwood, for making this possible.
Marisha: And by ASAP we mean as soon as we get out the other 20 packages we need to get out and then you're in the queue! Welcome to being in line.
Taliesin: It's like the kickstarter you didn't sign up for. It's coming!
Marisha: I didn't want this.
Matt: All right! So, coming back into our game. Get my music situated here. [very loud music] Oh my, volume! So, as you all slowly come to consciousnesses the following morning, well-rested for the most part. You gather your supplies, you prepare whatever else you prepared before, making your way to the coming battle. So, what do you guys want to do?
Sam: Go to the coming battle?
Mary: Yes.
Matt: All right, if you have all your things situated, you wait throughout the day, anxiously, eating your meal, looking to--
Liam: Why is the music so--
Matt: The music is intense here.
Liam: Is he here now?
Sam: I attack Zahra!
Mary: I use Witch Bolt on Scanlan!
Taliesin: It's like that random Final Fantasy encounter just happened and you're like, I only got ten feet.
Marisha: I just got out of the shop. Just got out.
Mary: And in that moment, we fall in love.
Will: If it's the final fantasy, why are there 14 of them?
Marisha: Every J-RPG.
Matt: We're fixing the audio. (loud wind instruments)
Matt: I don't think this is mine, either.
Sam: Is this just a radio station that we're picking up?
Will: You're listening to the sounds of Whitestone.
Mary: On WNBC radio!
Will: This is dragon radio. Giving a shout-out to the Conclave, Vox Machina...
Matt: Okay. I think we're at my tracks. Okay. Thank you for your patience. I need my music. It's just a thing; I need to have it there. I can't focus and dungeon master if I forget the music. What? So, thank you, guys. Pushing through the day, working through the antsiness of the coming conflict. Allura, communicating back and forth, gets word that the forces have gathered, temporarily set up camp to arm themselves and prepare for the battle once sundown hits. Warmaster Mikael Daxio is awaiting your arrival.
Laura: I have a question. I have a question. I'm going to attune the Boots of Haste that I took from my brother just now.
Liam: That your brother gave to you.
Laura: That my brother gave to me. And if I un-attune my Coldsnap Armor, do I just lose the cold resistance?
Matt: And any sort of armor bonus that it gave you. I mean, you would still have the armor. Like, if it's leather armor, it would give you a bonus of two to your AC. But if it's a plus two armor, you would lose the plus two on top of the actual armor.
Laura: That's a big drop. I'm going to take my bracers off, then.
Matt: Okay, so you're doing two less damage per attack.
Laura: Yes.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: That's smarter. That's wise.
Mary: I'm going to attune my Charred Dark Staff.
Matt: All right. Good.
Marisha: And I'm going to go ahead and attune to my cape, instead of my ring.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: I'm attuning the dragon sword, and I want to use it a little bit just so I don't get pantsed in the moment. Does it work all right; am I all right with this? It's awfully large.
Matt: It's bigger than what you're used to.
Liam: Yeah.
Will: Do you want to spar?
Matt: But even still--
Taliesin: It won't do a bonus to him. He's not a dragon.
Liam: I mean, I'd like to, but do we have time?
Matt: You could give it a shot.
Liam: Yeah, sure.
Matt: All right, so the two of you square off briefly out in the streets just outside of the guard barracks.
Laura: I whisper in my brother's ear.
Liam: What?
Laura: Just be careful because-- What? What?
Liam: Nothing. What were you going to say?
Laura: Be careful; I think he has a grudge against you.
Liam: For what?
Laura: Just go. You'll be great.
Will: Am I fighting you or your sister?
Liam: It's really the same thing, at all times.
Mary: I use Awakened Mind and I say, Kash, go easy on him.
Laura: (laughs) Oh, shit.
Will: We're going easy. I just want to make sure that you and your blade are one before you go into battle. It's a bad time to find out you don't know how to use it.
Liam: I poke him in the knee with my sword. (laughter)
Matt: Roll an attack.
Liam: That is-- Is this a sneak attack?
Matt: No.
Liam: No, it's just 28.
Matt: All right, so yeah. So, as you say that, he smiles, and before you even notice, you hear a ping! and you feel a slight vibration into your lower pauldron, and you look down and the sword has not hurt you, but it has definitely pierced the plates behind the armor and he's showing, he's posturing that he already has availability with the blade between your armor.
Will: Interesting.
Liam: I jump back five feet. (laughter)
Will: I Flame Strike! No, I'm kidding. (laughter)
Liam: Evasion!
Will: Just jump right to it.
Matt: "Where's Vox Machina?" "Well, um. They killed each other. It's weird." (laughter) So as you both stand there, in a moment, squaring off, the tension still in the city from the coming event, but people are starting to look out and gather. They're having a "Morpheus is fighting Neo" moment as people are starting to pull others from nearby buildings, and gather in a small circle around.
Marisha: Yeah, I go up to Vex, and go  why-- Why is this happening? Is this happening for, like, a-- Did they tell you-- Did they tell you the reason?
Laura: They're fighting over you, darling. They're fighting over you.
Marisha: I can tell-- I've been with you for a long time. I can tell when you're lying to me.
Laura: They both professed their love and now they're fighting.
Marisha: Now you're patronizing me.
Liam: (calls) We're really not that far away! Are we going to do this? You ready?
Will: I'm ready when you are.
Matt: Who's making the first move?
Liam: Me. Are we doing initiative or attacks? I don't even know what this is?
Matt: The initiative was whoever said "me" first, so.
Marisha: I didn't know how badly I wanted this until now.
Taliesin: Boy, I did.
Liam: Oh, man, what are we fighting to? Here we go. So that is the first and that is-- I'm going to use Luck.
Marisha: You're about to fight a fucking dragon! You're fighting Kash!
Matt: You do realize-- You only have-- You're spending your Luck for--
Liam: I spent it already. Just so we're clear, everybody-- I'm going to switch back to Liam-- This is a game! This is a game. Which camera's on me? This is a game!
Will: Your fun is wrong.
Mary: Your fun is very wrong.
Liam: So it's an 18.
Matt: An 18. What's your armor class? With your shield?
Will: My armor class is 20.
Matt: As you go to strike with the sword--
Liam: That's the first one.
Matt: Yes. With your sword. And so now you're attacking with your--?
Liam: Natural 20, with Whisper.
Matt: With Whisper, okay. All right. So, as he swings with the sword, with your shield you deflect it off to the side and you're about to bring your spear through for your own strike. However, he's suddenly much closer than you expected, and you feel the blade shirk the side of the armor. So for the purposes of this, we're not rolling damage because it's to spar--
Liam: Thank you.
Matt: But the blade hits and pokes just enough where you know that's maybe-- That's where the kidney is.
Will: Right, okay.
Matt: And in that brief moment, you see the little creeping smile up the side of his mouth. You go ahead and roll your attack now, Kashaw.
Will: 18.
Matt: Plus?
Will: Plus, well, if I'm using my-- I don't want to use the shadow spear. Should we use-- Let's not do nec damage on him, let's think. It's just a regular plus two, right?
Liam: So what is he at?
Matt: 20.
Liam: Nope.
Matt: Well, it's a plus two spear. What's your attack bonus altogether?
Will: Oh, with the attack bonus is plus ten.
Matt: So that's 28.
Will: 28 to you, yeah.
Liam: Oh, that definitely hits.
Matt: Yeah, so, after you get the blade there, there's that moment of posturing. How do you deflect him off?
Will: I think, yeah, the blade comes in, he's got his spear, so as the blade comes in, he slaps his arm away and just takes it right lightly across the chest so it just cuts into the little bit of fat.
Matt: Just-- (slicing noise). You back away and you see two of the mantle-like dark feathers of your armor, the very tips just go-- (puff)
Will: And then I look at you and go  one-one. (laughter)
Mary: I cast Eldritch Blast, two beams, right in front of either one of them.
Matt: As you guys are having this moment, all of a sudden the ground detonates before you. In a haze of greenish-white arcane energy, you see now these small basketball-sized concave blast craters in the ground before each of you, and right off to the side you see Zahra standing, staff in one hand, hand before her with the other.
Liam: Oh, you do have two different color eyes. They're so nice.
Mary: I use Thaumaturgy to go fire with my eyes.
Will: We're just playing.
Mary: All right, boys. Enough. I appreciate it.
Liam: All right, we'll play slap and tickle later.
Mary: Your fun is wrong. Play slap-tickle later. Let's do this.
Liam: Anyway, sword works. Sure.
Matt: All right, you sheath the sword. So you guys gather the rest of your materials together.
Taliesin: We still have that spare sword that was just that standard rapier that was just in the bag before from the general, correct?
Laura: Grog has the Bag of Holding, and I don't know what's in it.
Taliesin: I think we have it. We still have just a very standard nothing, where it's barely a plus one--
Matt: Yeah, it's barely enchanted.
Liam: What'd you need it for?
Taliesin: Just in case someone gets close enough to me that it's complicated.
Liam: I have a shortsword, but that sounds better.
Taliesin: It's probably better. It's whatever Stonefell had.
Matt: Shortsword is dex-based, so you're going to probably want to run with that.
Marisha: I need to roll really fast to recharge my Spire. So I'm going to do that, real fast.
Matt: All right. And actually, you should roll to recharge your wand.
Marisha: It goes all the way up. It is full again.
Matt: All right.
Marisha: I rolled four plus four.
Matt: Twice, actually, for two nights of rest, so.
Will: "My spire's full."
Mary: "So is mine."
Sam: Seven. So I'm back up to normal.
Matt: Okay. All righty. As you guys are preparing, Gilmore comes out. He's usually dressed in his usual casual flowing robes. Or his wizard tracksuit-type outfit. The outfit you see on him, it's more ornamental. And it's, specifically more so than you've seen him wear, it has a very similar design and presentation of some of the more noble individuals you saw wandering Marquet, Ank'Harel in particular. He seems to be going more ceremonial than you're used to seeing Gilmore.
Laura: What color are the robes?
Matt: Oh, they are very much purple and gold. He keeps to his aesthetic. But the design is definitely ceremonial; different than anything you've seen him wear.
Marisha: Wow.
Liam: Full Bollywood.
Marisha: Yeah, that's what I was thinking about!
Sam: Is it his old boy scout uniform or what?
Matt: It's a long mantle that travels down to the lower part of his torso, where his arms come out from these long sleeves that come to a fine point at the ends. He still has all of his jewelry on, but where the belt is you can see it's a very thick, heavy belt that like ties to a bow in the center, almost like a reverse kimono that comes to a square point. And the robe itself drops low and flows behind him as he walks. It's really pretty. As he walks in, he's holding himself with the Gilmore air, but you can still see a bead of sweat down his head and a little bit of nervous energy. "Very well, I guess today's the day."
Taliesin: Be pleased.
Sam: How are we going to get there?
Matt: "Be pleased."
Will: Are we speaking to the general first?
Sam: Yeah, we're going there first. But not via a tree, we have to go via something else.
Laura: Why not via a tree?
Sam: Is there a tree on the battlefield where they are?
Laura: Well, it's not a battlefield.
Marisha: I will be able to find out when we scry. If not, we'll have to talk to Allura. I'm going to scry real quick! Scrying Eye.
Matt: Who are you scrying on?
Marisha: Can't hide from my scrying eyes. Your dad. What's his name? Syldor, okay.
Taliesin: Syldor the inevitably disappointed. That's his full title.
Matt: Okay, you scry Syldor. You have a bit of a flash of green, lots of green, endless green. Your vision jumps into a familiar warm home. You see Syldor nervously sitting with his daughter on his knee, and they're talking. Syldor is back in Syngorn. Syldor isn't a fighter, Syldor is a diplomat.
Taliesin: Oh, that's fair.
Laura: Right, right.
Will: Did you see them? Where are they?
Marisha: Happy and healthy and comfortable by a fire.
Will: The whole army is happy and healthy and comfortable by a fire?!
Marisha: No, he's not with the army is what I mean. Oh shit. I thought he was going to be with the army.
Taliesin: It's okay we have plan B. Let's go deal with plan B.
Marisha: Okay, I'll scry again.
Taliesin: Or we can make Allura do it.
Marisha: Allura, do you know where they are?
Laura: She can take us to Daxio?
Matt: "I don't know specifically where they are." And she sits for a second and sets up a rush job of a scry ritual, 'cause now she feels she's been put on the spot. But she puts it together.
Marisha: Can I help her a little bit?
Matt: Yeah, you give her a little aid. You pay it back to the last time you helped her with a scry spell, back when you first met in Emon. And her eyes blink over white again, cloudy. And she returns. "All right, I see Mikael and the army gathered, and there is a very energetic air to them. They're looking restless. I can bring eight of you with me."
Sam: Well, are there any trees near them?
Matt: "There are, yeah."
Marisha: The problem is it generally has to be a tree that I'm familiar with.
Sam: If you go with her, you'll be familiar with the tree.
Marisha: It doesn't work that way.
Laura: Question, if you go and you open up a path to the Sun Tree, can people on this side run through the Sun Tree?
Marisha: Can I? That's an excellent question, can I?
Matt: Wait, so if you Transport via Plants--
Marisha: Like if I go with Allura and then open a gate through the Sun Tree, and they're just ready to rock.
Taliesin: Do you have a Sling Ring?
Marisha: Oh, damn it. Fucking lost my Sling Ring.
Matt: It does; it connects the plants on both sides. (cheering)
Marisha: Hey! I'll do that. Does anyone else want to go, just in case?
Laura: Yeah, the eight of us need to go. And then how many is that left?
Matt: "That would leave--"
Sam: Four?
Matt: "Then Grog, Pike and Gilmore. And Kima. And Jarett. Yeah, we could bring everybody."
Laura: And Drake?
Matt: "Is Drake coming?" And she looks off to the side, and you see this little figure running down from the castle at the top, carrying all this shit in his arms. "Hold on! I'm--" And you watch him just eat shit. He just tumbles; scatters. Gets up and is like, "No one saw that!" Picks it back up, runs back down and catches up.
Taliesin: Are we supposed to get something from the-- Oh god, we were supposed to-- Weren't we supposed to grab something earlier? My brain is just turning to mush.
Sam: We got it already.
Taliesin: Oh, we got it already; never mind, that's right.
Laura: Yeah, yeah, yeah. He gave it to us.
Marisha: Where's Raishan, though?
Liam: Yeah. Are we going to talk to what's-her-butt?
Sam: She'll find us. She's not our problem. She's not our problem. We're not babysitting a dragon.
Taliesin: In fact, if anything, the less we speak to her at this point, probably the better.
Will: And you're sure she's coming?
Matt: "Don't worry; she's coming." And you hear another dwarven voice from the side, as you glance out you see there's standing not too far from you, arms crossed, Larkin. (cheering)
Liam: Buddy! Where have you been!? I've been fucking worried sick! You were there; you were gone. How'd you even get back here?
Marisha: Vax, please, don't--
Liam: Listen, I'm fucking with you. All right? What's up, green bean?
Matt: "So, are we ready for this?"
Taliesin: No.
Matt: "Didn't think so. Let's do it."
Sam: So you all go; I'll stay with these ragtag group and sit by the tree and get ready.
Laura: All right.
Marisha: All right.
Matt: Allura grabs you, and takes Kima, and the rest of the group that she can, and over time you guys manage to get-- we'll say for the sake of brevity here-- everyone back over to the war camp itself. And it is a fair-sized war camp. And what's interesting is as you're within this camp, you look up, and in a similar way, the illusion barrier that surrounds Whitestone, that very, very faint shimmering effect, is present, but it's much stronger and it's much more visceral in the way that it alters the visuals. It looks like the sky is this perpetual shifting kaleidoscope of colors. The blue sky becomes green, becomes purple, becomes red; it just constantly shifts like the surface of a pond that's been perpetually rippling. And you see on the outskirts of the war camp, this rotating guard of illusionists that are taking time to just restore and maintain this illusion, as everyone else is eating, polishing their weapons and armor. You see a mix of elven warriors, elven archers, and, very similar to the Daxio soldiers you met earlier, but armor of different crests, signifying the different regiments. It doesn't take you too long to eventually come upon, and be led to, the tent where Mikael is, the Warmaster himself. The Warmaster, I do not believe you've met before, personally. As you enter and look within, you can see the Warmaster-- It sets you off at first, because he does resemble his son. His son, who you did not have quite a positive experience with. He's an older elvish man. His hair just past shoulder-length, but pulled into a very, very tight ponytail in the back, with a few strands that fall in front of his face. He has a very, very strong jaw for an elf. He's a thick and well-built warrior and holds that with both a strength, and commanding respect, and everyone around him definitely looks up to him. You can immediately see why he's the Warmaster and how he's held that position for so long. And you also wonder, one, how his son fell so hard, and two, how it must have affected him. But in that instant as you enter, he's in the process of having a conversation, and they have a layout of what looks to be a brief sketch of Emon in its current state, with a few things here and there marking where most of the gathered elements of the army, whatever you'd call it, the defense of Emon, exists. And as you all begin to enter the tent, he goes, "Oh, hello. I know of you, and I've been expecting you. Allura has been kind enough to fill me in, in bits and pieces, but as far as I am to understand, you're our strike force?"
Laura: The elite SWAT team, heading in there.
Matt: "Good to know this. We've been walking for quite some time, and the soldiers have had a bit of rest. If we could, we would take an additional day, just to put it at our most capable, but it seems time is not at our beck and call in this situation, and as such, when the sun is down, I think that is the agreed-upon time to strike."
Sam: At sundown. All right, sure. Yeah, yeah, sure.
Taliesin: Most of these soldiers have, at least, night vision, some form of darkvision, I assume.
Matt: "Most of the Syngorian army does, and we have quite a few at Daxio that do as well."
Will: (flatly) How are you going to attack?
Laura: This is Kashaw.
Will: Hi. How are you going to attack?
Matt: "Pleasure to meet you as well. So. We have broken up the regiments into five different segments. We're going to separate, leading into the initial strike. We're going to simultaneously hit the four main gates, the north, south, east, and west side. The easternmost gate has already received quite a bit of damage. With all the simultaneous strikes, we're hoping to draw most of the army to the outer circles of the city. We're going to utilize this time to then shift our forces southward and instead push towards a singular gate in a southward position, while they're scattered in that direction. If I'm to understand what Allura has told me, you are going to be entering from underneath the city?"
Taliesin: That is the plan.
Matt: "And attempting to facilitate the opening of one or more of these gates in doing so?"
Laura: That would be swell if we can, huh?
Matt: "That would be."
Taliesin: We haven't really discussed it, but--
Laura: No, no, no, but we have talked about doing it.
Taliesin: Or even breaching the south gate alone would be-- If all four gates are being--
Will: Any time we go out and we attack a gate, they're going to bring all of their forces to that gate. What they're not going to be suspecting is a wall being ripped down. And once you open a wall, you can't close it. You can close a gate.
Laura: What's the weakest wall?
Matt: "That would be the eastern wall."
Taliesin: It's also near Greyskull Keep.
Mary: Oh, that's the arrow that you're going to use, yes.
Matt: "While we are not in a position to use siege weaponry, we do have most of our mages at our disposal, and they have prepared a modicum of siege-based arcane spells at their disposal. So I do not think piercing the outer wall will be an issue. It's what lies beyond it that our focus is going to be: sow confusion, separate and destroy. They are not a very well-organized army, and most of the creatures we've seen wandering the skies do so with nothing but bloodlust and the intent to rend and tear as their main driving force and goal. So, utilizing that technique-- And we've discussed, you'll be entering the walls; we'll be pushing forward, phalanx method with those that are shielded. We will be piercing through and scattering from the inside, breaking their ranks as much as possible, and doing our best to stay out of the skies, using alleyways, using small streets. We don't want our men being plucked out from the middle, from their air support."
Laura: We will have air support.
Marisha: I called in assistance from the Air Ashari, from the north. They're maintaining the skies.
Matt: "The Ashari are aiding us as well?"
Will: Do you know how many?
Marisha: Did dad tell me how many?
Matt: He said roughly a hundred.
Marisha: Oh, shit. Thanks, dad. Roughly a hundred.
Will: If I can make a suggestion? If you get into the city, don't move through the alleys. You're going to scatter your forces. Move into the city and fortify a position. So then you've opened a gate inside the city. Move the command center inside the city, and defend from there.
Matt: "That is indeed part of our push, however, we are rather vulnerable from the air. So with the Air Ashari giving us air support, that will allow us the ability that we need to push forward as a singular unit, from unit to unit, in its own right. You are entering from where?"
Sam: The sewers.
Laura: Yes. We have a secret entrance in our keep, if we can still access it. If not, there is an entrance to the sewers towards the water. We were told of it by the Clasp, right?
Sam: I've also used a tunnel to get out, at some point.
Marisha: That's right, when you were looking for Kaylie.
Matt: That was Westruun.
Sam: It's the same sewer system, though, right?
Mary: It's the same basic layout of a city, yeah, right?
Laura: Wait, wait, the Traverse Junction. What's the Traverse Junction?
Matt: "The Traverse Junction is-- was-- is, as far as I know, still attached to the Lyceum, but--"
Sam: The Lyceum's unguarded!
Matt: "The Lyceum is partially destroyed, and is filled with the remains of the enemy."
Sam: I remember that.
Laura: That's not what I meant, then. That wasn't the thing that I meant to say.
Marisha: And we know Thordak has made an underground basin. He only emerges when someone challenges him, or offers their loyalty.
Mary: Were we supposed to meet the Clasp in a specific place?
Sam: We've just got to get to a sewer.
Mary: So we just need to find a sewer and then we're going to reconnoiter with-- Is that the right word? Anyway-- with the Clasp. And at that point, we shall make our way through--
Matt: All right.
Will: And that's when the thieves and liars will take us to the thing that's going to kill us all? We're very excited about the plan.
Matt: "I can tell."
Will: Yeah. Do we have the 50 soldiers we need, or do we need to ask them for 50?
Sam: Did they ever show up? Did the 50 soldiers from Fort Daxio show up?
Matt: "I had heard that Daxio had fallen. There are survivors?"
Laura: Well. There were. There were about 55 soldiers.
Matt: "They haven't found their way to us yet, then. We'll keep an eye out."
Taliesin: They might be headed towards Greyskull, if I recall. I believe they were heading there.
Laura: That's true. They should be crossing paths very shortly.
Taliesin: 50 men can move quietly.
Laura: So after you cut through all of the lizardmen like butter, you'll make your way to Thordak?
Matt: "That's the intent, to push in towards the Cloudtop. And, based on how well you and/or any of the air forces have been able to puncture the defenses, push in towards the creature itself and unleash everything we have at the beast. As far as I know and have been told, from some of the remaining members of the Council, they have a few members still within the city. I believe Tofor Brotoras, Seeker Asum, and Brom Goldhand are still within the city."
Sam: Well, not Asum. We know where he is.
Laura: And Brom.
Mary: I thought Brom was at Whitestone.
Laura: Don't say that word out loud.
Mary: I said it to you, quietly.
Laura: Yeah, very quietly.
Taliesin: We'll gather what we can. We don't really know what's actually in there, yet.
Marisha: And we can't trust anyone within the city limits.
Matt: "Understood."
Will: Do you have a time frame? For your attack?
Matt: "We are intending, once the men have been fed, once the men have been able to rest and prepare their armaments, we were going to attack upon sundown, yes."
Will: And you plan to breach the city when?
Matt: "Hopefully within the first hour of the attack."
Will: Really?
Matt: "That's the intent."
Will: How far do you think we can make it in the tunnels in an hour?
Taliesin: Pretty far, to be honest, especially if we're-- Well, no that's--
Sam: 20 blocks.
Will: You making that number up?
Sam: Yep.
Will: You just pulled that out of nowhere.
Sam: Absolutely.
Taliesin: It's the highest number he knows. Grog's not here; I have to do something.
Sam: An hour-- We can probably make it, I don't know, we can make it deep into the city, but not all the way to the center, can we?
Taliesin: No, not in an hour.
Liam: It's a maze in there. But the tunnel from our keep in, if it's intact, was not that far.
Matt: "If you were to traverse the tunnel system in advance of our attack, that would perhaps aid us in syncing our maneuvers."
Sam: So we should go now.
Will: That would be the goal, is to act as point for the entire army.
Matt: "That would indeed be the goal."
Laura: So, what, the minute we pop out, we send up a flare?
Matt: "Some sort of a sign. Hopefully something not quite as easy to read as a sign of aggression. We've taken much care to not be seen this far."
Sam: Or we could just wait for sundown and then go, knowing that they're going to strike at the same time.
Taliesin: We go now.
Sam: No, I mean, once we get in there, we wait until we pop out, until it's getting dark outside.
Liam: I mean, what kind of symbol do we send up in a sky full of wyverns?
Laura: What if we're not in position by sundown?
Marisha: The Ashari are already looking for a symbol. I plan to be aiding them. They should be helping us with--
Sam: What about a storm?
Marisha: Well, there will be a storm.
Will: Wait, there's a storm coming?
Sam: Can you make one?
Matt: As you guys actually glance over, you can see in the eastern sky, past the Iron Seat Ridge, there is an extremely dark, building stormfront that is just looming, miles off in the distance.
Marisha: See? Told you.
Sam: What about-- Kiki, what if you just made some lightning strikes to signal the start of the fight?
Taliesin: I think nature itself is going to make some lightning strikes.
Marisha: Well, I've got my whole Skywrite thing. I've got my whole Skywrite thing; I can make a symbol in the air out of clouds, which isn't as terrifying as everyone has thought it is in the past. We just need to pick a symbol--
Laura: It just has to be subtle, something your dad will recognize, huh?
Mary: A phoenix or something.
Will: How is the storm going to affect your attack, is my question.
Matt: "We are trained to undergo warfare in many different forms of terrain and weather."
Mary: My concern is that if we wait until this storm comes in, the sewers will be flooded. We need to go in now before the storm gets here.
Will: But if we get lost in there and the storm comes, it'll be flooded while we're in there.
Sam: The storm isn't a real storm, isn't it Air Ashari?
Laura: No, no, no, it's Air Ashari.
Taliesin: But it's still a real storm.
Matt: "If there is rain to come with the storm, that is fortuitous, for much of the city still burns. But fire we can quell with a storm would be helpful."
Marisha: It's a-coming man. It's coming.
Matt: "Right, good to know this."
Liam: Well, let's go.
Sam: To Greyskull Keep?
Marisha: Look for-- Keep your eye on the sky.
Matt: "I will have two of my hawkeyes keeping an eye at the clouds"
Marisha: There will be a symbol. It will be super obvious when it's determined. You'll be like, "Oh, of course, it couldn't have been anything else". When you see it.
Matt: "I look forward to solving your riddle. You as well, stay safe."
Marisha: Don't know what the fuck it's going to be. It could be a big "VM" for Vox Machina, I mean like you know-- We could be like, Now! Fucking attack!
Liam: Are there clouds overhead now? Above the city.
Matt: If you look up, it's-- the weather over here's been fairly clear. There are a few wispy white clouds, but nothing that is indicative of a storm, yet.
Taliesin: If the storm has taken the city, there will be a break in the storm, of a perfect circle, where we are attacking--
Will: The eye of a hurricane.
Taliesin: The eye of a hurricane. If it is not a force, we can certainly look for it.
Liam: And if the skies are clear, they'll not be clear.
Taliesin: It will be a nice column that will--
Matt: "All right. Then--"
Will: Look for the stillness in the storm.
Matt: "We shall. Travel safe, travel swift."
Mary: Safe journey.
Matt: "You as well, good luck."
Sam: Be pleased. Remember, the plan is chaos.
Laura: Total chaos.
Will: Chaos can work.
Taliesin: Chaos works very well.
Laura: We make our way to Greyskull.
Taliesin: Back to Greyskull.
Matt: All right. As you guys make your way towards Greyskull Keep. Walking through, as you see rows and rows of soldiers of different walks of life, all part of the alliance of Tal'Dorei between Syngorn and Emon. Many of them watch as you pass, some just curious as to what regiment you belong to, and you get a couple of occasional looks of recognition.
Laura: I wink.
Will: Dale? Where you been, man?
Matt: "Wait! Kash?"
Will: What the hell's going on?
Matt: "Going to die today, what are you doing?"
Will: Pretty much the same thing man, how's Anne?
Matt: "Anne's not doing too well."
Will: Aw, I'm sorry to hear that.
Matt: "Yeah, she was in the city when the dragons attacked."
Will: No! She wasn't.
Matt: "Yeah."
Will: Oh, that's horrible!
Matt: "It's okay, we're going to kill them today, right?"
Will: We're getting there buddy. Good to see you, you're looking good.
Matt: "Good to see you too, you too!"
Will: All right, I'll see you later, man.
Matt: "All right."
Will: That was-- I haven't seen that guy in forever. So bizarre. Sorry, let's go.
Sam: Small world man, small world.
Liam: And we're walking and we're walking and we're walking.
Taliesin: I feel like I've had that awkward four minutes of like every con ever. Oh god!
Matt: As you guys exit the side ranks of the current encampment, as they are all preparing, the sun itself growing maybe about two hours out from touching the horizon, you can see, in the distance, on some of the outer embankment and small structures that litter the walls of Emon's surrounding fields, you see Greyskull Keep, a very welcoming, longtime coming return. As you stay low to the grass, I need you all to make stealth checks
Laura: Oh shit. Oh shit, oh shit. You roll a 20. And then you--
Marisha: Oh, natural 20!
Matt: Nice!
Sam: Natural 20 right here as well.
Marisha: Really? Eh! Natural 20 bros!
Taliesin: Natural 19, I haven't added yet.
Marisha: Fuck you.
Mary: Ten!
Laura: Should I cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us? Is it too late? Can I just add it to everybody's if I cast it now?
Matt: As you guys were going stealthy, I'll say sure. Because you would have known, at this point to do so. If you want to spend your spell slot to do that, sure.
Laura: I do.
Liam: And that's plus ten, right?
Laura: Yeah, it adds ten to all of your rolls.
Mary: 20.
Liam: 35, now.
Laura: 30.
Taliesin: 35, 35 with the plus ten. 35.
Matt: All right. As you guys all stay low and guarding each other, keeping an eye out to make sure nobody is giving too much away. You manage to go unnoticed--
Marisha: (coughing) Sorry, I so inhaled my spit, keep going.
Matt: Don't do that. That's bad.
Will: Make a breathing saving throw.
Marisha: (coughing) I'm still dying for a second. Go on, guys.
Liam: I rolled double ones. (wheezing)
Matt: You guys make your way to Greyskull Keep, front door's open. Like, partially ajar. Not locked.
Liam: I move in, forward.
Matt: Okay, you head inside first.
Liam: I'm going to poke my head in first.
Matt: Make a perception check.
Liam: 27.
Matt: You take a moment and look around, listen carefully. No sound.
Liam: So far so good. I'm going to move further in. And continue to-- I'm going to check for traps.
Matt: Go for it. Investigation check.
Liam: Fine, sure, investigation is an 18.
Matt: Okay. Nothing appears to be trapped here. If anything is out of place, you know this area pretty well, so.
Laura: We're making our way to the doorway, we peek in now.
Mary: Is it very dark in there?
Matt: There are no current set torches or candlelight whatsoever, there are a few openings that bring some light in. Specifically from Sarenrae's temple. But other than that, it is pretty dark in the hallways.
Mary: Can I see anything with darkvision?
Matt: With darkvision, you're fine. As you guys glance around and begin to scatter throughout the keep, you can see signs that it has been lived in. People have been rummaging through, there is no sign of any food whatsoever in the keep anymore, there are a number of bowls and anything of any remote value has either been taken or is left used and unwashed. But after doing a quick scan, there is no one inside Greyskull Keep. Apparently--
Liam: Like, the whole place?
Matt: Yeah.
Liam: So all the way up the stairs, to our bedrooms, to his laboratory, all that's clear?
Matt: All of it's empty, but a lot of things have been taken.
Sam: Can I go in the kitchen and just sort of sense magic, or do an arcana check or something, to see if there's any--
Matt: There is a Detect Magic spell, if you have that.
Sam: I don't have that.
Matt: Then you would be hard-pressed to detect if it's present necessarily.
Marisha: Is your poop still around?
Sam: My poop is still there, it's just inert. It's just poop.
Laura: Did somebody steal the poop?
Sam: Oh, is it still there in the jar that I left it in?
Matt: Actually, there is a broken jar on the ground. It looks like somebody discovered it and wasn't quite sure what it was, and then discovered what it was.
Mary: This isn't pudding! (laughter)
Liam: This single scoop tastes funny.
Mary: Gelato? (retches)
Matt: The behavioral patterns of the way things are left, it looks like people have come in through, rummaged, grabbed what they needed to survive, or what seemed of value, and left. And things they didn't understand, or didn't see value in, they left behind. Most of your workshop has been ransacked.
Taliesin: I figured.
Matt: Your cask is still there. And a few esoteric tools that they didn't really understand, or too big to maneuver, are still there. But most of your toolset is gone.
Taliesin: Grabbing what's useful, and maybe as a lark I might try and run a wire from my inert glove to Cabal's Ruin to see if I can actually get the charge to travel through it if I punch something.
Matt: If you want to use one of the charges, you can try that.
Taliesin: Yeah, I'll use a charge-- I'll hold. I'll find out in the moment, won't I?
Matt: Yeah, that you will.
Marisha: Try it on the day.
Will: Is this your castle?
Sam: Yeah, this is our house. This is our keep.
Taliesin: It's a keep, not a castle.
Mary: This is lovely. It's a little cold.
Sam: But it's seen better days.
Mary: But the bones are good.
Will: Lot of space.
Sam: It's a fixer-upper.
Mary: Good location.
Liam: I'm going downstairs to the entrance, and I'm going to check it out. And use Divine Sense at the entrance.
Matt: Okay, make an investigation check.
Liam: All right. That's good. That is a 24.
Matt: Okay. Divine Sense doesn't trigger anything off. Nothing gets you riled up in that sense.
Liam: Feathers are in place?
Matt: Indeed, yes. Except the two that were cut earlier from Kashaw. But you do find the hidden entrance, or the exit I guess you could say from the keep, left as it was, untouched. The seam still smooth, covered in dust.
Liam: Nothing hinky with it?
Matt: Nothing hinky, no traps.
Sam: Let's go down to the secret path. We're in a hurry now, we've got to get into the city.
Taliesin: Oh, I show Kashaw the cask, by the way. I have some powdered death, if you like. This will explode very loudly.
Will: How much damage?
Taliesin: You know, I've honestly been too nervous to ever find out. Because everybody who plays with this loses a limb eventually.
Will: Is it heavy?
Matt: You hear this faint echoing voice in the back of your head that says, "Learn from my mistakes..." (laughter)
Will: I say we bring it.
Taliesin: That's my plan.
Sam: Can I just give you a quick note? Planning Kashaw is very staccato. He's very clipped. I feel like when you're just talking normally, you're so warm and pleasant. But when you're planning, you get this voice you use that's very grating. I'm just saying, try to even out your tone. Do some breathing exercises, breathe from the diaphragm.
Will: (breathes) Let's go. (laughter)
Taliesin: To the tunnels.
Matt: All right. Grog happily takes the cask under his arm.
Laura: Don't drink that, Grog.
Matt: "Oh come on! One--"
Laura: No, none of it. No-- (laughter)
Matt: "Okay."
Mary: He could fart explosives if he did.
Sam: Matt's Grog and Matt's Trinket are very similar.
Matt: To be fair. You guys all-- single-file, because this tunnel is not very wide, it's maybe four feet wide-- you make your way through and it's a long, musty tunnel. It smells of damp earth and dust.
Laura: We need to pass out these healing potions before we get anywhere.
Liam: Well, why don't everybody bunch up for a second then?
Laura: Yeah.
Mary: Is there light in there? Do you need light, are there torches?
Matt: There is no light.
Mary: I cast Light.
Laura: All right, we have three greater healings, five regular healings, and two superiors. Who needs what?
Taliesin: I'll take a greater.
Liam: Superior, please. I'm weak as fuck.
Laura: All right, take one.
Taliesin: I'd like to take a greater as well, because I'm always far away.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: "Greater for me." Grog raises his hand.
Laura: He wants one? MATT "Please."
Laura: You want a greater or--
Matt: "Yes, please."
Laura: Okay, we have one greater left. Five regulars, so I'll pass out regulars to-- Do you need any? You, you--
Will: I should be okay with healing, but if you'd like I'll take one.
Marisha: I'm all right. I still have a couple.
Mary: I have one normal, and two greater, and one superior.
Laura: There's one superior left. Oh, you already have a superior?
Mary: I have a superior, two greater, and one normal.
Laura: Oh shit. You have a fuckton of potions!
Sam: I'll take a superior and one of them fire resistance, please.
Laura: Take the superior, Scanlan.
Sam: I need the stuff.
Laura: Zero superior and four fire potions. I'm taking one of the fire potions as well, so that's three fire potions left.
Marisha: If I could have a fire potion?
Laura: Yes, two fire potions left.
Mary: Should Pike have a fire potion?
Laura: Pike has fire resistance.
Mary: I don't know, I've only met her once.
Taliesin: I would love a fire resistance potion, if one exists.
Laura: Of course darling, whatever you need.
Will: No, I have fire-resistant plate, but I'd love a healing potion, if you have an extra.
Laura: You want to take two regulars?
Will: Sure.
Taliesin: I'll take the fire resistance. All right, one fire resistance.
Matt: As you guys are awkwardly passing this down this singular tunnel, having to almost chain it back and forth.
Marisha: I load up Grog's camelback with healing potions.
Laura: Now, the potion of invulnerability. Is there someone specific we need to give that to?
Matt: "It sounds really neat."
Sam: Why don't we give it to Grog for now?
Taliesin: Well, Grog already halves all of his damage.
Liam: Grog, if we give it to you now, you can't drink it now. Not now. You have to wait.
Taliesin: Quick rule point, if he already takes a lot of half damage, if he takes the potion, it doesn't really affect?
Laura: Does it quarter the damage?
Matt: No. He just likes being invulnerable.
Taliesin: It should go to Vax.
Liam: I didn't wanna--
Taliesin: Because you're gonna get close.
Liam: I'm gonna get up in his shit.
Taliesin: So you should take the potion. It doubles your HP, double your HP.
Liam: I just wanted you to be able to pl-- excuse me? Can I have that, Grog?
Laura: I still have it. I didn't give it to him.
Liam: Can I have that, please?
Matt: "What do you want to give me?"
Laura: You don't have it, Grog. You don't have the potion.
Matt: "Oh--"
Liam: He's holding a wood chip.
Taliesin: Where did you find a purple wood chip down here? That's, oh--
Matt: Travis just texted me saying he does not have resistance to fire, which I knew. So if anyone would like to--
Laura: Oh! Okay, well then he gets the last--
Matt: The last one is Grog. He takes it and is about to open the cork.
Laura: No, no! Grog, wait for when we start fighting Thordak.
Matt: "What can I drink?"
Laura: Some ale.
Matt: "Okay."
Sam: Use your magic canister.
Matt: (whispers) "Mayonnaise." (laughter)
Mary: I would also like to evoke Fiendish Vigor.
Sam: What's that?
Mary: Which means I can cast False Life on myself for one hour, yeah?
Matt: Yeah, yeah.
Laura: Do you do it now?
Mary: Well, we're about to go in.
Sam: It's gonna take us an hour to get to the center of the city.
Mary: All right, right before we go in, I'll hold it. Grog, give me a drink! Just one small one! Just a shot. Don't look at me like that, I just want a shot.
Matt: It's like an urn-type cask, and he holds it over to you, and it's just filled with mayonnaise.
Mary: Ah-- It's so delicious, thank you so much. No, all right.
Matt: "Sour, isn't it?"
Taliesin: Sweet, bitter, angry.
Mary: It's good. It's only four or five days old.
Will: You pull out your whiskey, but Kash is already naked. (laughter)
Taliesin: I hand the bottle to Kash.
Sam: Let's go!
Laura: I'm gonna give-- I don't know if Pike has any healing potions, so I'm gonna give her a regular healing potion just for something.
Marisha: We're going out like we came in!
Liam: We're in a little tunnel passing things up and down in a little single file.
Taliesin: Eating mayonnaise out of a jar.
Marisha: Kash, pass the trail mix. Pass it all the way back.
Mary: I smell a new sponsor!
Taliesin: Mayonnaise?
Matt: You guys eventually find your way towards the end of the tunnel that leads to the ladder that leads you into the alleyway on the outskirts of the southern edge of Emon. You make your way up-- Well, it leads you through an outhouse, an alley. You've been here before.
Liam: I'm gonna, yes, I'm gonna peek through the pooper first. Let's see what I see.
Matt: Perception check.
Liam: Yeah. Okay, that's fine.
Laura: We know where the entrance to the tunnels are, though.
Liam: I'm just looking for anything unexpected, 27.
Matt: It is empty and still chained.
Liam: Are there poos?
Matt: No. It is chained shut for that reason.
Liam: It's clear.
Sam: Should I-- Before we go out there, should I Seeming us as lizard people? Yes?
Laura: Can you do it to all of us?
Sam: I can do eight. Wait, is that right?
Marisha: Do we? What time is it? What time of day is it?
Matt: It's maybe like, at this time? After travelling this far in Emon, you're maybe 40 minutes from sunset.
Sam: Want to be lizard people or no?
Will: Has the storm hit?
Matt: The storm is getting closer.
Taliesin: I think that we will not act like lizard people, and also anybody who can see through, there are like--
Laura: Lizard people can't see through that.
Taliesin: They are idiots. But they also--
Sam: All we need is a second to get some confusion.
Taliesin: They're used to seeing humans, though, and as long as we scatter and are fearful they'll--
Matt: "I don't mind being invisible. That's not an issue. Meaning I can make a number of us invisible if you want to go--"
Laura: How many can you?
Matt: "Not all of you, obviously! But like, if some of you wanna go as lizardfolk or somebody else can--"
Laura: I want to be invisible!
Liam: Invisible, please.
Sam: You've got a ring that makes you invisible!
Liam: I'm busy with other things. Also, it's maybe time for another Feast? Isn't it?
Taliesin: We're still good, I think.
Liam: It's about sundown. When we did it last-- We did it before beddie-bye.
Sam: But that takes an hour, we're not gonna sit here in the sewer eating a fucking--
Liam: We cannot fucking fight Thordak without a Heroes' Feast.
Marisha: How long has it been? Is it almost up?
Will: 40 minutes until battle.
Matt: Well, I mean, you guys-- It's about 40 minutes until sundown.
Sam: We don't have time.
Laura: Can we eat a really fast feast?
Taliesin: McFeast.
Marisha: When did we eat the feast last night? About this time? Are we about to expire or can we push it? Was it a midnight snack?
Matt: You guys would choose the most optimal time, since there was no rush to eat the feast.
Laura: Yes! We would have.
Matt: You would have been like, well shit, let's do it at 6:00 because we're fighting-- That's probably when you guys would've. So you probably have until the end of the evening.
Liam: Three or four hours-ish.
Matt: There would have been no benefit to doing it earlier.
Taliesin: This is going to be over before that. These things move quickly.
Sam: Am I turning us into lizard people?
Laura: Some of us, but I'm invisible because of Gilmore.
Marisha: Are we making an above-ground jump to the underground tunnels again?
Will: Someone knows where they're going, right?
Mary: Where's the Clasp? Are we going to meet up with them at some point?
Taliesin: Once we're down there, they'll know we're here.
Marisha: How far is the tunnel jump? How long do we have to be above ground? I'm asking because I might be able to make some holes in the wall to cut us into other tunnels and not have to go above ground at all.
Matt: When you recall Garthok leading you through Emon to get to the Clasp entrance, you had to be above ground for probably about 20 minutes.
Marisha: 20 minutes?!
Will: That's a lifetime above ground.
Matt: A lot of it was spent slow because you guys were stealthy, jumping from alley to alley and being very stealthy. If it was a brisk pace, it could be as fast as ten.
Marisha: That was to the entrance to the Clasp, not the entrance to the sewer system, right?
Matt: Correct.
Laura: We could just pop down to a sewer. Do we see a sewer hole?
Matt: If you want to go inspect, you could look for one.
Sam: Then we have to find our way through the sewer that we don't really know how to get through. We should find the Clasp entrance.
Laura: This plan is smart. Wait, once we get to the Clasp, then we have to fucking talk to the Clasp.
Sam: Yeah, for a second.
Laura: All right.
Mary: They're going to help us, right?
Laura: It's all on Scanlan; he's very charming. Kash, don't talk when we're in there.
Will: I won't speak. Remember that time I saved your life?
Laura: It was wonderful, and I'm very grateful.
Will: No, we're good.
Laura: I'm very glad you're here, though.
Will: Thank you, that's very sweet.
Matt: "All right, are we lizarding and then invis-ing?"
Laura: Yes, and then we're going to go quickly to the Clasp entrance.
Sam: All right, I'll make us all lizard people, even the ones turning invisible.
Laura: No! I don't want to be a lizard person.
Will: Invisible lizard people!
Taliesin: We need someone who can turn invisible.
Sam: Except for myself. Myself, I'll put the Hat of Disguise on.
Matt: And you're attuning to that?
Sam: It's an attuned?!
Liam: Only if it says it. Does it say it?
Sam: Do I have it? I gave it to you.
Taliesin: And I gave it back. That was a long time ago. Years.
Sam: Fine, I'll make myself a lizard person, too.
Will: An invisible lizard person.
Liam: A little lizard person.
Mary: Sam, I can do me.
Laura: Don't waste a spell.
Mary: I'm not. It's an invocation.
Matt: Seeming affects how many people?
Sam: As many as are near me when I cast it. Any number of creatures, it says.
Matt: That is awesome! Seeming is broken!
Sam: Seeming is broken.
Taliesin: How appropriate that we're going to be underground lizard people in the city of Los Angeles.
Marisha: Yeah, it's very appropriate.
Taliesin: It is our best urban myth. The lizard people of Los Angeles.
Will: That's not a myth. I have a friend who knows somebody who saw one.
Taliesin: That's true!
Sam: I make them all very skinny, not-well-nourished lizard people. Except for me. I'm pretty big.
Matt: You now have a cluster. As Gilmore begins his incantation for the Invisibility spell for him, Vax, and Vex, you guys all watch as each of your forms become these emaciated lizardfolk, except for Scanlan, who is this much shorter, but Wolverine-stocky-looking lizardman.
Sam: It's a glandular problem.
Mary: It's the mayonnaise.
Matt: You hear Gilmore chuckle mid-incantation. (chanting) "You're ridiculous." (chanting) He finishes the incantation, and Gilmore, Vex, and Vax vanish.
Liam: Can't see us, motherfucker!
Taliesin: I suppose the invisible people will lead the way.
Sam: Let's go!
Will: Who knows where they're going?
Laura: We do; we all followed Garthok.
Will: Okay. Can we see the invisible people?
Matt: No.
Will: Then how the fuck are we going to follow you?
Taliesin: We also know.
Matt: You guys begin to make your way through, out of the alley--
Laura: I tug on Kash's little braid behind him.
Will: Aw, come on! I hate that.
Matt: You guys make your way into the street, out of the alleyway. It doesn't take you long to find an entrance to the sewer. You do occasionally hear the distant, ominous (wing flapping) of a wyvern rider or two doing a pass over this portion of the city. A lot of the buildings on the outskirts have been damaged even further from last time you were here. A number of the buildings have doors torn off the hinges, signs of struggle on the outside. It takes you only a couple of minutes before you find a grate, a drainage runoff for rain in the city that leads into a subterranean sewer system. It is a little bit out in the open. It's between two buildings, but right on the cusp of the street itself, so you'll have to be quick about it.
Mary: Let's go.
Will: Who's opening it?
Liam: I am.
Taliesin: Invisible person opens it and then somebody invisible keeps watch.
Laura: I'm keeping watch.
Liam: I'm checking for traps, just in case. Natural 20.
Matt: That grate is so not trapped, like, holy shit.
Liam: It's brand new.
Matt: No one's ever trapped it, yeah, man. You could sell that. Like it was day one.
Liam: I lick it. There's nothing; it tastes clean.
Matt: No, it tastes sweet, actually!
Liam: All right. Is it locked?
Matt: It's not locked. It's wedged a little bit in there.
Laura: Grog, help! Lift!
Will: Quietly!
Laura: Stealthily.
Matt: "Okay! Shh!" He walks over and reaches. As you're down there, he walks over, not seeing you, reaches on each side of you to get to the grate. Are you going to try to get out of the way?
Liam: Yeah, I'll roll out of there. It seemed like you had a little story you wanted to tell. Yeah, I roll out of there.
Matt: You dart out just as he lifts it off. You hear the creaking of metal, the bars bend slightly as the strength imparted by the Titanstone Gauntlets cause him to easily pry this thing off the ground. You can see there is a somewhat eroded ladder, set of rungs, but it is functional.
Liam: How far down, with darkvision?
Matt: About 20 feet. It seems to open into a chamber or sewer system.
Liam: I spank him on the ass and say  I'm going in, follow me. I drop in.
Laura: Wait, Grog! Put the grate down very quietly! I whisper in his ear.
Liam: On tiptoes. Standing on his knee.
Matt: You guys all head down there with Pike in tow, Gilmore following, invisible.
Laura: Once we're down in there, I bamf Trinket out of the necklace.
Mary: I use Beast Speech. How are you, Trinket? It's been a long time.
Matt: "Yes. I'm scared."
Mary: Don't worry. You know Vex loves you very much.
Matt: "It's why I'm here."
Laura: I love you very much.
Mary: We'll look out for you, darling, we will. Thank you for coming and helping us. Thank you.
Laura: And for being such a badass!
Matt: (grunts) "Smells weird."
Mary: Kiss him on his--
Matt: It's cold. It's damp.
Mary: I love him.
Matt: You guys continue up the sewer system. It's been a dry spell for a month, at least. It hasn't rained in the past couple of weeks. It rains fairly often here, so the system itself doesn't have a lot of drainage going through. That'll change soon, I'm sure.
Liam: I'm 40 feet ahead the whole time.
Matt: Make a perception check.
Liam: 22.
Matt: Okay. About ten more minutes into travel, you're starting to get fairly close to game time, when things begin. You do hear some whispers up ahead.
Liam: Hold on. Vex.
Matt: It sounds like four different voices are all conversing.
Laura: I creep up next to him.
Liam: In one location?
Matt: A little ways ahead, out of sight. You're not sure of the source; it's echoing from ahead.
Liam: Listen with me.
Laura: What are they saying?
Matt: Roll a perception check.
Laura: I'm going to roll the Critical Role dice. Oh man! Oh good, that was good!
Will: There was a second where you thought it wasn't going to be good!
Laura: Where's my piece of paper? Perception. That is a 28.
Matt: So while you hear the whispers, it's too distant for you, Vax, to make out the details. Vex, as you hone in your ranger attentiveness, you've studied lip-movement, you've read lips so much to the point where any dis-enunciation, you can fill in the gaps. The conversation sounds like, bits are talking about the relocation of people, timing, "it's too dangerous," "we have to move further west," "the tunnels are down," "now now now," and you hear a bunch of footfalls.
Laura: Running away from us?
Matt: Running in a direction, you can't make out if it's towards or away, right now in this moment.
Liam: Do we pop out now and talk to them?
Matt: You now see what looks to be seven figures step into the center of the walkway where you are, walking away from you, in the direction you were traveling.
Will: Is anybody still invisible and/or lizards?
Matt: You are all still lizards and three of you are invisible.
Laura: And they're heading towards us?
Matt: They're heading away from you, in the direction you were going.
Laura: Okay.
Liam: Wait if I go?
Laura: They hate you.
Liam: Wait.
Matt: Three of them stop and turn, "Wait, shh!" It's really quiet, they've all just stopped.
Laura: Are you true to Emon?
Matt: Stillness, no movement. One of them goes and pulls a blade out very quietly.
Liam: I used to be one of you. I used to be Clasp.
Laura: And then I took an arrow to the knee. (laughter)
Taliesin: That may be the funniest that's ever been.
Liam: So fucking meta. (laughter)
Taliesin: Joke has been waiting for years.
Marisha: Yeah, what's up, 2014!
Laura: Remastered!
Matt: You made it funny again!
Liam: She's in the game.
Sam: Are you invisible?
Laura: Yeah, we're still invisible.
Taliesin: We're friends of Garthak.
Laura: Garthok?
Taliesin: Garthok.
Laura: You're invisible, and you're far back.
Matt: Also, all the figures that were stopped are slowly crawling in your direction. And one of them goes, "It's lizardmen. Turn away."
Laura: It's not lizardmen. Magic.
Liam: It's a ruse.
Matt: Make a persuasion check, with disadvantage.
Laura: Oh no!
Matt: Because you're two voices coming out of the ether right now! They just see a cluster of lizards in the shadows and voices going, "No, we're okay!" (laughter)
Will: "We're not lizards!"
Matt: "Don't worry, guys!"
Laura: I rolled a 20, and a one.
Marisha: Shut up.
Liam: Also one.
Marisha: You also rolled a one?! You both rolled fucking ones?
Liam: "Cacaw, look over here!"
Matt: The one in the front goes, "Shit! We have to close it! Run, run!" And all seven just start running in the direction they were going.
Laura: Oh, fuck, what do we do? Somebody--
Mary: I go running up! Wait!
Laura: Drop Seeming, drop Seeming! Drop Seeming, Scanlan!
Liam: I'm running after them.
Sam: Okay, okay! I'm dropping Seeming.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Please, wait! We're not lizardmen.
Sam: You're still invisible.
Will: We're not lizardmen!
Mary: Please, wait! Please, do not be afraid. We are with you.
Sam: Oh, sorry, you're freaky-looking, so-- (laughter)
Mary: I understand that! I'm not a lizard person, and I have a very high persuasion!
Matt: You do. Double ones is a rough situation. They have bolted very quickly, and they are not showing any sign of slowing, and you just hear the footprints go (stepping sounds).
Laura: Shit.
Mary: Shit.
Marisha: Move fast.
Will: We can't catch them?
Matt: Well, you're keeping in pace. So, if you guys full bore, double dashing--
Mary: How far away are they?
Matt: They're beyond your visual sight right now in the darkness.
Mary: Are they more than 30 feet?
Matt: Yes, they are.
Liam: I shout out after them, I know Garthok, he'll recognize me!
Marisha: He also kind of hates us, I think.
Liam: Don't care.
Matt: The, mm... Double one, man.
Liam: Okay. Okay.
Matt: Yeah. No, they're still running. They're still running.
Laura: We're still running after them.
Matt: Okay. You guys follow them for the next ten minutes or so, and you're roughly ten minutes from sundown, game time, before you hear a door slam ahead of you.
Liam: I want to move to that door.
Marisha: I immediately stop and start looking behind me. Does this look like we just ran into a trap?
Matt: Make a perception check. Well, this would be more of an investigation.
Liam: Are they catching up behind?
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: Okay. 21 total.
Liam: I'm checking the door, too.
Matt: Okay. Looking around, it's hard to see. The sewer has slowly given way to a non-sewage tunnel system that looks like it has existed for a long time. This is reminiscent of some elements of the Clasp's tunnel system that you've seen before, though you haven't really been to it this far south in the city.
Marisha: Okay. I stand back before I run in with the rest of them. I don't want to get us all in a corridor.
Mary: Can we investigate the door?
Liam: I rolled a 28.
Matt: He's currently doing that right now. You rolled a 20?
Laura: I like that you're talking to Matt through the earring.
Liam: I'm not talking to Matt, I'm-- (laughter)
Liam: Laura Bailey, busting my balls since 2000 and something, every chance she gets. But she "loves me with all her heart!" (laughter)
Liam: Don't touch me! 28! Support you left and right, and this is the thanks I get?
Matt: The door is locked, and the door is trapped.
Liam: Scanlan. Will you come up here, please? I've got my hand on my earlobe for a fucking reason.
Sam: I'm here, what do you need?
Liam: I need you to talk us into this fucking doorway.
Sam: For what, are we still trying to get this Clasp? Ten minutes has gone by. All right, great.
Liam: Talk to the fuckers on the other side of this door. You can talk to anybody.
Sam: I knock, knock, knock on the door. And I say, oi, I know you can hear me in there. Sorry for the scare. We're friends, and we're here to help you get a lot of gold.
Matt: Make a persuasion check with disadvantage.
Sam: Because it's through a door.
Matt: And because they--
Marisha: Because we're assholes.
Taliesin: You should try and sell them drugs. I think that would go well.
Laura: Oh, sell them drugs!
Sam: 28.
Matt: I can guarantee you, they don't have any.
Taliesin: No, he's got them, he can sell them off.
Matt: They're the Clasp.
Liam: They're straight-edge, I know.
Matt: Oh, totally.
Will: You still don't know if you put it up your ass or smoke it. How are you gonna sell it?
Sam: I'll find out from them.
Matt: There's a pause, and then a voice comes through and says, "So. Who are you? What do you want? What leaves you the possibility of wandering these sewers unstabbed?"
Sam: First of all, you, or members of your organization, know us. We are from Emon. We are Emonites. Emonies? We're locals. We've traveled these sewers before, among you. And we will again tonight if you help us find our way to Thordak. We are super-powerful superheroes who are gonna kill a dragon and give you half the gold.
Laura: Half the gold? Half the gold? Holy.
Matt: There's another pause. Ten, 20 seconds. 30 seconds. Then you hear a winch go (clacking, tink). Then you hear (door opening sound) and the door just ever faintly opens, and just a single face pokes through, hood up. "So. You're allies against the dragon?"
Taliesin: Absolutely.
Matt: "How many are you?"
Sam: Well-- (laughter)
Sam: About a half dozen, let's say.
Taliesin: Twice a half a dozen.
Laura: I think 12-ish?
Sam: Ten, ten? Some are animals, some are invisible. Six to 12.
Matt: "We stand 30 strong in this room, crossbows drawn. Make no mistakes, we will be watching you. One false move, you'll all have a bolt in the back of the skull. Walk with us, we'll see if what you say is true."
Liam: I use Thieves' Cant to knock out the phrase, "No bullshit," on the door.
Matt: You see his chin move and grind for a moment.
Sam: I did that with my penis. (laughter)
Matt: Make a deception check. (laughter)
Mary: He thinks you're cute.
Sam: 20.
Matt: 20?
Laura: I like that he goes-- and it's a 20.
Matt: Yeah. (laughs) You see him go-- and slowly back away. The door opens wider, and as you enter the room, you can see there's roughly 30 people in various dark bits of dress. The Clasp had a uniform, or at least a uniform style to them, when they were within their safe space. While that still exists, all of them look tattered. They look underfed. They look sleepless. And they all look driven. And it's that cornered animal look that both is welcoming and also a little scary. And as you all walk in, they all very intently keep their eyes on you, their crossbows at their side. They're all surveying you and taking in and-- You can definitely see them accepting that you are powerful in comparison to maybe many of the others that they've encountered. And that also scares them. It would be like, 'Good. Fuck,' at the same time. And as you all walk in, in this sullen atmosphere, the one that was talking to you pulls his hood back, and you see it's a younger man, probably in his late 20s, but his face is just currently wrecked by some sort of a disease that's just scarred over.
Liam: Where is Shenn?
Matt: "You want us to take you to Shenn?"
Laura: No.
Taliesin: There's no time, to be honest.
Liam: Where is he?
Matt: (sighs) "He's probably by the volcanic pocket. Looks to me-- at least from the word on the street-- there's something going on. Something's going to be happening tonight, and the Clasp is getting ready."
Will: Yeah, we've got about ten minutes until all hell breaks loose. So if we've got to do this, we've got to do this now.
Laura: We've got to get to where Thordak is.
Mary: Is he by this volcanic surge?
Matt: "That he is. (sighs) Travel fast. Travel light. Follow me." Puts his hood back up, and goes into a run.
Will: Go running.
Mary: Naruto.
Matt: You guys all gave chase, at this point, as fast as you can. Poor Pike is like (panting).
Laura: Grog picks her up, come on!
Matt: Grog picks her up, as he does. And she's still like, running in the air before, "Whoa! Okay. Thanks." And puts her on his shoulders, and they're running together. Pike has to duck low a couple of times as she almost gets her head knocked off on the low bridge area. Following him as fast you can, it's around the corner, down low corners. He's quick. And you can see why certain people within the Clasp rise quickly, in that messenger format, is they can get around the city like that. You begin to get to a point where you see a few grates up above you, passing 20 feet up. You start to see more and more sewer openings. And you hear in the distance the sound of cracking thunder.
Mary: (whispers) The storm's coming.
Sam: As soon as we get out, Keyleth, you have to make a storm or something--
Marisha: Yeah.
Sam: Or a VM or something, right?
Laura: She can probably do it through the grates.
Sam: Okay. Hurricane.
Matt: As you continue to run, you can hear up above, too, what sounds like just the energy itself is gathering into a loud cacophony of screeches and roars. It sounds like the populace that is keeping guard over the currently ruled, tyrannically held city, the wyverns are restless. They see something happening, there's something brewing. And now, not just those below understand, but those above are starting to get the sense that things are not right. It's beginning. You begin to feel and hear bits of rainfall beginning to come through the grates, just up ahead. The little bit of light that peeks through, you can see the droplets now hitting as you run past, overhead. You hear another bolt of lightning and thunder in the distance. And another (lightning crack). The storm is getting faster and more successive and it's definitely landed in Emon. You continue to push forward--
Mary: How far are we?
Matt: You shouting ahead of--?
Mary: How much longer?
Matt: "You feel that?"
Mary: Yes.
Matt: "No. Do you feel that?" And you start to realize, as cold as it is up there, as it has been in the past, these tunnels are growing warmer, and warmer, and warmer. "We're not far now." And he's still running.
Laura: As I'm running, I'm dipping arrows in poison.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: I've got six.
Matt: Okay. So go ahead and mark those--
Laura: Six vials of poison. So that makes six arrows or does that make--?
Matt: Each vial can make three poisoned arrows.
Laura: Three? However many I can make during this amount of time. Because I know it only lasts for an hour. So on the tips.
Matt: So per vial is three hours.
Laura: Awesome!
Matt: It's hard to do while running at this fast pace, so I'd say you could get maybe two vials done, to be honest. Because in order to keep up, it's a full sprint. You're racing against time for this. It's like, running as hard as you can, and like-- (laughter)
Matt: It's a little hard.
Laura: It's one of those things I meant to do earlier.
Sam: Just got to finish knitting this sweater. (laughter)
Matt: Eventually, you begin watching as these tunnels, you see collapsed portions of it. You see the falling rocks that are gathered. You feel the air itself become humid, become temperate and uncomfortably warm. The sweat begins to drip down your brow, and what you recall being the dry heat of the Marquet deserts is now being matched or exceeded by the wet, damp, humid underground air of the subterranean tunnels of Emon. You dart around the corner and follow him around this curve, and it's the first time you see a break in the rock, where a vibrant, bright orange stream of molten rock is now pouring down, past into some basin below the walkway. And you see him more carefully walk around it. And now this pathway has gone from an original Clasp tunnel to, essentially, a haphazardly carved or left over and barely functional tunnel that has been wrecked by this slow incursion of volcanic activity. You have about two more minutes of running before he comes to a stop. And you hear now, what initially was just the rousing of local lizard creatures and denizens of Emon, the now-ruling class, the lightning is every few seconds. And you hear one loud, ominous, rumbling roar echo through the sky. And it's a familiar roar. You heard it once, before the fall of Emon. The storm has awakened, or at least got the attention of the beast, the tyrant that now resides over the city of Emon. And he is not that far from where you stand. The young man pulls his hood back again and points up, and you can see that there's one tunnel that leads up out of the sewer. Part of it is jutting outward, and it's a slippery pouring of rain now just gliding off of it and slopping into mud on the ground. Most of the rungs have been rent off or fallen through the erosion, or the impression of this tectonic shift in this localized area. He points up. "This is the closest I can get you but I don't know how you want to climb. Good luck." And he turns around and darts back where you guys came from.
Mary: So he's guiding us up and out?
Matt: No, he's gone.
Sam: We've got to get up. So wait, there's a pipe to climb up?
Matt: It's a three-, four-foot-wide tunnel. It used to go straight up, but now parts of it are (ground cracks). It's a little crooked and some of the initial climbing rungs have eroded away.
Laura: Can we parkour up?
Matt: Certainly. Go ahead and make acrobatics checks, both of you guys.
Mary: Can Grog throw us up?
Marisha: Is there a grate ahead of us? Can I see the sky?
Matt: There is, but it doesn't-- it looks partially off.
Liam: 33.
Laura: 34.
Matt: Both of you guys, in a networked-twin-type near-ballet in its execution, darting up in tandem, both using each other to push off as you hit each edge, you make your way to the very top in this crisscross fashion, then one of you gets up just in time to hit the grate as the other one hits the other side, sending it onto the ground outside.
Liam: Perception check. For anything nearby.
Laura: By the way, I was totally going to say I was putting Trinket back in the necklace before you started saying all that, I was just-- It went into it right away.
Matt: Okay. Not a worry. Trinket is in the necklace.
Liam: 29.
Laura: Oh, I want to perception check too. Just because, you know, that 29 isn't going to see everything.
Liam: No, you've got to get 30, right?
Laura: Yeah. No, this is a 23. So-- (laughter)
Matt: You guys both look out. You, Vex, looking around you, you can see you are in the street. And you can see there are a number of buildings around: single-story, second-story, some of them long-collapsed and burned. Some still have flames on them that the rain is attempting to put out, but the fire is fighting back. You, Vax, see the same spread, and off to the left of you, a familiar sight. The Cloudtop District wall and gates, maybe a couple hundred feet off from your current position. You can see beyond that just a singular, black column of smoke, with the occasional flicker of red embers just drifting up through, fighting against the storm itself. The rain may fall, but it doesn't seem to last long enough to hit the ground of the Cloudtop. You see mist and steam begin to rise up; the rain is evaporating before it can even get close. You also see above the gate what looks to be a few dozen small, dark shapes. You take a moment to focus before you can see what looks to be-- what were once people are now blackened husks that have been left up on chains; decoration, if you will, for the outside of the Cloudtop. It's a warning, or a celebration of Thordak's rule. You see, on the outside of that gate, two large, armored, alert fire giants, wielding long, thick, square, black metal blades that themselves have flames engulfing. And they are both standing there, just shoulder to shoulder, looking about, on high alert based on the current chaos of the circumstance.
Liam: What's between us and them?
Matt: It's road. It's just bare road. You have buildings to each side, you're just now emerging from the alleyway, and you are in the center of the street right now.
Liam: How far are they from us right now?
Matt: They're a little over a hundred feet.
Sam: Two fire giants?
Laura: Yeah.
Liam: I pull Vex out of view--
Laura: I mean, we're invisible.
Liam: I know, I don't want to be heard. We've got two fucking giants up here, guarding our path--
Laura: About a hundred feet off, clear view.
Sam: There's no more tunnel down here, right?
Matt: No, it goes for another five or six feet, and then it is just wrecked, it's collapsed, ruined--
Sam: We cannot spend our energy fighting these guys. We have to distract them away and move in past their position.
Marisha: I can conjure an elemental. Will it--?
Sam: And one of them will chase it.
Laura: Is it possible to get up and over the wall, away from them?
Liam: Three of us are invisible, but not the rest. How do we get by?
Sam: Is there a gate behind the line?
Will: Can we hear this conversation?
Sam: You can hear half of it.
Taliesin: Two fire giants guarding the gates. We have to get rid of them.
Will: Can we get into a building on the other side?
Taliesin: It's just a wall, it's defensive. We can get over the wall, perhaps.
Marisha: What kind of wall is it?
Sam: 30 feet high?
Matt: It is about roughly 30, 35 feet.
Laura: Can I peek my head out--?
Matt: Oh! It is a solid, thick, stone wall. It is designed as a second-tier defense from siege warfare against the palace and the--
Marisha: Can I use Stoneshape to stoneshape us a hole through it?
Matt: You know that it's pretty thick. You're familiar with the wall. You guys have traveled to and from the Cloudtop before. Let me see, where's Stoneshape--
Liam: Extend the tunnel?
Laura: Or I can fly up to the top of the wall and drop the rope down?
Marisha: The problem is, I don't know how far the tunnel has collapsed.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: No more than five feet in any dimension. No, it's thicker than that.
Mary: Where do you need to go beyond this?
Sam: In there.
Marisha: I took-- Okay, here's the thing  I took Move Earth. I can try and tunnel us through. But that's a pretty big spell.
Laura: Well, what if--
Matt: Move Earth also takes a while.
Laura: What if I come out, I fly, I move down away from the fire giants, I fly up to the top of the wall and drop the rope down? So everybody can climb up?
Liam: But nobody's invisible but ourselves.
Will: It's too much of a chance, they're going to see you.
Mary: They're going to see you. How far away are we from them?
Matt: You're about a hundred feet.
Sam: I can make another three of us invisible. But that's still not enough.
Marisha: Do fire giants have any reason to attack lizard people?
Matt: You don't know.
Laura: Maybe make lizard people and then pop over--
Sam: I've just burned a 5th-level spell making us lizard people once for no fucking reason.
Liam: And that's dropped at this point?
Sam: Yeah.
Mary: You need a distraction.
Sam: We definitely do.
Mary: Let us do this.
Sam: You two?
Will: Two of us have to stay.
Mary: Let us do this.
Laura: What?!
Mary: Let. Us. Do. This.
Will: We don't have any time.
Marisha: We need you guys. We need-- we need you.
Mary: You can do this without us.
Sam: Are you going to go out and draw them away?
Mary: We'll try and meet you if we can. In the meantime, call your people. Do it now.
Sam: Absolutely.
Mary: I cast-- I invoke-- I use a cantrip Mask of Many Faces. As a lizard person, I go ten feet so I'm within 90 feet, and I cast Evard's Black Tentacles on the two fire giants.
Taliesin: You've got to go out the tunnel first.
Marisha: I grab Kash by the arm really fast, and I just say, thank you. And I give him a kiss on the cheek.
Will: We're way past that.
Marisha: Just shut up and appreciate it! Go!
Mary: Before I go running out, I grab Vex. I love you, if I can find you, I will. If not, stay alive.
Will: I grab Vax real quick. Hey!
Liam: Yeah?
Will: Two things.
Liam: What's that?
Will: First  it's one-one. And second  don't get us all dead.
Liam: All right, cutie.
Will: Good luck in battle.
Mary: So I go running out. Lizard face. Once I get out of the tunnel, Mask of Many Faces, lizard. I just go walking up. Within 90 feet, I cast Evard's Black Tentacles, hoping to hold them.
Matt: Okay. As she's doing this, anyone else doing anything else? Are you--?
Sam: I put on Gloves of Climbing to climb up the thing.
Taliesin: Spiderwalk.
Will: Kash just stands with his back to them, guarding them as they're going up the wall, spear at the ready.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Are you brooming it? I'm holding onto the broom.
Matt: Okay. You guys go up there.
Laura: I drop the rope down so Grog and Pike and everybody else can go up.
Matt: Easy enough. You all eventually get your way up to the top and duck in an alley. I need you to roll stealth checks.
Taliesin: We still have that--
Laura: Pass Without a Trace that I cast? Yeah--
Matt: All of you would, since it hasn't expired. It's an hour concentration.
Sam: 27.
Laura: Can I cast it again?
Matt: No, I mean it's still on. It's an hour concentration. It'll last until--
Taliesin: 21.
Matt: Well actually, you cast it right before you guys got to the keep, right?
Laura: Right, at the keep.
Matt: No, no-- Yeah, so you do not have it currently. I'm sorry.
Marisha: 18.
Taliesin: 11.
Laura: Do we get advantage because we're invisible?
Matt: The invisible folks do, yeah.
Laura: Ah okay, good.
Will: (chuckles) Invisible folks.
Liam: 31.
Laura: 21.
Sam: 27.
Matt: All right. And-- okay. You guys manage to dart up-- you notice-- First off, the wyverns are now coasting by and scooting over the sky, in groups of ten at a time. And you can see now as the bolts of energy are starting to hit-- Off in the distance, you see a flash and (lighting strikes) as one gets taken down by a bolt of lightning. The wind is now picking up and beginning to swirl. You watch as they're having a hard time flying and being harried by the elements, just darting around and slamming into them. One of the fire giants sees movement over in your direction (speaks in Giant), and starts walking that way as you begin to emerge in your lizard-person form.
Sam: Can I quietly inspire Kash?
Matt: You can if you like.
Sam: (singing) Kash! King of the Universe! Kash! Ah-ah! He is the best of us!
Will: (singing) And his hair was parted in the middle-- (laughter)
Matt: Take your d12 inspiration die.
Will: Where's my d12?
Mary: You just hold on to it.
Will: My gosh-- Oh! Yeah, I'm just holding it. (laughter)
Matt: So, as you walk forward and lift your hands up, clutching the staff, you watch as these black ethereal tentacles burst out of the ground, slam into the ground, and attempt to wrap around the legs and lower body of these giants. What is your spell DC?
Sam: It's been a while since she's played, guys.
Mary: 18.
Matt: 18, all right. The fire giant-- oh! Nope! A two and a three on their dex save. (cheering)
Matt: All right. Yeah, so they're both restrained and they take 3d6 bludgeoning damage, if you want to go ahead and roll that.
Mary: 3d6? They're restrained! And it's 3d6 bludgeoning damage, which is ten.
Sam: Both of them? You just restrained two fire giants?! Holy shit!
Taliesin: Ten is on the good side of 3d6--
Matt: You watch as it pulls them back, their swords are held at bay, their wrists are bound by these tentacles, and both of them are being crushed by it. And the other one-- No one here speaks Giant, except for Grog.
Will: I speak Giant.
Matt: You do?
Matt: You and Grog hear it, and it just says, "Under attack!" in Giant. And as they're both being held there, as you're holding them in place, they take the damage. What are the rest of you guys doing?
Marisha: I immediately, right above us, create a little eye-of-the-hurricane. And you know when it snows and there's a moonbow? A rainbow? I do a little bit of a moonbow situation.
Laura: Okay, are we trying to keep stealthed and then letting Zarah and Kash--
Sam: I think we just go.
Taliesin: We're going to pass them.
Marisha: And then we run!
Matt: Okay. You guys all bolt towards the-- there's a 15-foot gap between these two giants right now. And you're rushing across this, like a double-dash, you get just to them as it comes to their go.
Laura: I thought we were up and over the wall.
Sam: No, no. We were out of the pipe.
Laura: I understand.
Matt: Yes. At this point, as Keyleth runs and creates this moonbow in this clearing in the sky, the wind suddenly doubles in speed in the air, the bolts come down at twice the pace. You watch as rooftops are exploding. You see wyverns being struck and thrown to the ground. You see small funnel clouds begin to form in portions of the city, as the cloud itself is beginning to draw. And you start seeing a similar dark speck to what you saw in the sky before, coming to land before you-- You see distant skysails flickering in and out of the storm, control over this. As this is happening, as you guys are running with that symbol, you hear far to the left a large explosion sound in the distance. It sounded like an impact against a wall. You get the sense that it has begun. You guys rush up to the edge of the door just as the two giants are going to attempt to break free from the tentacles. That is dexterity. Strength or dexterity check against your save DC. So that's going to be helpful, so strength is much better than the dex. Not with a three! Or a seven. I'm rolling as bad as I did on--
Mary: Stay right where you are, boys!
Matt: Both of them just still locked in place. They both try desperately, staring down at you and growling, you can see the strain as the tentacles are pulling on them, their swords burning--
Mary: Welcome to hentai! (laughter)
Matt: --and you're keeping guard there, at the ready. What are you guys doing? You're at the door now.
Sam: Grog! Can Grog punch through it? I don't--
Matt: "Yes, I can!" And he goes for a full swing against the door-- Yeah! Oh, man! Okay.
Liam: (in Grog's voice) Surprise, gents!
Matt: Basically. So that's double-damage with Siege to the door. Yeah. That is just with his fist, not even using his axe, just his fist against the door. The first hit, he dealt 26 points of bludgeoning damage. For the second strike, he brings up the axe now, as he dented it inward, and swings with it. Ooh! That's 32 points of damage to the door. You watch as the fist slams between the doors, and they're large, large, heavy wooden doors you're very familiar with that have metal reinforcements on them on this part of the gate. The fist slam causes them to shudder at the impact and shake, but the chains still holding them in the inside are taut. The axe comes by. As it hits the edge of the wood and the iron, the wood splinters, the iron bends, and the hinges actually (impact) off of one, and the gate slams off the side, off the top hinge, and you all have to try to dart out of the way as it swings past. Oh, man! It's not quite big enough to hit all of you, and I would say the ones that're at the front line would probably be the twins and probably Keyleth. You'd want to stick with them. Well, you'd be back because of the storm cloud-- Yeah. And Grog, definitely. So the twins and Grog, I need you guys to make a dexterity saving throw. Natural 20 for Grog! (cheering)
Liam: Would Evasion work for this?
Laura: 28.
Liam: That's a dex save. All right, it's just 20 with me.
Matt: Okay, it's fine. You guys all duck out of the way as soon as the door slams into the mud to the side, the giants still restrained. You all begin to charge into the space without thinking. As soon as the opening's there, you dart in as the giants are restrained. And you guys, what are you doing at this point? The giants aren't going to be held for long.
Mary: Kash?
Will: Can I cast Geas on one and have one attack the other?
Mary: Swing away, Kash.
Will: Am I allowed to take control of one of them?
Matt: Oh, I will see what the-- casting time is one minute. So that's ten rounds that you have to cast that spell-- It's not much of a combat spell, really.
Will: Because they're flame giants, right? Does a Flame Strike work on them? Or are they susceptible to flames, or no?
Matt: That is up to what you might expect.
Will: Then let's give it a try. We're going to try to do a 5th-level Flame Strike and see what happens.
Matt: All righty! Go ahead and roll 4d6 radiant damage. Both restrained, so they have disadvantage on the save. Yeah, no.
Will: I also still have my inspiration, too.
Sam: It won't help here.
Will: I know. Okay, it's okay. Yeah-- well, no. It's awful, I-- It's 13. Yeah. 13
Matt: All right. They both take 13 points of damage. They take no fire damage, they're both immune to fire. The flames do nothing, but the radiant burst in itself does singe the exterior of their bodies. You see them rock with pain as the blast of light, a column that shoots at them, bursts into them, has taken effect. Not as much as you would have wanted, but an effect nonetheless. You, who are still maintaining concentration on this spell, what do you want to do?
Mary: What is the radius of Witchbolt? If I drop Evard's and hit-- they're 15 feet apart from each other?
Matt: They're 15 feet apart from each other, yes.
Mary: I just don't know what the radius of Witchbolt is. Can I hit both of them with it?
Matt: With Witchbolt? With Witchbolt, as a--
Taliesin: You'd need a ten-foot radius to hit both of them.
Matt: It's going to be a tough call. Let me see-- Witchbolt-- No, no. Witchbolt hits one creature.
Mary: Only hits one creature?
Matt: Yeah. You can still maintain a concentration spell and do instant spells, if you wanted to.
Mary: Yes! So then I will hold Evard's Black Tentacles and use a cantrip of Eldritch Blast and Agonizing Blast? Can I do that?
Matt: Yeah, it's part of the ability. So, yeah, you can do that. Make three spell attack rolls.
Sam: Three spells?! She's so powerful!
Matt: It's all against one guy or it's--? How are you splitting it up?
Mary: I'm going to hit two on the left, one on the right.
Matt: Two on the left, one on the right. Okay. Go for it.
Matt: Your spell attack bonus is--?
Mary: Plus 12, so 15. Plus Agonizing Blast--
Matt: That only adds to damage.
Mary: 15.
Matt: So the first one you fire at? It arcs past and hits the door behind, hitting the where the already damaged door fell off the hinges.
Mary: It's 20--
Matt: That hits. Go ahead and roll-- So you've hit one, now roll for hitting the other.
Mary: Oh, natural 20.
Matt: Okay! So go ahead and your roll damage on that. Roll your d10 plus seven. What's the first one?
Laura: 2d10?
Matt: No, it's 1d10 for the first roll, next one is the critical.
Mary: That's a ten.
Matt: And roll one more time.
Mary: Plus my charisma?
Matt: Correct. Add that in there. So go ahead and roll for your critical now.
Mary: Six. Plus my charisma, which is eleven, right?
Matt: Great! So you blast both of them and they're still held in place. You guys run past. They're both taking hits from Zahra, but they're both more focused on the people that are being led through the gate they were ordered to watch. And--
Liam: How far are the twins from the giant?
Matt: You guys just ran through into the--
Liam: Right through?
Laura: We want to take sneak attacks on both of them.
Matt: Go for it. And five and a seven, they cannot make their checks for shit.
Laura: First one hits. And then 21, does that hit?
Matt: Hits.
Laura: Okay, do I get three attacks-- oh, no, no, no, I'm not clicking the boots yet.
Liam: 21. So 21 hits?
Matt: 21 hits, yeah.
Laura: Augh, what's happening?!
Liam: Okay, so the first one was-- All the dice, all the dice.
Laura: So, 15 for the first hit. 22 for the second.
Liam: 36 for my first, and eight for my second.
Laura: And just keep running.
Matt: And keep running, okay. All right, so you guys lob those attacks as you're rushing past, you guys see-- actually, both of you guys roll perception checks.
Will: 14.
Mary: 12.
Matt: 12. You just make it-- you, Kashaw, out of the corner of your eye, you notice the buildings that were on fire, the flames that were burning amidst the storm, you watch as one of the flames leaps out of the house. And a number of other flames begin to rise up as living, flaming entities that are making their way towards you. And you can quickly see that this is about to become--
Will: Awesome.
Matt: --awesome. (laughter)
Matt: But as you see Vox Machina running into the Cloudtop District and disappearing into the surrounding clouds and fume.
Will: May the gods be with you.
Liam: Totally minor, I didn't add my regular bonus for dex and all that, so add another eight to my damage.
Matt: Okay, got it.
Mary: So they're leaving.
Matt: You got them in.
Mary: Go! Go! We'll find you if we can! In the meantime, my love, shall we have some fun?
Will: Let's do this thing, baby!
Mary: Yeah!
Matt: You guys hear the distant sounds of battle conflict inside the wall and far beyond. You hear, in the distance, the weird, vibrating fuzzy echo of hundreds and hundreds of voices shouting in unison. The battle's upon Emon. However, that moment quickly shifts as you're walking through this volcanic fume; the air itself is sulfurous, and there are gouts of poison that spill forth from cracked earth. You can see points, little bursts of glowing, molten rock that break through the surface and pour and then cool and create these small, miniaturized volcanic spires. You can see the burned, destroyed, crumbled remnants of the buildings-- the noble houses, the beautiful mansions that used to make up the entirety of the Cloudtop District. The homes that you'd look at and think, "God, one day it'd be great to live in something as beautiful as that," reduced to ash and cinder. Your run slows as you begin to see this large crater wall that lifts up through the smoke, a lip that then vanishes over the edge where the smoke is pouring out like a thick column, a slow-moving, stationary tornado of black that pours into the sky. As you watch, two large, bulbous, scaled red arms shoot forth from the center, as one long, unfurling dragon neck rises up. You see the red crystalline brow itself, like jagged daggers of flame burst across the face as it rises up beyond the smoke. The teeth, impossibly long and pointed for something of this size. The eyes, not red, not yellow, but burning beams of pure white light, like a small sun exists in each eye. As it lifts its whole form upwards out of the hole, the wings unfurl, the wind itself pushing all the smoke out, clearing the Cloudtop for but an instant, to see its massive, swollen form. You also notice that within its chest, this large, thick scar, but no crystal. Just a large, bulbous, grown-over, thick piece of scaled scar. As it stands towering above all of you, peering over the distance, not even noticing you at the moment, surveying the chaos around in Emon, its face drops, and you hear this voice gurgle up from within. Sourceless, almost, in its immensity, in its encompassing nature, it says, "It appears that we have guests. Where are you?" And that's where we'll end tonight's episode. (cheering and screaming)
Marisha: Can we all take a nervous swig of our fire resistance potions? Like, right now? Like glug, glug, glug!
Matt: It's to the instance where, right now, there's so much going on that Thordak is having this Superman moment where he closes his eyes and hears all the screams in the city at once. So you don't know if he knows where you are yet, or has seen you, he just knows that something's here. And that's where we're going to pick up next session.
Liam: Double-fisting them, gulp gulp!
Taliesin: Smoke 'em if you got 'em! I'm going to vape-- I'm going to vape my fire resistance.
Matt: I'm pretty sure you can get that at Critical Vapes.
Taliesin: Oh yeah! You can get that there.
Mary: Critical Vapes!
Laura: Shout out!
Liam: Merry deathmas, everyone.
Taliesin: Merry deathmas.
Sam: What happens to Kash and Zahra?!
Matt: They're currently preventing you guys from having to deal with Thordak and two fire giants and a bunch of elementals.
Sam: But how do we know what happens?!
Taliesin: We don't die.
Matt: Don't die and you'll find out.
Will: The Kash and Zahra show, starting next week on Wednesdays. (laughter)
Matt: If only.
Laura: It's just a buddy cop movie.
Mary: We're in a really old Mustang the whole time.
Will: He's a little bit country; she's a little bit dragon. (laughter)
Taliesin: I would watch the fuck out of that.
Matt: Yeah, I would. Oh my god. That's the best version of Dallas I've ever heard of. Which has an RPG book.
Will: No!
Matt: Oh yeah.
Sam: You can roleplay Dallas?
Matt: Yeah! I'm trying to find a copy of it. But anyway, that's neither here nor there. We'll be here next week for the showdown with Thordak the Cinder King in the center of Emon! You guys, you avoided a lot. You beelined to Thordak.
Laura: We were out of time!
Matt: We would have gone into this next time. I was preparing for Thordak--
Mary: Always rely on tentacles.
Taliesin: If anime has taught you anything--
Matt: Don't tell the internet that.
Mary: If anime has taught us anything--
Matt: I know! No, I was expecting this Thordak encounter to either happen next week or in the first two weeks of January when we come back from the break, I wasn't sure when. You bypassed a bunch there.
Will: Great way to end the year, though.
Matt: It is a good way to end the year!
Liam: (singing) Here comes Cinder Claus, here comes Cinder Claus, right down Cinder Claus Lane!
Mary: Yeah, it's just the two of us and the fire giants!
Will: While I sit back and watch her kick some ass!
Taliesin: I thought you were dead, Fred!
Marisha: You told me they were dead!
Liam: We need Brian Blessed now!
Taliesin: We need Brian Blessed! We need Brian Blessed for everything!
Matt: I don't disagree with this.
Taliesin: He might be down.
Matt: We'll see you guys next week for this crazy showdown. Rest well, thank you Loot Crate and Magic Puzzle Quest for being our awesome sponsors for tonight's episode. Thank you all for your patience. Thank you, Will and Mary, for joining us.
Will: Thanks for having us, you kidding? Thanks for having us back.
Mary: Thank you so much!
Marisha: Thanks for sacrificing yourself. Hopefully you're not dead.
Will: It's the only show where you can walk by, "Hey, thanks, hope you're not dead."
Laura: Are we allowed to say, Brian, that they're going to be on Talks Machina?
Brian: (offscreen) Yeah!
Mary: So we're going to be on Talks Machina on Tuesday. With that Brian Foster man!
Sam: Are you going to be on Talks Machina?
Matt: I don't know.
Laura: No, we can't know his secrets just yet!
Sam: But if you were on Talks Machina, then you could do this whole fight on Talks Machina. (laughter)
Matt: I've been on a lot of Talks Machina recently, and I could probably use a Tuesday night off.
Mary: Yeah.
Will: Yeah.
Matt: Especially to prepare for this.
Laura: Plus I don't want to know any secrets before we go into this fight.
Matt: I wouldn't tell you any secrets regardless, which is why I'd be a very boring guest next week. I'd be like: I don't know. That's a great question.
Marisha: You Don't Know  The Show.
Matt: Exactly. All right, guys, thank you so much, guys. Thank you guys, have a wonderful weekend. We'll see you next Tuesday for Talks Machina and Thursday for the finale, possibly, much love and is it Thursday yet? See you soon. [music]

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit and play Dungeons and Dragons across my camera. (all laugh)
Matt: Welcome to tonight's adventure. Before we get into it, we're going to go ahead and go through our notes for sponsorship and other such glory for the evening. First and foremost, tonight, we have our fantastic returning sponsor, Lootcrate.
All: Lootcrate!
Matt: Thank you so much, Lootcrate. We have a glorious unboxing that is happening right now.
Laura: Right now!
Matt: Let's do it.
Marisha: So wait. They've changed their boxes and their logos. I don't know if you guys noticed.
Sam: I think you mean upgraded. I can't open this.
Laura: So wait, we're unboxing last month's box.
Travis: This is their 'build' theme.
Taliesin: It's the 'build' theme.
Liam: That's for building a thing, isn't it?
Marisha: Yeah!
Liam: Oh, that's cute.
Marisha: Oh, you know what? This was a bad decision. You're correct, this was a bad point of entry.
Taliesin: This was a great decision.
Travis: What did you do?
Laura: What did you do, Marisha?
Marisha: I found a perforated edge.
Matt: It's like a Batman loot container? Wait, wait, wait. Oh, slick.
Laura: You can put your soup in it!
Matt: You can put your secret keys in there. Hide it in your front yard so nobody can take it.
Sam: There's Lego stuff!
Taliesin: Oh, no there's not!
Sam: My kid's gonna love this!
Taliesin: Oh my god, I got the Spaceman. Which one did you get?
Sam: Lego Dimensions fun pack of--
Taliesin: It's what's-his-name. It's Liam Neeson.
Sam: That's Liam Neeson?
Liam: Yeah, they're all different.
Matt: I got Cyborg!
Marisha: I got Cyborg.
Matt: Yay, we have two Cyborgs for the home.
Marisha: Oh, yay. Who wants to trade me a Cyborg?
Taliesin: I'll trade you a Cyborg for a Spaceman.
Marisha: Aw, yeah.
Taliesin: Oh my god, this is actually--
Sam: Voltron?
Taliesin: No, that's Power Rangers.
Travis: We don't have to give these back, right? We can keep them?
Sam: That's not Voltron?
Taliesin: That's not Voltron, man.
Sam: I'm so stupid.
Taliesin: I know.
Laura: Did anybody show off the shirt, yet?
Sam: No.
Taliesin: Yeah, I did, but I'll show it off again. It's a really awesome Power Rangers shirt, with the classic Megazord.
Laura: That's pretty frickin' cool.
Sam: I'm pretty sure that's Voltron, guys.
Travis: Megazord!
Taliesin: Who are you gonna believe?
Laura: Wait, what size do I have?
Taliesin: Guy with the comic book show?
Laura: Hey, who's got a small?
Taliesin: I may have a small. Let me find out. This feels small.
Liam: What do you got?
Laura: I got a large.
Taliesin: I've got a large, never mind.
Marisha: There's also something that tells me that I can unlock the mysteries.
Taliesin: Oh, this is really cool, look at that.
Liam: What Lego did you get?
Marisha: Secret of the keys. Lootcrate.com/keys.
Sam: Ooh, 'How to build a tabletop RPG character'! That's very helpful.
Taliesin: You should definitely read that. You should definitely, definitely read that. Please read that. I'm not even kidding. Read that.
Laura: My favorite thing is the Batman head.
Liam: You, specifically.
Taliesin: You, read it.
Sam: I will read that.
Taliesin: Like, on the break, read it.
Sam: Okay.
Laura: Thanks, Lootcrate!
Matt: Thank you so much, Lootcrate! You're awesome, appreciate that. Sam, did you want to speak a little bit--
Sam: I just wanted to say the things that we're supposed to say, which is, our sponsor Lootcrate, this was their last month's theme, 'build'. This month's theme is 'primal', featuring brands like X-Men, Overwatch, and Predator. If you go to lootcrate.com/criticalrole and use the promo code 'criticalrole', one word, you get 10% off. I've prepared a very, very small bit tonight, because I knew we had the unboxing to do. I thought for our international audience, they might like to know how to say Lootcrate in different languages. So I did some really good research. Not five minutes on Google Translate, I'll tell you that much. In Spanish, Lootcrate is 'las ganancias cajas'. In German, it's 'der Zaster Casten'! In Japanese, it's 'senri-hin kureto'. In Latin, it's 'praedam corbis'. In Dutch, it's 'buit krat'. In Swedish, we're talking 'plundra spjällĺda'. And in Klingon, (yells in Klingon). (all cheer)
Taliesin: Good pronunciation.
Sam: Oh, and in pig latin, it's 'Am-say's ick-day is ig-bay'. All right, good.
Matt: Fantastic.
Liam: Send all your complaints care of Sam Riegel.
Matt: Thank you so much, Sam. And thank you, Lootcrate, for being our awesome sponsor. If the announcement sheet did go out today, I did not get it, so whoever put it together, if they could go find it real fast while I talk about--
Marisha: You talk!
Taliesin: I sent the announcement sheet to you.
Matt: I didn't get it in my e-mail.
Marisha: Let me find it on my--
Matt: It's okay.
Marisha: I don't know where my phone is.
Matt: I do want to give a heads-up, right now we have a giveaway happening from our pals over at Nerdist. Thanks to Qualcomm, Lion's Gate, and the new VR experience based on the upcoming Power Rangers movie, you can enter to win a paid trip to LA to attend the Power Rangers movie premiere, as well as Google Pixel phones and Daydream headsets. I don't know what Daydream headsets are, but I bet you I know what they do.
Travis: They're VR, they're the VR headset.
Matt: They give you daydreams. From now through March 10, you can go to nerdist.com/powerrangersgiveaway to learn more and enter to win, and we kinda prefer to see Critters win anything that happens here--
Travis: Yeah we do!
Matt: Because then we can stack the deck against our own people. To show those Nerdist guys what we mean here at Geek and Sundry.
Laura: What's up!
Matt: That's awesome, thank you so much for the heads-up on that. Let's see. The other announcements...
Marisha: The other announcements, I'm trying to navigate Taliesin's phone, because I don't know where my phone is, so this is just going--
Sam: Taliesin's on an iPhone 2 over there.
Marisha: This is just going great. Fuck it. We'll do it off the cuff.
Taliesin: Well no, I remember some of them.
Sam: One of them was Taliesin's announcement that he has some show on Wednesday nights.
Marisha: Wednesday Club.
Taliesin: I do. Wednesday at noon to two on this very Twitch channel, is the Wednesday Club, and this week we're gonna be talking about Image Comics, which is now about 25 years old. This is the thing, and we're gonna talk about how they started and why it's important, and then all the cool stuff they're doing today, which is some really cool stuff. Good books.
Marisha: There's also a new Signal Boost, with Stefanie Woodburn and Eric Campbell is out-- ooh, there it is. Merch! Merch. Dice. Are out of stock.
Laura: The dice are out of stock, you guys.
Marisha: Dice are out of stock.
Sam: Don't worry, we'll get like three more.
Marisha: Gilmore shirts. The Gilmore shirts are still up, along with socks, vinyl stickers, mugs, patches, bracelets, pins, hats, nail wraps, logo shirts, the disturbingly comfortable 'How do you want to do this?' t-shirt and hoodie, and more, but not really more. That's actually I think everything. (all laugh)
Marisha: I just felt like I needed a finale to that. Oh, GM Tips!
Matt: Oh, that's right! New episode of GM Tips went up today. This one is about how to design and write your own one-shot. It goes through the process of initial story design and how to prepare encounters and NPCs and be ready for a one-shot circumstance for a single-run arc. These tips can also be expanded upon to do multiple sessions or a full arc, or even a full campaign. But these are little bite-sized condensed tips, so I hope they're helpful and inspiring so people can learn a thing or two about running a one-shot or more. So check it out. Marisha, you--
Sam: Taliesin just made a robot.
Matt: That's actually pretty rad.
Taliesin: Hello.
Matt: You had an announcement, if I recall.
Marisha: Yes! I can officially announce as of yesterday that I am one of the new hosts of Gamestop TV. (all cheer)
Marisha: So if you walk into a Gamestop, you can see my dumb face talking to you about games and all that stuff, along with Chris, who's been there since the beginning, but yeah.
Matt: Since the Triassic.
Marisha: Yeah, exactly.
Liam: We are so proud.
Marisha: I'm a little kooky.
Laura: You're always a little kooky, Marisha.
Marisha: That's true.
Liam: That's you.
Matt: It's like you were the harbinger of the end of the circle of life for Gamestop.
Marisha: Yeah, it's like the ouroboros kinda thing.
Matt: You know what I'm talking about.
Laura: Oh my god. Lego Batman head's gonna be my dice jail tonight. That's an important announcement.
Marisha: And last but not least, as always, Talks Machina's live on Tuesday nights at 7PM on Twitch, with the illustrious Brian Foster. And don't forget, 'cause I feel like not a lot of people are doing this really, and I see so much, don't forget to submit your gif and fanart of the week to the contest, and use talksmachina@gmail.com to do that. Put it in the subject, be like, 'contest entry', because that helps people who are poring through your emails.
Matt: There you go.
Sam: 17 more announcements, guys.
Marisha: That's it. That's all we have.
Matt: Good, great!
Marisha: Done and done.
Matt: All righty. That being the case, let's go ahead--
Travis: Twins!
Matt: Twins.
Liam: Twins.
Matt: -- and bring it in to tonight's episode of Critical Role. (opening credits)
Matt: Welcome back. So, to get you guys up to speed for tonight's episode, Vox Machina, our band of adventurers, after defeating the Chroma Conclave, destroying Thordak and then Raishan, the mastermind behind their ascension, you then recovered a few objects of possible-- revealing her plans, at the very least, though keeping it tempered. You've begun closing loose ends that you hadn't had the time to get to at this point, including finishing Keyleth's Aramente. You managed to charter a ship and crew at Emon to head towards the west, the Ozmit Sea, where you were boarded temporarily by what appeared to be a band of pirates. Defeating them and sinking the ship, you continued forward, taking a prisoner.
Laura: A friendly prisoner. We're friendly taking a prisoner. Nicely taking a prisoner.
Travis: What history do you remember?
Matt: You then eventually found yourselves, the ship reaching the outside of the Anamn Mountains-- Anamn Islands. It's been a long week.
Travis: Yeah, man.
Matt: Where the ship set anchor on the outside of the reefs that encircle the center of these three islands, where in the center of them lies a partially submerged city of Vesrah, the last stop on Keyleth's Aramente and the water ashari that live there. You, upon arriving just past sunset, watched the city come to life, and the Vesrah come out, and upon discovering that you were allies, or at least friendly, they took you in and gave you the idea of what you had to do to finish this Aramente. Your task, to come the following day, was to be led down into the Aerie of Torrent, where the elemental rift to the water elemental plane resides, under protection, and you were to retrieve three lodestones, magical stones that are occasionally farmed from the water elemental plane as they fade from power. These stones are utilized, apparently, in both keeping the rift contained and keeping the city of Vesrah aloft and up towards the air. However, in the process of them researching where these lodestones came from, it was discovered in the most recent years that they were byproducts of one of the krakens that lives in the water elemental plane, and--
Laura: Kraken, plural?
Matt: There are a number of krakens. This one, however, was drawn back to the rift from one of the earlier expeditions of the Waveriders that were attempting to find them, and now has taken up its lair on the outskirts of this rift, so your task, as Vox Machina, is to enter the rift into the water elemental plane, find and bring back three of these lodestones, and do so without slaying the kraken, as it is an important part of the ecology and continued existence of the city of Vesrah. So. That's where we come up. So as it is evening, you've been fed, a largely fish- and marine-based meal, and you've had the opportunity to speak with some of the locals and prepare and discuss amongst yourselves exactly what you wish to do for this journey tomorrow. So.
Marisha: So what time is it here?
Matt: I mean, it's probably-- post-food and mild celebration of you guys making it here in the first place? They don't get too many intentional travelers. Most of the people that come here are either shipwrecked, saved by the Waveriders in the middle of storms, and some of them stay and end up joining the Vesrah. They have a number of reformed pirates. People that almost died at sea or drowned but were saved by them and eventually joined them. But I'd say it's about... maybe close to 10PM, the equivalent.
Marisha: Oh, it's late.
Laura: I feel like we should--
Matt: You got here just after dusk.
Laura: We should have a Heroes' Feast before tomorrow. I have no idea what a kraken does, or--
Marisha: Me neither. Actually, is Uvenda still around? She's still there, are we still in front of her?
Matt: Uvenda is around, yeah. You can find her. As you approach her, she's finished her meal and is half-napping in this, almost a high chair, though it's built beautifully of what look to be petrified bleach-white shells and coral structures. This looks to be her seat at this open natural gazebo-like eating space. She's half-resting off to the side with her staff, leaning off a bit, and as you start approaching, one eye flies open and rolls in your direction, and she leans forward. "Young Keyleth. What do you require?"
Marisha: Sorry. I hope I'm not interrupting.
Matt: "My nap, yes, but you seem intent. What do you wish?"
Marisha: I was just curious, I guess, if you had any advice for tomorrow morning. Is there anything I should know in particular about the kraken?
Matt: "From what we know, the kraken is a very hungry beast. It carries with it a swarm of long, grasping tentacles. It moves unimpeded and destroys structures in its path. Seems nigh-unstoppable, which is why maintaining the rift is so important. To unleash more of these entities into our plane would be disastrous, not just for our city, but for the entirety of the Ozmit. Do be aware that you will be encountering this beast deep, deep in the fathomless depths of the water elemental plane, so be prepared best you can to swim."
Marisha: Right. You mentioned it being hungry. What does it hunger for?
Matt: "Anything that crosses its path. You'll see, the sand below the vicinity of the rift is partially soot, dirt, and sand, but a lot of it is sprinkled bone of things that failed to make it through the rift."
Marisha: And I imagine it's pretty dark down there.
Matt: "It's not the brightest place, no."
Laura: How large are these lodestones that we're looking for?
Matt: "We will show you these down in the Aerie tomorrow, but they're roughly--" and she gives a motion about that big in her hands. "About that large. But you can take time and research the ones that are dwindling within the temple. That way, you'll know what to look for."
Liam: And in all your experience with these beasts, are their attacks mainly physical?
Matt: "Mainly. However, they have a degree of control over the waters that surround them. Those who have returned, the Waverunners who do these passes every few years, they speak of currents swiftly changing, it leaving bursts of darkened ink-like material to obstruct the space. And they speak of sudden surges of energy that rock through the nearby waters."
Laura: Great.
Travis: So we need snorkels.
Laura: Lots and lots of snorkels.
Liam: Long ones.
Marisha: Are there other creatures that live in the rift?
Matt: "There are creatures, but those of flesh and bone usually find themselves in the belly of the beast, and due to the nature of its presence, and the rift's energy, elementals do occasionally wander half-crazed, directionless in that space as well. So be careful."
Marisha: All right. Is there a particular creature that you know is good at evading this kraken?
Matt: "Our Waverunners. They travel usually in various forms of their mer-form."
Marisha: All right.
Matt: "Anything that can swim quickly, swiftly, search fast, and retrieve and return. Whatever that is to you, that's your choice."
Marisha: Okay.
Laura: Keyleth, I know you have the ability to turn us into different things.
Marisha: Yes.
Laura: Is it possible to turn us into water elementals?
Marisha: No, that's--
Laura: It's not a thing.
Marisha: -- that's not really a beast. I can turn you into--
Travis: Like a great herd of dolphins that we can commandeer?
Taliesin: Sea cows.
Travis: Yeah. And then just ride them--
Laura: Manatees.
Liam: Manatees.
Laura: Narwhals!
Travis: They do have a spike.
Taliesin: The worst of like five worlds.
Liam: The unicorns of the sea.
Marisha: Well, I know that Taryon and I can alter ourselves into merfolk.
Sam: Yes.
Marisha: And you can also-- how many people can you imbue with your powers?
Sam: To become underwater sea-breathers?
Marisha: Yeah, could you give Alter Self to others?
Sam: I mean, technically, I could. It would use a lot of my spell abilities, but I could give four of my little coins to people, and those coins could be used to alter yourself to be a water-breathing madman like me.
Laura: Merfolk?
Sam: Well, sort of. Just you, but with gills.
Laura: What if we want to be a mermaid, though?
Sam: Sure, yeah, you could do that.
Laura: Okay, sweet.
Matt: With the Alter Self, you can give yourself gills and webbed hands, and you would gain a swim speed of your normal walking speed.
Laura: And a seashell bra.
Matt: Should that be your preference, sure. As she begins to talk about the--
Travis: For all of us.
Taliesin: Oh, yeah. Oh, please.
Marisha: Definitely.
Taliesin: We're all on board.
Liam: This all she talked about from ages six to 13. Only thing.
Marisha: (sings) We are the daughters of Trident!
Travis: (sings) I want to go where the people are.
Liam: Look at our DM.
Matt: "Anyway."
Sam: I could also think of a spell that would give you a clever Rastafarian crab sidekick.
Laura: Ooh, I like it. Oh, Trinket!
Taliesin: Turn Trinket into a--
Marisha: Oh my gosh! Yeah! Yeah!
Taliesin: Okay, okay. Gotta put the foot down before this gets weird.
Laura: Okay.
Marisha: I agree. Let's talk about this over a Heroes' Feast. How's that?
Laura: Yeah, but a midnight feast like--
Taliesin: We're not doing Hero's Brunch?
Laura: No, 'cause that would waste a spell on the day.
Travis: Keyleth? I don't think she's done talking.
Marisha: Who? What?
Matt: "Just be warned..."
Marisha: Sorry, we get carried away.
Matt: "I would recommend taking some time in the water first. Learn how it reacts to you and you react to it. Know that the limitations of not combating in air can be restrictive."
Laura: Makes sense. I don't know how my bow's going to work underwater.
Taliesin: I don't know how my guns are going to work underwater.
Marisha: Do you have a training ground? Like an arena that's kind of comparable we can test in tonight?
Matt: "Tonight? We could escort you to one of the more deep areas in Vesrah if you'd like."
Travis: Does it have to be tonight?
Sam: Well, yes, if we want to recover all our abilities for tomorrow.
Marisha: We're leaving in the morning.
Travis: Oh. Right, yeah. Good point.
Marisha: Do we want to practice now and eat later, or eat now and practice later?
Laura: Practice for an hour, have a midnight feast.
Travis: I hear you're not supposed to fight or kill anything for 30 minutes after you eat.
Laura: Right.
Taliesin: At least 30 minutes.
Marisha: Yeah.
Laura: So fight first, and then snack.
Marisha: So fight first. Yeah, we shouldn't swim after eating.
Taliesin: You'll just get a cramp.
Marisha: Cramps.
Liam: Even that's a pretty big number for you.
Travis: I just say it, I don't know what it means. 30.
Matt: All right. You guys are escorted over four or five structures past the main eating thoroughfare into an area that quickly descends. The beach drops down into about a ten, 15-foot depth. You can see this area is almost like a farming ground for bits of kelp and other sea plants that are just maintained for food.
Marisha: So we're doing this in the morning, right? We're leaving first thing?
Matt: You guys just said you were doing it before--
Laura: No, no, no, no, no, yes. We're doing that, but we're leaving in the morning.
Marisha: No, we're leaving in the morning though, at dawn.
Matt: Yeah, tomorrow is when you actually venture down to the Aerie.
Sam: At dawn, we swim.
Laura: Yeah.
Marisha: At dawn, we swim. Then I'm going to go ahead and cast Water Breathing on all of us now, because it lasts for 24 hours.
Matt: Okay. So how many targets can you do with that?
Laura: Can we still breathe on land?
Marisha: Up to ten, I believe.
Sam: No. (laughs)
Marisha: I think it's up to ten. Let me double-check. I'm pretty sure it's ten.
Matt: Oh, don't worry. In older editions, there were arguments, because they didn't specify.
Laura: Yeah? Ooh.
Liam: Oh, great.
Taliesin: You have to sleep with a glass of water by the bed.
Laura: Sleep in a fishbowl.
Matt: All right, so between all of you, including Trinket, you guys are able to imbue, for the next 24 hours, Water Breathing onto the party.
Marisha: Ten. Willing creatures.
Matt: Ten willing creatures, perfect. Ah, Doty does not need it. Doty does not breathe. All right, so you guys, you feel this strange kind of sensation as the air seems to change in your lungs, but still function. It's a bit colder, and as you slowly submerge yourself in the water, you dip underneath, and the instinct is to hold your breath for as long as you can. It's that natural survival instinct, but the moment you give in and allow yourself to inhale you panic for a moment but then regulate, for a moment, and feel the water cycle through. It's cold. It chills the interior of your lungs a bit, but you can breathe fine. Speaking's still a bit of an issue. It's still a kind of a garbled-- there's no air passing past the vocal cords.
Travis: (garbled) I'm peeing. I'm peeing in the water right now.
Liam: (garbled) Three hours of this.
Laura: Can we see under the water? How's our perc--
Travis: Visibility.
Laura: Visibility?
Matt: Your visibility is as good as it would be underwater. It's murky. It's difficult to get a very clear view of anything beyond maybe a 20-foot span. Plus, this is nighttime. It's dark.
Laura: What about Percy with his glasses? I mean, could we do some sort of goggle things, so we can see better?
Taliesin: We could try to craft some goggles.
Liam: You put 'em away. Didn't you?
Laura: So that we could see underwater.
Liam: Aren't they for close up?
Taliesin: Yeah, they are for close up, but they're not attached to my-- water could get in.
Laura: Oh.
Travis: Do you want me to hold your glasses again for you?
Matt: You would have to ask, probably, for materials to do that.
Taliesin: Yes.
Matt: You don't have anything to craft goggles.
Liam: You don't want to lose them in the ocean. Maybe put them away?
Taliesin: Yeah, I'll put them in, I've got a pocket.
Liam: Just, just don't open it.
Sam: Crafting goggles. Would it be helpful to craft something that would allow us to speak? Or--
Laura: I don't know if there's time for all of that. It'd be great, though. Tary, you're really good at crafting, right?
Sam: I am, I would say the best at crafting, actually. I've spent my whole life doing it.
Laura: All right, could you make something like that in like an hour?
Sam: I have no idea. But the adventure is to try, right? And I certainly will give it a go.
Taliesin: My big question is, what am I going to do with my guns?
Travis: Go find out.
Laura: Yeah, I'm going to try to shoot an arrow and see what happens.
Marisha: Yeah, go find out, that's why we're here, man.
Matt: Okay, you pull back and release the arrow, and it does fire, but it fires much slower and is impeded. It only gets about half as far, and even then with a dull thud.
Laura: Does it-- It doesn't seem like it pierces any?
Matt: It functions, but essentially the-- and this goes for any ranged attacks, most ranged attacks I should say, and melee attacks are at disadvantage underwater.
Travis: What!
Matt: And ranged attacks don't go further than their first range increment.
Laura: So what would that be?
Taliesin: I'm gonna have to look up my first range increment
Matt: So if you look at your bow, and it says like, you know, 60 feet, 120 feet, you know, for first increment, second increment.
Liam: Yeah.
Laura: Uh-huh.
Matt: It's disadvantage, and anything past that first increment is an automatic miss. It just stops in the water.
Laura: Oh no!
Liam: So, for example, daggers'--
Travis: Thank you, Ryan.
Laura: Thank you, Ryan.
Liam: -- short distance is 20 feet.
Matt: Yeah.
Liam: I could throw it 20 feet at disadvantage.
Matt: And that's as far as it'll go.
Liam: Gameplay wise, game mechanics.
Matt: Also, your movement speed is halved.
Travis: Son of a bitch!
Liam: This is awesome!
Taliesin: Unless we web.
Laura: So, for a longbow.
Matt: Unless you have webbed fingers, or you know, use Alter Self
Taliesin: Or turn into dolphins, or--
Marisha: We could be great whites.
Laura: Ooh! Let's be sharks.
Taliesin: Swordfish.
Marisha: We could be sharks.
Laura: Or we could be merpeople.
Marisha: I can also change us whenever we feel like being something else.
Taliesin: Eels. Electric eels.
Marisha: It just takes a turn. Rock it like an electric eel!
Laura: How do I find out how far a longbow can shoot?
Taliesin: Not that I don't know this isn't going to work, but I'm going to try and see if I can get, even with like maybe an electric pulse, if I can light the powder. If the powder's wet, the powder's wet. Once I open that thing--
Matt: The minute you submerge your gun, the powder is wet. Your firearms will not function underwater.
Taliesin: They're not going to function underwater.
Matt: I'm sorry, Percy.
Taliesin: It's okay. No, I'd be worried if they did.
Matt: All right, so for the longbow, your first range increment is 150 feet, so you're okay.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: But anything beyond that, not functional.
Laura: Done, okay.
Travis: So, all melee attacks are at disadvantage, because you're swinging through water.
Matt: Correct. Yeah, you're going against resistance in the water.
Travis: Fucking hate the ocean now.
Taliesin: So there's no way to put a bubble around me or anything, is there?
Marisha: Sorry.
Laura: Yeah but, oh.
Sam: A bubble around what?
Travis: Like an airtight bubble.
Taliesin: Like some sort of bubble.
Sam: Ooh.
Liam: So you think if your bullets were to pierce out through this bubble, they could still go a ways.
Taliesin: Or I could even put the tip of the gun out of the bubble.
Laura: Wait, you can shoot into water.
Taliesin: And fire, but as long-- the combustion has to happen in air.
Travis: Yeah, yeah, be in a closed airtight space with a firearm, that will do wonders for your ears.
Sam: The firearm.
Taliesin: How do you even know all this?
Travis: Oh, sorry.
Sam: The firearm has to be enclosed, not you.
Taliesin: Not me, just the firearm.
Sam: But it would only last one shot. Blow a hole in the side, then water would get out.
Taliesin: Well, if I could have it around just the combustion point, and have the barrel sticking out of the point, that might be a thing.
Sam: That might be something we could try to make, I suppose.
Taliesin: Out of what?
Sam: We could take apart Trinket. That's your bear, right?
Taliesin: We're not taking apart the bear.
Sam: That's your robot bear. We could take apart that.
Laura: He's a real bear, Tary, he's a real bear.
Sam: Oh, well then, never mind.
Laura: Hm.
Travis: Could you make some sort of cavernous hole out of Doty's chest?
Sam: We don't touch Doty.
Taliesin: Okay, I've got a crazy idea.
Travis: I mean, I'll touch Doty, but--
Matt: What's your crazy idea?
Sam: We lure the kraken onto land.
Laura: He's still formulating it.
Taliesin: I wanna, I wanna build--
Laura: Through a portal, into--
Taliesin: I wanna build a watertight vest for the guns. Basically just a packet that keeps that section dry. Like a protective-- like a soft bag that is waterproof, that would use some sort of stomach lining of some animal or some leather to build it. I couldn't reload the gun.
Matt: No, you'd probably only get one shot each.
Taliesin: One shot, or would it just be one shot-- yeah, 'cause it might--
Matt: 'Cause it would pierce the containment.
Taliesin: Well, like it would-- just around everything but the-- well, the barrel would then have to be--
Matt: The barrel would then fill with water.
Taliesin: That's--
Marisha: Tary?
Taliesin: One shot each.
Sam: Yes, Antlers?
Marisha: Respect. Can I imbue one of your mystical coins with one of my spells that we give to other people or is that kind of your thing?
Sam: I mean, if you inspected them, you would know that they say 'T.D.' on them. They're sort of personal to me. I've had them minted.
Marisha: Oh, sure, yeah. I'm sorry. I'm farsighted. So sorry.
Sam: I don't think that would work. It's sort of a thing that I can do and I'm pretty cool at it.
Marisha: I did not mean any offense.
Sam: None taken. I respect the question and I respect you wanting to work with someone of my skill set and aptitude. I saw your work back there at the last fight and, well, the gunslinger was rendered useless and everyone else was fighting on the other boat against lesser allies. Uh, enemies, I mean. You and I held off that beast together and it was quite amazing to watch.
Marisha: I mean, you're gonna take full credit for it later, aren't you?
Sam: I made the kill. It was 100% mine.
Marisha: All right. No, that's fine. I mean-- you know--
Sam: But you were there and it was a good assist and I appreciate it.
Marisha: (laughs weakly) Moving on. Back to planning.
Taliesin: I'm going to need some way of defending myself or I'm going to have to take an animal form.
Marisha: I could give you an animal form.
Taliesin: I may have to have an animal form.
Travis: Like what?
Marisha: Shark?
Travis: Barracuda!
Taliesin: It's kind of small, isn't it?
Laura: A little yellow fish. A little yellow fish that's very friendly.
Taliesin: A very friendly yellow fish. I was thinking maybe some sort of half-octopus merperson.
Travis: Does that exist?
Marisha: I've gotta give you something kind of real. Kind of beastly. But it is challenge rating four or lower, which is awesome. That's cool.
Travis: I have a question for you.
Matt: Yes?
Travis: I have two vials of underwater breathing from a long time ago. How long do those last?
Matt: Let me check, actually.
Travis: Like an hour?
Sam: I have a question for you as well.
Matt: All right. What is your question?
Sam: My rod of mercurial form.
Matt: Yes?
Sam: We know that it can turn into a crossbow?
Matt: One hour.
Travis: One hour?
Matt: Yes.
Sam: How many crossbow arrows do I own? Any?
Matt: Yeah, you would have 40.
Sam: 40! Okay, great.
Matt: They're just regular bolts. They're bolts, not arrows.
Sam: Thank you.
Matt: You're welcome.
Travis: Do we know if the kraken is considered Thordak-sized or, humongous?
Matt: You have no idea, but the stories say immense.
Travis: Immense.
Matt: Yes.
Taliesin: They could take down a ship, right?
Matt: Yeah, from what you've heard.
Liam: Yeah, I mean, fairy tales tell about them pulling ships under the water, breaking them in half.
Laura: I have a little poison bolt. Do you want one? I've just been holding onto it. If you have a crossbow?
Sam: Yes, I would love that. Thank you. How much do I owe you for it?
Laura: 50,000 gold.
Sam: It seems like you're just fucking with me. (all laugh)
Taliesin: He's catching on.
Sam: Let's call it an even five gold.
Laura: Hm, I'll take it. I was just gonna gift it to you, but I'll take the gold.
Sam: Well, I don't want there to be any sort of implied favors or anything that I have to return later. If you're all right with it, I'd like to just keep this business, thank you.
Laura: I do still want an Alter Self coin.
Sam: I mean, are we doing that? I can do four of those Alter Self coins.
Travis: Would that take away the speed halving? If we had webbed hands and feet, would that--
Matt: Yeah, you'd then have normal speed through the water.
Laura: See, that's pretty great.
Matt: For the record, with swimming, you're essentially flying, too, I mean, as far as in water. You can swim in an up and down direction as well.
Laura: That's cool.
Taliesin: When I'm an animal, none of my bonuses--
Travis: Right. So, Boots of Feral Leaping, I don't really-- unless we're on the bottom of the ocean.
Matt: It's not gonna help you.
Travis: Right.
Marisha: You keep your bonuses.
Taliesin: My bonuses stay. So, my vestige will actually--
Marisha: Yeah. I think so. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Taliesin: We'll find out, I suppose.
Matt: If what?
Taliesin: If the vestiges will be functional while I'm in animal form.
Marisha: Wait, we're still underwater, right? (garbled underwater speech)
Laura: Yeah, all of this conversation has been happening underwater. We're surfacing and talking and going back under.
Sam: Yeah, we're treading water.
Matt: The target's gear melds into the new form. The target can't activate, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.
Marisha: With Animal Shapes?
Matt: Yes.
Marisha: So, you can't benefit from your equipment.
Matt: Right.
Liam: Does that negate all my class boosting and all that?
Matt: All that you get in the form of the creature. If you become a creature that has an armor class of 11, you have an armor class of 11.
Liam: What about these merpeople?
Matt: Alter Self, you keep all your stuff and just gain the ability to swim underwater.
Marisha: And it's our movement speed, which isn't very fast.
Matt: Correct, but it's better than half your movement speed.
Marisha: Correct.
Matt: Which is really not very fast. So your call.
Marisha: Could killer whales give us a movement speed of 60 swim feet?
Travis: We're not fucking whales.
Taliesin: I'm turning into one.
Marisha: He was into sharks, but he has something against whales.
Liam: I mean, don't knock it.
Travis: (whale noises)
Marisha: They're faster.
Laura: Are they?
Marisha: Yeah, they are.
Laura: Yeah, but what if the kraken sees it?
Marisha: It says in the book that they are definitely faster.
Travis: Maybe orcas, but they're not whales, right?
Taliesin: They're not actually whales. They're orca.
Travis: They're like porpoises and shit.
Taliesin: They-- yeah, like with cool tattooing.
Marisha: You guys were down with manatees, but have something against killer whales? I feel like our priorities are off.
Taliesin: Look, we can have different animals. Like, he can shark and I can whale.
Liam: Also, I know it's always been a waste of time, our planning, but we're not even talking about what we're going to try to do. Are we going to try to distract this fucker and take his lodes or--
Marisha: I mean, if we use Pass Without A Trace, right?
Laura: Yeah?
Marisha: I mean, Pass Without A Trace should still work underwater. If we're all something super stealthy, we move super fast, get there, and get out.
Laura: Let me make sure Pass Without A Trace is not concentration.
Travis: Important question. Do we know if the elemental plane is more like the waters off the Cayman Islands and it's crystal clear for hundreds of feet or is it like more murky, boggish Louisiana, Gulf of Mexico-type water?
Marisha: It seems like it's Marianas Trench levels. Seems like--
Matt: Yeah, it's pretty dark. From what you've heard and what they've talked about, the water elemental plane, most of it feels like you're a mile beneath the surface of the ocean.
Liam: Oh, shit.
Laura: We have to be animals that can grab things.
Travis: Light is also important.
Matt: There is a little bit of light that comes through. You do have some visibility, though the source is difficult to really ascertain.
Marisha: Here's my thought. Certain of us are gonna be better under the water with our natural forms and some of us aren't. Half of us go... (laughs)
Sam: Ooh, I like this. She is smart.
Marisha: Half of us are animals. The other half can ride them in our Alter Self forms like a SeaWorld show.
Sam: Yes, yes, absolutely. I volunteer to be a rider or a captain of the ship sort of.
Taliesin: If we throw a little bit of rope together, we can make some quick harnesses, including harnesses that include a little bit of a netting for the stones as we get them.
Sam: A harness around the big man? I think that would be quite a formidable steed.
Travis: You back the fuck up right now.
Sam: All right. Just strategizing, chum.
Travis: I understand that.
Marisha: Because I can Alter Self at will and you have to take a spell slot, or can you do it at will?
Sam: I don't know what "at will" means, but I'm very impressed.
Marisha: Yes.
Travis: That's not a terrible idea, 'cause I'm gonna be able to do dick diddly shit in there. That's, like, zero.
Marisha: It means one of us might have to borrow your bag of holding.
Travis: No, I'm out. I'll stay on the land.
Marisha: Tary, you had a bag of holding, right?
Sam: I do.
Marisha: All right!
Sam: What do we need it for? Oh, to put the--
Marisha: The lodestones in.
Sam: The things in that we're finding. Oh, yes, yes, of course and they would be great keepsakes.
Marisha: No, you cannot keep them.
Sam: Oh, well, if we find an extra one, perhaps I could take that back as a--
Liam: Question.
Sam: Yes?
Liam: I'm obviously a fan of stealth, right? But when we go in there and it all fucks up like it does nine times out of ten and the thing sees us anyway, what are we doing?
Laura: Run!
Marisha: Run.
Liam: Without the lodes? With the lodes?
Taliesin: Well, those of us who can swim quite quickly will try and evade. We'll try and hide and keep looking for them.
Laura: Distract him.
Liam: But we don't wanna hurt this thing, so what are we doing? Interference and distract and a couple of us try to smash and grab?
Travis: Yeah, diversion.
Taliesin: Diversion, scatter, grab, and run.
Marisha: Yeah.
Laura: Only attack if truly necessary.
Sam: New guy here--
Travis: Bait. I like it. Way to volunteer, captain.
Sam: No, nope, nope. New guy here, just a process question. I'm new to these sort of strategy "seshes" that you guys have. Is this how it always is, with people just throwing out random bad ideas constantly for, like, 15 minutes?
Liam: Yeah.
Taliesin: That's about right.
Liam: We do that and then we kind of take it like jazz on the day, you know?
Sam: Wow, because I really-- this is a big fight for me. I've never fought anything quite so big. Is there a chance that we might perish?
Marisha: Yes.
Taliesin: Pretty good.
Travis: No, we're fine.
Sam: Because it doesn't seem like we have a good plan right now.
Taliesin: Well, that's the thing about these sorts of encounters, is that any plan you have is pretty much going to be out the window the minute you see it anyway.
Sam: All right.
Liam: If it makes you feel any better, this feels less asinine than many things that we've done before.
Sam: That does make me feel better.
Laura: It's true. Half of us are animals, half of us are riders.
Taliesin: Half more a plan than we normally have.
Liam: I once teleported into the belly of a dragon with another jackass and that went tits up fast.
Sam: That sounds like the stupidest fucking plan I've ever heard.
Liam: I'm still breathing.
Travis: Yeah.
Taliesin: It's much like those people who give you instructions of how to survive an encounter with a tiger. It's that, you think about it, but you've never actually met anybody who's said, "Yes, I've met a tiger, that's exactly what I did and I'm fine." No, anybody who does that's probably been eaten anyway. It's a terrible idea. You don't try and look bigger, you don't do any of that. You're gonna get eaten.
Marisha: It's true.
Sam: I've read some of those.
Taliesin: You survive an encounter by a tiger by running really quickly in the other direction or hopefully hacking it to death before it kills you.
Sam: All right.
Liam: You know, just between you and me, this does sound really fucking stupid.
Marisha: Tigers aren't that bad.
Taliesin: Well, it was just my suggestion.
Travis: So, if four of us are fast water creatures, right? Something that swims quick? What's our diversion? I volunteer as tribute.
Marisha: Well, if you drop back down to zero hit points, you'll revert back to your normal form, being able to water breathe, full hit points.
Travis: That would be a bad case scenario, 'cause I'm really slow, in that case.
Marisha: Yes.
Travis: All sorts of fucked.
Marisha: Uh-huh.
Travis: How many hit points does a killer whale have?
Marisha: 90.
Travis: Oh, god, I thought you said nine. I nearly shit my pants.
Marisha: 90.
Taliesin: Let's see, what can we do?
Marisha: I don't know if there's anything else better.
Laura: The thing is, the kraken might be able to swallow you whole, Grog.
Liam: Yeah.
Travis: They have mouths?
Laura: I don't know how big they are.
Travis: No, they have tentacles.
Laura: No, but they've got-- Don't they have beaks, like a squid?
Travis: I didn't hear anything about a beak or a mouth.
Liam: Who hasn't seen a drawing of a squid or a kraken in a fairy tale book? They're disgusting.
Travis: Book.
Taliesin: Maybe-- we have one night. Maybe I could try and craft some sort of concussion explosive.
Marisha: I also don't want you tired tomorrow.
Taliesin: It wouldn't probably hurt it, but it would at least maybe shock it. Give it a-- stun it? To just blow something up underwater?
Marisha: There's something that I want to try really quick, if you guys could back up or maybe get out of the water. I want to see if I can cast spells underwater.
Laura: Yeah, yeah. I'm out.
Taliesin: Well, all right.
Marisha: I also want to see what lightning does, so if you don't want to get electrocuted.
Liam: As soon as those two start talking about that, I get out of the water and start attuning the Deathwalker's Ward to lightning.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: Very clever.
Marisha: I love that this is all under the assumption that we just had this planning sesh underwater.
Laura: No, we were treading water.
Marisha: Oh, we're treading. Okay.
Travis: I'm staying in the water because I wanna feel the lightning.
Marisha: You wanna see?
Taliesin: You wanna ride the lightning.
Travis: Yep.
Marisha: I'm gonna tread back from Grog, go underwater, and I'm gonna do a Call Lightning bolt. See what happens.
Matt: Okay, Call Lightning, let me check real fast. Yes, okay. So, you begin to speak underwater. (burbling noises) Spell isn't coalescing.
Laura: Oh, no!
Marisha: Yeah, that's what I was curious about. That's exactly what I wanted. All right, then how about this? I take out my Spire and I do a Chain Lightning out of the Spire.
Matt: Do Chain Lightning out of the Spire? As you concentrate on the staff, the lightning arcs out of the staff and ends up searing and burning a small section of the floating kelp vines that are wandering up there.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: Clears a little area.
Marisha: So I can cast out of the Spire. And-- cool. While I'm under there, I want to Beast Shape into a killer whale.
Matt: Okay. You turn into a killer whale. You are-- it is about 15 feet deep, so you are occupying a large portion of the water nearby. It's really hard to swim in this vicinity, especially with the density of kelp in the center of this dip.
Marisha: I goose Grog a little bit from underneath.
Travis: (yelps) I punch it. (all laugh)
Matt: Okay, roll for an attack.
Travis: I was watching, but not that close. That scared me, I'm sorry.
Taliesin: It's okay, it's an animal that already has a black eye.
Travis: Oh shit.
Marisha: It's fine. (laughs)
Travis: 25.
Matt: Okay. So, with your strength bonus--
Marisha: (laughs) Uh, yeah. That definitely hits.
Matt: -- you, (laughs), let's see. What's your strength bonus?
Travis: Eight.
Matt: Yeah, so you take, we'll say, nine points of bludgeoning damage as Grog just smacks you in the nose.
Liam: Right in the blubber.
Taliesin: To be fair, no worse than anything that happens to a killer whale at SeaWorld at that point.
Marisha: (laughs)
Travis: Oh, that's terrible.
Taliesin: Yeah, I went there, I'm so sorry. It's been there, I'm sorry!
Laura: Is there some sort of Alter Self spell that--
Marisha: (groans) Oh, no.
Liam: Change his alignment!
Marisha: Oh, no.
Taliesin: My personal alignment is already so far down.
Liam: (laughs)
Laura: Yeah, no, yeah, you're right.
Matt: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Marisha: I drop form out of shame. (all laugh)
Taliesin: Sorry!
Travis: Were you gonna-- you were gonna check your speed or something?
Sam: Oh.
Marisha: Well, I'm in like a tank.
Laura: Aw.
Marisha: Which is even worse, I know! This feels tactless, I'm out! (all laugh)
Taliesin: Shit got real on Critical Role.
Laura: I like how SeaWorld is was what was our line. Of tactless.
Taliesin: Yeah. Oh no, I know what--
Marisha: That's a good point!
Travis: All right Jesus Christ, let's move on!
Taliesin: I know where my money is going at the end of the evening.
Laura: Is there an Alter Self sort of spell that could make you be able to speak underwater? Is there anything that you can do that allows for speech?
Marisha: Well, if I do Alter Self--
Sam: Did you do Alter Self just now?
Marisha: Let me actually try that. I Alter Self.
Travis: Yeah. Oh. No polymorph.
Marisha: To be able to give myself--
Matt: Gills, right.
Marisha: Gills, and like, fins and stuff, and then-- now can I cast?
Matt: Unfortunately, because there's still water passing through your throat and vocal cords. If you get a full breath of air, you can get one spell off. And technically, with your breathing the water underneath, because you already had the gills in, it didn't work. You get a breath of air, and you cast the spell as the air leaves your lungs, but once you cast the spell, the air is gone.
Sam: No more spells.
Laura: What about merpeople? How do they talk to each other?
Sam: (dolphin noises)
Laura: Are there really merpeople? There are merpeople.
Liam: Frog sacs?
Taliesin: They have a different larynx system.
Travis: Dry-erase boards.
Taliesin: (laughs) Wet-erase boards. (all laugh)
Taliesin: I deserved what happened below the table. Last weird question, would it be possible-- could I basically just make a bag of air that we could carry that she could breathe in and have to breathe it in before casting the spell. Is that nuts?
Sam: Well, if I may. The big fellow over there said that he had some sort of vials that you could breathe air out of. Is that true?
Travis: They're supposed to let you breathe underwater. I don't know if it pumps your guts full of air or anything.
Sam: May I examine it?
Laura: It's Water Breathing, it's the spell Water Breathing.
Marisha: Yeah, what about my Water Breathing--
Sam: No, it's not.
Marisha: -- we should still be able to talk?
Matt: Water Breathing you can breathe the water, but when you still--
Marisha: Okay, but you can't go (garbled underwater noises).
Matt: -- but you can't, yeah. It's still water passing through the vocal cords--
Sam: What is the thing that you have?
Matt: -- which doesn't have the vibration to make the same sound.
Marisha: I think it's a potion of waterbreathing.
Laura: What if we use some sort of--
Travis: Underwater breathing.
Laura: -- cap, right? On Grog's jug. And it just makes air!
Sam: Hm.
Liam: Not a bad thought.
Taliesin: Make a skin.
Marisha: Could I speak into the jug-- clearly.
Taliesin: I was gonna say we could make a diving bell. But it would be very hard to travel with, but we could make a micro diving bell.
Laura: (laughs)
Marisha: What is a diving bell?
Travis: You guys, this is getting dumber and dumber. We will have a movement speed of one.
Taliesin: It's basically an upside-down pot that you stick your head in and you take a big breath of air, but the problem is moving with it is bad.
Travis: We can't move it.
Laura: Okay, okay, okay.
Travis: It'll go straight to the bottom.
Marisha: Killer whales?
Travis: Yep.
Laura: Whales and riders.
Marisha: And-- all right. Who's whales, who's riders?
Taliesin: Whales.
Travis: Whale.
Liam: Rider.
Marisha: Rider?
Laura: I guess I'll be a whale. Or Trinket could be a whale!
Marisha: Trinket could be a whale.
Taliesin: Or a shark.
Laura: I will ride Trinket.
Travis: Well, it needs to be one of you two.
Taliesin: You might want to go shark for one of them.
Travis: Trinket needs to go in the necklace 'cause of the odd man out.
Sam: Please don't leave me behind.
Marisha: I thought you were being a rider.
Sam: I would love to, but, there's no one to ride.
Laura: Can't we have two people on one whale? I feel like whales are very large.
Sam: That makes sense.
Matt: You could muster that, yes.
Marisha: Yeah.
Travis: Okay.
Taliesin: Especially if it's just handles, if it's just like hanging onto a piece of rope.
Marisha: All right, let's go eat food.
Matt: All right. You guys make your way out of the small kelp farming area, eventually back to complete your-- you're doing a Heroes' Feast?
Marisha: Yup.
Matt: Okay, so mark--
Laura: But like ice cream, and donuts, like a midnight snack kind of.
Travis: Easy, psycho.
Matt: That is totally doable.
Laura: Like, waffles and--
Marisha: Hot fudge sundae.
Laura: Yes.
Liam: This is the meal I was waiting on.
Taliesin: A Heroes' Sundae Bar.
Laura: Mm-hm.
Matt: The finest of gluttonous sweets available in Tal'Dorei are summoned upon this fine mahogany table that thrusts itself out of the sand. Everyone in the vicinity steps back and kind of, "Ooh, ahh," at this display of unexpected magic. Other folks step forward to try and take a piece from it, before somebody else stops them with a hand, "It's not for you!" You guys spend the next hour eating your meal, and gain the benefits of your Heroes' Feast! (all cheer)
Matt: So let's go ahead and--
Travis: Oh.
Taliesin: (sings Zelda music)
Liam: That's extra hit points, yeah?
Laura: Mm-hm!
Liam: How many?
Marisha: 2d10--
Matt: Yeah, Marisha rolls for you guys--
Liam: Roll for all of us.
Marisha: -- which I will roll for you right now, and we-- both are cocked. (singsong) Landed on the side. That one-- is that still cocked?
Taliesin: That's cocked.
Marisha: God damn it.
Travis: Take some of the dice out of your box.
Marisha: Shut up! An extra 11.
Matt: All right. So, 11 extra hit points to all you guys. Including Trinket, who scarfs up happily at the table.
Laura: Yay!
Taliesin: 11 hit points
Liam: No fear, no poison, advantage on saves, isn't it?
Marisha: Wisdom saves.
Liam: Wisdom saves.
Matt: Wisdom saves.
Taliesin: Wisdom saves. Advantage. No fear. No poison.
Marisha: No fear, no poison, 2d10.
Laura: Lovely. All right.
Matt: You got it.
Travis: Are we supposed to go research the lodestones before we go to bed, right? The ones that are failing?
Laura: Oh, maybe we could do it in the morning?
Matt: The morning is what you were told.
Travis: Okay.
Matt: Going to bring you to the the Aerie of Torrent.
Taliesin: Are they heavy or are they light?
Laura: We'll find out.
Matt: So. As you guys are brought to your sleeping quarters, which are these semi-private huts elevated above the water, so they are actually about half a foot above the surface. You are each given a small chest, a soaked damp chest like the wood itself is just waterlogged through and through. As you open it, on the inside each of you receive what looks to be a leather band, with a circular stone affixed to the center of it.
Laura: If this is going to make us be able to fucking talk underwater--
Marisha: Oh, that will be super frustrating if we just took all that time. Or if this is one of those--
Taliesin: Vox Machina, solving problems that don't need to be solved.
Marisha: Solved-- making problems complicated for five years.
Travis: Why don't we put it on and see what it does?
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: Okay. What do you do? There's a cluster of them at various--
Travis: Does the leather band attach at either end?
Matt: It has almost like a rudimentary belt clasp on both sides.
Travis: I'm going to put it around my neck like a dog collar, and I'm going to lay down in the water face first.
Matt: Okay, it warms as it touches the outside of the neck and it feels like there's a very loose-- almost a vibration to it.
Laura: (gasps) Talk, Grog!
Travis: (distorted, vibrational voice) This is really cool! (all laugh)
Taliesin: I put my ear in the water to see if I can hear him.
Matt: It does transfer your voice through the water.
Laura: That's awesome! What a waste of (sings) fucking time!
Travis: But, but--
Marisha: That's great.
Matt: (laughs) You didn't go back to--
Travis: But does it remedy the spell problem?
Laura: Yeah.
Taliesin: Yes.
Liam: Welcome to the cool kids' table, Tary.
Marisha: It does.
Laura: It does.
Matt: Yeah, it does.
Sam: It's amazing.
Matt: You guys can talk under water. There is still a limitation to the distance you travel 'cause sound is, you know.
Taliesin: Best of the best.
Matt: Actually, no sorry, the sound does travel further.
Taliesin: It does.
Matt: Underwater. Conduit.
Laura: Oh. So we have to be super quiet.
Matt: However, you also look within the case and each of them has what looks to be spherical, somewhat see-through domes of some glass-like material.
Laura: (gasps)
Matt: You are also affixed with goggles, and you remember, looking back, you saw some of the people who were part of the troupe here, especially the guardians on the outside of the city, had the same similar goggle sets hanging around their neck.
Liam: Get the fuck out!
Laura: This is awesome!
Taliesin: Hello, water-based culture, would you happen to have some goggles lying around we could borrow, maybe something that's to communicate underwater, I don't know?
Liam: (makes ding noises to mimic hitting glass dome)
Marisha: We totally didn't.
Matt: Nobody asked-- but they were provided.
Marisha: We should have asked what equipment was available. (all laugh)
Matt: These are standard given to the Waveriders, the guardians that look on the outskirts of Vesrah.
Laura: What a fucking idiot.
Marisha: I feel stupid.
Liam: (gong noise)
Matt: (laughs)
Travis: Tary Jumbo--
Laura: We don't have giant domes on our heads.
Liam: I do. (all laugh)
Travis: I just thought of one thing for you, right? I went fishing this one time--
Matt: Just goggles.
Travis: -- and the lure that I had was really shiny and sparkly, like fish love sparkly things in the water. And I'm just noticing now that you are really shiny and sparkly kind of all over.
Laura: Oh.
Sam: Like a lure?
Travis: Yeah.
Taliesin: I was actually just contemplating that, because you know how frustrated you get opening up a crab when you're going to eat it--
Travis: I lost you at like the third word.
Taliesin: I wonder, would it be ironic if the kraken gets frustrated trying to peel off the armor? It'd just be a wonderful irony. I'm so sorry, sir.
Liam: I mean, that's funny, but it doesn't sound safe.
Taliesin: No.
Travis: What if we paint you in like black paint, or poo.
Marisha: Oh yeah, and that will immediately go away--
Laura: Oh yeah, that's smart.
Marisha: As we go underwater.
Laura: Oh.
Travis: All right, paint it is. Or tar.
Laura: Alter Self?
Travis: Should we tar him?
Marisha: If you Alter Self, right?
Taliesin: I don't know. Let's--
Marisha: Can you make yourself darkish?
Laura: Maybe you should be a whale.
Taliesin: Just not reflective.
Sam: I don't like any of this. When I was treading water before, was it difficult in armor? Was it--
Matt: Yeah! (all laugh)
Sam: And if I were to remove my armor, would I be weak and squishy?
Travis: You already are.
Matt: Yes. (all laugh)
Matt: That's a valid point.
Taliesin: That's a very fair point.
Matt: You have a breastplate, right?
Sam: Uh-huh.
Matt: Actually, it's heavy, but it's not super impeding you. It's heavy, but from a mechanical standpoint, it doesn't make it more difficult for you to swim. It's just more of a (heavy breathing). Yeah.
Sam: But it's shiny.
Matt: It is shiny. Your armor is shiny.
Travis: What if we put you, like, in a potato sack? So, you've still got your armor but it just doesn't twinkle.
Liam: That's not a bad idea at all.
Taliesin: He is not wrong, and that's not a bad idea.
Laura: Is there any burlap around?
Sam: I have a robe, I have a robe.
Marisha: Oh, okay.
Sam: I can just wrap myself in my robe.
Liam: It's not just as flashy as the armor though, is it?
Sam: It has some colorful patches on it, yes. But they're not shiny.
Laura: What if I stitch up the front?
Travis: No, no. Potato sack.
Laura: I just would hate for it to open up. I'm just gonna-- do you mind? If I just--
Marisha: Well, if it's dark--
Sam: Stitch up the front of my robe?
Laura: I'm really good at sewing.
Travis: Better not be flashy.
Sam: All right, I would, yes, thank you.
Laura: Yeah, I stitch up the front.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Thank you.
Laura: It'll be like a choir robe for you.
Liam: Good idea, Grog.
Laura: Yeah, that was smart.
Sam: Thank you so much.
Travis: Thanks. I go fishing a lot.
Sam: You lot are taking good care of me. I appreciate that. Thank you. This is going to be fun! Right? Tomorrow?
Laura: Fun, fun, fun!
Taliesin: Fun.
Sam: Yes?
Liam: Scary fun.
Taliesin: Scary fun.
Sam: All right.
Marisha: So much fun.
Taliesin: Technically speaking, we can't quite feel fear at the moment, can we? Or is it just a general malaise of fear? (all laugh)
Marisha: Yeah, I like, I like the latter. Malaise of fear.
Laura: I start working on the robe.
Matt: All right.
Laura: Really ugly stitches.
Matt: Yeah, it's, I mean, it takes you a while to get through the whole robe and get it done, and it's functional more than visually appealing. But you get the job done.
Sam: This reminds me of one of my caretakers when I was younger, stitching up some of my play clothes. It's a nice feeling. Thank you so much.
Laura: You're welcome, darling.
Marisha: While they're winding down, can I sneak away and see if I can find Uvenda?
Matt: Sure! It's not too difficult. She's in the same seat, snoring loudly, while two of her guardians stand at the side with their thin, polearm-like blades just watching as you approach, and she's just like (snores).
Marisha: I turn to her guards and say, do I wake her up? Does she not like being-- I don't want to be rude! But I kinda need to talk to her and I'm only here for a few more hours, and I--
Matt: One of them takes his bladed trident and hits her just gently on the side with the butt of it. She goes (snorts awake).
Marisha: Ah, that's how you do it.
Matt: "Ugh, yes, young Keyleth, hm."
Marisha: Hi.
Matt: She leans forward, putting on the presentation, but you can hear just that slight undertone of frustration. "What can I do for you?"
Marisha: Uh, yeah. I was just curious. I'm so sorry, first off--
Matt: "Keep talking, please. What do you want?" (all laugh)
Marisha: You mentioned that there were only remnants of my mother that came back. Was she defeated by the kraken, or do you think this was from another means? Do you have any more information on her?
Matt: "Child. There was little left of her and her allies. We found other pieces of her friends, but, pieces. Her leg was all we found. We could not recover much else, but the sea floor is littered with the many corpses and pieces of the kraken's various prey. It does not take much to ascertain the nature of her end."
Marisha: And you're sure of this? This is what the kraken does to people?
Matt: "What it does to anything that crosses its path. It eats to survive."
Marisha: Hm. I was just wondering. If there was any other potential explanation or--?
Matt: "I'm sure there is. There are many potential possibilities for anything that happens. I only have the information I was able to glean from the various scouts and teams."
Marisha: How long ago was this?
Matt: "This was four, five years back?"
Marisha: Really? All right. That's not that long, really. Did she stay long?
Matt: "A few days. Prepared for the journey much like you did. That was the last we saw of them."
Marisha: All right. I was just curious. Thank you.
Matt: "I wish I had different news for you."
Marisha: Did you keep anything? From what you found?
Matt: Her head turns curiously. "I fear I did not."
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: "We gave a quiet burial to what we were able to recover, but that's all."
Marisha: Well, I appreciate that much. Thank you for doing that.
Matt: "Of course, and once again, I am sorry for your loss, Keyleth."
Marisha: Oh. It's part of the duty.
Matt: "Yes. Yes, it is."
Marisha: Well, I should be getting my rest.
Matt: "Yes, you should."
Marisha: Yeah, big day! Swimming! Lots of calories! I'm gonna go now.
Matt: "Yes."
Marisha: All right, bye.
Matt: "Yes, you will. Goodbye."
Marisha: Goodnight.
Matt: (snores) Just conks right out again. Anything else you guys wish to do for the evening?
Liam: Well, I'm gonna follow Keyleth back to our room.
Matt: Mm-hm.
Liam: You all right?
Marisha: Did you just follow me? Were you following me just now?
Liam: No, I was waiting outside the door.
Marisha: Oh! All right, okay, yeah. Sorry. No, I'm good, I'm good.
Liam: I've seen the trouble behind your eyes all day, not surprisingly, yeah?
Marisha: I'm great.
Liam: Yeah?
Marisha: Yeah.
Liam: Okay.
Marisha: A lot, yeah. A lot riding on this, but-- A little surreal that we're here.
Liam: Long time coming.
Marisha: Yeah.
Liam: You know, you are already a river to your people.
Marisha: What?
Liam: I know that your life has built up to this moment in many respects. But your father is very proud of you. You've already done a lot. You silenced that dragon. You've done a lot.
Marisha: I'm just glad I have you all.
Liam: You know, I know that you struggle with doubt, and I don't think it's ever gonna go away for any of us. Especially for you. I think that's part of the job you're getting ready for. But I don't see it as a weakness. You know, all this time I've remembered Uriel. I'm not big on monarchies and the like, but I liked him.
Marisha: He was a good man.
Liam: Yeah. May his soul rest. And he had doubts. And he let them inform his decisions, and tried to do what was right. And the questions you have, I think they speak to your character.
Marisha: Uriel was also blinded by his unknowance of a lot of problems, so I just hope I don't follow in his footsteps in that regard.
Liam: Well, all the matters is what we leave behind us when we go. You've already done a lot of good. And you've taught me to be happy again. I'm very grateful to you. So, thank you.
Marisha: Thank you. For believing in me.
Liam: You make that easy.
Marisha: Anyway, we should get some sleep. It's a big day tomorrow.
Liam: Yeah. You know, I noticed, about a week ago? You were curious about my wings. I shoot them out.
Marisha: Heehee, hee. I pet them a little.
Liam: We have one hour. Fade to feathers.
Laura: (gasps) (all laugh)
Laura: (beatboxing)
Sam: Skyfuck!
Laura: Oh, shit!
Travis: I just want Vax and Keyleth to do the original Superman movie dialogue while he and Lois are flying.
Marisha: Oh god, that weird poetry! (all laugh)
Laura: Oh yeah--
Travis: "Can you hear my thoughts?"
Matt: Just like slow narration of Keyleth disembodied as they're both just flying over Vesrah at night.
Taliesin: I have a thing just for you.
Marisha: Is he God?
Travis: "Can you read my mind?" (all laugh)
Matt: Perfect.
Liam: I don't think they went anywhere.
Matt: That's perfect.
Taliesin: Just for you! Pass that down later.
Matt: All righty, so! Anyone else doing anything else?
Taliesin: I'm collecting some seashells, and taking a bit of a walk.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Derp.
Taliesin: And eventually, we're chilling.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: I'm gonna brush Trinket.
Matt: (disgruntled bear noises)
Laura: You need it! You're dirty! (all laugh)
Matt: (more disgruntled bear noises) It's various knots and seawater clusters--
Laura: Yeah. Just gross.
Matt: It's just not fun. All right, so morning comes to, the sun rises, it's a warm day. But the waters are crystalline and beautiful as soon as you step out. And since you haven't been here during the daytime, you can see it's a paradise-like existence. The sands that fall beneath the waves are white, just bright bleached white, and the entire city seems like the middle of this distant, tropical paradise. The islands that do kind of flank in a triangular position, as the islands of Anamn, they are just lush and green and dense. You see no signs of civilization built across them. They are just unending canopies that swarm these masses of land that break past the ocean's surface in the distance, but here in Vesrah, the city cluster, it's beautiful. The water has almost a turquoise-type shimmer when you see the areas that are deeper. And you see, in various sections, where the sand drifts away, the sandbank vanishes into the reef, and there you can see just an array of colors that refract beneath the water's surface, as a gentle breeze kind of blows through in sections.
Liam: I want to go to there.
Matt: It's beautiful.
Laura: I want to spend the morning, before anyone else gets up, standing on the edge of the water and like letting my toes sink deeper and deeper as the waves--
Liam: That's nice.
Matt: Okay. You guys eventually gather your way for a morning meal, and you can see in the distance now some of the Waverunners are doing perimeters. And you can see that they have large sails that are up on these triangular-like pointed boards that curve up into horn-like javelins in the front, and they are coasting on them. Basically surfing across the waves in the distance, doing runs around the perimeter of the reef.
Laura: That's fucking sick!
Marisha: That's so cool!
Liam: Cool!
Matt: And they are wearing the same goggles and the same throat pieces you were given.
Laura: Ah!
Matt: This is part of the standard equipment that is given to the Waveriders as they check on the outside and the vicinity of Vesrah.
Liam: That one looks like Keanu Reeves! And that one looks like Patrick Swayze! (all laugh)
Sam: (Keanu Reeves as Johnny Utah impression) He's not coming back.
Matt: It's a clear sky, not a cloud visible. Beautiful blue above you. What do you do to prepare?
Liam: Oh, Jesus.
Marisha: Oh, I find Uvenda.
Matt: Okay. She's actually already waiting for you, as you guys-- she's been up, earlier than you were, and--
Marisha: I take some time in my morning prep to do a little meditation, and I take my flame hands and I do some like, traditional Ashari war paint, kinda thing, going on.
Travis: Sick.
Laura: Nice.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: Nice, okay.
Marisha: Yeah. Oh, yeah.
Taliesin: Are we bringing the bear?
Laura: Yeah.
Taliesin: We're bringing the bear.
Laura: Trinket's gonna be a whale.
Marisha: Mm-hm.
Taliesin: All right.
Liam: Hopefully the whole time.
Marisha: As long as he doesn't hit zero hit points, then he won't turn into a bear. But he has water breathing!
Laura: If he hits zero, okay, I have a question.
Matt: Yes.
Laura: If he hits zero hit points--
Marisha: As a whale.
Laura: Does he go into the--
Matt: No.
Sam: Trinket-form.
Matt: The form reverts--
Laura: Would revert, and then--
Matt: Becomes Trinket at full hit points, carrying over any damage that happens. And remember only Trinket's, or any of your natural form, maintains the bonus hit points from your Heroes' Feast. Your animal form does not.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: So, you just have the base hit points of whatever creature form you take, and once you go to zero and revert back to yourself, or just revert back to yourself, then you have your hit points plus the Heroes' Feast.
Liam: And gameplay mechanics, can Trinket get walloped so hard that it passes all of his new form, plus Trinket form, and take him out?
Matt: If it was a shit-ton of damage, yeah.
Laura: It would have to be 150 points of damage. Thereabouts, 160.
Taliesin: Is it possible to grab a spare set of goggles and choker, just in case?
Matt: Asking around--
Taliesin: We'll return them all.
Matt: -- you approach Uvenda to ask this question. Even as you approach, they're looking out in the distance. She says, "Yes, that could be certainly mustered." And she snaps her little gnomish fingers.
Taliesin: Thank you.
Matt: And one of the guards wanders off, comes back a few moments later and retrieves an extra pair of goggles, and the throat bead.
Taliesin: Excellent.
Matt: And it's called a throat bead.
All: Throat bead.
Sam: How many of us need my coins to become altered?
Travis: I need to be a whale.
Marisha: That's me.
Taliesin: Three.
Liam: So, riders, show of hands. Rider, rider?
Laura: I mean, I can just use Water Breathing and cast Pass Without a Trace on us, that's the only thing, is I can't do that if I have Alter Self.
Sam: Oh, well then, I can just--
Marisha: Well, if you cast Pass Without a Trace, it's a concentration spell--
Sam: You won't be able to swim very fast, though.
Laura: If what?
Sam: She can't use Alter Self and Pass Without a Trace.
Marisha: Is Alter Self a concentration spell?
Sam: Yes.
Marisha: Oh. I could cast Pass Without a Trace, though.
Laura: Okay.
Marisha: I did bring it today.
Laura: Oh, good. All right.
Marisha: I could-- yeah. Wait.
Travis: Are there any seashells on the floor that I could find? Pretty shells?
Taliesin: I've already got a small bag of them, if you want to keep them--
Travis: I don't want yours.
Matt: So Alter Self is a what-level spell?
Taliesin: We could trade later.
Marisha: One. Two.
Matt: You have three second-level spells you can cast. And two thirds. So you'd have to use one of your third-level spells to do that.
Sam: Yeah.
Taliesin: Also a skipping stone.
Marisha: Right.
Matt: Technically, you could do--
Sam: I need one for me.
Taliesin: You didn't think of that, did you?
Sam: So four of them.
Matt: You are correct.
Laura: You're a rider?
Travis: I'm a whale.
Marisha: Animal Shapes takes my concentration, so I can't do that. But you could cast it--
Sam: You could just have Water Breathing, and be riding a whale. But if you get tossed from the whale, can you swim?
Laura: I mean, I can swim. What if you give me the coin--
Sam: And then you can use it if you need it.
Laura: -- and if things get hairy, then I use it, and then we drop Pass Without a Trace.
Taliesin: If it's hairy, we won't need Pass Without a Trace at all.
Marisha: I can go ahead and cast Animal Shapes on her, but it takes a turn, a round, for me to-- an action to change her into something else, so can I cast it on her, but leave her as Vex for now?
Laura: I'm not gonna be an animal.
Marisha: No, I know.
Matt: You assume the form of a different creature for the duration. A creature different from herself. Of the beast variety.
Marisha: Okay. Never mind.
Taliesin: We've got a plan.
Laura: We're fine!
Marisha: 'Cause we need Pass Without a Trace for her, right?
Laura: Yeah, so I'll get a coin, I'll cast it, go in, if things get bad, I'll use the coin.
Marisha: You can cast the coin. Okay. All right.
Sam: You're a whale.
Taliesin: I'm going to be a whale, we've got some rope here, it's going to be your job once I'm a whale to create at least a couple handholds with a harness. You know how to use knots, right, you can do some basic--
Sam: I know every knot in the book.
Taliesin: I knew you would.
Sam: The double-sloop. The reverse-cowgirl. I know 'em all. I've got the itsy-bitsy spider.
Taliesin: Keep going.
Sam: I know the rusty trombone. I've got--
Laura: The old Alaskan pipeline.
Sam: Yep. Got the figure eight, the figure four, the hidden figures.
Taliesin: The Dallas two-step.
Sam: I've got a bunch of 'em, yep.
Taliesin: The sweet Caroline?
Sam: Oh, yes. That one. That one's good. (all laugh)
Taliesin: Good for tension. I'm also gonna grab-- I should not be allowed to drink this. I'm going to take you aside really quickly and give you the extra set of goggles and the bead.
Liam: What do you want me to do with these? Just keep them safe?
Taliesin: Just in case. I'm-- you know how I get with my hunches.
Liam: Okay.
Taliesin: You'll know, if we need them, we have them. Just an extra set.
Liam: All right, Freddie.
Marisha: Uvenda, these beads.
Matt: "Yes?"
Marisha: Can you guys also track where we are based on them?
Matt: "No, unfortunately."
Marisha: No.
Matt: "The magic is only localized."
Marisha: All right.
Matt: "We've recovered as many as we could from previous scouts that have fallen."
Marisha: I go ahead and I Druidcraft one of my bark bracelets to put around her. For scrying, if you need it.
Matt: "All right. Thank you."
Sam: Bigly man over there, do you want a coin in case you lose your whale form?
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: What about you, Percival?
Taliesin: I'll take one just in case.
Sam: All right.
Travis: What does it do?
Sam: You say, 'Alter Self!' and slam it against your body and it'll make you with gills and stuff. Does he speak-- he speaks Common, right? He understands what I'm saying?
Taliesin: Well.
Travis: What does it do?
Sam: Make big, big hit, say 'Alter Self'--
Travis: What's the matter with you? Why are you talking like that?
Taliesin: That was everything I could've hoped for.
Liam: He does speak Fucking-with-you. Very well.
Sam: All right, I guess I'll make four coins.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: And pass them out to Percy, Little Elf Boy, Little Elf Girl, and Jumbo.
Matt: All right.
Liam: Hi. My name is Vax.
Sam: Oh.
Liam: That's short for Vax'ildan.
Sam: Have you heard the Legend of Taryon Darrington?
Liam: From you, yes, I have. It's a good tale.
Sam: Good, then, we're equals.
Liam: That is my sister. Her name is Vex'ahlia. You can call her Vex. Some people call her Vax.
Laura: That's true.
Sam: That's very confusing.
Laura: Yeah, you can call us by anything, we'll both respond.
Taliesin: At first, yes.
Sam: Okay. Okay. Were your parents fond of you, because to name them that similar would be-- just quite annoying, growing up, you must've gotten confused constantly.
Liam: I walk away. (all laugh)
Laura: I follow suit.
Matt: About this time, as you've seen Uvenda's been looking out patiently, the water nearby at the very edge of one of the reef drop-offs splashes out, and you watch as a figure darts out and lands and shakes off, and what you see there looks to be a very, very dark-skinned, stocky dwarf, wearing the same goggles and throat bead there. "Sorry about the delay." He wanders up and pulls his goggles off and rustles his hair a bit. "Hello. So you're the ones traveling to the Aerie today? Waverider Durent. Pleasure to meet you." And he reaches over and grabs-- as he takes your hand-- you put it out to extend it, he grasps it and gives a firm shake. You see he's got very, very short dirty-blonde hair--
Marisha: Durent?
Sam: Yeah.
Matt: And a beard that is just tattered and knotted from not being kept or combed through.
Marisha: So someone you would find at Venice Beach.
Matt: Kind of, yeah. He's the Venice Beach dwarf, basically.
Laura: (gasps) That's awesome.
Matt: Straight-up, actually, now that you point it out.
Liam: Just finished going up the ropes and down.
Matt: "All right, I'm taking you down to the Aerie. You ready?"
Laura: I think so.
Taliesin: Sure.
Marisha: Are you gonna be with us the whole time, or are you just getting us there?
Matt: "Well, I'm just getting you to the door."
Marisha: Of course.
Sam: Wait, there's a door?
Taliesin: Oh, now we're really in trouble.
Laura: This is where we're gonna check out the lodestones, before we go through the door.
Travis: Right, yeah. Knew it. Making sure you knew.
Marisha: There's doors to the other planes. That's our people's job.
Matt: "It's a figure of speech."
Sam: We're going to another plane?
All: Yes.
Sam: Oh my. Okay. This is great. This is great.
Matt: "Oh, you look really excited."
Sam: I am.
Matt: "You shouldn't be. Now, come on. See you've got your equipment." And takes his goggles and puts them back on. They're bulbous, they're just these giant domes that make you look fly-like.
Taliesin: I love it.
Liam: Nice.
Matt: "Okay. Now. Follow suit." He looks over. "Thank you, Uvenda." "Of course. Take care of them." "That's not my job." And dives into the water.
Marisha: I go in first.
Sam: Wait, don't you have to make some of us--
Marisha: Oh, right.
Laura: No, no, no, wait, how long does it last?
Travis: Right at the fucking start.
Marisha: Are we doing this now?
Laura: No, 'cause we can do it underwater, can't we?
Marisha: Animal Shapes last for 24 hours.
Laura: Well, let's wait until we're going into the water plane before we turn into fucking whales.
Travis: Don't we have to examine shit first? With our non-flipper hands?
Marisha: Yeah, he's gonna be showing us the stones first, right? So yeah. Jesus. I go in first.
Matt: All right. So you guys follow suit, diving in, diving in, each one of you in the order you wish, eventually with Doty (splash) just sinking very heavily down after you.
Laura: He's coming?
Sam: Oh, no.
Laura: Tary, shouldn't we leave him?
Sam: How deep is this?
Marisha: I can't-- nope, he's a construct.
Matt: Do you prefer Doty not to?
Sam: I would prefer Doty not come. He can't swim, right?
Matt: No, he can just walk across the bottom.
Travis: We're not going to tell you what to do here.
Matt: Your call.
Sam: I'm a little confused. We're going underwater now, but not to where we're going for the mission?
Matt: Correct.
Marisha: The portal to the other dimension is underwater and through a rift.
Travis: Imagine endless water.
Laura: Just lots of water.
Travis: No possible-- bottomless.
Sam: All right, then Doty can come this far.
Liam: To the rift?
Sam: Just to the door.
Travis: We barely knew him. Bring him along.
Liam: Wait by the gate. Like a butler.
Sam: Yes.
Travis: That was quick.
Laura: What if he gets rusty?
Sam: I hadn't thought of that.
Laura: It might be smart to not have him join us.
Taliesin: The rusty Doty's another knot that you know.
Laura: Just leave him behind.
Sam: The rusty Doty? (all laugh)
Matt: What's your plan? Yes or no?
Sam: Doty, you should stay behind.
Matt: Goes to jump, like--
Sam: Stay behind, and just take atmospheric notes, you know. Time of day, position of sun. Type of clouds. And if anyone tries to steal my stuff, describe them very well in the book.
Matt: A little seagull flies overhead. (all laugh)
Sam: It's all for color, for the book, you know.
Matt: Another one. Just taking very, very good notes.
Sam: Two chapters of seagull flight patterns.
Marisha: You're gonna have an excellent book on the mating habits of seagulls when you get back.
Matt: Eat your heart out, Darwin. Doty's on the case.
Travis: Oh my god.
Liam: Love you, Matt.
Matt: It's ridiculous. So you guys all eventually dive into the water, and as you do, you look down and there is essentially a 40-foot-wide gap in the beach here, just barely submerged beach, that coasts down and drops off directly down into this cylindrical section that is just open. And as you drift down, your goggles visible, you can see around you, dry, pale reef that slowly gives way to colorful, life-teeming reef. You see hundreds of fish of different sizes and colors, all darting in and out of the various gaps and openings in the side, you see vibrant plant life beginning to massively jut out from the side of this reef. Further down, you see eels twisting through, and bits of kelp and other long, underwater plant life tickle your body as you push past and drift, keeping track of where you're slowly sinking down, desperately trying to follow this dwarf that is no longer in view, he just dove straight down and is far more comfortable under the water than most of you. Eventually, the reef begins to cluster in tighter and tighter, and you start getting a little nervous as to if you're going to hit a bottom or hit a pinch point. And then suddenly it stops, the reef just ends, and you now are floating down into what appears to be endless dark ocean. And just below, you see just a faint bit of light, and you start noticing the dark color is because you're about to hit an extremely dense forest of underwater plant life. You watch as all of these long, thin tendrils of almost vines covered in elongated leaves begin to curl up around you, and you start pushing through, following this light, and as you get across to the edge, Keyleth, you're the closest ahead and you guys have just enough light to watch the bead of where Keyleth is. Keyleth, you can still see Durent and keep that pace. He leads you down over this bank of where the top of this underwater forest ends, and you see, attached to the reef above by a single pillar of stonework that seems to be built or carved out of the reef, emerges a spiraling tower that eventually ends on the floor of the ocean here. It's made of a yellowish-white sandstone-like color, there are pillars carved out of it, naturalistic, but also have almost a series of bevelled edges to them. Within the inside, there is a dull green glow that is pulsating, and as Durent makes his way down toward one of the many openings in the floors, you can see there is a very, very faint sparkling energy that seems to just drift up out of the center of this tower. As you make it further down towards the base, you now begin to see through some of the openings, the center of this tower is hollow. It is an exterior, like a very thin Colosseum-like structure that goes up for multiple floors, slowly pincering as it gets to the top, and it is just an open interior inside. As eventually you touch down onto the soft bottom of the ocean here and begin making your way, slowly swimming towards the interior, you can see a number of other similarly dressed Waveriders as well as armored guardians that stand, all with various trident or spear-like weapons. A number of them appear to be of varying races, human, half-elf, elf, it appears that Durent is the only dwarf you see in this vicinity, and a couple of them appear to be merfolk, like straight-up half-human, half-fish, tails, fins, gills, the whole circumstance.
Laura: What does their hair look like?
Matt: (laughs) You see two of them, one of which is male. No visible hair on him, actually, just the frill that goes down his head. The other is female. Long, deep, dark blue hair that drifts past, and as she shifts and looks in your direction, you watch it hold in place and slowly shift as the water currents push through.
Laura: I just stare at her.
Matt: (laughs) As you're entranced by this, your attention slowly glides over to the very center, the base of this temple, where you can see there are these three large, smooth, gray-ish rocks that are embedded in the ground, about five feet wide, and in the center of these three rocks, you see what appears to be-- it's almost like an oval shape, about ten feet tall, about five feet wide, that is crackling blue energy. This opening, here. And you can watch as occasionally clouds of black, murky soot or sand, deep, deep ocean sand, push through. You can see, as you get closer and peer in, this is a doorway into the plane, this is the rift. Unlike the one that you saw at Pyrah, which seemed to flicker and have a barely contained energy when you've seen it at its torn-open stages, this appears to be fairly contained. It's demure, there's not a lot of movement, it's just stationary, and the guards that surround it in the center of this temple all look inward, keeping vigilant watch. As you follow Durent, making his way towards the doorway, you can see within each of these three large, half-buried stones, there is a smaller, deep emerald green, almost jade-looking stone that is about that large that is embedded in each of these. Durent points over to one of them, and you hear him, through the water, the throat bead carrying the sound of his voice through, "This is what you're looking for. This is a lodestone. Take your time, as much as you need, to study it. Find what you need. Let me know when you're ready to pass through."
Laura: Are they all the same color? Every lodestone looks the same?
Matt: Yeah, you glance through, they're all the same color. Slight variations, and the shapes change a little bit, some are perfectly spherical, some are a little oblong, just whatever shape it eventually hardened into.
Taliesin: Kind of a natural jade?
Matt: Kind of, yeah. But like a dark, dark jade. Like Maori, New Zealand jade.
Laura: Not translucent at all, not--
Matt: No.
Laura: Okay.
Marisha: Keyleth goes up and touches one and meditates on it for a second.
Matt: Okay. As you put your hand towards it, you feel a very, very faint vibration, actually a very similar vibration to the throat bead.
Marisha: Really. Are the throat beads green? Do they look similar?
Matt: At this point, now? You notice, yes, they're made of the same material. You see that a lot of-- the lodestones' main purpose is here, but a lot of the inherent magic of them, or at least the enchantment properties of it, it's a pretty big part of the general life here at Vesrah.
Marisha: Do the beads tend to react when they get closer to the lodestone?
Matt: There is no change. But you do feel that faint hum and vibration of power of the lodestone that is embedded within.
Marisha: I turn to Durent. Whereabouts do they tend to be found? The lodestones?
Matt: "Well, I mean, all over."
Marisha: All over?
Matt: "Who knows where they've been dropped. The ocean tends to swallow things up. You might have to dig. Mostly we find them buried."
Marisha: Buried.
Taliesin: How heavy are they?
Matt: "Let me show you." And he goes over and grabs one and (strains) and pulls it out. The doorway flickers ever so slightly. He's like, "It's fine for a moment." And hands it to you. You take it, and for its size, it is surprisingly dense. It has about twice the weight you were expecting, and your arms just (grunts) a little bit. Also, as you're holding it, you notice the clasp on your cloak is being pulled towards it. As you pull it away, and pull towards it, you realize these are actually fairly magnetic.
Taliesin: They're magnetic?
Matt: Yes.
Marisha: Magnetic. Percy, do you have a compass?
Taliesin: I don't, but I can fake one pretty quickly if we have to.
Marisha: Really? You don't have a compass. Really?
Taliesin: We never needed a compass.
Travis: What do we even have you here for, I mean?
Taliesin: Is it possible-- well, we're too deep now, but--
Matt: As you're having this conversation, you watch as Durent's patiently there.
Taliesin: You have a compass, don't you? And I'm going to hand it back to him.
Matt: "No, but I need the stone." Puts it back inside. "Okay, we're good."
Sam: If I examine it, do I detect any magic on it?
Matt: You do. Profoundly magical, this is a very, very strong natural magic source.
Taliesin: This is going to be weird. I'm going to take out a chunk of Whitestone residuum and just compare the color and see if there's any relation.
Matt: Make an intelligence check.
Taliesin: Look at my sheet. That's a natural 20. (all cheer)
Travis: The snitch returns.
Matt: Interestingly enough, there are similarities. It is not the same material, but you've had enough time to study whitestone, and get a feel that there are-- this is your first inclination that there are more than one substance that seems to be related to the nature of magic. This is-- at least based on the ecology and what little bit of history you've picked up from the kraken and how long it's been around-- whitestone may be one of the more recent sources of this type of power, or variation on this type of power. But there are certain comparable facets of its ability, yeah.
Taliesin: It actually occurs to me that I might have some magnets on my person. Can I make an investigation check? I had quietly in my head been using them to keep my coat down when I was running around with the spider boots.
Liam: The magic of improv.
Taliesin: I wouldn't say it if it wasn't true.
Matt: No, that's fine.
Taliesin: Can I make a roll to see if I happen to have some on me?
Matt: I'd say you have them on you. You're Percy. It's fine. They're very simple magnets.
Taliesin: Yeah. They might help with-- I'm going to try and see if I can use them as a very base dowsing rod for these stones.
Matt: You notice that you don't-- any sort of pull you feel on the magnet doesn't seem to hit until you're within about a foot or so of the stone.
Taliesin: Okay.
Laura: I do have Locate Object.
Sam: I pull out my compass and see if it works.
Matt: Okay, you pull out your compass?
Travis: You have a compass?
Sam: Sure. Yeah, I have a compass, by the way.
Marisha: Really, you have a compass?
Matt: As you pull it out, you watch, as you stand there, it's confused, it's darting around and doing circles. As you begin to step in one direction towards one of the stones, it rights itself in its direction.
Sam: Hm. Fascinating.
Laura: Nice.
Marisha: Will you keep that handy, you know?
Sam: Oh, sorry. Yes. One second. Just, still pressurizing.
Marisha: Sure.
Travis: Equalizing.
Taliesin: In my head, you have zinc all over your nose. There's just zinc.
Marisha: And a hula shirt.
Sam: Oh yes, do you want a--
Taliesin: Yes, we're really pale people, this is probably a good idea. No.
Marisha: I tap it, because I've seen other people do that, and I feel like that's what you do with compasses.
Travis: And it shatters.
Matt: (shattering sound)
Marisha: Ahh!
Matt: Yeah, it seems to be a functional compass.
Marisha: Do you want to be the compass man? Are you gonna man the compass? Be navigation?
Sam: The leader? Absolutely.
Taliesin: The navigator, yes.
Sam: The navigator. Sure.
Marisha: The navigator.
Sam: Sure.
Matt: All right.
Travis: Any other tests you brainy types want to do on these giant, green balls?
Taliesin: I feel comfortable. We have Locate Object, we have a compass.
Laura: Yes. Locate Object is concentration, and so is Pass Without a Trace.
Marisha: So when we get through the void, and maybe we can do a Locate Object and then Pass Without a Trace, and then I'll cast Animal Shapes, and then we go.
Matt: Locate Object, by the way--
Liam: That is a lot of steps.
Laura: It's within 1000 feet.
Matt: Yes.
Laura: Yes.
Marisha: But it lasts for ten minutes.
Matt: It does, yes.
Laura: Yes.
Matt: Okay. So. You guys ready?
Marisha: Yeah.
Sam: Yes.
Liam: Eh.
Matt: All right--
Travis: Are we ready?
Laura: Are we ready?
Matt: Durent looks at your faces as you're all staring and goes, "Okay. So. About time?"
Laura: Have you seen a kraken?
Matt: "Oh yeah, I've seen it."
Laura: And?
Matt: "Oh, it's fucking terrible."
Laura: How big, are we talking?
Travis: Immense?
Matt: "You know this, this size? It's a lot bigger."
Liam: How many Grogs?
Laura: Big enough to swallow him?
Matt: "Oh, yeah."
Liam: Like ten Grogs long?
Matt: "Hundred."
Liam: Hundred Grogs long?!
Matt: "It's hard, it's spatial awareness. Look, I'm not a science man like these two, but it's big."
Taliesin: I'm a science man!
Travis: Your beard is glorious.
Matt: "Thank you. Yours isn't too bad yourself, boy!" He tousles it up.
Travis: Yeah, hold on. Are there any barnacles down here I can put in that? Is it fast in the water?
Matt: "I'd say it's pretty fast, aye."
Liam: And you've seen it leave these stones, these lodes?
Matt: "I've seen him through the door. Oh, I don't go in there!"
Travis: Oh, yeah?
Matt: "No, I just watch the doorway. That's my job"
Sam: You don't watch him drop his lodes.
Matt: "I have not yet seen the kraken drop its lodes, no."
Laura: All right.
Liam: I have never felt more prepared than I do right now. Let's do this shit.
Laura: Let's.
Matt: "If it goes bad, come back."
Laura: Run.
Matt: "Just get back."
Laura: Right.
Matt: "You'll fail, but you'll get back."
Marisha: I'll fail?! Did you just say I'll fail? Okay, bye!
Matt: As you guys, one by one, plunge through the rift in the Aerie of Torrent, into the water elemental plane. And that's where we'll take a break. We'll be back here in just a few moments guys. Real fast, we do have a giveaway from our friends at Wyrmwood.
Travis: Giveaway!
Matt: We have a Hero Vault made of very aromatic cedar. That actually smells of the most glorious hamster cage ever, it's awesome. Aww, I love that smell. It reminds me of when I had my first pet.
Liam: It smells like poop?
Matt: So, this will be going out to somebody. Just to clarify, if you want to be part of this, you need to come into the Twitch chat. So, come into the Twitch chat. Our code word tonight is, guess what, 'kraken.'
Laura: Kraken!
Matt: So, as soon as that opens up in the chat, make sure you write kraken in the chat to be entered into the contest, and we'll come back with a winner of this awesome Hero Vault in just a bit. [break]
Matt: Hello, and welcome back everyone!
Liam: (shouting, away from mic) What, we're on, now?
Marisha: Jesus.
Matt: Yeah, it was quick, imagine that.
Liam: Holy cow.
Marisha: Hi, countdown.
Sam: Wait a second! Okay. Nothing. But they can't see the map, yet, can they?
Matt: They will shortly.
Marisha: The map?
Taliesin: They can't see the map yet.
Matt: So, as you guys emerge-- (all gasp)
Matt: Oh! (laughs)
Laura: Is it beautiful?
Marisha: Yes I just noticed it, yeah.
Liam: You just opened your eyes?
Laura: Aw, it's so cool!
Matt: So, this here is the exterior portal, into the floor. You step out at about two feet below the doorway, your feet (two dull thuds) slowly hit the soft, cushy bottom of the water elemental plane. You see about you a number of thick clusters of various underwater plant life, rising up and slowly shifting with the waves and the water. You also see throughout the dark sand in the vicinity hundreds of bones and various other chunks of flesh, in various long states of decay. It is dark down here, you maybe have about 20 to 30 feet of visual range right here unaided. Our two humans friends over there have almost no sight beyond a five, ten-foot distance here. Usually, from just the glow of your armor, your helm itself has this radiant glow about it.
Liam: I'm using Divine Sense right now to see if anything is not completely--
Matt: Okay, you're-- you're divining for what?
Liam: Undead. In the bones.
Marisha: Ooh.
Matt: Okay, as you carefully close your eyes and focus, you lend your essence out to the Raven Queen even across the planes to guide your vision to anything of undeath, or fiendish in nature. And nothing.
Laura: I'm going to take a moment to use Primal Awareness and see-- is there a way to sense krakens? Or anything.
Matt: I don't know, do you know how to sense krakens?
Laura: I don't know, do I?
Travis: Do you sense calamari?
Liam: DM snark!
Matt: Looking at your various choices.
Laura: Aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends and undead.
Liam: And krakens, it says right there--
Laura: And krakens.
Matt: Okay, as--
Laura: Krakens--
Matt: As you focus your attention, utilizing-- and mark off your ability there.
Laura: Yes.
Matt: You sense nothing. You said elementals are on there?
Laura: Elementals, aberrations--
Liam: Aberrations.
Laura: -- and fiends.
Matt: Which one are you choosing?
Laura: Oh, I have to choose one
Taliesin: Aberrations
Marisha: Elemental?
Laura: What do you think?
Travis: I think you should just get all of them
Laura: What do you think? Aberrations or-- what do you think a kraken is?
Sam: Aberration? It's an animal.
Marisha: You'll definitely find elementals because they're definitely here.
Laura: What would a kraken be?
Travis: An animal.
Liam: If it's not an aberration--
Taliesin: An animal.
Liam: It'd be a beast which you don't have--
Travis: A mineral. (all laugh)
Liam: The only thing on there--
Marisha: A mineral? (laughs)
Liam: The only thing on there-- that it is maybe is an aberration.
Laura: Aberration?
Liam: I mean, elementals--
Taliesin: They're not really aberrations.
Sam: They're aliens.
Laura: No?
Liam: There's nothing on this list.
Laura: All right, then I'm going to try for elementals.
Matt: Okay, you sit down and focus and dozens of nearby signatures hit you, you're not quite sure what direction they come from, but you know that this area is teeming with elemental energy, it has drawn many elemental powers nearby.
Laura: They're like everywhere.
Liam: They're all around us, man.
Sam: It's impossible, it's from inside the room!
Marisha: They're in the walls, they're in the goddamn walls!
Travis: This is really important. I fart. Do the bubbles go up?
Matt: (bubbling noise) They do.
Travis: We're in a safe place.
Taliesin: That was weirdly helpful.
Marisha: Do I see that?
Matt: You do.
Marisha: That's actually insanely helpful.
Taliesin: That's really, genuinely helpful. (all laugh)
Taliesin: Looking at--
Sam: (garbled voice) Should we use our flashlights?
Taliesin: (garbled voice) Why are you doing this with your face?
Marisha: (garbled voice) No!
Travis: I don't know, I don't know!
Sam: (garbled voice) I don't know, it felt--
Travis: Looking up, can you see any sort of surface to the water, like you would if you were 150, 200 feet, scuba-diving down, and--
Matt: I mean, your vision in the vicinity is dark, and you feel like you're at the bottom of a very, very deep abyssal ocean. Looking up, you see a faint turquoise glow in the upward direction but it seems sourceless, almost as opposed to straight up, it almost encompasses a full dome, and you see no sign of a break in the water--
Travis: That's what I thought.
Matt: -- and the various strands of plant life extend far into the darkness and strange kind of fuzzy distance where they fade out.
Travis: We in it.
Laura: I have a feeling light will attract all sorts of creatures down here
Travis: Yes.
Taliesin: I'm not entirely sure the creatures down here have eyes.
Laura: Hm.
Marisha: Most do have blindsight or echo-location, so they--
Laura: Hm, what about those kind of fish that have the--
Marisha: Might not be good for us.
Travis: Yep.
Laura: -- things that dangle in front of their faces?
Marisha: Angler fish, yeah.
Travis: Movement, light, shiny things, all bad.
Marisha: Mm-hm.
Liam: Tary's armor.
Laura: He's covered.
Sam: Thank you.
Marisha: Do we have a few minutes? I can do a quick Locate Object spell, see if we're headed in the right direction if you wanna--
Laura: I'm going to use a Locate Object spell
Marisha: Can I assist her in any way?
Matt: Nope, this is her particular spell to cast.
Marisha: All right.
Taliesin: I'm going to examine the sand, and just gently dig around to see what's around. This is fascinating, I'm just digging for whatever.
Matt: Okay. Your feet hit and pull apart, and as soon as you do, you get about four inches of the soft sand before you start hitting black dirt. That immediately starts to cloud and obscure your vicinity, so you carefully stop for a second.
Taliesin: Good to know.
Marisha: Wow.
Sam: I'm going to load up my flashlight with one of those Daylight gems, but with the lens fully closed, so no light can escape.
Matt: Okay, so you go ahead and you activate, so mark off another one of your opals.
Sam: Sure.
Taliesin: There's a red filter.
Matt: As you activate it as soon as you close the device, and you feel it contained within.
Sam: Okay.
Taliesin: You do have a red filter?
Matt: All right, you cast Locate Object, Laura?
Laura: Yes.
Matt: All right, so as Vex, you focus, concentrating on the lodestone that you saw before.
Travis: Through the portal behind you.
Laura: No no no, it finds similar objects.
Travis: I know, I know, I know.
Matt: Let's see, you feel the direction pull you this way.
Laura: Awesome.
Matt: You don't know how far away, but the distance pulls you in that direction.
Laura: There is a lodestone within a thousand feet that direction.
Marisha: You know, Taryon just gave me an idea.
Sam: I tend to have that effect on people.
Marisha: Thank you for your infinite wisdom, Taryon. We might be able to use a Daylight spell as a distraction worst case scenario, because I can place it somewhere and then leave it.
Laura: Oh, that is smart.
Marisha: Yeah.
Taliesin: If we have to use an opal we can.
Sam: Sure.
Taliesin: So, we can be far away when we activate it.
Travis: How far away can you place that?
Laura: She can cast it on an object and leave it behind.
Marisha: I can leave it. As a distraction.
Travis: Right.
Laura: You could--
Taliesin: Let's not cast it near the portal, though.
Marisha: I don't wanna do it right now, but I'm just throwing it out there--
Laura: -- cast it on the tip of an arrow and I can shoot it at least 150 feet.
Marisha: That's a hundred percent true, we've done that before.
Taliesin: Very good.
Marisha: Just keep that in mind. All right. Yeah. All right.
Taliesin: Filing it away.
Marisha: Okay, we have a direction, are we ready?
Laura: Let's try to move stealthily, for a little while. Or should I just drop it and cast Pass Without A Trace right now?
Taliesin: Let's see how we feel?
Marisha: Let's see how we feel. I'll go ahead and do Pass Without A Trace on us and we'll try and move in the direction that she called.
Laura: Oh good call. All right.
Matt: Okay. So, I need all of you to roll-- is Trinket still in your necklace?
Laura: (with hesitation) Okay. (all laugh)
Matt: That's not an answer.
Laura: I hadn't imagined him in but--
Taliesin: Everybody knows about the sea bear.
Laura: Yeah, he's going to turn into an animal so--
Liam: A killer whale, we talked about.
Marisha: Whenever he's ready.
Taliesin: When it's time.
Laura: Let's bring Trinket out. Fuck it!
Liam: Yeah! Killer whale Trinket man.
Marisha: He does have Water Breathing cast on him.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Yes, this is true.
Laura: So he can fucking swim.
Matt: Yes. Trinket does not have goggles. And cannot talk or cast spells underwater.
Laura: Well.
Marisha: I mean, he's a bear.
Matt: I know. I know.
Laura: What if-- Okay.
Matt: As soon as Trinket (splash)
Liam: He's having a singular experience for a bear, though.
Marisha: Yeah. (laughs)
Matt: (confused bear noises)
Laura: It's fun, buddy?
Travis: You give him a hard time. Like trying to get a rat in a bath.
Laura: Oh god. No, no, no.
Liam: I just (mimes scratching Trinket).
Marisha: Oh no.
Laura: I'm gonna cast, I'm gonna-- Fuck. I'm gonna cast Speak With Animals on him.
Taliesin: Anyone ever seen Bedknobs and Broomsticks?
Laura: Trinket?
Matt: Pass Without A Trace-- this is before or after Pass Without A Trace?
Laura: Oh, she's casting Pass Without A Trace.
Marisha: No, I'm doing Pass Without A Trace.
Matt: Oh. That's right, yeah.
Laura: I'm casting Speak With Animals.
Matt: That's right.
Laura: Trinket, everything's fine! You're just underwater.
Matt: (confused bear noises) "It's very wet."
Laura: It is.
Matt: "What's going on?" (all laugh)
Laura: We're going to be swimming for a while. You're gonna make me cry, dear. We're going to be swimming for a little while, all right? Do you feel okay with this?
Matt: (distressed bear noises)
Travis: You're drowning him, baby.
Laura: He can breathe, just breathe in. Just like land, only not.
Matt: (bear noises) He kinda lands in the sand. Looks around, very nervously. Looks at one of the nearby kinda floating pieces of weird errant plant matter and-- (all laugh)
Laura: Yeah. We're good? Are you all right?
Matt: "I'm okay."
Laura: All right. Just giving you a heads up; you may be turned into a whale in a little bit.
Matt: "What is a whale?" (all laugh)
Laura: You'll be really, really big and you'll be able to swim a lot better. All right? Just remember to follow my lead. And I'm gonna hang onto you when you are a whale, all right?
Matt: "Okay."
Laura: Okay. I love you.
Matt: "I trust you."
Laura: I trust you, too. I love you.
Matt: "Love you."
Laura: I'm proud of you.
Matt: "Okay."
Laura: I love him so much. I love him!
Travis: Say goodbye to him.
Laura: Shut up!
Matt: The slowest. You see him start like, just bear-paddling a little, under the water just like--
Laura: It's fun, see? It's fun. But paddle quietly, dear, we're trying to be stealthy!
Matt: "Mm-hm. Okay."
Laura: Okay.
Matt: Now are you casting-- Oh, no. You're casting Pass Without a Trace, I want everyone to make stealth checks.
Laura: I love him. Aw.
Liam: Fucking D&D, man.
Sam: Stealth checks! Stealth checks!
Taliesin: Okay. Stealth checks.
Matt: Stealth checks. All of you guys including Trinket, please.
Laura: Okay, okay, okay.
Travis: Don't fuck me, Gil.
Taliesin: Yay.
Marisha: I'm crying so hard. Oh wait, we're all doing them.
Taliesin: I'm so sorry for doing that to you. It was really unfair.
Travis: 25.
Marisha: Oh, that's good! That's good.
Taliesin: Plus ten?
Travis: 25.
Matt: 25, right.
Sam: 20! With our boost.
Laura: Oh, with Pass Without A Trace, right.
Liam: Yeah, add that ten, man.
Marisha: Yeah, 34.
Taliesin: 33.
Liam: 38.
Taliesin: Hut hut!
Matt: Rogues!
Liam: It's all I do.
Travis: Yeah, man.
Taliesin: They get the job done
Marisha: Rogues! They get the job done.
Laura: I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I don't know what to add for Trinket's stealth. Is that just his dex maybe?
Matt: It's his dex, yeah.
Laura: Okay, so 29 for me.
Matt: All right.
Laura: And 30 for Trinket.
Taliesin: He kind of looks like kelp --
Travis: Yeah?
Taliesin: -- maybe he's blending
Liam: He's just underwater ballet-ing, man
Matt: What'd you roll for Trinket?
Travis: 18.
Laura: 18.
Liam: Not making a sound.
Matt: Nice!
Marisha: Oh my god.
Taliesin: It's just a face in a giant brown--
Matt: All right.
Liam: Gently.
Laura: Let me make sure I'm right on mine.
Matt: You guys (water sound effects) start very quietly as you can begin walking across the bottom of the floor--
Taliesin: (Darth Vader-esque breathing effect)
Marisha: (Darth Vader-esque breathing effect)
Matt: -- barely, your toes barely touching the surface of the bottom. Making your way in this direction. You guys slowly begin to shift this way. Following this path. Now you're maintaining Locate Object, you said?
Laura: Yes, I am.
Liam: I thought it was one of these.
Matt: Now you cast--
Laura: Oh.
Matt: Is Speak With Animals a--
Laura: Concentration? It's not.
Taliesin: Let's hunt some scallops.
Marisha: Hunt some scallops.
Matt: It is! Concentration up to ten minutes. Locate Object is ten minutes. Oh, Speak With Animals is not, sorry.
Laura: No.
Matt: Sorry. Then you're fine.
Laura: Okay.
Marisha: Calamari.
Liam: Get some butter from the jug.
Marisha: Some Grog aioli, a lil bit of mayo, lemon.
Travis: Do we see anything swimming above us or around us?
Matt: Looking in your vicinity, you see clusters of ruins, you see broken pieces of very, very old stonework. And looking at them, they are scattered throughout the vicinity. Singular chunks of structures. Let's see. Percival, go ahead and make an intelligence check.
Taliesin: That'll do. 20.
Matt: Okay. Looking to the left of you as you pass by this one structure, you can see the chunk of wall that's visible, it is thick enough and tall enough where it looks like it's a sliver of the base of a larger structure that was designed for far larger creatures. The sense of the erosion and the relatively smooth edges of the various broken parts to it tell you that it's been there for a very long time.
Taliesin: This was for a larger creature, like, giants?
Matt: Giants or larger. It's hard to really tell. This is not a human-sized--
Taliesin: Did these ruins crumble, or did they sink?
Matt: They appear to have crumbled. The structure in which they're placed has intentional placement within here.
Taliesin: And is the stone-- does the stone feel natural, or does it feel like stone that would be underwater? Does it look like the parts of it that have been underwater are doing well, or does it look like it's eroding as something that should've been above the surface?
Matt: It looks like they're eroding as expected for something that's been there for a very long time.
Taliesin: And there's no writing visible.
Matt: No, no. They're almost extremely smooth. Just been there for so long and hit with various blasts of water current, sand, dust, and other things for such a long period of time that it's smoothed the entirety of the wall structure.
Taliesin: Okay.
Matt: All right, you maintain the Locate Object?
Laura: Mm-hm.
Matt: As you guys push forward, eventually it leads you this way, until you begin to feel the direction change this path, there. So you lead the path over this way, and it leads you to the edge of this wall.
Sam: Do you need some help finding it?
Laura: Can I look around? Does it seem like it's right there?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Laura: Okay. 25.
Matt: Glancing about the vicinity, looking over it all, you look at the wall, it's smooth, there's no indentation, there's no sign of a stone. Looking at the sand on the ground at the base of it, no sign of a stone.
Laura: Can I move some of the sand out of the way on the ground and see if I see anything?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Taliesin: Compass.
Sam: Compass, yeah.
Laura: Ten. Yeah, bust out that compass.
Matt: Yeah, you begin to pull apart some of the sand, and the black murkiness begins to come up underneath, and you don't see anything.
Marisha: I stand watch while they do this and just look for any movement.
Matt: Perception check.
Sam: Is the compass moving?
Marisha: Don't fuck me, Gil.
Matt: The compass is currently focused on the same direction that you're moving, towards the wall.
Liam: I'm going to join Keyleth as well.
Sam: I'm gonna cast Detect Magic.
Marisha: 25. No, 27. Sorry.
Matt: Okay. Nice. You glance this way, as you're looking overhead, you can see a dark, very large dark shape right about here, looks to be the shelf of some sort of an underwater stone cliff or a mountain of some kind that leads up here like a bank. At the very top, you see very faint movement. Looks like individual, long tendrils of some kind, just barely visible at the outside of your dark vision.
Marisha: I come over the intercom and say, Be very quiet. Very still. Very slow.
Sam: I don't hear that, so I just cast Detect Magic.
Marisha: Oh, son of a fuck, you don't. Motherfucker.
Matt: Okay. So you cast Detect Magic. You currently, in front of you, don't see any sort of magical source. Nothing seems to glow or emanate at the wall or near the base of the wall.
Sam: Within 30 feet.
Matt: Right.
Sam: Even under three feet of sand.
Matt: Let me double-check something here for you.
Laura: I'm gonna wander to the other side of the wall and see if it's on the other side.
Taliesin: I'm with you.
Sam: One foot of stone, one inch of metal.
Matt: Okay, you faint-- You still feel the direction of the magic where you're looking, but you don't see anything on or around the base of the wall. Do you move around?
Laura: To the other side of the wall, yeah.
Taliesin: Yeah, we're moving there.
Sam: I'll come with.
Matt: As you and Percy find yourself at the other side of the wall, there.
Marisha: Still keeping an eye on the dark figure.
Matt: The direction of the Locate Object leads you adjacent and just beyond the wall on the other side of where you guys were looking.
Laura: Ah, that makes sense. Do I see it now?
Matt: You do not see anything.
Taliesin: I'm going to gently pat at the base of the wall.
Matt: Okay, both of you guys make investigation checks, please.
Taliesin: Not disturbing anything. Investigation? 13.
Laura: (high-pitched) Nine.
Matt: You're both digging through and pulling at the sand, and dig further and it causes the black---
Laura: We're digging softly, we're trying not to do that.
Taliesin: Very gently.
Sam: I'm coming too, I want to--
Taliesin: If anything we're sucking at this.
Sam: And I'm going to cast Detect Magic again.
Matt: Focusing, you do feel a very, very faint magical essence from the sand about two feet to the left of where they're currently sifting through the sand.
Laura: Shh, shh, shh!
Taliesin: Shh!
Sam: Oh, okay, Jesus! I'm just trying to help us find the fucking lodestones.
Laura: We move over there to start digging.
Matt: Start pulling through, you get past the sand, you get to some of the black murkiness and you're careful and start digging before (clunk) you feel one of your fingers hit a hard surface and you begin to pull underneath.
Laura: I think we found one!
Matt: You pull and begin clearing the space around it, and it takes you a minute or so with the help of both Taryon and Percival, but you dig enough of this sand and soot from underneath to get around and you have there, currently in your presence, one of your lodestones.
Laura: Do you think they'll know, if we grab it, do you think it's going to attract anything?
Taliesin: I think we put it in the bag of holding and it won't matter.
Laura: Grog.
Marisha: I'll watch.
Laura: Can you swim over here?
Travis: I slowly make my way to the other side of the wall.
Taliesin: I imagine like Neil Armstrong.
Matt: Over the wall, meet the rest of your allies.
Laura: We lift it, and put it in the Bag of Holding.
Travis: Okay.
Matt: It fits inside, vanishes, you feel this slight vibration in your fingers as you take the stone and slowly relinquish it to the bag of holding's entry port. It vanishes within.
Laura: Hey, one down! Do I sense another one with my Locate Object spell?
Matt: You do, you get a sense of something in this direction.
Laura: All right.
Matt: Like a line pointing this way.
Liam: C-20. (all laugh)
Marisha: Hit!
Laura: All right.
Taliesin: Let's curl around.
Laura: Shall we hide, yeah, curve around so we can hide from the big figure up top.
Marisha: Yeah, I keep an eye on the big figure the whole time.
Matt: All right, I need Percival--
Sam: Me too.
Matt: Tary, Vex, and Grog, who are moving currently, to make stealth checks.
Marisha: Come on.
Sam: 24.
Travis: Come on, Gil.
Laura: Woo.
Travis: Nice.
Taliesin: 33.
Travis: Just regular, right? No plus ten.
Laura: Yeah, plus ten.
Liam: No, plus ten.
Taliesin: Plus ten.
Travis: Oh, sorry. 27.
Laura: 39.
Liam: Good job, Gil.
Matt: All right.
Marisha: Thanks, Gil.
Matt: Are you guys staying ground-level? Are you curving over? Are you going around?
Taliesin: We're going around.
Laura: Going around. We're trying to keep as, you know, stealthy as possible.
Matt: Right. So, you guys make your way around, heading this direction, following Vex. As you continue to curl forward, Vex, bringing your way forward, Trinket's kind of getting nervous of the distance.
Liam: I start scootching him behind the ear, I know this one spot behind his left ear that calms him down, as I watch with Keyleth.
Matt: Okay, so you slowly meander up to the side and help keep Trinket quiet for the time being.
Sam: A stream of diarrhea come out of his rear end.
Liam: Mixing in with the black sand.
Matt: Oh, god.
Liam: Like a squid in his own right.
Matt: You guys follow behind and--
Laura: Do we sense any kind of movement around us or anything?
Matt: Go ahead and make a perception check.
Travis: Yeah, I do that. Especially with that giant red rock right there.
Marisha: Do I do that too or no?
Taliesin: No, I perceive nothing.
Matt: You're not looking.
Marisha: I'm looking.
Matt: You're staying back with Vax.
Travis: Oh! 16!
Laura: Twenty... two. 21.
Matt: 21.
Taliesin: One. I saw nothing.
Matt: Okay, yeah. You come to this heavy, heavy piece of thick, natural wall-like stone that is heavily embedded in the ground. This is not like the previous ones that looked like it was carved, this is just a natural formation of stone that is jutting out of the sand, and it's a thick ten, 15-foot-wide embankment, maybe five feet thick and about six feet above. As you approach and get to it, you don't see anything that would mark it as different other than a series of-- you start looking down as you're inspecting and you see a series of skulls, some humanoid, some larger, some like almost elongated fish or crocodile-like jaws. Some of them are older, some of them are fresher, some of them still have like, bits of little thin tendrils of flesh-- (all groan)
Matt: That is mostly decomposed that drift off and change direction with the flow of the water as you make your way through.
Sam: Our masks are like--
Laura: No, we got goggles.
Matt: It's goggles--
Sam: Just goggles.
Matt: And just this little stone right over the larynx
Sam: So our mouth is free and--
Travis: Free in the water
Sam: Okay, I vomit. (all laugh)
Matt: (vomit sound, laughs) And this cloud of green, yellow, and brown just kind of emanates from the front of Taryon's face.
Travis: Feed the fish. Wait, quick question. Krakens don't like use shells do they like a crab?
Taliesin: No.
Travis: Okay.
Liam: They don't have fuck all.
Laura: I mean, do they?
Taliesin: They don't.
Travis: Just checking.
Taliesin: As far as I know.
Laura: Can we start looking for the lodestone?
Matt: Investigation check. Who else is helping?
Taliesin: I'll help.
Travis: No, no, I'm--
Sam: I'm looking at the compass.
Travis: I'm keeping an eye out.
Matt: Yep, you're looking on the compass.
Travis: I'm the lookout.
Matt: Grog's lookout, I just need Vex and Percy.
Laura: 18.
Matt: 18.
Taliesin: 13.
Matt: 13. You guys sift through the sand in this vicinity, poring around, trying to kind of dig across the exterior of the stone to pull away. You spend a good two to three minutes or so searching the vicinity and you don't find a stone.
Laura: Can I use the compass?
Marisha: No stone.
Sam: All right, I'll use Detect Magic again.
Laura: Well, can I just use the compass?
Marisha: Compass?
Sam: Yeah, what does it say?
Matt: It points in the direction you--
Laura: I wanna take it and bring it down to the ground and like--
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Like a metal detector
Marisha: Can I kind of start splitting the difference in case anything bad happens?
Matt: Okay, so you start making your way this way.
Marisha: Just very slowly.
Matt: Okay. I need you to make a stealth check. You as well.
Laura: Oh god, oh god.
Liam: Natural 20.
Laura: I feel like something's bad.
Matt: Roll for Trinket.
Sam: This music is fucking creepy.
Laura: Man. Why is it so tense?
Marisha: 31 stealth.
Matt: Good.
Taliesin: This Philip Glass nervous breakdown you're giving us is really--
Laura: That's good. 26 for Trinket.
Travis: (mimics music)
Sam: (mimics music)
Liam: 45. Natural 20.
Marisha: (gasps)
Sam: 41?
Liam: 45.
Matt: Holy shit!
Marisha: 45?!
Sam: 45?!
Liam: See ya, mothafuckers!
Marisha: That's your stealth? (all laugh)
Matt: All right, you guys make your way between areas as Trinket comes behind you--
Marisha: My god, 45.
Matt: Don't want him to stray too far in this circumstance.
Sam: I'm casting Detect Magic.
Laura: And the compass.
Marisha: And the compass.
Taliesin: We think we find him and it's just a rock.
Travis: Hey, you two, it's not a race.
Marisha: Yeah, hey Vax, oh fuck, it's a rock again.
Laura: Yes it is.
Matt: You sense the magical presence of it in the direction that you've been facing, but it seems further past.
Sam: Okay, keep going, it's around the rock.
Taliesin: Rock.
Laura: Again? Fuck! We go around the fucking rock.
Travis: You sure it's a rock?
Laura: I don't know, Grog.
Sam: Oh wait a second! Eh, all right.
Matt: What?
Sam: Detect Magic lasts for ten minutes!
Laura: So you don't have to cast again.
Marisha: Yeah, it lasts for a while.
Sam: So this is all one spell, yeah?
Matt: Yeah, you can maintain the-- okay. So you go with them?
Sam: Yeah!
Matt: Okay. Grog, you staying put or you going with them?
Travis: Staying there.
Matt: Okay. You all three searching, then?
Sam: Yes.
Laura: Yes.
Matt: Investigation check, investigation check, investigation check.
Sam: One.
Taliesin: Ugh.
Laura: 19.
Marisha: Oh Jesus, I thought it was a one at first.
Taliesin: Nine.
Matt: Nine, and?
Sam: Five, I--
Laura: 19.
Sam: I got a natural one.
Matt: You got a natural one?
Sam: Yeah.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Oh no.
Sam: The kraken eats me.
Matt: As you're digging through, your fingers, Taryon--
Sam: Yes?
Matt: Hits something hard.
Sam: (gasps) I got it. I've got it!
Laura: Shh!
Taliesin: Shh.
Sam: I've got it! (all shush)
Matt: As you pull up what you think is the stone, you look, and instead it's a humanoid head that is mostly skeletal bone with strips of flesh hanging off of it with one eye that is a pale swollen pink-white color.
Sam: (gags)
Matt: Yeah, you just start like (gags) you instinctively step back, start yelling about the point there.
Marisha: Richard Dreyfuss in Jaws.
Matt: Just for the sake of this, make a stealth check.
Marisha: Oh man, come on.
Sam: Natural one. (all groan)
Marisha: No, you are lying to me, you are lying!
Laura: Put that dice away, put that dice away right now!
Liam: Two in a row?
Sam: Yeah!
Marisha: No!
Liam: Wow.
Marisha: No, Tary!
Laura: Tary! You're fucking us, Tary!
Sam: (gagging noises)
Liam: (sings) Telling a story!
Matt: Holy shit. Okay. Keyleth, as you're carefully looking up in the shadows, you watch as this giant dark mound just diminishes and vanishes.
Taliesin: Oh no.
Marisha: And I just say, red alert, red alert, think we got a kraken coming. Think the weather is calling for a kraken tonight.
Matt: As you guys hear this, you glance about the vicinity and watch as suddenly a series of large tentacles (whump whump) around this large outcropping of what looks like stone or wood jutting out of the base of the floor.
Marisha: Please tell me you guys found a lodestone. Did you guys find it? Did you find it?
Laura: Did I find it while it was happening?
Marisha: Please tell me you found it.
Matt: You rolled a--
Laura: 19.
Matt: 19? You just barely hit the exterior of it when this happens. You're like, oh, I found it, you look over, see Taryon yell, and then watch this creature suddenly swift down and begin to crawl over the top.
Marisha: Vex, Vex, let's do the Daylight. Red alert, red alert, Daylight! Taryon, dig up the lodestone immediately--
Matt: I need all of you to make initiative checks.
Marisha: Fuck me! No!
Laura: Jeez!
Marisha: Fuck!
Taliesin: God damn it.
Laura: Maybe we can shoot Daylight directly into his eyeball.
Marisha: Natural 20!
All: Woo!
Travis: Do you really think Daylight's gonna help at this point?
Laura: In his eyes, maybe. He's not used to bright light.
Travis: Oh, thank god I have advantage.
Sam: It would help me and Taliesin see.
Marisha: That's true, not used to bright--
Liam: Aw, the humans. Aw.
Marisha: Just like, fwoomp, towards him. Over him, away from him.
Matt: All right. So.
Laura: Or directly at him.
Marisha: Towards him, yeah.
Matt: 25 to 20.
Sam: (whispers) I could've used Luck.
Liam: 24.
Matt: 24.
Marisha: 22.
Taliesin: Yeah, you could've used Luck.
Matt: 22, nice.
Sam: Forgot about it.
Taliesin: 17.
Laura: 19.
Marisha: Ah. Worked out yesterday. Ouch.
Matt: All right, 15?
Sam: 13.
Matt: 13.
Travis: 14 for Groggy Grog.
Laura: The Groggy-poo.
Sam: Liam, how do you remember when to use Luck?
Liam: Uh, when shit is exploding in your face?
Sam: Yeah, well, I forgot.
All: Ohh.
Matt: As you watch this entity suddenly emerge from the top, there--
All: No!
Taliesin: Not cool.
Laura: Whoa, he's really pretty in that light, though.
Taliesin: Yeah, he is very pretty.
Matt: Enjoy it.
Marisha: He's like a delightful Creole dish.
Liam: The inside of his mouth is so pretty (muffled yelling).
Matt: So. Top of the round. Vax, you're up.
Liam: Jeepers creepers.
Matt: You hear this noise through, and Keyleth giving the warning. As you glance over and see the top of this structure, the dark shadow of the kraken pull its way over the top.
Marisha: Don't hurt it!
Matt: You see this gleaming yellow eye on the one side that's near you, and what looks to be three, five, seven or more tentacles begin to curl over and pull it over the top, making its way towards your friends. What are you doing?
Liam: I'm clicking the boots of haste. And I am casting Bless on myself, on Keyleth, and on Grog.
Matt: Okay, what's the distance on that?
Liam: 30 feet.
Matt: 30 feet? Yeah, Grog is just in range.
Liam: You are blessed.
Travis: What's that mean?
Liam: It means on attacks or on saving throws, you can roll a d4 and add that for a minute, for the whole battle, basically.
Travis: Nice!
Matt: It is a concentration spell.
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: Great, thank you.
Matt: So that's your-- you used the Haste, you have your action. What are you gonna do for your movement?
Liam: I'm going to-- I'm 45 stealth, I'm going to back away to behind those giant shells.
Matt: Over here?
Marisha: Someone find the third fucking lodestone.
Matt: Your speed is 60 right now, so you can move 30 feet hasted underwater, swimming.
Liam: Mm-hm. So I'm gonna swim over that way. And I'm hasted, so action, action, I should have a bonus action, yeah?
Matt: Yeah.
Liam: So I'll hide, if I'm not hidden already.
Matt: Yeah, you can do that. Roll a stealth check.
Liam: Good, 35.
Laura: We would've been a bunch of whales slamming into shit.
Matt: Okay, cool. Yeah. All right, so. That brings us to Keyleth.
Marisha: How far away am I from Vex?
Matt: From Vex? You're not sure. You'd probably be somewhere in the neighborhood of 35, 40 feet.
Marisha: Let me move towards-- I say, Vex!
Matt: You've used Alter Self on yourself?
Marisha: Huh?
Matt: You've altered yourself, right, to swim fine?
Marisha: Yeah. I can do that at will.
Matt: I know. So how many feet do you want to move?
Marisha: Enough to see Vex. Vex?
Matt: She's just on the other side of the rock, and as you say that, you look up, and notice the creature, and you see Vex's head just barely poke over this stone barrier.
Laura: I'm going--
Marisha: Daylight arrow! Now! And I prep my Daylight spell for whenever she draws her arrow. And I wait for as soon as I see the tip of her arrow to go.
Matt: Okay. So you're holding your casting action until you see her arrow go.
Marisha: And then I say, dear god, please, Taryon, find the other lodestone. Don't kill the kraken!
Sam: I didn't hear any of that.
Matt: Because he does not have an earpiece.
Marisha: Fuck! (all laugh)
Marisha: Fuck!
Liam: That loud, though?
Matt: But you do hear it, because you're underwater, and because of the--
Marisha: These things!
Matt: You do hear it. It's a little garbled, but you pick up the essence of what she's saying.
Marisha: (garbled) Use the compass. Lodestone.
Matt: All right, Keyleth, you're holding your action.
Taliesin: Coldstone? That's a great idea!
Marisha: (garbled) Coldstone Creamery. Go for the raspberry cheesecake.
Matt: Okay, as the kraken pulls its way over, you watch as its yellow eye all of a sudden glows blue.
Laura: Oh no.
Matt: And you watch as the edge of its tentacles begin to (charging noise) give off this luminescent blue glow.
Marisha: No.
Matt: And suddenly this (electricity noise) burst of electrical energy shoots forth from it and completely encompasses the surrounding-- all creatures within 120 feet have to make a constitution saving throw. All of you.
Liam: d4, d4.
Travis: Yes, thank you.
Marisha: Plus a d4, plus a d4.
Taliesin: I don't get any-- my cloak doesn't get any bonus against this, does it?
Matt: No.
Marisha: Using the people-killer-- not bad. Not bad, people-killer.
Matt: This is a lair action for the kraken.
Laura: Oh, god.
Travis: A lair action for the kraken? 'Cause we're in its fucking fish-tank.
Matt: It's made this its lair for the past-- for a number of years.
Travis: Fuck you, Costco.
Liam: (laughs)
Travis: I meant Petco.
Laura: (laughs) "I meant Petco".
Taliesin: That's better!
Liam: Oh, yes!
Laura: Use Luck, Tary.
Sam: I did!
Laura: (laughs)
Liam: I did too! (all laugh)
Sam: And grateful for it.
Matt: All right, so-
Sam: 26.
Matt: Okay, so you take eight points of lightning damage. Percy.
Taliesin: 23.
Matt: 23, eight points of lightning damage. Keyleth.
Marisha: 19.
Matt: You take 19 points of lightning damage.
Marisha: 19.
Liam: 22, plus I'm set to lightning with the Deathwalker's Ward.
Matt: 19 halved to eight points of lightning damage-- oh wait, actually--
Liam: Halved twice, I should be quarter, right? If I made the save?
Matt: Oh, no you didn't make it.
Liam: Oh I didn't make it? 22 didn't make it? Oh.
Matt: No, I'm sorry it was--
Marisha: I said 19.
Matt: Right--
Marisha: And that took--
Laura: 18 damage.
Matt: I apologize, it was nine, nine, and 18 damage. So nine, nine, 18, 18.
Laura: I already forgot what I rolled, 'cause everybody's talking numbers. 14!
Matt: 18 points of lightning damage.
Laura: You got it!
Matt: Trinket?
Laura: Oh, shit... He doesn't make it.
Marisha: (imitating Oprah) You take 18 points of lightning damage!
Taliesin: (imitating Oprah) You take 18 points of lightning damage!
Matt: 18 points of lightning damage. Grog.
Travis: With my #blessed, 27.
Matt: You take eight points of lightning damage.
Marisha: (laughs) "#blessed"
Matt: Or nine-- sorry, nine.
Travis: Nine?
Matt: Nine.
Liam: #Bless bless bless.
Travis: Bless bless.
Matt: All righty. Vex, you're up. As you kinda reel from the sudden electrical shock that pulses out in the vicinity, what are you doing?
Laura: The Alter Self coin, does that take an action or is that--
Matt: Yes, it's to cast the spell on yourself.
Laura: Fuck, okay. Then I'm going to start with pulling out the arrow and doing what Keyleth and I talked about. Hey! I'm pulling out my arrow.
Marisha: Daylight on the tip of that arrow.
Liam: Finger guns.
Laura: And I'm gonna shoot it--
Matt: And you see it just slowly arc--
Marisha: Pew, pew, pew.
Laura: As close as I can to the Kraken's head and just, like, past him. I want it to go by the eyeball.
Matt: Okay, let me see here, Daylight.
Travis: You're throwing a meatball past a lion that's stalking you.
Laura: I mean, if I can get it in its head--
Taliesin: It's a really good meatball.
Sam: Hit it!
Laura: If I can hit it in its head, that's cool, but--
Marisha: It's a Hail Mary pass.
Travis: It'll be like, "Yeah, fuck these treats. I want that meatball."
Matt: Is this Light or Daylight?
Marisha: Daylight.
Matt: 'Cause Daylight you just choose a sphere for it to happen.
Travis: (watch talking)
Marisha: I've totally cast Daylight on an object before.
Sam: You don't need to.
Matt: You don't need to.
Matt: But we'll say for the purposes of this--
Marisha: But I can do that, right?
Matt: Sure.
Marisha: 'Cause I did that with Grog and his bull helmet.
Taliesin: So that way it'll stay lit over there.
Marisha: Over on the arrow.
Travis: (watch talking)
Matt: Sure.
Marisha: Like a flare--
Laura: What is happening to your watch?
Matt: Okay, we'll go with that.
Marisha: I don't know if that's allowed, but I know we've done that in the past.
Travis: (watch talking)
Matt: Oh, it happened, it happened. So as you hit that--
Travis: (watch says  "Zero miles")
Sam: What is going on?
Laura: His watch is telling him he's working out.
Matt: You're not working out.
Travis: Wow, Siri's fucking drunk right now. (all laugh)
Matt: I don't know, man, kraken just showed up. That sounds like a workout to me.
Travis: "Elevated heart rate."
Laura: Oh, I know! It said--
Travis: "Please, take a moment to breathe." (all laugh)
Matt: Well, on that note. Okay, so you focus as she draws the arrow and pulls with intent in the back of the bow. As you do, you focus and you watch as, Vex, you aim and then close your eyes as you see this spark of energy curl off the front of the arrow. You see bright, nature-based daylight burst out of the arrow as you release it. Go ahead and make an attack against the kraken with disadvantage, please.
Laura: Okay.
Marisha: Come on.
Laura: Come on!
Laura: Come on!
Marisha: Come on!
Laura: Come on, come on.
Matt: No, you were right, if you choose a point with an object you're holding, and one that isn't being worn, the light shines from the object. You were correct.
Laura: 26.
Matt: 26, that hits! Go ahead and roll damage.
Laura: (high-pitched) Okay. Well, all right!
Liam: Totally in-character.
Laura: (deep voice) 12 plus (normal voice) one lightning damage.
Matt: All right, so 13.
Laura: This is not a Sneak Attack and I obviously can't have done Hunter's Mark.
Matt: Right, so the arrow sinks into the underside of the kraken's dark form. You're just barely making out bits of its shape. As the light hits, you can see now, close to it looks like ten various tentacles curling and finding its way over the top of this structure. It slams into the side, and daylight brightly sprays out from under it.
Laura: I want it to be by its eye.
Matt: By the way, because daylight-- no, it lasts for an hour. So you watch as this light is now billowing from underneath the creature. You can watch as its pupil adjusts to the light. It does not appear to be blinded or have any issue with the daylight, however, it is now a beacon, and the arrow now partially jammed into its side, you have a very clear idea and a bright view of the battlefield around it as this kraken is now emitting light in its vicinity.
Marisha: Sure.
Laura: Well, now there's shadows.
Travis: And a giant megalodon comes and eats it. (all laugh)
Laura: Ooh, that'd be great.
Matt: So that's your first attack.
Laura: Oh, yeah. I can't do a spell for my second? I can't do Alter Self on my second?
Matt: No, you've already attacked once, that was part of the attack action.
Laura: I was just checking. Okay, do I still get disadvantage if I attack it again?
Matt: Yep.
Laura: Okay, I'm gonna attack it again.
Matt: It's not about aim, it's about the actual-- the water resistance.
Laura: Okay, I'm gonna attack it again.
Matt: Go for it.
Laura: What's 15 plus seven?
Travis: 22.
Laura: 22.
Matt: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
Laura: 12 plus... just one damn lightning damage.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: One damn.
Laura: (Southern accent) One damn lightning damage there.
Matt: You watch as the spark of energy from the arrow hits it the second time, the daylight obstructing your view, and the energy bursts around it. The lightning damage you're used to seeing from any creature it impacts, the lightning seems to just hit its blubbery hide and vanish.
Laura: Right, 'cause lightning-- it just did lightning. Obviously it's immune to lightning. Right. And I'm gonna use my motion to back the fuck off and try to get behind that rock outcropping. Laser pointer. Okay, yeah, sure. Just on the other side of it.
Matt: That's as far as you can get.
Laura: Okay, cool.
Matt: Because you don't have your Alter Self form yet. You're like (swimming noises). You're slowly swimming through this water, sluggishly.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: As far as you get Trinket, you want to give Trinket any sort of movement on this?
Laura: Yeah, can he back up behind that pillar?
Matt: Right here?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Yeah, Trinket moves up and guards himself behind the side. All right. Percival.
Taliesin: I'm gonna use my bonus action to cast Hex on the kraken. I'm gonna Hex the kraken.
Matt: By the way, Vax, did you make--
Laura: Oh, did I get a bonus action, I guess I could've--
Marisha: Don't kill it, don't kill it.
Taliesin: No, I just want to know where it is.
Matt: What do you want to do for your bonus action?
Taliesin: There's nothing I can do to it.
Laura: Can I hide for my bonus action as rogue?
Matt: You can.
Laura: Yeah, I'll do that.
Taliesin: I literally have only one power, and that's to electrocute it, which does nothing.
Marisha: These violet candies are delicious.
Taliesin: Really good. They're really good and they're a problem.
Marisha: Just delicious.
Taliesin: I'm going to dig the lodestone out of the dirt.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Don't worry about it.
Taliesin: I'm gonna spend my turn keeping an eye on the thing I just Hexed so I know where it is.
Matt: Okay. You go ahead and spend your entire turn pulling the lodestone out, and you're now holding it in your hands.
Taliesin: And I'm also turning to Tary and going, (whispers) find the next one, we've gotta get out of here.
Sam: Okay.
Matt: Okay. So that's your action. Do you want to move at all?
Taliesin: Yeah, once I've got the lodestone, I wanna-- well, I don't have the bag.
Laura: You're next to Tary, though, you can put it in his.
Taliesin: I'm gonna put it in Tary's bag.
Matt: Okay, so you move over and you're able to go ahead and put it.
Taliesin: And I'm gonna try and see if I can get some cover, as far away from that thing as possible. Whatever I can do.
Matt: Five, ten. You're not able really to get any cover, unfortunately, because the water's like (swimming noises), you're swimming through after putting it inside there, and you move along, you used your action to pull it up, kinda put it inside there. As the rest of the turn you just swim past, that's as far as you can get.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: All right. That ends your turn.
Taliesin: Oh, god.
Matt: All right. Now it's the kraken's turn. Let's see. Swim speed of 60 feet.
Taliesin: Fuck you.
Matt: It coasts around, this direction. We'll say it gets over in this side here, perspective-wise. Vex, what'd you roll for your stealth again? It was--
Laura: I didn't roll after I said I hid.
Matt: For your hide, because you're gonna hide for your bonus action, so go ahead and make your hide check.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: Stealth check.
Laura: Oh, that's good, that's good, 35.
Liam: Rogue!
Sam: 35!
Matt: Okay. By the way, Vax, I meant to ask  go ahead and make a concentration check. So it's a constitution saving throw.
Liam: Jeebus. I'm gonna use Luck. All right. 15.
Matt: 15. Okay, you maintain concentration on the--
Liam: Shite.
Matt: -- Bless to you guys, so you still have that. All righty.
Taliesin: I'm not happy with any of this.
Matt: So, the kraken is now--
Marisha: Don't kill it, don't kill it, don't kill it.
Taliesin: How can I?
Matt: Its tentacles begin to whip outward. It's going to make one strike against Vex--
Laura: Aw, he saw me?
Matt: -- one strike against Tary, and one strike against Grog!
Travis: Yeah!
Matt: 'Cause why not?
Laura: 35 is not good enough to hide from him!
Matt: Wait. That's right, you're hidden, so it does not. It's Tary, Percival, and Grog.
Laura: Oh, sorry.
Taliesin: You did this to me.
Laura: I'm sorry, that's--
Matt: That is a total of 32 against Tary.
Sam: Sure! Oh, yeah that hits. Yeah, of course.
Matt: Percy, that is 23?
Taliesin: Oh yeah, that hits.
Matt: And Grog, that is 23 again.
Travis: It sure hits.
Taliesin: Not speaking as Percy, this is legitimately nightmare fuel right now. I'm not sleeping tonight.
Matt: All right.
Travis: You got a problem with--
Marisha: You hate fish!
Taliesin: I do, I have a--
Laura: Oh, that's right, you hate fish!
Taliesin: Shh! Don't tell the internet, they'll find--
Marisha: I'm so sorry, you're so right!
Travis: Do it. Full blast.
Sam: Do not send him packages of fish.
Marisha: Holy shit.
Matt: Taryon, you take 16 bludgeoning damage.
Liam: Trinket kraken. Trinket kraken.
Matt: Percival, you take 20 bludgeoning damage.
Marisha: Yeah.
Taliesin: Okay.
Matt: Grog, you take 19 bludgeoning damage.
Travis: Cool.
Matt: And all three of you are grappled. The tentacle wraps around you and holds you in place. Your movement is zero currently until you try and break free.
Liam: Oh my gosh.
Laura: Oh god.
Taliesin: Oh no.
Travis: It's just trying to get a feel for the friends that are in its space.
Laura: Oh god, oh god.
Matt: All right. That ends the kraken's turn as it goes ahead and grapples three of your allies in the process. Grog, it's your turn.
Marisha: That's not cool. At all.
Travis: It's my turn?
Matt: Yes, it is.
Taliesin: It can regrow tentacles.
Travis: I would like to watery rage.
Matt: Okay, that's your bonus action.
Travis: Yeah that's my bonus action.
Taliesin: You should see a doctor about that.
Travis: And can I smash the titanstone knuckles together to cast Enlarge on myself?
Matt: Yes, you can. So, you shift into your larger form.
Travis: Yeah, I'm a bigger fish now.
Laura: This is bad.
Matt: You are still grappled by the creature, but you are larger.
Taliesin: This is monstrous.
Travis: Can I fight with the strength of the (sings) titanstone knuckles to break that grapple?
Matt: To slam your gauntlets together, that wasn't-- Does it specify an action on the ability? Look at the item.
Travis: It is an action.
Laura: Aw.
Matt: So you cannot break free currently this turn. That is your action to transform. You're still grappled.
Travis: He just got a bigger chew toy.
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: Sweet. I'm digging it. That's my turn.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: Can't do anything else.
Matt: Tary!
Sam: Ah!
Matt: You're up.
Sam: Me?
Matt: Yes.
Sam: Oh, Christ.
Matt: You're currently grappled, you can't move.
Sam: I can't move my hands or anything.
Matt: You can. I mean, you can't move, like your movement is zero.
Sam: My body.
Matt: You can do things. You can still cast. Any attacks are at disadvantage because you are currently restrained within the grapple.
Sam: Okay. The attacks are at disadvantage. Jesus.
Matt: Attack rolls. Spells are still unaffected but--
Sam: I'm going to reach for my robes, so carefully sewn by young Laura Bailey.
Liam: Who?
Laura: Who?
Sam: And rip off-- I think I have a patch.
Taliesin: Like Velcro pants.
Sam: Don't I have some spells on there?
Liam: Stop. Tary time.
Marisha: (sings "Hammer Time")
Sam: Is that from my robe or is that somewhere else? No, you gave me some scroll spells. Some spell scrolls.
Matt: You have some spell scrolls, you have patches on your robe, and you have your helmet.
Sam: I wrote down that I have a hypnotic pattern somehow. Was that a patch or was that something else?
Taliesin: Hypnotic pattern?
Matt: That's not part of your helmet, so that would probably be one of your patches.
Sam: It must have been a--
Taliesin: Like a boy scout!
Sam: It must have been a patch or something. Oh yeah! Yeah yeah yeah, patch! It's a patch. It's a patch.
Taliesin: Bravery!
Matt: Okay.
Sam: I'm ripping off a patch.
Matt: Okay. So you rip off one of the patches and you go ahead, and you're using Hypnotic Pattern?
Sam: Yes.
Matt: That weaves through the air inside a 30-foot cube within range. So you create a hypnotic pattern around the exterior--
Sam: Correct.
Matt: -- of the face of the kraken where the eyes are.
Sam: Yes.
Matt: So as you tear the patch off, you release it in the water and you watch the patch slowly drift up and for a second you're like, "Nothing happened!"
Sam: Wait, what?
Matt: And there's a spark out of your hand (pff) and you watch as suddenly there's an array of colors and various flashes in the face, in the area around the kraken's face.
Sam: Oh. Oh I do-- it worked! Okay.
Matt: Wisdom saving throw. What's your DC? On the item?
Sam: On the item. Jesus. So many things.
Laura: Magic is hard, guys.
Sam: I know!
Taliesin: Wasn't it easier when you just had to rhyme?
Sam: I know, right? It just says 'Spell scroll'. The item-- I mean, I think it's mine.
Matt: This is the Robe of Useful Items, correct?
Sam: Oh. Does that have its own DC?
Matt: The spell scroll-- oh yes, it is one of the scrolls.
Taliesin: It's nice to see someone else going through this.
Marisha: Yeah.
Sam: It's just one of the scrolls.
Matt: So yeah, I'll say I'll just use your DC.
Sam: My DC?
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: Is 17.
Matt: 17. Wisdom save on that.
Marisha: Spells suck.
Matt: That is a 21. So yes, it saves.
Marisha: They're great.
Sam: Ah, shit.
Matt: Unfortunately.
Sam: I thought we were taking him out.
Matt: So as the spark hits, the slight flash vanishes and you watch as the lids are still closed tight and they open with this horrible sickening sliding sound and the glowing yellow eyes still seem trained on various allies of yours in the vicinity.
Laura: Does he gots two eyes or just the one eyes?
Matt: Two eyes.
Laura: Got it.
Matt: All right. Is that your turn, Taryon?
Taliesin: He's not a pirate.
Sam: I mean--
Laura: Arr.
Taliesin: Arr.
Sam: Yeah.
Matt: All right, top of the round.
Sam: I mean-- I think I'll cast--
Travis: Holy shit.
Sam: No. I mean, he's got me grappled. I can't do Sanctuary, right? He's already got me.
Matt: Well, you've already used your action to try and use the patch.
Sam: That's a bonus action.
Matt: The patch is a bonus action?
Sam: Uh, no, the Sanctuary is a bonus action.
Matt: Then you can do that, yeah.
Sam: All right, I'll cast Sanctuary on-- on myself.
Matt: Okay. Sanctuary on yourself.
Travis: Don't act like you have to choose who it goes on.
Matt: All right, Vax, you're up.
Liam: Oh my god.
Matt: You glance just barely over the side and you can see it's already wrapped up Grog, Taryon, and Percy with its tentacles.
Travis: But one of us does not look concerned.
Liam: Shit.
Marisha: Get 'em undone.
Taliesin: I'm fine.
Liam: What'd you say?
Marisha: Get them undone.
Liam: I'm going to start-- who's the closest of all the people grappled to me?
Matt: That'd be Grog.
Liam: Grog, all right. I'm going to start swimming there over the shells. And I'll blow--
Matt: (counts) That's as far as you can go.
Liam: And I'll use my bonus action for more movement.
Marisha: I hadn't gotten that far.
Matt: Okay, to dash?
Liam: Yeah.
Marisha: Give me a week.
Matt: That'll give you just the time to swim right next to him.
Liam: Okay. And I'd like to use Whisper to tear into the tentacle holding him to try to get him free of it.
Matt: Okay. So are you attempting to--
Liam: To un-grapple him.
Matt: Un-grapple him? All right. I need you to go ahead and make a-- because this is not you in the grapple, this is him--
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: This is an athletics check.
Liam: Athletics check, goddammit Matt!
Matt: Acrobatics is to escape from it. To help somebody else you're having to actually physically force it off.
Liam: Plus-- that's shit. Shit. Luck. 11.
Matt: Nope. You try and grab, you're hacking at the side, but as you're hacking with the blade, you're watching as it's not quite beating past the hide of the tentacle around it.
Liam: Okay. I'm out.
Matt: Okay. Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: I knew that's what you were going to say. So all my friends are still grappled.
Matt: A lot of them are, yeah.
Taliesin: Three of them.
Matt: Three of them.
Travis: Just go get the lodestones.
Marisha: Yeah, I'm going to cast Locate Object, see if I can find that third lodestone.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: They're fine. You're fine. You're level 16, motherfuckers. You're fine.
Taliesin: Oh god, I want to die.
Marisha: I want to find the lodestone.
Liam: I've been in a dragon.
Taliesin: Please help.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Locate Object.
Matt: All right. The third lodestone is in the direction and just past-- it's this way, at least.
Marisha: I'm sorry.
Laura: Wait, which direction?
Matt: So you're here.
Marisha: Your hand is lateral.
Matt: You're here.
Marisha: Yeah.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: It's going this way.
Marisha: Towards the way your hand is going.
Matt: Correct.
Taliesin: There from you.
Marisha: Okay, I'm going to use my Alter Self swim speed.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: And swim that direction as far as I can. Do I get a better location on it?
Matt: You get there, and you're still feeling it in this direction.
Marisha: I'll double my speed.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: Yeah, that's really confusing. On a fundamental level.
Marisha: Can I do another investigation check? Is it near me?
Matt: Unfortunately, no. Investigation is one of those things where you spend your action moving through and searching in the vicinity. Other than your bonus action, that's about as much as you can get. You just feel it's in this direction from you.
Marisha: Okay. As a bonus action, who's near me?
Matt: The kraken's about 20 feet above you.
Marisha: Yeah yeah yeah yeah. Party members.
Matt: Party members, you have Percival, Taryon, and Vax. I'm sorry, that's Vex over there.
Marisha: Okay. I'm going to do-- you're fine, right?
Taliesin: Eh.
Marisha: You're great. I'm going to do a Grasping Vine and see if I can get Taryon out of the kraken's grasp with Grasping Vine.
Matt: Okay. From--
Marisha: A lot of big words.
Taliesin: Get Taryon out of the kraken's grasp with Grasping Vine.
Matt: Where does the Grasping Vine start from?
Marisha: Can I get it kind of towards that-- sorry, deal with me. This guy here?
Matt: This stone?
Marisha: Yeah. Yeah yeah yeah.
Matt: Right there? Okay so a vine curls up, whips towards--
Marisha: Taryon.
Matt: Taryon. Wraps around--
Sam: (choking sounds)
Taliesin: Oh no.
Matt: For this, I'm going to say this is an opposed check of the vine versus the kraken's strength.
Marisha: Strength?
Matt: I need you to go ahead and roll and add your wisdom modifier.
Sam: You're tearing me apart.
Marisha: People-killer. People-killer! That's good!
Taliesin: Ooh!
Marisha: My strength?
Matt: No, your wisdom modifier.
Laura: No, your wisdom.
Travis: Wisdom.
Marisha: Oh, just my modifier?
Matt: Just your wisdom modifier.
Liam: Wise as fuck.
Marisha: Wise as fuck, motherfucker! That was a 15. 26!
Matt: 26. It tugs and tugs, but it's not strong enough to break free.
Laura: Oh no! He's so strong!
Matt: The vine is now pulling back and forth between the tentacle and Taryon's like, argh! Being pulled from both sides.
Taliesin: Drop it, drop it!
Marisha: (yells)
Sam: (yells)
Laura: Oh no!
Matt: Unfortunately.
Laura: It's the Dread Emperor all over again!
Taliesin: All over again. Nope. Don't say it.
Travis: Break him.
Matt: It's a very strong creature.
Marisha: Okay, but I'm still-- lodestone's, over here! And that's all I get.
Matt: Okay, ending Keyleth's turn we come to the top of the round, I need everyone to go ahead and make a constitution saving throw as once again--
Marisha: All of us?
Matt: Once again, the kraken, its eyes light up blue and its tentacles release another burst of electrical energy in the vicinity.
Travis: #blessed
Matt: #blessed
Travis: Constitution, right?
Matt: Yes.
Liam: (zapping noise)
Sam: 15.
Matt: 19 points of lightning damage.
Taliesin: 21.
Matt: 19 points of lightning damage.
Taliesin: God damn it!
Marisha: Seven.
Matt: Ooh, 19 points of lightning damage.
Liam: Six, Deathwalker's Ward.
Matt: 19 reduced to nine points of lightning damage.
Laura: I get 19 points.
Matt: 19 points.
Travis: 32, and I have resistance to lightning damage with the Exalted Knuckles.
Matt: All right so you take 5 points of lightning damage. Trinket?
Laura: Natural 20! Just kidding, he gets it, too. (all laugh)
Matt: Okay, so that is 19 points of lightning damage. At the end of that turn, the kraken is going to go ahead and use-- let's see-- get in range here-- going to go ahead and use one of its legendary actions to do a tentacle attack against Keyleth.
Liam: Good gravy.
Matt: That is 29.
Marisha: That definitely hits.
Sam: This is a powerful creature.
Travis: It's like a crustacean beholder.
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: Keyleth, you take 21 points of bludgeoning damage.
Marisha: That really-- that hurts, 21 points, I'm at 91 so 21 puts me to 70, right? Yeah.
Matt: I will say I will use these red markers here as people that are currently grappled.
Travis: Gra-pelled?
Matt: Because you are now grappled and restrained, Keyleth.
Marisha: What?
Laura: (gasp) Oh yeah, he can grapple like all of us! (Southern accent) He's got enough of those tentacles. (all laugh)
Marisha: Who's not grappled?
Laura: Me.
Matt: Oh, Percival, because of your Hex, I need you to go ahead and make a constitution saving throw.
Liam: Your accent is showing.
Laura: (Southern accent) It's showing?
Liam: Yeah.
Laura: Oh no.
Liam: (Southern accent) You're talking like that.
Taliesin: That's a 19.
Marisha: (Southern accent) The later the hour gets--
Matt: Okay, you're fine.
Laura: (still Southern) No that's mom.
Marisha: The longer-- mom's been in town for a while.
Matt: That brings us to Vex. Vex, what are you doing? You're hiding behind the rock. You watch as four of your allies are now grappled by this creature.
Laura: Fucking A. I gotta use the Alter Self, so I can actually do something, though. I won't be able to get to anybody, I'm just going to waste a turn.
Marisha: Laughing at your accent.
Matt: All right, so you cast Alter Self on you as an action?
Laura: Oh, am I still doing it?
Marisha: A little.
Liam: Little bit.
Laura: (extra posh) I'm using Alter Self.
Matt: All right, so you grab the coin that Taryon gave you. You focus on it--
Liam: (Southern accent) Alter Self.
Matt: And your gills suddenly pull from the side, and all your fingers get webbed suddenly, and you begin to be able to move at your full--
Laura: Okay, I'm gonna swim behind the rock-- god damn it, light-- laser, no! The other rock, sorry.
Matt: This rock here?
Laura: Yeah, but on the other side of it.
Matt: Okay so that's (counts)--
Laura: And I'm gonna--
Matt: Your full movement.
Laura: And I'm gonna use my bonus action to hide again.
Matt: Okay. You still have your action, by the way.
Laura: Oh!
Matt: That was your movement to get the-- oh, no no no--
Laura: No no no, I used Alter Self.
Matt: Sorry, sorry, action was spell, movement, you're right, bonus action.
Laura: Bonus action to hide.
Matt: Okay, make a stealth check.
Sam: Trinket has to save us all.
Travis: Trinket's pretty low (laughs).
Laura: And you cast a spell so we can't use Pass Without a Trace Anymore? So that's 24.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: Okay. So you're keeping low. At the end of your turn, it's going to use its other two legendary actions to do Lightning--
Marisha: No, no, I cast Grasping Vine, which is technically a bonus action. It should not impede with my concentration spell, so we should still have Pass Without A Trace, correct? Nope! I cast Locate Object--
Laura: Yeah, you did.
Marisha: Totally ruined that!
Matt: Yep. Sorry.
Marisha: Sorry! Nope.
Matt: That's okay.
Marisha: Lodestone--
Sam: Marisha argues with herself and loses.
Travis: Totally loses.
Marisha: Yep, podcast coming to the alpha network. Project Alpha.
Matt: It uses Lightning Storm with its two other actions and begins to charge up now, and as most of you are in the vicinity you watch as the front of its mouth-- you now see between the darkness of the daylight that is glowing beneath it, the light begins to surge electrical energy. You see this strange beaked, sharp mouth that opens and as it does, bolts of thick lightning energy shock out from it. That's going to be hitting Grog, Vax, and Percival.
Liam: Bless.
Matt: So I need you guys to make dexterity saving throws please.
Taliesin: Yay!
Marisha: Big money no whammies, big money no whammies!
Taliesin: 23!
Matt: 23, you take 11 points of lightning damage.
Taliesin: That'll do.
Sam: Oh, wow.
Liam: 27.
Matt: You take no points of lightning damage because of your Evade.
Sam: Wow!
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: And?
Travis: 11, but I have resistance to lightning damage.
Matt: Right, so you take--
Liam: Pirouette.
Matt: -- 11 points of lightning damage. All right, that brings us to Percival's turn. You are still grappled and held in the creature's grasp.
Taliesin: Okay.
Marisha: Just get out, man.
Taliesin: Yeah, I'm going to try and-- is acrobatics a way to get out of this?
Matt: Acrobatics or athletics, your choice.
Taliesin: I'll take acrobatics. (all laugh)
Matt: All right.
Laura: All of us wiggling.
Taliesin: All right, so here go. Let's roll well. I get advantage on this, right?
Matt: No.
Taliesin: Okay, just thought I'd see if I could sneak that through. I rolled a really-- I can't reroll that with Resolve can I? No, 'cause it's not a save.
Marisha: It's a big-ass kraken, though, it's not bad.
Taliesin: 16.
Matt: 16? You try and slide through, but it's holding too fast. You can't escape, unfortunately. So that's your action.
Taliesin: Do I have anything-- with anything else, do I have anything I can do? Is there a bonus action thing I can do here? No, I am just-- yeah. I think about how easy it would be to reload my gun right now if I had one.
Matt: Okay. That's your turn?
Taliesin: That's-- yeah.
Matt: All right. It is now the kraken's turn. The kraken is going to shift over here. Still holding you guys in this vicinity, pushes past the area, kind of reaching the ground area. We're going to say push you up to there. It's going to go ahead and make a bite attack against you, Grog, you're the largest meat in this circumstance. That is going to be a 27 to hit.
Travis: That hits.
Matt: All right. So you take 27 points of piercing damage. Because you are raging it is halved, to we'll say 14 points of damage. However. As it pulls towards you, its tentacles pull up, and that giant piercing beak just (gulp noise) swallows you.
All: What?!
Matt: You suddenly-- everything goes dark, and you feel yourself being pulled into the dark interior of the kraken, the burning numbness of the acid of its interior beginning to burn away at the outside of your flesh. You are restrained, you are inside, you are blind.
Travis: Cool.
Laura: Oh my god.
Matt: You watch Grog, even in his large form, just disappear inside the kraken's maw. That's going to bring us to Grog's turn!
Travis: Cool. I'm in the womb again.
Matt: Yes you are.
Travis: There's fluid. Do I hear a heartbeat?
Matt: Very faintly you hear (heartbeat sounds). It's like a triple heartbeat.
Travis: Nice. Right. Cool. Am I restrained anymore?
Matt: Yes.
Travis: Because I'm in the gut?
Matt: Because you're inside, being crushed by its interior muscles that are pulling you towards its digestive tract.
Liam: It's fun, isn't it?
Travis: Nice, cool, yeah.
Laura: How do you break free of being restrained?
Travis: That threw off my plan.
Liam: Attack with disadvantage.
Travis: How about-- Yeah, let's try-- God, can I even make a melee attack here?
Matt: You can, it's at disadvantage.
Travis: Yeah, let's give it a whirl, and I'll make it a reckless attack.
Marisha: Yeah yeah yeah!
Liam: Bless.
Matt: Okay, go for it.
Travis: Bless.
Matt: Now it's a regular attack, just one roll.
Liam: Bless roll. Bless roll. Make that big roll.
Marisha: Come on. Come on. You're still blessed yeah?
Travis: Yeah, I'm still blessed.
Taliesin: #blessed.
Travis: That's a 30.
Matt: 30 hits.
Taliesin: You hit a creature from inside of it--
Marisha: Inside of it, yeah yeah yeah.
Taliesin: There's literally nowhere your fists could go that wouldn't hit it.
Liam: But it's like--
Travis: 23.
Matt: 23, okay.
Laura: Are you punching it?
Travis: Nah, I'm hitting it with the dwarven thrower.
Matt: All right.
Travis: Two hits.
Matt: Attacking again?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: Same thing?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: One roll.
Travis: 10. 26.
Matt: 26 hits. Roll damage.
Travis: 22.
Matt: 22. All right.
Travis: And my bonus action-- I would like to be very discouraged about my current state of affairs.
Matt: Just regular rage right now, right?
Travis: Yep, just regular. Can I use my bonus action to go into a frenzied rage because I have never been swallowed? And I don't like it.
Matt: Okay. Let me check one thing real fast, as far as the frenzied rage goes.
Laura: That's good, that's good, that's good.
Taliesin: How do you get un-swallowed?
Marisha: Please don't kill the kraken!
Travis: Fuck this big squid.
Marisha: Gonna have a really hard time explaining that to my ancestors.
Travis: We can kill them, too, it's not a problem.
Marisha: That's not-- no.
Laura: Maybe we can just rip open its guts and then leave it.
Matt: All right, so we'll leave that as the turn. So you go into a frenzied rage as your bonus.
Travis: Yeah.
Taliesin: We'll resuscitate the kraken if it comes to it.
Marisha: I could do that!
Taliesin: If we have to resuscitate a kraken--
Taliesin: -- we can resuscitate the kraken.
Marisha: -- we can resuscitate the kraken.
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: Okay, that ends your turn, Grog.
Travis: Yes.
Matt: Tary.
Sam: Pfft. Still grappled, yes?
Matt: Still grappled and restrained, yes.
Taliesin: Grappling with many things.
Sam: I feel like I should not be here, but there's no way I can break free. He's super strong, and I'm not. So--
Taliesin: Keep fucking with him.
Matt: As a note, too, those--
Marisha: Find the lodestone. I did tell you to find the lodestone.
Matt: I forgot earlier.
Laura: He's grappled.
Sam: (muffled) Okay!
Matt: Any of you that are grappled or restrained by the creature have disadvantage on your dexterity saving throws. I forgot about it earlier. It's fine going forward. Keep that in mind.
Travis: Okay.
Liam: Okay.
Sam: Okay. On dexterity saves.
Taliesin: Thanks, chat room.
Matt: Mm-hm. I just remembered from the rules, here.
Liam: Oh.
Sam: I will rip off--
Matt: I'm sure chat room was on that.
Taliesin: I'm sure chat room was.
Sam: I will rip off another patch. I'm just using all my tricks.
Taliesin: You don't need no stinkin' patches.
Sam: I will rip off another patch and use, because I'm touching it, I will use Vampiric Touch.
Liam: Ooh!
Laura: Ooh!
Travis: Ooh!
Matt: Okay!
Taliesin: Take you to a goth club.
Liam: The twins like.
Matt: Hah, take you to the goth club. All righty.
Sam: I think that's a touch spell, right?
Matt: It is, you still have to roll an attack to hit it--
Sam: Shit.
Matt: But it's a melee spell attack, I'm pretty sure. So Vampiric Touch. All right, so you use your action to cast it on yourself and then make a melee spell attack against the creature, so go ahead and roll a d20. With disadvantage because you are restrained.
Sam: Aw. So the lower of those two.
Matt: Yeah.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Sam: I can't use Luck on the lower of those two?
Matt: You can.
Sam: Oh. Okay. Okay, that's better. Still not gonna be enough. Plus my spell attack bonus? Is that what, how--?
Matt: Yes.
Sam: That's still not gonna be enough. So that's 20?
Matt: 20 hits!
Sam: Oh!
Matt: Yeah!
Taliesin: Worth it.
Matt: All righty, so that's 3d6 necrotic damage
Sam: That's not a lot
Laura: Ooh!
Taliesin: That'll help.
Sam: That's not a lot.
Laura: No, that's something.
Sam: Oh, nine, 14!
Matt: 14, so you do 14 points of necrotic damage to the kraken, and you regain seven hit points.
Laura: (gasps)
Liam: Hey.
Sam: Nice!
Matt: As you draw its life force away, grabbing onto the tendrils of its tentacles like, "Argh!" You watch as the necrotic energy pulses into it and pulls the life force into you
Sam: Okay.
Matt: All righty.
Sam: Y'know, small but okay.
Matt: All right.
Sam: And once again casting, recasting Sanctuary on myself.
Matt: All righty.
Sam: Because it went away when I did that.
Matt: Sanctuary is concentration?
Sam: No, well, I don't know, but it goes away when I attack him.
Matt: True. However, if Sanctuary is a concentration, 'cause Vampiric Touch is also a concentration.
Sam: Well, it would have gone away either way, right?
Matt: I'm saying, if Sanctuary is a concentration spell--
Laura: Oh, you can keep up Vampiric Touch if you want.
Matt: Yeah, you could do it every turn, if you wanted.
Sam: Oh, I can?
Liam: Just keep yanking that out.
Sam: Oh, well then, I'll just keep it going.
Matt: If you wanted to.
Sam: Yes, I do, I do.
Matt: The Sanctuary is not concentration. It lasts for a minute. So your Sanctuary's still on, you don't have to cast it again-- Oh no, you did attack. So you cast it again.
Sam: So I do have to cast it again.
Taliesin: Oh.
Matt: But yeah, so you can have both on.
Sam: Okay. I have both on.
Matt: There we go. There we go, we figured that out.
Liam: Lot of rules.
Matt: All righty. Top of the round. Vax, you're up.
Liam: Okay, I'm gonna use Disengage to kick away from this big fucking thing and start-- I'm hasted, so I should be able to get to Keyleth.
Matt: (counting)
Liam: And she's grappled, correct?
Matt: She is.
Liam: I'm just gonna start cutting. So, try to do what I did with Grog before.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: So, athletics, you said?
Matt: Yeah, I'd say cutting at the tentacle-- I mean, both are pretty rough for you because you don't do a lot of damage with the dagger. I'll say for the sake of going forward in this, go ahead and make an attack roll.
Liam: Attack roll. I'm gonna use my last Luck of the day. Because that was a one.
Marisha: Can I say anything to him in the process?
Matt: Yeah, you can.
Marisha: I can?
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: I say (garbled) Lodestone! Right there!
Liam: I ignore and I keep cutting.
Taliesin: I like that we all keep doing that with the fingers.
Sam: That's, we got that one already.
Liam: 16, 29, that's very high. 31.
Matt: 31 hits, go ahead and roll damage.
Sam: We don't know where the next one is.
Taliesin: She does.
Matt: Not Sneak Attack.
Liam: Right.
Marisha: No, this is the next one!
Sam: You found it?
Taliesin: She found the next one.
Marisha: This is the next one, I found it, where I am!
Liam: Because even though she's grappled, it's still way far away.
Matt: Yeah. The actual body, the sensitive part of the body is away.
Liam: All right, so, where the hell-- two, plus ten-- oh boy.
Marisha: I'm right there. That's me, the lodestone is over here somewhere.
Sam: (sings) That's me in the ocean
Sam: (sing) That's me in the spotlight--
Taliesin: (sing) That's me in the spotlight--
Marisha: (sing) That's me in the spotlight--
Liam: That's 15.
Matt: 15 points of damage?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: All right, you just rush to the side of her and begin hacking away at the tentacle. You watch as you're carving into it and it begins to break away. It doesn't fully--
Liam: I've got one more attack, so I'll keep going then.
Matt: Okay, go for it.
Liam: All right. This is venom. That's 24, plus--
Matt: That hits.
Liam: Okay, good, plus nothing. Where the hell do I keep putting my dice? Where's a four? Where's a fucking four? There it is, plus four is ten. I'll unload some poison in it, that's a DC 15.
Matt: Okay, it succeeds.
Liam: Okay. Is it halved then, or nothing, for the poison?
Matt: What does it say on the item?
Sam: Percival! Take this down..
Taliesin: Sure.
Liam: It doesn't say anything about halving it.
Matt: Yeah, so it's just--
Liam: So I guess that means zero.
Matt: Nothing.
Liam: So ten, for the second.
Matt: Ten points of damage. Okay, it doesn't quite carve away entirely.
Liam: God damn.
Matt: It's close, you can see it's taking damage and the tentacle's starting to pull away--
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: But it's still holding her fast. You're still grappled.
Marisha: I'm still grappled.
Matt: That's the end of your turn?
Liam: That's the end of my turn.
Matt: Okay. End of your turn, it's going to make a Bash action. Since Taryon and Percival are right next to each other, it takes the two tentacles, pulls them back,
Travis: Oh my god.
Matt: Whack! And slams them into each other.
Taliesin: Augh.
Travis: (cackles)
Matt: Both of you guys take 11 points of bludgeoning damage
Taliesin: Oh my god.
Matt: And are pushed adjacent to each other, which you already are.
Travis: I like this thing.
Matt: So, that's that.
Taliesin: I am not having a happy time. 11 points?
Matt: All right. Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: Hm, hm hm hm. So I'm still attached?
Matt: You are, yes. Yeah, there's a 30-foot reach on each of these tentacles, so you're still just on the outskirts of its reach. It's damaged, it's hurt, it would be easier to break free, but it would take your action to do so.
Marisha: Hm. I turn to Vax, grappled, and I say Lodestone!, and I point with the best direction that I can with my remaining--
Matt: Okay, so you point this way.
Sam: Did it make its wisdom saving throw when it attacked me?
Matt: Actually, you are part of the Bash, so that is an 18, plus 12. So yeah, 30.
Sam: Well then, yes it did. (all laugh)
Matt: Yeah, sorry.
Travis: Well, fuck. No need to add it up.
Taliesin: Oh, I have a saving throw, constitution-- I have a concentration--
Matt: Yes, you do.
Taliesin: No.
Matt: What'd you roll?
Taliesin: A one.
Marisha: A one.
Matt: Yeah, Hex is gone, sorry buddy
Marisha: Who's still grappled?
Matt: You are.
Taliesin: We are.
Marisha: Taryon and Percy?
Matt: Taryon, Percival--
Matt: Grog has been swallowed.
Taliesin: Grog is in the belly of the beast.
Marisha: And Grog.
Travis: Don't worry about me.
Matt: Yes.
Marisha: Okay--
Taliesin: He's happy. He's in a better place.
Marisha: I look at the twins, and I say "Lodestone! There-ish!"
Laura: I'm on the other side of the rock but I can hear you.
Marisha: Lodestone! And I do Control Water?
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: And I'm gonna redirect flow, and I'm gonna push all of us-- I don't give a fuck, we'll be fine, in this direction. You see my laser?
Matt: This way? You push yourself--
Marisha: I want to point us away. So I'm gonna redirect flow and go poof! And push us away from the lodestone, in the direction of everyone else.
Laura: (gasps)
Matt: This way. How many feet of movement?
Laura: Oh my god, can you get the water away from the kraken and maybe it'll just be on, like, landlocked?
Marisha: I can redirect the current of the ocean for a temporary amount of time.
Laura: Right, right.
Matt: Okay, so you and Vax both?
Marisha: All of us, just, me and the kraken, and I guess everyone who's still grappled by him are going this way.
Matt: Okay, keeping Vax away.
Marisha: Vax and Vex are probably still away.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: I'm going (sound effects)
Matt: Okay, so I want you to roll a d20 and add your wisdom modifier.
Marisha: Roll a d20 and add my wisdom modifier?
Matt: Yes.
Marisha: I've got advantage on that, right?
Matt: No.
Marisha: Because of Heroes' Feast?
Laura: (gasps)
Matt: It's your wisdom modifier. It's a wisdom check, not a wisdom saving throw.
Laura: Not a wisdom save.
Liam: Not a wisdom save.
Marisha: Ooh! That's good! That's a 17!
Laura: (laughs) That was, like, such a grandma reaction. "Ooh!"
Marisha: Plus 11, eight, 28! Ooh!
Matt: The strength of your control water does actually--
Marisha: 28!
Matt: -- is stronger than the kraken's current ability to hold itself in place, so yes--
Marisha: Fuck yeah it is!
Matt: The kraken gets pushed this way about 20 feet.
Sam: Does it lose its grip on us?
Matt: You guys get dragged around by 20 feet.
Marisha: Did he lose his grip, come on!
Matt: And you get dragged along with it 20 feet.
Marisha: Wait, who? Me?
Liam: You.
Laura: You.
Matt: Yeah, it pulls you--
Marisha: Not Vex and Vax?
Laura: No.
Matt: Not Vex and Vax. Just you.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: You forced the kraken this way. So yes.
Travis: Nice.
Matt: Maintaining concentration, your Locate Object fails, but you're still controlling, and you push the kraken, and the rest of the allies that are grappled, along with it.
Marisha: Get the lodestone!
Laura: Right.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: Were we supposed to get something?
Matt: That finishes Keyleth's turn. We're at the top of this here. So, let's see.
Marisha: Bathroom, I'll be back.
Taliesin: Yep.
Liam: Same.
Taliesin: Here to help.
Laura: Ah!
Sam: (sings) That's me in the kraken...
Matt: As the water begins to force the kraken this way, with it being pulled and dragged across part of the rock nearby, and seeing everyone pushed in that direction, it turns and tilts sideways, and as it does, it pulses with muscles, and releases this giant cloud of ink--
Travis: Yes!
Matt: -- that swallows this vicinity 60 feet in the area. The entire surrounding vicinity of the battlefield, all of a sudden, is now heavily obscured by black ink.
Travis: Awesome.
Laura: I bet it looks really cool with the daylight passing through it, though, huh?
Matt: It doesn't-- it encompasses the area and blocks out the daylight.
Taliesin: It's like watching creamer in coffee in reverse.
Matt: Kind of, yeah. Like the ancient in Neverending Story.
Taliesin: (sings)
Laura: Awesome.
Matt: Basically, yeah.
Laura: "I can't, I have to keep my feet on the ground!"
Matt: Vex, it's your turn.
Laura: That's me.
Sam: Now that Vax and Keyleth are gone, do you guys hear the faint flapping of wings and moaning?
Laura: Oh, creepy. Really creepy. I am going to-- Matt's like.
Taliesin: God damn it.
Laura: -- swim up and over towards my brother.
Taliesin: Thank you for that.
Laura: Towards where she was pointing the lodestone.
Matt: That's one movement there.
Sam: Lodestone!
Laura: That's with the altered self?
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: Okay.
Travis: Just like her.
Laura: I'm gonna have Trinket-- wow, okay.
Matt: You just move out of range of the kraken, but it does not see you because of your hide check earlier, so it does not get an attack of opportunity.
Laura: Awesome. I'm gonna have Trinket, for my bonus action, swim up on top of the kraken's back.
Matt: All right. We'll say Trinket's right there.
Laura: And try to claw through, because he saw Grog get swallowed.
Matt: Okay. There is Trinket, currently grappling onto him.
Laura: He's just claws, like, thinking he's going to get to the belly. He's going to attack him with a claw attack.
Matt: Okay, so make your claw attack against him.
Travis: Does it have to be at disadvantage?
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: Damn it, that was a good one.
Matt: I mean, all attacks are at disadvantage underwater.
Laura: Oh!
Taliesin: It's good. Nothing bad happened.
Laura: 25.
Matt: Okay. 25? That does hit. Go ahead and roll damage for cr-- for Trinket.
Laura: For creamer! Did you say creamer?
Matt: I was thinking "Crinket".
Laura: Oh, okay.
Matt: Different creature. That was with disadvantage, right?
Laura: Yes.
Travis: Yes.
Travis: 18 and a 16.
Matt: Nice.
Laura: Five plus eight is...
Travis: 13.
Laura: 13!
Taliesin: If only we'd brought your robot.
Matt: 13 points of slashing damage, as Trinket just rakes into the side of the kraken, cutting four distinct lines through the side of its armored crustacean exterior.
Travis: It does have that armored out like a lobster? It's not soft and rubbery like an octopus?
Matt: No, no, there are parts of-- the underside is, but a lot of it has this crustacean-like armor on the outside.
Travis: Okay.
Matt: All right.
Laura: And I guess I still have an action, because I can't get close enough to search for the lodestone?
Matt: Correct.
Laura: So I'm gonna try the thing that I saw very noisy Keyleth try earlier, which is to shoot out Grasping Vine and try to break someone free with it.
Matt: Grasping Vine is a bonus action spell.
Laura: Grasping Vine-- oh.
Marisha: Not concentration, bonus action spell.
Matt: Yeah, but she already used her bonus action to let Trinket attack.
Marisha: That sucks.
Laura: Oh. Okay! Then I'm gonna cast Conjure Animals and I'm gonna try to cast-- that's third level. I get summoned fey creatures, so what's a fey creature that swims underwater?
Matt: I don't know, what's a fey creature that swims underwater?
Marisha: You know, things that the Player's Handbook does not tell you. I just want to point that out.
Sam: I will say this, I know this for a fact, that it says in the Player's Handbook, the Dungeon Master will help you select a fey creature. (all yell)
Matt: You realize this doesn't help you...
Taliesin: Player's Handbook says a lot of things, doesn't it?
Liam: You just got chat roomed.
Marisha: Conjure Woodland Beings, it says right here--
Sam: Does it say it?
Marisha: Hang on.
Matt: To what CR, does the spell say?
Laura: To what?
Marisha: The DM has creature statistics.
Liam: CR.
Laura: Oh, CR.
Sam: Okay, it says the DM has creature statistics.
Matt: Great.
Taliesin: Do you have creature statistics, DM?
Matt: Let me pick one out for you.
Laura: I have my card, wait--
Taliesin: We're gonna get little fey minnows.
Marisha: Roll initiative for the summoned creatures as a group.
Liam: Edge-of-your-seat action from Critical Role.
Sam: Who can look up the stats first?
Matt: A fey creature...
Taliesin: Full-contact stats.
Matt: There are a lot of fey creatures in the Monster Manual, Wizards of the Coast. Just want to point that out.
Marisha: You know, I will say, it's a little bullshit.
Taliesin: There's shade being thrown in every direction tonight, isn't there?
Marisha: It's a little bullshit.
Laura: What is a rating one? Is that super lame?
Sam: Yeah.
Marisha: Yeah. Yeah.
Laura: Rating two is still super lame?
Marisha: Well, okay, so us as killer whales, we're challenge rating three. Except none of us are killer whales.
Matt: Okay, so you're conjuring a fey creature of challenge rating--
Laura: Two.
Matt: Two. One creature.
Laura: Yes.
Matt: Of two or lower. Okay. So.
Travis: You make Sebastian the crab.
Marisha: You get one fey creature--
Matt: I fucking hate Summoning spells so much, they are the bane of my existence.
Laura: I'm sorry!
Matt: Oh, it's okay.
Marisha: They're friendly, they roll initiative--
Matt: Because they're not in the beast section.
Taliesin: They sing like Disney characters.
Marisha: And they sing like Disney characters.
Taliesin: They braid your hair for a bonus action.
Marisha: Basically, Tangled. But not.
Laura: I'm sorry, Matthew!
Matt: It's fine, it's cool.
Laura: I'm sorry!
Matt: I remember all this. It's gonna be great.
Taliesin: Have we finally broken Mercer?
Marisha: You know, but like for real, they never tell you the best creatures.
Laura: It can be-- you know what? It can be an animal. I'm conjuring an animal. I can conjure an animal. I'm gonna conjure a shark. I've seen a shark.
Matt: Fey creature.
Laura: Why does it have to be a fey creature? I'm conjuring an animal.
Taliesin: Wait, I can do this.
Marisha: You know, that's a good point.
Matt: You know what? I'll let you. Sure.
Sam: Sea hag!
Marisha: (gasps) Is that a thing?
Laura: It's considered fey.
Sam: Sea hag is a fey. Two challenge.
Marisha: Thank you, Google.
Sam: Sea hag!
Laura: It says, 'Each beast is considered fey.'
Matt: Oh, I see.
Laura: You can summon fey spirits that take the form of beasts.
Marisha: And you can get a hunter shark--
Matt: You are right.
Marisha: -- which is a challenge rating of two.
Laura: Okay. I cast a shark.
Matt: All right.
Marisha: Hunter Shark!
Matt: Where do you want it to appear?
Taliesin: It's a hunter shark, but it's fey because it's dyed its hair with a pastel pattern.
Laura: Right around the kraken. I want it swimming around the kraken to distract it.
Matt: All right, we'll say it's right there. You get a shark now at the kraken.
Marisha: And a hunter shark has blood frenzy, which means the shark has advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that does not have all of its hit points.
Laura: And it's gonna attack him.
Matt: All righty.
Sam: And get eaten.
Matt: I'm glad we worked this out.
Marisha: We're those assholes right now. I just wanna point that out.
Matt: All right. Go ahead and make your attack on it.
Liam: For 80-something episodes, yeah.
Matt: Bite attack. Plus six, with advantage.
Laura: Roll what?
Matt: It has advantage, because it's been damaged. Plus six.
Laura: 11.
Matt: It bites-- a battle of futility against the armored exterior of the kraken.
Laura: It's more for distraction purpose anyway.
Taliesin: Caramel. Caramel. Ow.
Sam: Totally working.
Laura: It will be, if it uses up a fucking tentacle.
Sam: Yeah, no, it's great.
Taliesin: Yeah, no, we're in.
Travis: Yeah, he is so ready to use a tentacle on the hunter shark.
Laura: Hey.
Matt: All right. End of your turn. It's gonna go ahead and use another one of its points to do a-- let's see.
Taliesin: This is how he's been plotting our death.
Matt: Yeah, it's gonna go ahead and make a tentacle attack against Trinket, who's biting at it currently. That is a 23 to hit.
Laura: That hits.
Matt: All right. Trinket takes--
Laura: How close am I? How close am I? How close am I?
Matt: 20 points of bludgeoning damage.
Laura: Halved. Because of his armor.
Matt: Because of his armor. And Trinket is grappled, currently.
Travis: Jeez.
Laura: Everybody's grappled!
Travis: (sings) Everybody was grappled underwater! We're all... fucked enchiladas.
Matt: All right, as that's the end of your turn, Percival, what are you doing?
Taliesin: You know, I'm not having any luck getting out of this thing. Ah, god. And I get the distinct impression that the whole point of this creature is there's just no escaping it. I'm gonna start trying to cut my way out of this thing. I give up. I'm cutting my way out.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Just so long as we don't kill it.
Taliesin: No.
Matt: What are you using to attack?
Marisha: Just don't kill it.
Taliesin: I'm gonna use my longsword.
Matt: All right. So attack with disadvantage.
Taliesin: Attack with disadvantage.
Marisha: Please don't kill it.
Taliesin: I can't, it's just gonna--
Laura: It's just a tentacle, it's not--
Taliesin: Yeah, it's just a tentacle. With the intent to leave. Oh, that's not bad.
Marisha: I'm sorry, I just saw a flash of my future.
Taliesin: 23.
Matt: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage. It is not a dragon.
Taliesin: Okay. I do not have Hex anymore, so that's--
Laura: What if you turned us into animals now? Will that break the grapple?
Marisha: I could, yeah.
Taliesin: 13.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: And another attack.
Matt: All right. Go for it. With disadvantage.
Taliesin: Also 23.
Matt: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
Taliesin: Also 13.
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: And again.
Matt: Third attack with your sword, with disadvantage.
Taliesin: 28.
Matt: 28 hits. Roll damage.
Marisha: Did you roll both 16s?
Taliesin: Yes, they're both 16s.
Marisha: You did. They're both 16s.
Taliesin: I know. It's a metaphor. Oh.
Marisha: Oh! That's good.
Taliesin: 15.
Matt: 15. With that, you manage to finally--
Taliesin: Drop it, drop it, drop it!
Matt: -- cut through the tentacle. It tears open, you can see the dark purple blood beginning to cloud around the area, as you feel yourself freed from the tentacle's grasp. That's your action.
Taliesin: I am booking towards the big red--
Matt: This way?
Taliesin: No, the other way. I'm booking that way.
Marisha: Sorry, this thing looks very red to us.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Marisha: This thing.
Taliesin: Oh, and it's not red! Oh, that's so weird.
Marisha: It's not red, but on camera it looks very red to us. This thing.
Matt: So you're heading this way?
Taliesin: I'm heading the opposite direction of that fucking nightmare monstrosity.
Matt: This way?
Taliesin: Yes.
Matt: Okay, you can move five, ten--
Taliesin: I'm gonna get behind that boulder and hide, if possible.
Matt: Here? All right. Okay.
Taliesin: Bonus action to hide, or no?
Matt: Well, it's a bonus action for rogues to hide.
Liam: Rogue shit, yo.
Taliesin: So for my bonus action--
Travis: You just faceplant.
Taliesin: Is Minor Illusion a bonus action or not?
Matt: I'm pretty sure Minor Illusion is an action. Sorry.
Taliesin: I can't remember, I haven't done it in so long. And I'm feeling so useless. Yeah.
Matt: Welcome to fighting a kraken, buddy.
Taliesin: Oh, I'm gonna use-- I have a heal. I'm gonna heal. I'll use my bonus action to heal.
Travis: Selfish.
Matt: Okay, go for it.
Taliesin: 1d10 plus 12. Where's a d10? That's not bad. Okay, 18 points. Okay, good, I get 18 points back, yay.
Matt: Okay, there you go. At the end of your turn, Percival, it's gonna use its third and final legendary action to attempt to hit you with a tentacle. That is 21 to hit.
Taliesin: Yeah, that hits.
Matt: All right. You take--
Marisha: You're so grappled again, aren't you?
Matt: -- 26 points of bludgeoning damage, and you are grappled once more. (all groan)
Travis: (cackles)
Taliesin: 26 points of bludgeoning damage?
Matt: Yes.
Liam: Fucking meatbag, getting knocked around all the time.
Marisha: You spent your entire action getting away from him.
Taliesin: Yeah, that's fine.
Travis: That's a piece of shit. I love it.
Matt: Does that end your turn?
Laura: Krakens suck.
Matt: All right. Top of the kraken's turn.
Marisha: Fuck this.
Matt: Grog?
Travis: Yes? Yeah.
Matt: The acid from the interior of the kraken begins to--
Laura: Oh god.
Matt: -- begins to slowly pool around you, and you feel your flesh on the exterior begin to singe and burn and melt away.
Liam: Oh jeez.
Matt: That's a lot of dice. I'm going to go ahead and use the app here.
Taliesin: Oh god.
Laura: Oh my god, is it like being in lava?
Travis: I'm sure it ain't great. I'm sure it ain't like being at a fucking spa.
Matt: That is 45 points of acid damage.
Travis: Okay.
Laura: Gulp.
Matt: All right.
Marisha: Holy shit.
Travis: Fuck.
Matt: And so, turning around, the kraken's going to make its way back-- oh no, Trinket. Oh no.
Laura: Oh no!
Matt: Trinket is left this way, it's going to swim past to there--
Marisha: Okay, hang on. My Control Water spell has a concentration and I create a current--
Liam: Ooh, buddy, what are you doing?
Matt: Correct.
Marisha: In a direction for several minutes.
Matt: I agree. The kraken has an ability called Freedom of Movement, the kraken ignores difficult terrain, and magical effects can't reduce its speed or cause it to be restrained.
Marisha: Well, that's just great.
Matt: Sorry.
Marisha: That's wonderful.
Laura: What about my shark? Does it get an attack of opportunity?
Matt: Your shark does, yes. As does Trinket, technically.
Travis: This little bastard's high-spirited.
Marisha: Motherfucker.
Liam: The dungeon master is giddy tonight.
Laura: I get advantage, right, on it?
Taliesin: You are annoyingly cheerful.
Matt: From the shark? Yes, you do. Trinket has disadvantage.
Laura: Okay. 16 plus six is 22.
Matt: 22 from the shark. Nice.
Sam: Cast Hunter Shark on it.
Matt: All righty. And disadvantage for Trinket?
Laura: Oh. 14 for Trinket.
Matt: Trinket, unfortunately, his claws strike against the back of its armor as the kraken passes. No effect. All right.
Laura: Do I roll for the damage? Of the shark?
Matt: Yes. Oh, that wasn't the damage. Yeah. That was to hit. So yeah, roll damage for the shark.
Laura: 13.
Matt: 13 points of damage from the shark. Nice. Yeah. All right, so as the shark bites, and watch as it tears away, makes its way over towards the grappled Keyleth, its jaws open with its beaked mouth.
Taliesin: There's no room for anything else in there.
Liam: Hey, don't eat my girlfriend. I just got her.
Matt: That is 24 to hit.
Marisha: Yeah, I mean, yeah.
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: Does it ever not hit?
Sam: Oh no. Oh no.
Marisha: Am I about to be swallowed with Grog?
Sam: Yes.
Matt: 22 points of piercing damage, and Keyleth, you are swallowed by the kraken.
Laura: (gasps)
Liam: Seven minutes in kraken.
Laura: You can do something from the inside.
Marisha: 22 points, you said?
Matt: Yes.
Taliesin: Whoever actually succeeded in changing anything from the inside? Let's be honest here.
Laura: Aw.
Taliesin: You become part of it.
Liam: Let's not get--
Sam: Part of the system?
Taliesin: Just know somehow that this is a metaphor.
Marisha: 48 points.
Taliesin: For what?
Travis: Well, now it's a tribute.
Laura: Yeah, this one's crazy.
Taliesin: This is bad.
Liam: Let's shift to the fire realm.
Marisha: Do I see Grog?
Matt: You see nothing. It is black, blind, darkness on the inside, and it's not Darkvision blindness. It is folds of internal muscle, tightening flesh across your entire body, so not only is there no light, but there is no room to actually see anything, even with your Darkvision.
Liam: Fuck.
Travis: (fart noise) I'm here!
Marisha: Can I like-- a free action to be like, Grog, I'm in the kraken! as a free action?
Matt: You scream into it like, Grog!, as you're being devoured, sure.
Marisha: Grog! (gurgling noises)
Taliesin: Ew.
Matt: All right, that ends the kraken's turn, Grog, you're up.
Travis: Right. Can I reach around? Do I feel any dangly bits or something I might be able to yank on?
Marisha: Or like-- hands?
Travis: Or is it smooth? I know I'm like this, but--
Matt: You are unable to really feel around. You're like holding your hammer here, and the whole thing is squeezing against you and the muscles are pulling in, tense.
Travis: There's no way that I could try and push out with my legs to try and pull something out of the bag of holding, is there? It's too tight for that.
Matt: Well, what are you trying to pull out?
Travis: Maybe the alchemy jug?
Matt: You could probably pull the alchemy jug out if you wanted to, yeah.
Travis: I pull out the alchemy jug.
Matt: All right. And you force it out and hold it on the inside.
Travis: And I get super fucking wasted-- No, I'm kidding. (all laugh)
Travis: I look inside of it, and I say, oil.
Matt: Okay. The jug now produces a bunch of oil.
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: It gets to fill up the inside of the jug.
Travis: You know, sea creatures like oil.
Laura: Ew. Like, if you swallow cod liver oil, you vomit? Yeah?
Liam: Like castor oil?
Travis: Yeah.
Liam: It greases you up.
Taliesin: Unless you're a cod.
Matt: Or a kraken. All right, so you produce a bunch of oil for your action, inside the jug.
Travis: Yup!
Taliesin: Grease me up!
Matt: Is that your turn?
Travis: Yeah!
Matt: Okay. That brings us to Taryon. Taryon. You just watched Keyleth, the pinnacle of leadership, the guiding force in this whole adventure, get swallowed by this terrible, writhing sea monster.
Sam: It must be part of the plan. You're all seasoned veterans, right? This is all part of the plan, right? (screaming)
Sam: Oh! I've made a horrible mistake! (all laugh)
Sam: Caligo, take me away! Oh my God.
Matt: What are you doing, Taryon?
Sam: Well, I saw Percy cut his way out of the tentacle, so I will try to do the same.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: For all the good it did me.
Sam: I can move my hands, right?
Matt: You can, it's just any attacks are at disadvantage, and you can't move.
Sam: Okay. Then I will reach into my magic bag and pull out a vial of acid, and slam it on the tentacle and see if I can burn through the tentacle.
Matt: Okay! Go ahead and make a-- This would technically be-- a melee or ranged, but we'll say because it's so close, roll a D20 twice with disadvantage, so.
Sam: Oof. Oof!
Taliesin: What. What. What.
Sam: Terrible.
Matt: So, with your attack bonus for the attack.
Sam: Yeah. 12.
Taliesin: Did you just grease? Did you just grease that with tears?
Matt: Twelve? You reach out to pull it out and throw it. It tenses once, and then-- And it just-- It floats away.
Laura: Oh no.
Matt: Before it just slowly sinks into the sand and rests there.
Taliesin: Clink.
Sam: Damn it.
Laura: At least it's still retrievable.
Sam: Sure. Yeah. Yeah. That's good. And then as my bonus action, I will say to Percy, Percival, take this down! I, Taryon Darrington, being of sound mind and body, hereby do not leave my belongings to anyone, but prefer to be buried with them. (all laugh)
Taliesin: I'm going to gaze at him, as a professional gazer. I'm going to gaze at Taryon. And just allow my head wound to just bleed out.
Matt: You channel Brazio, and stare at him, to give him disapproval. With, wordless. Okay.
Liam: Sweet.
Taliesin: I hate you. And you.
Matt: That ends your turn, Taryon. That ends your turn, I believe. All right, Vax, you're up.
Liam: All right. I have just gone--
Marisha: Lodestone! Lodestone!
Liam: I have just gone whiter-- My face has gone whiter than it has since I became a paladin of the fucking Raven Queen, seeing Keyleth just get swallowed up, but I am going to trust that Grog and she are going to get themselves out of there, and I am going to look to where Keyleth pointed, and try to see a lump or something, in the sand.
Matt: Okay, make an investigation check.
Liam: Okay, I made a-- hold on, 18.
Matt: 18? 18. Okay. You just get to this part of the sand and you start sifting through and it's causing this cloud and you hear the water just being rapidly whipped through and cut behind you from the rapidly moving tentacles. As you pull through, you just begin with your action to uncover what looks to be the very peeking top of the final lodestone.
Liam: Is that one action? Because I have an action and a bonus action, so I'll just do as much as I fucking can to dig this fucker out.
Matt: Bonus action is a weapon attack. So you manage to--
Liam: I'm hasted. The hasted action is only a weapon attack?
Matt: Correct.
Liam: Okay. Fucking hell.
Marisha: Dig. Dig. Dig, dig, dig.
Travis: Hey, man, you're making progress.
Liam: I can't do anything, I can't do anything.
Travis: You're A1 sauce right now brother, you're doing all the good things.
Marisha: You're so good, you're so good.
Laura: Can you use a bonus to help anyone?
Liam: No, I mean I'm on concentration for Bless and they're both in there and they probably fucking need it.
Marisha: No, you're great, you're great.
Taliesin: Throw a knife.
Marisha: You're hot. You're great. You're good. You're warm. You're finding that stone.
Liam: I'm done. I'm done.
Matt: All right, that ends your turn. Then it's going to use a legendary action to attempt to hit you with a tentacle. That is a 28 to hit. All right.
Liam: Oh shit, 22. No. Hits me.
Matt: Yep. That is--
Liam: Oh, uh, hold on. Two. What's 28 to hit? Nah, wouldn't hit 28. Never mind. 'Cause I'm blessed but it's not much--
Matt: 28 points of bludgeoning damage. LIAM. Okay. Uncanny Dodge?
Matt: Okay, so reduce that by half, so it's 14 and you are grappled.
Liam: Oh, good.
Matt: As the tentacle wraps around you.
Taliesin: Does it have a limited number of tentacles?
Matt: Currently now nine.
Laura: Nine tentacles?
Marisha: More than us.
Travis: It had ten.
Matt: It had ten, now it has nine.
Marisha: More than us.
Taliesin: But if we keep playing it may have eight, then seven, then six.
Matt: That might possibly be an option.
Laura: Or it might just swallow all of us.
Marisha: More than us.
Laura: And then we just Planeshift from the inside of the kraken, and everything's okey-dokey.
Marisha: Which, I have Planeshift if all goes terribly wrong.
Laura: But we all have to be holding hands.
Marisha: That's true.
Travis: Ha, just you and me live. (all laugh)
Taliesin: The Grog and Keyleth show? I would watch that.
Matt: All right, so. That's Vax's turn. Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: Grog!
Travis: What, jesus, I'm right fucking here. Yes, it sucks.
Marisha: Grog! And I reach out. He's saying. Do I feel him?
Matt: We'll say that you're just, as the muscles squeeze you deeper in its body, you kind of slam into what feels like a hard bottom of a boot.
Marisha: I still have Control Water. As a concentration.
Matt: Make a constitution saving throw as you were damaged by the piercing maw.
Marisha: Yep, you're not wrong.
Matt: Which is, we'll say 24, so go ahead and-- can't remember what the number was but we'll go with that.
Marisha: Come on. Concentration?
Matt: Which you have advantage on because of your Warcasters.
Marisha: Which I have advantage, oh, I'm a Warcaster! That's 16. No, I'll take the 16. What?
Matt: Constitution saving throw.
Marisha: Okay. 22!
Matt: Okay, so you maintain concentration.
Marisha: Okay. And I find Grog.
Matt: You do.
Marisha: And I Control Water.
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: Is it watery in this?
Matt: No, it is muscles tensing, and a thin layer of acid.
Travis: And oil.
Matt: And oil is inside the jug.
Taliesin: You didn't pour it.
Travis: Oh! Is it not just floating amniotic, like water, in this esophagi?
Laura: No, that's what he just said, there's no water.
Matt: Currently you're in the stomach, not the esophagus.
Travis: Anatomy.
Marisha: No water, though? I can't like jettison myself out of this guy's mouth? All right.
Matt: You can spend your action to try?
Marisha: Okay. No. That's fine.
Taliesin: There's options.
Matt: There's not a lot of water in this space. Right now, it's mostly like actual stomach acid of the creature and muscles that are tensing around.
Marisha: Okay. We have oil. Right?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: I tell Grog, I say, Hold on, and I cast a Fireball right in front of us, to try and jettison ourselves out with my Spire.
Travis: I'm a big fan of this.
Marisha: With my Spire of Conflux I go (explosion) and try and give this motherfucker the worst heartburn he's ever experienced.
Travis: Yeah get your Zantac 75 now, bitch.
Matt: Okay!
Taliesin: You put that kraken on Hot Pepper Gaming.
Matt: I need you both to make dexterity saving throws with disadvantage.
Laura: He's going to shoot out some watery lodestones.
Travis: I'm at advantage, though, so I just roll one.
Taliesin: Lode liquid.
Matt: Yes. Okay.
Liam: Jackpot. Dex save at disadvantage.
Travis: 11. Oh wait, man, wait, blessed.
Marisha: I'm making a dex save?
Matt: At disadvantage.
Marisha: At disadvantage.
Travis: 13.
Marisha: At disadvantage? That was eight. Plus dex, which is five, so that's--
Laura: Plus bless!
Marisha: Plus blessed!
Taliesin: Hashtag.
Marisha: #blessed. Ooh, that's good, that's good. That's 13, so that's 18!
Matt: What's the DC on the spell for your staff?
Marisha: It doesn't say.
Matt: So it'd be your spell DC.
Marisha: Which is 20. If I'm fully equipped.
Matt: Yeah, so you do not make your save. Your spell's too powerful. So you go ahead and roll damage.
Marisha: On myself.
Laura: Oh!
Travis: Oh, like a, 13.
Matt: Yep. So go ahead and roll 8d6 damage, to you, you and the kraken. Usually if a creature's fully submerged in water it has damage resistance because of the water around it. However, the spell is inside of it so I will say that it does not get the fire resistance.
Travis: I do have fire resistance, so I'm okay. I'm excited about this.
Matt: You take half damage.
Laura: Oh my gosh.
Marisha: I will be exceedingly angry if I have to--
Taliesin: We will save the kraken.
Laura: If you knock yourself unconscious with your own fireball?
Marisha: I don't care about that, I care more about the kraken at this point. This is my life's work. Literally Keyleth's life work.
Taliesin: Oh wow, a lot happened there.
Marisha: Okay, five, six, seven, eight, nine, plus four, which is 13, plus another six which is 16, 19, and a six which is 25.
Travis: 25.
Matt: 25, was what you needed to force it to make a constitution saving throw.
Travis: 25 exactly? Wow.
Laura: Wow.
Matt: Well, based on the circumstances I halved the damage required for it to make the saving throw to regurgitate. However a fireball explosion based on the--
Marisha: Three, four, five, six, seven, eight. I'm sorry. You said 8d6?
Matt: Yes.
Marisha: It's actually 29 points.
Matt: All right. So--
Marisha: Please don't kill this thing.
Matt: No. As the Fireball explodes, the oil that you created inside ignites and also detonates.
Taliesin: Yes!
Travis: Alchemy jug!
Matt: Roll a d20 for the strength of the jug.
Laura: No! It could kill the jug!
Marisha: Who? Him? No, Grog!
Laura: That's good.
Travis: 15.
Matt: Okay. The jug withstands the force of the blow. (all cheer)
Taliesin: Good jug.
Matt: The jug, however, detonates.
Taliesin: Yeah! I love everything that's happening.
Sam: That's gonna be extra damage to you, Groggy-pants.
Matt: For an additional 18 points of fire damage to both of you.
Liam: Kraken's gonna get burning squirts.
Laura: Oh shit.
Taliesin: And the kraken.
Travis: To half because I have fire resistance.
Matt: And the kraken.
Marisha: 18 points, that I can deal with.
Sam: Plus 25.
Marisha: Wait, plus 25?
Matt: This is on top of what you did.
Travis: So 39.
Matt: Correct.
Marisha: So 25 plus 18 which is what--
Sam: 43.
Matt: That would be 43.
Marisha: 43 points of damage!
Taliesin: You're alive!
Travis: 22 to me, because, resistance.
Marisha: I am alive.
Matt: Fucking rolled a natural one!
Travis: Did you? (all yell)
Matt: I'm not even joking. On its constitution, it's a DC 25 constitution saving throw, even with +15, it's a natural one. And so (explosion) it bursts inside, you watch the eyes bulge on the outside of this kraken as suddenly it vomits out a burst of smoke, dark, kind of bloody water, acid, and both Keyleth and Grog are jettisoned out of the front of the kraken's mouth.
Taliesin: What are the chances it dropped any of us while this happened?
Matt: Nothing.
Taliesin: Nothing.
Sam: Yeah.
Marisha: But Grog and I are out?
Liam: But, everyone on the outside just goes--
Taliesin: Kinda what I was expecting, to be magnificently frank.
Sam: I see him vomit, and I'm like, you and me both, buddy. (all laugh)
Marisha: Do I still have a bonus action?
Matt: You would, yes.
Marisha: I'm going to cast Healing Word on myself.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: At second level. Sorry.
Matt: Go for it.
Marisha: That's two. Because I'm hurting.
Matt: Remember, you still have your Wild Shape forms too.
Marisha: Oh, I know.
Matt: Okay, that ends your turn, Keyleth.
Marisha: Four, five, plus-- six. Yep, that ends my turn.
Matt: All right. Secondary legendary action to go ahead and as soon as you guys emerge, one of its tentacles wraps out in your direction, Keyleth. That's a-- plus 18, yeah that hits you for like 32. So as soon as you emerge, you look around, one of the tentacles wraps around you, and you take 19 points of bludgeoning damage.
Taliesin: Oh, god.
Matt: And you are grappled by the tentacle.
Marisha: So glad I healed myself.
Laura: Mother fuck.
Marisha: 19 points.
Sam: What are you down to?
Marisha: Seven points.
Matt: All right. That brings us to the next lair action.
Taliesin: God damn it.
Matt: Everything is still obscured in this black inky space, by the way. Oh, you guys missed that while you were away. The kraken did an ink jet and filled this entire 60-foot radius with ink. The whole area is drastically obscured.
Marisha: Even though there's my Control Water current going outward? Which lasts for ten minutes!
Matt: Well, lasts for ten minutes while you're concentrating, did you maintain concentration--
Marisha: I haven't broke concentration--
Matt: That's true--
Marisha: I saved for it.
Matt: Well, save right now.
Marisha: I already saved for it while I was inside of him. I can save again.
Matt: Right, but you just took damage from the--
Taliesin: From the tentacles.
Matt: From the tentacles. However, you are correct, the water jet did clear out the ink from this area.
Marisha: It's not terrible. My wisdom-- 19.
Matt: Not wisdom, plus your constitution.
Marisha: Not as good.
Liam: Bless!
Marisha: Plus bless, which is good. Wait, what was that?
Taliesin: Three.
Marisha: That was three, thank you, three. Sorry, constitution.
Sam: Constitution.
Marisha: 16! 16!
Matt: Okay, that's enough, you maintain concentration. So yeah, so you've now cleared out this section, this section is cleared of ink. Control Water, the stream you've been doing has cleared out this area, so yeah.
Marisha: Jeez, guys.
Laura: Slowest math.
Marisha: Gil. Gil bought us kraken.
Matt: All right, so--
Marisha: Blame Gil.
Liam: Kraken for kraken.
Marisha: Don't fuck me, Gil!
Matt: All right at this point, as it is now the 20 count on the lair action, the kraken once again gives another pulse of electrical energy, everything in the area, I need everyone to go ahead and make a constitution saving throw.
Sam: 25!
Matt: All right, five points of lightning damage.
Marisha: Player-killer, not great.
Taliesin: 18.
Matt: 18? You take ten points of lightning damage. Keyleth?
Marisha: Seven.
Matt: Ten points of lightning damage.
Taliesin: And she's out!
Marisha: I'm unconscious.
Liam: 19, Deathwalker's Ward
Matt: So five points of lightning damage.
Marisha: Keyleth is unconscious.
Taliesin: Just barely.
Laura: 16 for me.
Matt: Ten points of lightning damage. Grog?
Laura: And 14 for Trinket, so--
Travis: It's a 15, but I have resistance, so--
Matt: So five points of lightning damage. And Trinket was what?
Laura: He is ten points.
Matt: Ten points, okay, so. Keyleth goes unconscious, you watch as she just gets jettisoned out and the lightning streaks through her and eyes darken and she kinda falls limp in the water as the tentacle begins to slowly draw her back to its maw.
Laura: Fuck.
Taliesin: God damn it.
Matt: Vex, you're up.
Laura: Okay. I'm gonna keep moving towards the lodestone and my brother.
Laura: I see where it came out, right?
Matt: That's as close as you get right here in this position.
Laura: So can I use my-- can I get it out of the water and put in my bag of colding?
Matt: You spend your action to free it and you get it out of the water and put it into the bag of holding.
Marisha: That's all three, right?
Matt: So you have a bag of holding?
Laura: I have a bag of colding.
Matt: Colding? Okay, yeah, you can put it there. It has enough space.
Marisha: Three?
Taliesin: We've got all three.
Marisha: We have all three?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: You have all three lodestones currently.
Laura: Okay--
Liam: Is Keyleth--
Laura: We're all going to die, but we have three lodestones doing it.
Liam: Is Keyleth still grappled while unconscious?
Taliesin: Yes.
Matt: Correct.
Liam: Shit.
Laura: And I guess for-- god. For my bonus action, can I-- I don't know what to do. I'm going to have-- while I'm thinking about this, I'm going to have the shark attack him.
Sam: 'Cause it's shark week.
Matt: Okay, shark moves here.
Taliesin: Bite the tentacles.
Laura: The shark's gonna bite the tentacle that's holding onto-- who's that right in front of him, Percy?
Matt: Yes.
Laura: No.
Travis: In front?
Matt: Right there this is Percy. This is Taryon.
Laura: He's going to swim towards Percy.
Sam: Wait, friendly shark! (all laugh)
Matt: Okay.
Laura: And bite the tentacle to help free Percy. And he gets advantage?
Matt: Correct.
Travis: Awesome.
Sam: Oh, shark ally!
Laura: 15? Is that enough?
Matt: 15. Unfortunately, it's just gnawing at it, but it's not quite breaking through, it's tough hide.
Laura: Okay. I look at my brother and say, can you get out of this?
Liam: Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
Laura: Okay. I swim back and use my bonus action to try to hide.
Matt: All right. So you swim backward this way?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: How far? Which direction?
Laura: Towards the rock, towards the--
Matt: Towards the rock here?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: That's about as far as you can get, unfortunately.
Laura: Well, I try to hide--
Matt: You have Alter Self on you right? You cast it--
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: So you can make it. We'll say that's as far as you can get, no reason to hide, you're still out in the open, you don't have anything to hide behind, unfortunately.
Laura: Can I sit on the ground? I wanna sit on the ground and wrap my cloak around me and make myself look like a rock.
Matt: Actually, you do back up into the ink cloud, so you can.
Laura: Hey!
Matt: Which is not obscured to the kraken. So, you cannot hide. He can still see you in the ink cloud.
Laura: Oh really?
Matt: Yeah, so--
Marisha: Also did my Control Water--
Matt: It didn't-- this whole area is filled with ink, so you just cleared out this area here.
Laura: Well then, if I can't hide from him, can I use my bonus action to do something else?
Matt: Sure.
Laura: Then I'm going to have Trinket attack him.
Matt: All right. Trinket on your turn moves up to the back of it--
Laura: He'll attack the tentacle that's holding Tary.
Sam: Oh, friendly bear?
Matt: (bear noises)
Laura: Oh, Trinket-- Trinket's grappled!
Matt: Oh, Trinket can't move, you're right!
Laura: Trinket's going to attack the tentacle that's holding him.
Matt: Yeah, Trinket can't move, right.
Sam: Never mind, friendly bear. (all laugh)
Laura: Oh two 19s, and that's a critical for Trinket!
Liam: Yeah!
Marisha: Yeah Trinket!
Taliesin: (sing victory fanfare from Final Fantasy)
Marisha: (sing victory fanfare from Final Fantasy)
Taliesin: Aren't you unconscious?
Marisha: You know, they get it.
Laura: That's ten!
Matt: Ten points of damage. Trinket just tears with his jaws into the side. (growls)
Laura: Did he get out?
Matt: No, he did not, I'm sorry.
Laura: Damn it.
Matt: That ends your go, Vex. At the end of your turn, it's going to use its third and final legendary action to go ahead and attempt-- let's see--
Taliesin: Fuck, man.
Matt: It's going to attempt to make a bash attack against Percival and Vax. Which pushes you two together. There's no way to escape it, you just whack! Slams you both together. And you take--
Liam: (groans of pain)
Taliesin: (groans of pain)
Matt: You take 13 points of bludgeoning damage, both of you.
Taliesin: Okay.
Matt: All righty, that ends that. Percival, you're up.
Taliesin: Okay. I'm going to--
Liam: Don't do that, Marisha.
Taliesin: Hm? I know, she's making us feel really guilty right now. I'm going to hack away at this thing right now, so I'm going to try and hack away at this tentacle to get out.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: Disadvantage, correct?
Matt: Correct.
Taliesin: God, I'm really not enjoying this. That's a 17.
Matt: 17 does not hit. The first one you can't quite get your arms free, and you swing-- you just barely-- carves like a centimeter into the creature's flesh.
Taliesin: 19?
Matt: 19 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
Taliesin: I know that natural 20 is just going to waste.
Marisha: It's so close, I know. That's good, though.
Taliesin: 13.
Marisha: Yeah?
Matt: 13 points of damage.
Taliesin: And I'll take another one, that's not going to roll well, here we go. My third hit is 16.
Matt: 16 does not hit, unfortunately.
Taliesin: So I'm going to burn my Action Surge and I'm going to take the Alter Self. That coin you gave me is--
Matt: Takes an action to do so.
Taliesin: What does it give me, just full movement?
Sam: Gills and full movement.
Marisha: It allows you to alter yourself based on what you chose, which is give you gills and fins--
Matt: Yeah, in this circumstance the best bet you want to have is gills and fins. So you can swim.
Marisha: Within moderation.
Taliesin: Yeah, so I burn my Action Surge for that.
Matt: Okay, so your Alter Self is in.
Taliesin: I'm going to go find my healing potions to find out what I have, but I'm going to do that-- yep, moving right along.
Matt: That ends your turn, Percy?
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: That brings us to the kraken. Legendary actions return.
Taliesin: Fuck.
Matt: Kraken is going to shift around up and over there. So we'll say for the purposes of this--
Taliesin: We really need to leave badly.
Sam: Does the shark get an attack?
Laura: Is the kraken an animal?
Matt: Not quite.
Taliesin: No?
Liam: Monstrosity.
Matt: Going to curl over the top there, Trinket does get an attack of opportunity.
Travis: Does Grog?
Matt: No because it just moves into the space between you and Keyleth.
Sam: Laura, attack!
Taliesin: Does the shark?
Sam: Laura! Trinket!
Matt: The shark does not--
Travis: He's grappled. Trinket's grappled.
Sam: Yeah, but can still attack.
Matt: Yeah, 'cause the shark was attacking Percy's tentacle, so it was not in reach to attack the creature.
Laura: Was Trinket within range for a (chomps).
Matt: Trinket was not. He already moved before, 'cause Trinket was grappled before he could get into space with it. All right, it is going to use its Lightning Storm. So I need four bolts of lightning. That's going to be against-- That's going to be Vex, Taryon, Percival, and we'll say Vax. Dexterity saving throws, you guys.
Sam: You said something earlier about dexterity saving throws?
Matt: At disadvantage.
Taliesin: At disadvantage?
Matt: Yes.
Laura: Only if you're grappled.
Matt: If you're grappled.
Laura: Yeah.
Sam: Five.
Taliesin: 15.
Liam: 16.
Laura: 29.
Matt: So, hold on, was that five?
Sam: Yes.
Matt: 25 points lightning damage. Percival?
Taliesin: 15.
Matt: 15? 25 points of lightning damage.
Liam: 16 and Deathwalker's Ward.
Matt: So 25 reduced to half. 13 points of damage.
Laura: 29.
Matt: 29? You take 13 points of lightning damage.
Liam: Oh, and if I fail dex saves it's half damage, so I'm getting quarter damage right now.
Matt: Well, it's Evasion, so if it's half you do nothing.
Liam: If I succeed, it's nothing. If I fail--
Laura: But you're grappled.
Liam: I failed, it's halved.
Matt: You failed, so it's halved, so yeah, you take a quarter.
Liam: Plus the Deathwalker's, so down and down.
Matt: Right, I got confused, so yes. So half that as well. All right, that ends the kraken's turn. Grog, you're up.
Travis: Ha! Ha! Am I near Keyleth?
Matt: You are right next to Keyleth.
Travis: Great! I'm going to use my action to shove a greater healing potion in your stupid unconscious mouth. (all laugh)
Matt: All right, so that is 4d4 plus four.
Travis: I roll that?
Laura: You want some more d4s?
Travis: No.
Laura: Okay.
Taliesin: 4d4.
Travis: Great.
Laura: Yeah!
Travis: Four, six, eight, 12!
Marisha: Healing points?
Matt: Mm-hm. You get 12.
Liam: That's a number.
Marisha: I get 12.
Matt: Grog, you still have your bonus action. You are frenzied and you have your movement.
Travis: I do! I want to (doop doop doop) like Mario in the water world, and I want to go up on top of the kraken's face, and I want to punch him in his stupid big eyeball with the dwarven thrower.
Matt: Okay, so you come up onto the actual--
Travis: Yep.
Matt: -- kraken, okay.
Liam: Madman, love it.
Matt: So you're right there. Okay, so go ahead and make your attack.
Travis: Reckless!
Matt: So just a single roll.
Travis: Yep. 28.
Matt: 28 hits! Roll damage.
Laura: Eyeball death!
Travis: That's 14, 25. 25!
Matt: 35--
Travis: 25.
Matt: 25 points of damage. You just, whack!, bash it in the side of its face. (growls)
Travis: Eyeball took it pretty well, man, jeez.
Matt: Yep.
Travis: Those eyeballs are hard.
Matt: That ends your turn, Grog?
Travis: It does.
Matt: All right, Taryon.
Sam: I mean, we're just trying to leave at this point.
Laura: Yeah, we're just trying to get away.
Marisha: Yeah, yeah.
Taliesin: Yeah we're running, running.
Sam: So I will once again try my acid trick, and this time try to hit it and pull another bottle out and smash it on the tentacle.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Oh, where'd it go? That's shitty. So I'll use Luck. Oh, better.
Taliesin: Better.
Sam: 20.
Matt: 20 does hit, roll damage.
Sam: It's 7d6, right?
Laura: Whoa.
Sam: 22.
Matt: 22 points of damage. As you slam it and it begins to dissolve it, it is not enough to break free but it is fairly hurt and still holding onto you.
Sam: All right, for my bonus action I just say, oh, friendly shark! (all laugh)
Sam: I could use a bite over here! My animal handling is negative one, by the way. (all laugh)
Matt: Good to know. All right, Taryon, that's your turn. Vax, you're up.
Liam: Okay, I take Whisper out, and I'm throwing it at the ground ten feet away from you right next to Keyleth on the ground, and bamfing out of its tentacle to it.
Matt: Okay, go ahead and roll attack with disadvantage just to see it doesn't get caught in the water and float away.
Liam: (gurgling noise) 23.
Matt: Yeah, it's just enough strength for you to chuck it and (swoosh) hits the sand right next to her. You are no longer restrained--
Laura: Yeah! Oh, what a clutch fucking vestige.
Matt: You are next to Keyleth.
Liam: Plus Grog is whaling on its head, so I'm going to Sneak Attack the tentacle that's holding Keyleth. Yeah?
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: I am whaling on its head.
Sam: Right now, somewhere in the world, Scanlan is eating a like calamari and going-- (all laugh)
Marisha: Gets a little bit of a nosebleed.
Matt: Basically yes.
Marisha: Not sure why.
Sam: Huh, that's weird. Little acidy there.
Laura: Would have been great if Scanlan were here just to like Dominate Creature.
Liam: 34.
Matt: 34.
Marisha: All that inspiration.
Matt: With that, the tentacle holding Keyleth is torn asunder. You, using your dagger to cut her free, and the cloud of blood left behind, and withdraws, she is freed.
Liam: Okay, and I will-- I can't use a bonus action to pull her, right, that's too much, yeah?
Matt: Yeah.
Liam: Yeah. I will use a bonus action to stand over and in front of her.
Sam: So brave!
Taliesin: Water wings.
Matt: All right, that brings us to Keyleth.
Laura: Don't get swallowed.
Matt: Keyleth, you are freed from the tentacle,and you are conscious, but up above you as you look up into space you can see the giant kraken maybe ten, 15 feet away from you. Grog is slamming in the side of its head and Vax is right there looking over you right now.
Marisha: Yeah, I'm just like a poodle over a pool right now, just doggy paddling instinctually. Do we have the lodestones, do we have all of them?
Taliesin: Yes! Yes!
Laura: Get us out of here!
Liam: While you were out.
Sam: You and your fucking lodestones!
Marisha: And I do Animal Shapes and I turn all of us to-- who's grappled? A lot of us. Right?
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: Yeah, Trinket, Taryon, and Percy are currently grappled.
Marisha: I'm going to turn us into like little electric eels. Maybe it's because we made that joke earlier, I don't know.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Is that bad? Is that bad?
Matt: No, what do you wanna do?
Marisha: I just want something that is going to swim fast and then we all--
Laura: And we slip out of its grasp.
Marisha: Swim. We slip out of its grasp and swim to the portal. To the portal! And we go.
Matt: Don't have rules for eels.
Sam: There's a water snake in there.
Marisha: There is a water snake, which is kinda what I'm basing this off of.
Matt: We'll use that.
Marisha: The giant constrictor snake--
Laura: (laughs) He loves looking up animals.
Marisha: Has blindsight-- ugh.
Sam: They can swim really fast, and I know because I tried to turn into one when we were in the dragon. They have like a 40 swimming speed or something.
Matt: Saying a giant constrictor snake has a swim speed of 30 feet, that's the same speed as--
Marisha: Normal?
Taliesin: Normal?
Laura: I don't wanna be a giant constrictor snake. We wanna be teeny ones, or little ones.
Taliesin: No, it would be a normal, or like a swimming creature, though, what's the speed of a swimming creature?
Matt: Make your choice, Keyleth.
Marisha: Okay, okay, okay.
Matt: Most snakes are 30-foot swim speed.
Marisha: Most are and hunter sharks are 40-foot swim speed, killer whales are 60-foot swim speed--
Laura: So make us killer whales.
Marisha: But they're bigger motherfuckers, so can we do a giant eel that's got a swim speed of 40 feet?
Sam: Young sea serpent that can swim 60 feet?
Laura: Yeah, that!
Marisha: Ooh I wanna be that!
Taliesin: Thea Therpent.
Matt: Sea Serpent.
Sam: I don't know what that is.
Taliesin: (lisp) Help me, Cecil, help!
Sam: Oh no, that's huge, that's a huge monstrosity, she can't do that.
Matt: Monstrosity you can't do.
Sam: Can't do that, no.
Matt: What are you doing?
Liam: Killer whale, man, killer whale.
Marisha: Look, I'm bound by what the Player's Handbook gave me! So--
Taliesin: Let's go whale.
Marisha: So I'll go--
Matt: These are creatures you would know.
Marisha: Ah, fuck, whales are fucking big, though!
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: Whales are big.
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: So I'll be eels with a swim speed of 40 feet? So we can slip out?
Matt: What creature are you choosing is my question.
Marisha: Well, that's going off of a snake speed.
Matt: Snake-- I'm sorry, you need to pick a creature, you can't make up statistics here. Let's see here. So.
Laura: What are you reading, what are you reading, Marisha?
Taliesin: The giant snake is a land snake is the problem.
Marisha: It's a land snake.
Taliesin: Let's be whales.
Liam: Be whales, get the fuck out of here.
Laura: It still can hold us.
Marisha: Okay, but whales are 60 feet, sharks are 40 feet. That's our problem.
Matt: Most snakes I'm seeing here have 30 feet swim speed.
Laura: Then I think snake is probably better to wiggle out, that's the thing.
Marisha: Yeah.
Laura: He's going to be able to hold whales maybe.
Liam: Okay.
Laura: I don't know. I don't know! I don't know.
Marisha: We'd be slow to be snakes, but more possibly--
Travis: It's your Aramente. It's your Aramente.
Taliesin: It's your Aramente.
Laura: It's your Aramente.
Matt: What are you doing, as you're casting your spell. It's your Aramente. What are you choosing? What form?
Marisha: (yells) We're going to be eels! That's what I said at first!
Liam: Eels, we're eels.
Marisha: Swim, 30 foot!
Liam: Eels.
Matt: Okay, eels, we're using the statistics for a snake.
Marisha: I wanna use a statistic for a snake, but swim speed, fuck! I'm trying to be elusive here!
Matt: All right.
Marisha: Fuck.
Matt: I-- whatever. Fine.
Sam: We'll do it live!
Taliesin: We'll do it live!
Matt: You are all water snakes. You're majestic, ten-hit-point forms as water snakes. You all suddenly transform--
Taliesin: Mine has glasses.
Matt: -- into these tiny snakes.
Marisha: Go, go, go, go.
Matt: We'll say for the current purposes of this, until it comes to the kraken's turn, everyone who is currently grappled is not grappled, because you are a smaller form. Until the kraken's turn.
Sam: Ooh.
Marisha: Oh, god.
Matt: So we'll have to see whose turn order is what.
Laura: And we all just book it.
Matt: All right, so--
Marisha: Double movement.
Matt: That brings us next to the initiative counter 20. So. I need all of you guys, as snakes, to make constitution saving throws.
Laura: We're all just gonna bamf back to-- but at least, hey, we're ungrappled.
Sam: Matt. We're eels.
Marisha: I don't know what that did.
Matt: I know.
Sam: Eels.
Taliesin: Wait.
Sam: Hey! I did pretty good.
Taliesin: Electric eels-- if they're electric eels--
Marisha: I did okay. And we're still blessed.
Travis: And we still are blessed, right?
Taliesin: Constitution saving throw?
Liam: Keyleth is not. You are, and I am.
Matt: You did choose electric eels.
Laura: Oh!
Marisha: Okay, that went off the rails.
Matt: Which--
Marisha: That's not bad.
Taliesin: Aha!
Marisha: Okay, okay--
Matt: No, hold on.
Travis: Hold on.
Liam: We gots to be immune, man.
Laura: What are we doing?
Matt: I know. Because you chose eels--
Liam: Winging it.
Matt: -- the electricity has no effect.
Taliesin: Ah!
Sam: Matt hates everything right now.
Matt: Weirdly--
Marisha: What?
Matt: -- this worked to your advantage for the 20 initiative count.
Laura: Ah.
Marisha: (sings) Shocking like electric eels.
Matt: So as the pulse of electric energy shoots out from the kraken, it shocks around and through all of you, but your physical eel forms take no damage.
Liam: Feels good!
Matt: As they're used to conducting energy.
Taliesin: Ah!
Marisha: Sweet!
Matt: Vex.
Laura: Yeah?
Sam: (sings) Can't stop the eeling!
Matt: Your turn.
Laura: As an eel, I'm gonna swim around the big brown rock, away from the kraken, towards the door.
Matt: 30. And you're gonna use your action to dash, as well?
Laura: Yes.
Matt: That's as far as you can get. All right, finishing Vex's turn. All righty.
Laura: I feel like I'm just leaving everybody behind-- oh, and Trinket's gonna do the same thing.
Marisha: No, run, run, run. Get out, get out, get out.
Liam: But only because you are.
Matt: That's as far as Trinket can go, there.
Laura: Can he use his double action to do the same thing?
Matt: He doesn't have a double action.
Laura: Just kidding.
Matt: He moves in your turn.
Laura: But I am gonna make my shark attack him! The shark's gonna just swim up in his face.
Taliesin: What is happening?
Laura: Swim up in his eyeball, and just be like, wah, look at me, I'm--
Matt: Roll an attack for your shark.
Laura: I'm a shark!
Liam: Who hasn't gotten punchy at the end of a long D&D game?
Taliesin: I-- man, nothing makes sense anymore.
Liam: This is real D&D.
Laura: 21.
Matt: 21 hits. Roll damage.
Laura: Yes!
Taliesin: Good shark.
Laura: Okay, that's a bite attack, that is--
Liam: You went British again.
Laura: Okay, wait-- oh, that's more than that! Anyway.
Taliesin: I figure since I'm an eel, I'm gonna attack this thing.
Laura: 12.
Taliesin: I think I've got a shot.
Matt: All right. 12 points of damage to the kraken. Gotcha. All righty.
Taliesin: Ahaha. Sorry.
Matt: It's gonna go ahead and use Lightning Storm, costing 2 of its actions. It's going to focus this on--
Liam: Stupid kraken.
Matt: -- Taryon, Grog, and-- because you were the source of its magic and it is horribly frustrated, Keyleth. I need the three of you guys-- oh fuck, it's Lightning Storm, it's not-- you're all eels, what am I doing?
Marisha: Electric eels. We are electric eels.
Liam: Oh, no.
Sam: Oh, Matt hates us.
Matt: I'm-- it's been a long week, and I keep forgetting my fucking shit. It's okay.
Taliesin: This is the Winnie the Pooh of krakens. It's just trying its mild calisthenics to just try and make things.
Matt: All right, so it makes a lightning storm--
Liam: I thought he was being nice to us.
Matt: -- that strikes you guys--
Liam: He was just being nice to us!
Taliesin: And it tickles.
Liam: He's tired!
Matt: -- and, yeah, it tickles your fancy a moment as two of its legendary actions.
Laura: Aw.
Matt: All right, Percy, it's your turn.
Taliesin: I am going to book, double speed--
Matt: Respect. Respect on the electric eels that I gave you.
All: Yay!
Matt: Weirdly, saving your ass right now.
Marisha: Dumb idea that worked out.
Taliesin: I'm going to book through this weird little log.
Liam: 5.9, 6.2, 6.3--
Taliesin: I'm going to go straight through it.
Laura: Ooh, yeah!
Matt: 20, 25, 30. You just get out the other side, just barely seeing the eel-Vex ahead of you, just swimming through.
Laura: I wink at him, with my eel eye.
Sam: Ugh.
Taliesin: Ahh.
Sam: You know what, this is like an electricity between you guys.
Matt: Oh.
Taliesin: Wait, wait, right in the eye. Right in the eye.
Matt: End of Vex's turn, it's gonna use its last legendary action--
Liam: Hey. Fish porn.
Matt: -- to attempt to make a--
Sam: He throws water at us.
Matt: -- a tentacle attack at--
Travis: He throws water at us.
Matt: -- at you, Vax. The one that just recently severed one of its tentacles.
Liam: Okay.
Marisha: It's one of those mega water balloons.
Matt: That is a 28 to hit. Ten plus 18.
Liam: A what to hit?
Laura: Well, you're an eel.
Matt: 28.
Liam: Oh okay, do I not have-- am I hasted? Do I still have advantage on my dex saving throws? As an eel?
Matt: The effect is still on there, so yeah.
Taliesin: Very clever eel.
Liam: So it's, 'cause I'm blessed as well-- oh, it's a 32.
Taliesin: Yeah!
Matt: For dex saving throw?
Laura: But wait, no, it's-- is it an eel's--
Matt: No, it's an attack roll.
Liam: Oh, it's an attack roll. Oh, okay.
Matt: Against your AC, which as an eel is like, ten, so you take damage.
Liam: Oh, okay.
Marisha: You take its physical--
Laura: -- attributes.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: That is 18 points of bludgeoning damage.
Liam: What did it roll? Sorry, I thought--
Travis: 32.
Matt: 28.
Liam: Oh it definitely hit. Yeah, I'm sorry.
Matt: 28.
Laura: Plus, you're an eel. It's a 10 AC.
Matt: So your eel form is destroyed--
Liam: Got it. Aw.
Matt: -- and you take eight points of bludgeoning damage, and you are grappled.
Laura: Fuck.
Taliesin: He's got the dagger, though.
Laura: Yeah.
Marisha: Wait, why is his eel form destroyed?
Laura: 'Cause it was 10 hit--
Matt: 'Cause it has almost no hit points.
Liam: 'Cause it smacked the shit out of me.
Matt: The lightning did nothing, but it just bludgeoned and grabbed and squeezed around the eel, and then you formed back within its grasp.
Taliesin: It's not a giant eel, it's just an eel.
Laura: Yeah. He's got like no hit points as an eel.
Marisha: Yeah, all right.
Taliesin: I can kill an eel. Anybody can.
Marisha: All right.
Liam: I'm sorry, Matt, what was the hit point damage?
Matt: "All right", you arguing?
Liam: There's so much shit--
Laura: Eight. Eight.
Marisha: No. No, we're not arguing.
Taliesin: No. No, we're not arguing.
Marisha: "All right" is not the statement of someone who's arguing.
Matt: Just making sure. I know. It's all good.
Marisha: "All right" is literally "all right."
Sam: Snakes have, like, two hit points.
Taliesin: No that's a kitten, have two hit points. Snakes have, like, six.
Matt: I just, I ruled you guys to have ten hit points in that form.
Taliesin: Yeah, we're ten-hit-point eels.
Marisha: That's fine.
Taliesin: That's fair.
Matt: Yeah, flying snake is, like, five hit points, so. You're fine.
Marisha: Sure.
Taliesin: They have flying snake? Never mind, I don't want to know.
Matt: So that ends-- all right, so that was on Percy's turn. End of that turn. It's back to the Kraken's turn.
Travis: Great.
Matt: The kraken gets its legendary actions back.
Liam: Shit.
Laura: Shit.
Marisha: Did you skip me?
Sam: You did plenty.
Liam: You turned us into eels.
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: I thought I was after Vax?
Matt: Vax went, then you turned everyone into eels.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: And then it went to the 20 count.
Laura: And then I went, then Percy went.
Matt: So now it's back to the kraken.
Liam: I just got whacked.
Marisha: I confused you with Percy.
Matt: You did, it's okay.
Taliesin: It happens.
Matt: All right, the kraken's going to do three bashes.
Liam: It's all right. We're both sad.
Matt: It's going to be against Grog, it's going to be against Keyleth, it's going to be against Taryon.
Sam: Yeah.
Laura: Fuck.
Matt: Grog, that is 29.
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: Taryon, that is 31.
Sam: Nope.
Matt: (laughs) And, Keyleth, that is 34. All right. So against Grog, that is 24 points of bludgeoning damage.
Travis: Halved to 12.
Matt: You are an eel and grappled. You are out of your eel form and you're grappled. So-- well, your eel form just goes dead then you take-- what did I say again? It was 24--
Travis: 24.
Matt: You take 14 points of bludgeoning damage-- still raging-- halved to seven.
Travis: Okay.
Matt: Taryon, your eel form is destroyed.
Sam: Mm-hm.
Matt: That would be 22 points, so you take 12 points of bludgeoning damage.
Sam: Okay.
Matt: And you are grappled. Keyleth-- lucky roll. That is 14 points of bludgeoning damage. Your eel form is done. You're grappled, and you take four points of bludgeoning damage.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: Eel freed itself, so now you're back up on your feet.
Marisha: Who's still an eel?
Sam: No one.
Laura: Me and Percy.
Taliesin: Neal the eel.
Matt: Taryon as well.
Travis: Can I make a retaliation since he smacked me?
Matt: You can. Against him or the tentacle?
Travis: The tentacle.
Matt: All right.
Travis: Reckless.
Matt: Reckless.
Laura: Ooh, that's good.
Travis: That's a 31.
Matt: That hits.
Travis: Seven, 22.
Matt: 22 points of damage. You slam into the tentacle and it's still holding, but it's looking severely damaged. It's starting to-- the muscle's starting to tear apart. All right.
Marisha: Don't kill it.
Matt: That brings us to Grog, your turn. Grog, your turn.
Laura: It's okay, it's okay.
Taliesin: We can bring it back.
Travis: May I make my first strike a vengeance upon that stupid tentacle?
Matt: Go for it.
Travis: Yep. Reckless! That was not a roll. 30.
Matt: 30. (all laugh)
Sam: I need some d8s.
Travis: One, 16 points of damage.
Matt: 16 points of damage. You slam it again. This time the tentacle tears open and you're free. You are no longer grappled.
Travis: Sweet. Who's in the tentacle next to me?
Matt: You're gathering at this point, like, somewhere having around 30 points of damage gets rid of the tentacle.
Taliesin: Are we down three tentacles now?
Laura: Yeah, how many tentacles are we--
Matt: You now are down four tentacles total. Six left.
Taliesin: Oh. Six left.
Travis: Who's in the tentacle next to me?
Matt: Just below you about ten feet is Keyleth and Vax.
Travis: I mosey over to the one that Keyleth is in.
Matt: All righty.
Travis: And I will smash that tentacle.
Matt: All right. Keyleth, I need you to make a constitution saving throw, by the way. With advantage.
Marisha: Ooh.
Travis: Should I go ahead and roll?
Matt: 'Cause you took damage-- with the shift form.
Laura: Oh, right.
Marisha: Oh boy.
Laura: Is Beast Shape concentration?
Marisha: Oh that's good. 15.
Matt: You're fine.
Travis: That's a natural 20.
Laura: Oh! That's a natural 20!
Matt: Go ahead and roll damage for that plus your-- ha. So, roll the d10.
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: Times two.
Travis: Which is a nine.
Travis: 18.
Matt: 18.
Travis: And I get a two additional damage die.
Matt: Yes, you do. So roll two more d10s.
Travis: Okay. Actually, I do nine plus the rage damage, and then I just roll this twice.
Matt: Yes.
Travis: Right. Okay, so that's--
Matt: Well, nine plus rage damage-- well, 9 times two, so it's 18 plus rage damage, plus your strength modifier. You destroyed the tentacle. The tentacle's dead.
Travis: Cool. (all laugh)
Matt: Yeah, Keyleth's tentacle is just smeared like a-- you slam into it and watch as a cloud of dark purple liquid kind of goes past her face. The blood from the kraken clears and the tentacle just goes limp, the section that's been removed from the rest of the tendril.
Travis: Not that you even need it, but I try and release Vax as well.
Matt: Go for it. So roll for--
Travis: Reckless! 16. 30-- 20-- 32.
Matt: Yeah, it hits.
Travis: Cool. Seven. 22.
Matt: 22. You slam into the side of Vax's tentacle, bash it, bash it. It's starting to tear apart, but it's not enough to free him entirely.
Travis: Cool. I am going to biggity-buck the fat out! (all laugh)
Matt: All right, your movement is 50, and you've not used Alter Self, right?
Travis: No, 'cause I don't have that!
Matt: Yes, that's--
Laura: Yes you do. You have a coin!
Travis: Oh, but that--
Matt: Yeah, but you have to use an action to do so. So that's five, ten--
Laura: But that's good to know.
Matt: -- 15, 20, 25. 'Cause your movement's 50 normally.
Travis: Nice.
Matt: So that's as far as you can get just kind of swimming by, trying to get over there. Ends your turn, Grog.
Travis: Thank you.
Matt: All right.
Travis: Making real good distance.
Matt: End of your turn, it's going to use Lightning Storm. Two actions. It's going to hit Grog, Vax, and Keyleth. Need all three of you to make dexterity saving throws, with Vax at disadvantage.
Marisha: Is this considered a spell?
Matt: Nope.
Marisha: Okay.
Travis: Are we all at disadvantage on the dex throws?
Matt: No, just Vax.
Travis: Okay, so I get two.
Marisha: Don't fuck me, Gil!
Liam: 21.
Marisha: What am I doing? Dex save?
Matt: That's not going to make it, unfortunately.
Liam: So the fail means I take half damage.
Matt: Correct.
Liam: Plus the Deathwalker's Ward, so quarter damage.
Matt: Correct.
Travis: 17 for me.
Marisha: 22 for--
Matt: And Taryon as well, actually.
Sam: Oh! Great.
Travis: Oh, wait! Blessed. Blessed! #Blessed, bitch!
Laura: Still?
Taliesin: Add a d4.
Marisha: (gasps)
Liam: I haven't made a constitution save in a while.
Sam: I mean, I'm grappled, right? So.
Matt: Well, it's not at disadvantage.
Sam: Oh. Okay.
Marisha: Not great.
Sam: 12.
Matt: Wait, you're restrained, you are-- yes. So yes. You do.
Sam: Natural one. (all groan)
Matt: Yeah, so 24 points lightning damage.
Sam: Okay.
Taliesin: You're awake.
Marisha: 21 total for me?
Matt: 24 points of lightning damage.
Marisha: I'm unconscious.
Matt: Keyleth falls unconscious once more. Vax.
Liam: My turn? I'm just going to repeat what I did before. Attack--
Matt: No, no. What-- you take 24 reduced to half--
Liam: To a quarter.
Matt: Yeah. So 12 points of lightning damage. Reduced to quarter--
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: -- six.
Liam: Six.
Matt: Then Grog--
Travis: 19.
Matt: 24 points lightning damage reduced to half.
Travis: 12.
Matt: 12.
Matt: All right, so! That was the end of Grog's turn. Taryon, your turn.
Sam: I reach into my magic satchel, this time pulling out a powerful healing potion, which I drink by myself.
Matt: Okay. (all laugh)
Sam: Okay. 14, 21--
Marisha: Is that what you needed all the d8s for?
Sam: Uh-huh. (laughs)
Taliesin: Could have had a d8.
Sam: 35.
Matt: All right. Heal yourself 35.
Laura: Wow.
Sam: Yeah.
Laura: That's a major healing spell.
Sam: Yeah.
Marisha: Give me my d8s back. (all laugh)
Marisha: Fuck you.
Matt: You still have your bonus action, if you want to do anything.
Sam: Just sort of gently weep.
Travis: Weep! (laughs)
Sam: Yeah, just kind of weep softly.
Matt: Vax, you're up.
Sam: I'll do one more Sanctuary on myself! That's my last spell.
Matt: Sanctuary, technically, is still lasting, 'cause it's not concentration.
Sam: It's not! Oh, well then--
Matt: Well, no, every time you attack you lose it. You're right. I keep forgetting that, so yes.
Sam: But I haven't attacked him in a while.
Laura: You've attacked him with acid since.
Matt: You cut a tentacle.
Sam: I did. I did.
Matt: So Sanctuary is back up. Okay.
Liam: Is it on me now?
Matt: Yes.
Liam: All right. Keyleth is adjacent to me, right? On the ground?
Matt: Yes, she is.
Liam: Okay. So I'm going to use my first action to cast Lay On Hands and dump five hit points into her to wake her back up.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Next action is going to be to throw Whisper into the ground again. And bamf to it.
Matt: All right. You just escape the grasp.
Liam: And I'm going to use bonus action to back up fucking 30 feet towards the big-- yeah, towards the portal.
Matt: All right. By the way, all your guys' forms? You revert back to your normal selves. You are no longer eels.
Marisha: Yeah I kind of went unconscience.
Matt: So you're backing up 30 feet?
Liam: Yeah, backing up.
Travis: Unconscience?
Marisha: Unconscious.
Travis: Take it easy there, champ.
Marisha: Yeah, you know.
Travis: Take it real slow.
Matt: You are hasted, so yeah, 30 feet. You just get out of the range. It's going to take an attack of opportunity on you with its tentacle. That is-- nine plus 18 is 27 to hit.
Liam: Oh, that hits. Yeah.
Marisha: It's Gil's fault.
Travis: Yep.
Matt: You take--
Liam: Uncanny Dodge.
Matt: -- 21 points of bludgeoning damage.
Liam: Okay. Halved to ten or 11?
Matt: Halved to ten and you are grappled by the tentacle.
Laura: Ah, jeez!
Liam: Mother bitch!
Travis: Love America.
Sam: We just gotta get out of here. (all laugh)
Travis: I'm gonna kill this stupid sea puppy.
Laura: Don't kill it. Don't kill it.
Sam: Don't kill it, get us out of there!
Marisha: No! No, no, no. Get us out. Get us out.
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: Leave it armless.
Marisha: Leave it alone.
Matt: Keyleth, it's your turn. You come to consciousness. Once more you watch as Vax is darting off and a tentacle wraps around him. You see Taryon pulled, but the rest of your allies are rushing off in the distance.
Marisha: We have all the lodestones, right?
Laura: Yes, we do. All the lodestones.
Taliesin: Are you getting hit in the head?
Marisha: Yes! I literally have! Fuck!
Matt: What are you doing?
Marisha: Who is closest by the portal?
Matt: You can't see from where you are. It's actually blocked. You just see this giant, jutting underwater structure.
Travis: An ink cloud.
Laura: No, not anymore.
Marisha: There's an ink cloud?
Laura: No, not anymore. They got--
Marisha: I got rid of that, right?
Matt: No, you only got rid of part of it here. The ink cloud still sits in this vicinity.
Laura: Oh.
Marisha: Okay. Oh, dear god. I'm gonna Control Water again.
Matt: You're casting it again?
Marisha: Yeah, I'm casting it again.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Get outta there.
Marisha: Who's around me?
Matt: Around you it is Grog, it is Vax, and it is Taryon.
Marisha: I am going to--
Matt: And a shark.
Marisha: -- push us towards the portal with Control Water. Just (sound of rushing water).
Matt: All of you, towards the portal?
Marisha: Yeah. Control Water towards the portal.
Matt: All right. Say, 20 feet. Five, ten, 15, 20. Five, ten, 15, 20. Five, ten, 15, 20.
Marisha: Is there anyone still held on by the kraken?
Laura: No.
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: Oh.
Matt: I mean, Taryon and Vax are still grappled by it, and this-- the kraken gets moved to there.
Liam: It's got some long-ass tentacles.
Marisha: Vax is still grappled?
Matt: 30-foot range.
Laura: Yeah, and Tary.
Liam: Yeah. I was just at the edge of its range and it snagged me.
Matt: So you're right there.
Marisha: Okay. I'm gonna take a Grasping Vine, I'm gonna grab Vax and yank him towards me from this-- who's got the thing? From that-- that one closest by.
Matt: And yank him towards you?
Liam: Back towards the kraken?
Marisha: This one.
Laura: Why are you trying to yank him towards you? You are directly under the Kraken.
Matt: You cannot see this, unfortunately.
Marisha: I can't see that?
Matt: No, this is all obscured with ink right now.
Marisha: Can I see this red thing?
Matt: This thing got pushed this way--
Marisha: Can I see this?
Matt: Actually, with your Control Water that pushed this way would have cleared some ink in this area, but right now this whole structure is blocking it. You cannot see this rock.
Marisha: Can I see this red thing in front of me?
Matt: This here, you can. Vax is right next to it.
Marisha: Okay. I'm gonna drag him closer in. I wanna drag-- send him this way. [no audio]
Liam: -- wooden structure?
Marisha: Beyond it.
Matt: Well, the Grasping Vine only pulls things towards where it emanates, and since he's right next to this, it'll just pull him right against it.
Marisha: Okay, Tary-- where's Tary?
Matt: Tary's right here as well, it'll just pull him into the rock.
Marisha: Well, bullshit all the way around. Then I just swim desperately, doggy paddle towards the portal.
Matt: You still have your bonus action.
Marisha: There's-- what's left?
Matt: Your Wild Shape? Miss five hit points?
Laura: Oh, yeah, that could be smart. Since-- so you don't go unconscious again.
Liam: Whale it, dude.
Marisha: All right. I'll killer whale towards the portal.
Matt: Not to tell you what you're doing, but this is your thing and you're at five hit points, right underneath the kraken, the closest to it.
Marisha: Where am I?
Matt: You're here.
Liam: You're right under the kraken!
Laura: You're right under the kraken!
Marisha: All right. All right. All right. (LAURA laughs)
Taliesin: It's very hard to see from this-- I will say--
Marisha: It is very hard to see from what this is--
Taliesin: --this map is a nightmare.
Travis: Can we get some ammonia that we can pour on a cloth and just, like, take a big whiff of?
Marisha: Sure.
Laura: Just wake her up?
Matt: What are you-- what are you Shaping into?
Laura: Adrenaline.
Marisha: I'll go killer whale.
Matt: Killer whale!
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: All righty.
Travis: I think there's some in the first aid kit in the hallway. I'm pretty sure I stole some last week.
Taliesin: More kraken.
Marisha: That was true.
Taliesin: Oh my god, you actually have a mini for that one.
Matt: I don't actually. I did not come--
Liam: I remember that bag.
Matt: I'll say for the sake of this-- for the time being this--
Marisha: It's fine.
Matt: -- this naga will be your killer whale. Sure. That'll work.
Liam: So pretty.
Matt: All righty.
Marisha: And all of my Control Water direction is towards the portal.
Matt: Yes.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: You've cleared out some of the ink in this area. That's your turn.
Marisha: Sure.
Matt: All righty. Top of the round. The kraken is going to go ahead and-- the water current seems to shift in the opposite direction. I need each creature within 60 feet of the kraken, which is all of you, to make a strength saving throw.
Travis: Yeah!
Liam: Son of a bitch.
Taliesin: Aw, god damn it.
Marisha: Is that including me?
Matt: Yeah, all of you.
Sam: 11.
Matt: 11?
Taliesin: 23.
Matt: 23, all right.
Taliesin: Yeah!
Matt: So you only get pushed ten feet.
Marisha: 21.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: 18.
Laura: 23.
Liam: Ooh.
Matt: Pushed ten feet.
Laura: But only ten for Trinket.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: 22.
Matt: 22 is a failure. All right. So that is 60 feet away from the kraken for everyone who failed.
Sam: What does that mean?
Matt: So.
Sam: We're just pushed away?
Matt: You're right over here, pushed away.
Taliesin: It's doing a big like (raspberry).
Matt: The water just rushes through and pushes all of you away. Trinket is pushed--
Marisha: Who failed?
Matt: -- 60 feet that direction.
Sam: About everyone.
Laura: All right.
Matt: Roll for the shark, if you could. It's gonna maintain its grapple on you guys, you guys are just being yanked in that direction.
Laura: Does he--
Marisha: Wait, who failed?
Sam: Like, everyone.
Taliesin: Everyone.
Liam: Yeah.
Laura: I mean, 18 is what I rolled, I don't know what I add for it.
Matt: Yeah, so no, that's not gonna-- so the shark gets pushed up into that, there.
Sam: Fucking kraken. Do I get slammed into that thing?
Matt: Actually, you do, but it doesn't do any damage, it just kind of pushes you and the tentacle kind of holds you there. Keeping you grappled. It's not gonna release the grapple.
Taliesin: That acid's gotta be-- burn through that at some point. Is that a continuing--
Sam: That's a different tentacle.
Matt: Yep.
Taliesin: Damn it.
Matt: All right. So. That brings us to Vex's turn.
Taliesin: One less.
Laura: I mean, do I see any of this happening as I'm just fucking swimming away? I guess my--
Matt: All the ink has now washed away to the space, and everyone gets pushed away by the force of the water.
Laura: Fuck. I'm gonna swim up so I can see down over the rock.
Sam: (accented) Over the rock?
Matt: Okay, so there, and you can just--
Liam: What's your character's name?
Matt: -- see over this way, you can see your brother there--
Laura: Okay.
Matt: -- you see the kraken, you see everyone being pushed to this way, and everything being shoved to that direction.
Laura: I'm gonna try to shoot an arrow into the tentacle holding my brother.
Matt: All right, go for it.
Liam: Where'd the Key-whale go?
Laura: Oh. Disadvantage, right?
Matt: Yep.
Laura: Same thing. 25?
Matt: 25 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
Laura: 15, 16, 17. 17 damage, with four lightning, which I'm sure does nothing.
Matt: Nope. That's enough. Your arrow goes right through, and that's the last bit of damage it needs to actually sever that tentacle.
Liam: Love you!
Laura: Sweet.
Matt: Freeing him. All right.
Laura: And then I'm gonna-- do I have any movement to swim back down and hide? As my bonus?
Matt: You could certainly try. If you land back down that way--
Laura: Oh, miss it.
Matt: So go ahead and roll-- breaking line of sight just barely, go ahead and make a hide check.
Laura: 22.
Matt: 22. Okay.
Laura: And then I'm gonna have my shark attack him.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: How many tentacles does it have?
Matt: The shark has a speed of what? 40?
Laura: Yeah.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: 30, 35, 40. Just barely gets up into the space to hit it, so.
Laura: Plus nine-- 17 plus nine is 26!
Matt: 26 hits!
Taliesin: Good shark.
Laura: Good shark. Good shark. Good shark. With a bite attack--
Liam: Frickin' lasers.
Laura: Sweet. 14.
Matt: 14 points of damage. All righty.
Laura: I'm just using Trinket's stats, 'cause that's what I had in front of me.
Matt: Sure.
Laura: Is that terrible?
Matt: Yeah. But it's fine.
Laura: I'm sorry.
Matt: You haven't done enough damage, near enough, to really threaten the kraken yet, so you're fine.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: All right.
Travis: What turn's that?
Matt: Ending Vex's turn!
Marisha: No.
Matt: End of the turn, it's gonna use its last legendary action. It's going to go ahead and make a tentacle attack at you.
Laura: Oh, and Trinket's gonna swim towards the door.
Matt: That's as far as Trinket can get. All righty. That is a 29 to hit.
Liam: Shit balls. 28. Wait--
Taliesin: d4.
Liam: I'm Blessed!
Laura: It's your AC.
Matt: It's your AC.
Laura: It's just your AC.
Liam: Oh, fuck a duck, I thought I was doing it in-- a Dex save. Then it got me.
Matt: That is 18 points of bludgeoning damage.
Liam: Sure.
Matt: And you are grappled.
Liam: Uncanny Dodge.
Matt: Right. So nine.
Liam: Okay.
Matt: And it grapples you once more with that tentacle.
Liam: Okay.
Travis: How many tentacles were left, like three?
Matt: Five.
Travis: Five.
Laura: Fuck, he has a lot of tentacles.
Taliesin: They go down-- they go down fast, though.
Liam: Get out, get, go.
Matt: All righty. Percival. Your turn.
Taliesin: I am booking double speed to that door, 'cause I am useless--
Marisha: Get out, get out, get out, get out.
Matt: That's as far as you can go.
Taliesin: And I'm also-- I've got form this-- so I'm full speed.
Matt: What form?
Marisha: Alter Self. Alter Self.
Taliesin: Fins and gills. Alter Self.
Matt: That's right, you did, yeah. So, yeah.
Marisha: Alter Self. Go, go, go out--
Laura: And you're out!
Marisha: Out! You're out!
Matt: You leap out, you are through.
Laura: One's out! One's out!
Liam: Yes, one of us will live!
Taliesin: I am holding-- I am just, like, waiting on the other end for everybody.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: But you made it! That's good!
Liam: Who lives, who dies--
Liam: --who tells our story.
Marisha: --who tells our story.
Taliesin: --who tells our story.
Taliesin: Please, please no. Please, no.
Liam: It's too late!
Laura: It already happened.
Liam: It's done.
Matt: Top of the kraken's turn--
Liam: Jeez.
Marisha: Just tell 'em, tell 'em Percy! Tell Doty!
Matt: It's gonna move over here--
Taliesin: I'm just so useless in this fight.
Matt: Grappled, Vax?
Marisha: That's not true.
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: It's going-- giant beak--
Laura: No, no, no!
Matt: -- opens up towards you. That is a two plus 18, that is a 20 to hit.
Liam: No.
Matt: Because of the Haste bonus.
Liam: Yes.
Travis: Oh, he does not swallow you.
Laura: He doesn't swallow you!
Matt: I fuckin' rolled a two. Okay, all right, as it goes and snaps towards you--
Liam: Van Damme splits, just out of the way!
Laura: But grappled.
Matt: However, hang on. However, while you were attacked, you were restrained, so--
Laura: I'm gonna throw up.
Matt: -- restrained creatures, attacks against them do have advantage.
Liam: Okay.
Matt: So, that is a 28.
Liam: See ya later, guys.
Sam: You got swallowed?
Liam: Mm-hm.
Laura: What if you--
Marisha: What?
Matt: I just realised that, 'cause it says-- I forgot, it says here-- it says until the target's grapple ends the target is restrained, and attacks against restrained creatures have advantage.
Liam: Is that at all connected to dexterity?
Matt: No.
Liam: No. Okay.
Matt: Sorry.
Liam: It's all right.
Matt: So that is--
Sam: Are you dead inside of it?
Laura: Is this the ultimate fight of like--
Sam: Or just inside of it?
Laura: Yes! Ugh.
Marisha: No, he's just inside.
Matt: 15, 24, 34 points of piercing damage.
Liam: I'm out.
Laura: (gasps) you're unconscious inside of him?
Matt: And you are swallowed.
Travis: Holy fucking shit.
Sam: He'll be fine. He'll be fine!
Travis: This is insane. Oh my god.
Matt: All right.
Travis: Oh shit.
Matt: That is the kraken's turn, Grog, you're up. You watch as it just swallows Vax as his eyes go limp, and the jaws just take his not moving form and swallow inside.
Travis: Um.
Marisha: Does Keyleth see this?
Matt: You do, 'cause you're back here. Make an intelligence check.
Travis: An intelligence check?
Matt: I know.
Travis: Hold on, everybody. Prepare for an amazing--
Laura: Natural 20.
Travis: Nine.
Matt: All right. What are you doing?
Travis: I am gonna attack this big stupid sea-chicken.
Matt: Okay, so you just get into melee range.
Travis: Wait, I mean-- yeah. Yeah.
Sam: Yeah, 'course.
Marisha: Go for it, that's exactly what Grog would do.
Travis: Yeah, can I aim for one of its tentacles that is functioning?
Matt: Sure. Go for it.
Travis: Cool. Reckless. Natural 20.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: Should've made it-- That's a--
Laura: Wow.
Travis: Ten, plus, 25, 30, 35.
Matt: 35 points of damage. You go ahead and sever one of the nearby immediate tentacles as it's whipping around you.
Travis: I'll take the next tentacle that works.
Matt: Okay. As you finish that strike, you feel this strange sense piercing into your relatively unprotected skull.
Travis: It's very unprotected.
Matt: As no language peeks through, but you get this very strong, angry, hungry sense-- this emotional force that says, "Oh, now you've made me angry."
Sam: Ooh.
Matt: You start realising very quickly that this creature, while it seemed like a force of nature, has been just feeding, but you've got its attention now.
Sam: Ooh.
Matt: Its instinct has turned now to its intellect to reach out to its food. You've made it angry. What are you doing with your next attack?
Laura: Fuck. We shouldn't have attacked it so much.
Travis: Apparently, my hammer is talking to me. Reckless attack.
Matt: All right.
Travis: 23.
Matt: That hits.
Travis: Okay. 17.
Matt: 17 damage? All righty.
Travis: Last attack-- that tentacle's still fine, right?
Matt: Yes it is, damaged, but it's still there.
Travis: Yeah. All right, Reckless. 31.
Matt: 31 hits.
Travis: Ten. 25.
Matt: 25. You destroy another tentacle, as three are currently remaining.
Sam: One of them's around my neck.
Travis: Yeah, so one of 'em's on Tary, and there are two free?
Matt: Correct.
Travis: Okay.
Matt: That ends your turn.
Travis: I am going to use my not incredible speed to just--
Matt: You used your full speed to move up to it.
Travis: I'm gonna just end my turn.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: Yep.
Matt: Taryon.
Sam: I mean, I mean--
Taliesin: Do you have-- do you have a Hail Mary?
Sam: I mean-- No!
Taliesin: This is-- wow.
Sam: No, I have-- my Hail Mary I did on my first turn. I'm going to try to break free. I will put my finger up right next to-- against the tentacle, and just use that Ring of the Ram, and just try to punch through it.
Matt: Okay. So, how many charges--
Sam: I regained three.
Matt: Okay, so you use all three charges?
Sam: I have all three charges.
Matt: Go for it. So go ahead and make your ranged spell attack with disadvantage.
Sam: 12 plus nine is 21.
Matt: That hits! Go--
Sam: Oh wait, disadvantage, shit. That's less. That's 17.
Matt: 17 just misses. You try and squeeze it by and the ring releases and it smashes into the rock and destroys part of the nearby plant life, which then begins to just float away, chunks of rock and sand, and some of the underground dark soot begins to billow out. The tentacle still remains affixed around you.
Sam: Terrible.
Taliesin: Do you have a bonus action? Anything you can--
Matt: All right.
Sam: I mean, I don't have any potions, or anything, I-- nope, that's it.
Matt: It is going to use one of its legendary actions to attack Grog with one of its remaining tentacles.
Laura: He's a defeatist, if I've ever seen it.
Matt: That is a 34.
Travis: I think that hits.
Matt: Grog, you take 19 points of bludgeoning damage, reduced to nine--
Travis: Okay.
Matt: -- and you are grappled.
Taliesin: It only has one more tentacle left that is available.
Marisha: We can't fucking kill it, you guys, don't kill it.
Travis: I would like to make a Retaliatory Attack.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: A Retali-tali--
Taliesin: It can have no tentacles. It can still feed.
Matt: Against?
Travis: The one that grappled me.
Matt: Okay, go for it.
Taliesin: They'll grow back.
Travis: Reckless.
Marisha: They won't grow back.
Travis: That's a 31 again.
Matt: That hits. Roll damage.
Travis: Okay. 21.
Matt: 21 points of damage. You slam into it, it looks like it's pulling apart, but the muscle's still holding tight. Vax. I need you to make a death saving throw with advantage.
Marisha: Don't die.
Matt: Okay. Brings us to Keyleth.
Travis: Did it work?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: You're back here.
Marisha: Who's grappled and who's closest to the portal?
Matt: Grog is closest to you, grappled, and there is Taryon on the other side, that you cannot quite see.
Marisha: I still have Control Water up, correct?
Matt: You would, yes.
Marisha: Taryon and Grog are both grappled?
Laura: Yes.
Matt: Correct.
Marisha: And I'm free underneath them?
Laura: Yes.
Matt: You're free over here, yes.
Liam: Yeah, you got loose.
Sam: You're the naga.
Marisha: Okay. I used Alter Self originally, correct?
Matt: Yes.
Marisha: Alter Self. So I still have all my Beast Shaping, correct?
Matt: Correct.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: Well, you have your beast shape you used to turn into this form.
Marisha: Huh?
Matt: Your Wild Shape you used to into this form.
Sam: You're a whale right now.
Marisha: I didn't use Alter Self to do that?
Sam: No.
Laura: You used Beast Form on that.
Sam: Alter Self doesn't do that.
Marisha: Oh, okay cool.
Matt: Alter Self just gives you gills and fins, you used--
Laura: You used Beast Form to turn into a whale.
Marisha: Sorry, sorry, sorry, I meant, sorry, I meant-- Animal Shapes. No?
Matt: Animal Shapes you've already cast on everybody--
Marisha: I've used Animal Shapes to everybody?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Right, but you lost concentration--
Marisha: I used that to me, right.
Matt: -- when you went unconscious.
Marisha: All right. Cool, cool, cool. Cool. Okay. I'm gonna try to get Grog out of the grasp again with my Grasping Vine.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Bonus action first. See if I can--
Matt: Grasping Vine from where?
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: You can have it come out of the ground here if you want it to.
Marisha: He's right here?
Matt: Grog is right here.
Marisha: Correct? Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I wanna be over here-ish.
Laura: You're pointing at the TV screen.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Sam: (laughs)
Marisha: Yeah. It's hard 'cause I don't literally have access beyond this rock.
Matt: So pulling up this way?
Marisha: On the other side of that, closest to the portal? Yeah.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Marisha: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. That's what I want.
Matt: Okay, so we'll say, pulling this way.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: All right. Go ahead and roll a d20 plus your wisdom modifier.
Marisha: Don't fuck me, Gil!
Taliesin: Oh.
Marisha: What is that? What is that? Not-- What is that? What is that?
Taliesin: Oh, that's good! Okay, yeah, that's really hard to see, sorry, 'cause of the light. That's a 17.
Liam: Plus your wisdom modifier.
Marisha: That is a 17?
Taliesin: That is a 17, yes.
Laura: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Liam: 17 plus.
Marisha: Sorry, I don't want to feel insane. Plus my wisdom modifier.
Liam: Yes.
Matt: Correct.
Marisha: (nervous laugh)
Matt: Which is?
Marisha: 30-- sorry, 28! 28!
Matt: Your Wisdom modifier is plus six, right?
Marisha: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, sorry, not a saving throw, so 20-- 17 plus six, which is 25?
Matt: All right, so you pull Grog this way, and with Grasping--
Laura: 23.
Matt: -- Vine, that's a range of what?
Marisha: 23? 17 plus five-- six?
Matt: What's the range of your Grasping Vine?
Liam: The range. The range of Grasping Vine.
Matt: How long-- how far does it pull?
Marisha: It's a 30-foot range, with another 30-foot range coming from me. So 60 foot total.
Matt: Right. So you-- okay, you can pull him out of the range, it does break--
Marisha: 30 foot.
Matt: Yeah. So you do break the grapple on Grog, and pull him away from that.
Taliesin: Drinking again.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: All right. So your movement.
Marisha: And then I have my action, and my movement.
Matt: Correct.
Marisha: And I'm a normal person right now, or am I a whale?
Matt: No. You're a whale, still. You haven't taken any damage. You just got pushed away.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: Which actually, technically, in whale form you couldn't cast the spell.
Marisha: I wouldn't be able to cast the spell.
Matt: So would you drop your form?
Marisha: Yeah.
Sam: For sure.
Matt: Okay. So Keyleth--
Marisha: Yeah, I would definitely drop the form.
Matt: Keyleth is back into that, cast the spell.
Marisha: And then I have another spell. Correct?
Matt: You have your-- well, you have your-- you can cast your--
Marisha: Second level or lower.
Matt: -- second level or lower as your action, and you have your movement still.
Marisha: So-- fuckin' A, this is complicated. Okay. Then I would cast, oh, shit. I got Grog out. Who's almost dead?
Laura: Well, Vax is inside of the kraken.
Taliesin: Vax.
Travis: Vax is inside--
Marisha: Yeah, I don't know if I can do anything about that right now, though. I can cast a second level or lower-- oh my god, this is awful.
Sam: Just heal yourself.
Marisha: All right. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll heal myself-- sorry, for another Healing Word level two-- last level two spell.
Matt: Okay. And you're gonna move towards the--
Marisha: I'm gonna move-- no, I'm gonna stay close towards the kraken.
Matt: So you're gonna stay here?
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: Or move towards the kraken? Are you not moving?
Marisha: Where am I?
Matt: You're right here.
Liam: It's hard to see on the screen.
Marisha: You're actually not even on the screen.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: Right, but you can see my fingers.
Marisha: I can see your fingers-- let me move closer towards the kraken and towards the portal.
Matt: There you go.
Marisha: And that's all I'll do.
Matt: So we'll say there.
Matt: Okay. Got you. Top of the lair action--
Marisha: And I heal myself, sorry, level two--
Matt: Yes. Do that.
Marisha: -- which is 2d8. Healing Word.
Matt: All right. I need everybody to make--
Sam: Oh boy.
Marisha: Sorry. 2d4.
Matt: -- a constitution saving throw.
Marisha: That's-- both ones. That sucks. One plus six--
Sam: 12!
Travis: I'm not Blessed anymore, am I?
Matt: 13 points of lightning damage.
Sam: Great.
Matt: Percival.
Taliesin: I'm not there.
Matt: You're not there. That's right. Keyleth. Constitution saving throw.
Liam: Roll a d20.
Marisha: Natural one.
Matt: 13 points of lightning damage.
Marisha: 13?
Matt: 13. Vex.
Marisha: I had 12 hit points, so I'm unconscious.
Travis: Didn't you just heal yourself a little bit more, though?
Taliesin: For 12.
Marisha: I-- for 12. And now I'm zero.
Liam: But you would have 20--
Matt: Wait, wait, you were at five before.
Liam: You were at five. You couldn't have been at zero.
Marisha: And then I healed seven.
Liam: Oh, to seven to get to 12.
Laura: Ooh.
Matt: Ooh.
Marisha: And I healed seven 'cause I rolled two ones.
Matt: Yeah, Keyleth goes unconscious.
Marisha: So-- no, no, no, wait-- I rolled two ones on my d4s.
Matt: Yes.
Marisha: And I have--
Taliesin: Six plus two.
Marisha: -- a plus six, so that's actually eight.
Matt: Eight?
Marisha: Do I have one hit point left?
Taliesin: You're at one hit point, you're at one hit point.
Marisha: Is that accurate?
Sam: Eight plus five is--
Taliesin: Yes.
Sam: -- eight plus five is 13, you just took 13 hit points.
Matt: You're zero.
Laura: So you're at zero.
Taliesin: You're at zero. Never mind. Fuck.
Matt: You just fall unconscious.
Laura: You're at zero.
Marisha: I'm at zero.
Taliesin: Okay.
Matt: All righty.
Marisha: God f-- damn it.
Laura: I rolled a 20.
Matt: A 20?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: All right, so you take 13 points lightning damage.
Laura: Okay, and Trinket rolled a-- like a four.
Matt: 13 points of lightning damage.
Laura: Cool.
Travis: 20-- 23 and resistance.
Matt: All right, so that's 11--
Taliesin: It's gonna come down to Grog.
Matt: -- six points of lightning damage to you, Grog. All right, so Control Water is dropped.
Marisha: Get out. Out.
Matt: That ends--
Travis: Me?
Marisha: Get out. Get out.
Matt: -- Keyleth's turn. The 20 count.
Travis: What about him?
Matt: Vex, what are you doing?
Marisha: You're all-- I've got him. You've got three lodestones.
Laura: I saw--
Taliesin: You don't have--
Matt: You saw Keyleth just go--
Travis: I only have one.
Marisha: You and him.
Matt: -- get shocked as the burst of electrical energy shoots through the area, and she just kinda goes limp again, and is kind of floating in space.
Laura: And I saw Vax get swallowed? Did I see that happen?
Matt: You would've just barely seen it over your shoulder. And heard someone say it over the earpiece.
Laura: I-- fuckin' A. I swim up, and I swim-- god damn it.
Matt: You have your bonus action for a dash if you want to try and get closer, it's up to you.
Laura: I'm gonna try to shoot thorns, I guess, Hail of Thorns, maybe? Actually, I'm gonna try-- yeah. I'm gonna try--
Matt: What are you doing?
Laura: -- to shoot Hail of Thorns at-- directly at his mouth. I don't know, try to get him to like, do something to let go. Spit it up. It's the stupidest plan. I know. But, I'm not thinking clearly, my brother's got fucking swallowed.
Matt: Okay, what level Hail of Thorns?
Laura: I'm gonna do it at-- Oh, everything within five feet, and Keyleth is in five feet.
Matt: No, Keyleth is over here.
Laura: Okay. Is anything within five feet?
Matt: Currently, no.
Laura: Okay. Then I'm gonna-- I'm gonna cast it at fourth level.
Matt: Fourth level?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: You still have a fourth-level spell?
Laura: Oh no, I did Grasping Vine.
Matt: You did.
Laura: Did I?
Matt: That's when you pull--
Laura: No, I didn't.
Marisha: That was me.
Laura: No, I did Conjure Animals.
Matt: That's right, you did.
Laura: So fourth level.
Matt: Yeah, okay, fourth level? So that is an additional 4d10 piercing damage towards the attack. Go ahead and roll the attack.
Laura: 23?
Matt: 23 is the disadvantage?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Okay, that hits.
Laura: 11 plus three lightning and then-- how many? 4d10?
Matt: 4d10.
Laura: 18.
Matt: Okay, plus 18 points of damage. So as you fire the arrow, it sinks into the side of its mouth, just bursts with thorns in the vicinity. Kind of roils, but it doesn't seem to have any effect. You have your secondary attack if you want to.
Laura: Yeah, I guess I'm gonna try to shoot at his eye.
Matt: Okay, go ahead and roll.
Laura: 29.
Matt: 29 hits.
Laura: 16, plus four lightning, nothing.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: And I'm gonna-- This is so stupid. I'm gonna swim back down and try to hide. I've got nothing.
Matt: You already used your bonus action, unfortunately. To cast the spell.
Laura: Yes, I did. I'm gonna stand right there and say, fuck you, let go of my brother.
Matt: Okay. Percival, you're on the other side of the portal, looking through and you're watch--
Taliesin: How long-- Can I see what's going on?
Matt: I mean, you get a slight-- If you peek out the side. It's still obscured and like, the water--
Taliesin: And it's only been six seconds.
Matt: The Daylight spell is still kinda shooting out from underneath, so it's this beacon of light in the underwater area. So you get a decent view of what's going on. You see Keyleth kinda go limp in the distance. You see Grog there. You see Vex trying to shoot.
Taliesin: No. (inhales) I'm gonna try and-- how far do I have on that? I'm gonna try and stick my head through the portal. I'm gonna try and cast Minor Illusion? In front of the beast?
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: It can't be complicated, can it? It's gotta be small.
Matt: Nope. It is a cantrip.
Taliesin: It's a cantrip, so it's nothing. It's nothing fancy. I'm just gonna try and make a big meaty target appear. Just like a thing that looks like-- I'm gonna try and do like the shape of some aquatic animal? A small-- anything to try and get right in its face?
Matt: You concentrate through the portal and you watch just short of about 30 feet past you, a little shimmering space looks almost like a fish but it's sort of translucent and blob-like.
Taliesin: God damn it.
Matt: It's not really gonna help in this situation. Sorry.
Taliesin: I got-- Other than-- Yeah, I got nothing. Other than trying to distract it.
Matt: All right. End of your turn?
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: It's going to use--
Taliesin: I pull back through the portal, obviously, but.
Matt: All righty. As you pull back through and it returns, it's gonna ahead and use-- It's taking another legendary action to make a-- This is gonna be a tentacle attack against you, Grog?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: With advantage, that's going to be nine plus 18, that's 27?
Travis: That hits.
Matt: You take 12 points of bludgeoning damage plus ten, that's 22. Divided by that. 11.
Travis: 11.
Matt: All right, Percy's--
Travis: Can I make a retalito-ri-teh?
Matt: You already used it.
Travis: I did.
Matt: Sorry.
Sam: Retali-tali-tah?
Matt: It is now the Kraken's turn. At the top of the round, you lose a death saving throw?
Sam: To what?
Matt: As the acid begins to slowly burn away--
Laura: Oh yeah, this is gonna be--
Matt: Oh no, I mean like, you lose one. As the acid burns.
Liam: Oh, it just goes. Okay.
Matt: The acid is slowly digesting you. It's gonna move four, five, ten, 15, 25, 30. We'll say for the purposes of this, you're right there, Grog. Space is getting a little cluttered over there.
Travis: Am I grappled or did he just bitch slap me?
Matt: I mean, it hit you and grappled you.
Travis: Okay, cool.
Matt: One of its remaining tentacles--
Taliesin: Is Tary-- Tary's still held on?
Matt: Tary is--
Sam: Being pulled around.
Travis: Hah!
Matt: You're being pulled up over the rock and dragged across.
Liam: (make impact noises)
Laura: (make impact noises)
Matt: Like, oh god. Over there. That's a 34. You take-- this shit's getting intense.
Taliesin: (groans)
Matt: Oh my god.
Liam: Getting intense? Jesus.
Matt: (laughs) That is--
Marisha: God damn it.
Matt: -- 29 points of piercing damage, halved--
Travis: Okay, so that's?
Matt: To 14--
Travis: 14.
Matt: And it swallows you a second time.
Taliesin: Good!
Laura: Good, then you can get Vax out.
Marisha: Yeah, you can get Vax out.
Matt: Pulling you into its body--
Taliesin: Good! I approve of this.
Travis: You guys think this is part of a plan.
Matt: You are consumed and restrained once again in its dark space inside as you're pulled into the--
Travis: Fuck this tiny hole shit.
Laura: (laughs)
Matt: That ends its turn, Grog, you're up.
Travis: Ah, it's my turn now? I don't even get like a second to think about it?
Matt: Nope! Ah, as you're pulled inside the voice comes up again and it's now emanating outward to you as well, Vex, and in the unconscious darkness of Vax and Keyleth, the voice just says, "I've been here a long time, and I'll be here long after you are dust. Feed me and give me sustenance, I'll find my way through somehow." Grog?
Travis: I take a greater healing potion. Can I reach Vax at all? Can I find any part of his foot or anything and pull him down to me?
Matt: All right, so-- you can either reach around for him, try and feel for him-- you can take a healing potion as a bonus action if you'd like.
Travis: It's not for me.
Matt: Oh, it's not for you? You can make an investigation check to try and find him. This is gonna be your action to do so.
Travis: Is he rough at all? Even close?
Liam: The kraken.
Laura: The kraken.
Matt: The kraken? Not from what you've seen. You guys haven't been doing focusing damage, you've been trying to move around him. He's lost a number of tentacles, but--
Travis: Right, and those tentacles-- the tentacles don't count towards his overall damage?
Matt: No, they do.
Taliesin: They do, but--
Travis: (sighs loudly) What a choice. I am going to-- fuck it, I'm gonna make an investigation check for Vax.
Matt: Go for it.
Laura: (groans)
Travis: That's a big natural one.
Matt: Feeling around inside, you're unable to find any current form of Vax right now. However, you still have your bonus action and you are frenzied.
Liam: Take that fucking potion. Take it.
Travis: All right, I'll take the potion myself.
Matt: All righty.
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: So, what potion is it?
Travis: It's a greater, my last greater
Matt: All right, 4d4 plus four hit points.
Travis: 4d4 plus four.
Laura: So that's 48 hit points healed!
Travis: Seven, eight--
Sam: (laughs) Thanks, Laura.
Travis: 11, 12.
Matt: Oh, Laura, do you want your shark to do anything, by the way?
Travis: 16.
Sam: Nailed it!
Travis: 16 points of healing.
Laura: Yeah, I want it to go and try and attack the tentacle that is holding Tary.
Sam: The shark? Hello, shark friend! Aquatic ally!
Liam: I'll be back.
Laura: 21? No, 22.
Matt: That hits, roll damage.
Laura: 14.
Matt: 14 points of damage, that was one that had previously taken 22 points of damage--
Sam: Ooh!
Matt: the shark actually does tear the tentacle free, so technically Taryon, before you're about to get dragged over the coals of the top of this, before the shark actually tore into and removed your grapple from--
Taliesin: And Trinket runs.
Matt: It is down to two tentacles.
Laura: Trinket runs--
Sam: Wow.
Laura: -- oh yeah, and Trinket ran towards the door
Marisha: To the door, Taryon.
Sam: I can't hear anything.
Matt: Four here, four there.
Taliesin: Well, and she's unconscious.
Sam: (laughs) I can't really see the layout-- is it my turn, by the way?
Matt: It is your turn now, yeah.
Sam: I can't really see the layout of that rock, can I see through it? Is there an under that I can--
Matt: There is actually-- there is a small, kind of under-- kind of a low bridge.
Sam: Well, ball sack. I can't move very fast now, can I?
Matt: You can move 15 feet, as you swim through.
Sam: Can I wiggle through, under the little outcropping there, and get to the other side?
Matt: 15. You can just get out to that side, yeah.
Sam: Do I have a clean line of sight on him?
Matt: On the kraken?
Sam: Yeah.
Matt: Yes, you do.
Sam: Okay. I mean-- I can't really--
Taliesin: How many tentacles does the kraken have now?
Matt: Two more.
Sam: If I shoot the thing, the people inside will die. (nervous laugh)
Laura: I don't know about that, it might keep them from getting digested
Sam: Nuh-uh. I don't think so
Taliesin: Only one-- I mean, it's not like you're saving them by not hitting them at this point
Sam: They're gonna die.
Taliesin: Yeah, no matter what you do.
Marisha: Don't kill the kraken.
Taliesin: Kraken ain't dying.
Sam: I mean--
Taliesin: Kraken got ten thousand hit points.
Sam: Wow.
Taliesin: He's not even vaguely dying.
Sam: Is there a part of the kraken I can see that looks like I can do damage to it without hurting the main-- what is that, the thorax? (laughs)
Matt: You don't see any-- it is a big creature. Your friends are somewhere deep inside its fleshy, digesting interior, the outside is armored, and filled with very, very taut muscle and hide, so yeah. You would probably not damage your friends if you were careful.
Sam: All right, well, then I will take off a diamond and blast it with a Prismatic Spray.
Laura: (gasps)
Matt: Oh shit.
Taliesin: Thank god!
Sam: Yeah, yeah, except half of the things won't do anything to it.
Taliesin: Yeah, but we are out of options!
Laura: Well, still better than nothing.
Taliesin: I am totally okay with a Hail Mary.
Laura: Oh my god.
Matt: Okay, so as a Prismatic Spray, in this direction-- out this way, it'll just crest past the front of the kraken and the tentacles-- let's see here. Prismatic Spray, that's a dexterity saving throw on that.
Sam: I'm sure it makes it.
Matt: That is a 23.
Sam: Yeah, of course it makes it.
Matt: All right, so roll for your first beam, which is against the kraken itself.
Sam: Do I roll a d8? Or wait, to choose what kind of beam?
Matt: Are you focusing on the kraken or one of its tentacles?
Sam: I mean, no tentacles are holding anything right now, right?
Matt: Currently, no.
Sam: All right, so--
Matt: So it'd be just the kraken.
Sam: Just the kraken.
Matt: All right, so roll a d8 to see which beam hits it.
Sam: Five?
Matt: Five, that is 10d6 cold damage.
Sam: Oh, cold! That's good.
Matt: So go ahead and roll that.
Taliesin: Want some d6s? Or are you okay?
Sam: Doesn't have resistance to that, right?
Laura: Maybe.
Sam: Ten, right?
Taliesin: Yeah.
Marisha: Yeah.
Sam: Eight, 14, 19, 30, 35.
Matt: 35 points of cold damage, reduced to half because it made its save.
Sam: (groans)
Travis: Disable those tentacles, man.
Matt: That's 13. All right.
Taliesin: If you do enough damage to it, it may vomit them out.
Travis: No, we gotta do it from the inside.
Matt: You get that sense.
Laura: (groans)
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: Do you have-- yeah, and the tentacles don't get a Prismatic Spray of their own?
Matt: Nah, it's one of those things where it just damages the creature, you have to focus a specific physical attack on one tentacle.
Taliesin: Oh, man.
Matt: All right, that brings us to the top of the round, Vax, go ahead and roll a death saving throw with advantage.
Sam: I can't do a-- rip off a patch and take a potion, can I, as a bonus?
Matt: A regular potion, you mean?
Sam: It's a patch potion.
Matt: A patch potion?
Sam: Yeah.
Liam: It's like a nicotine patch.
Laura: Would it be like a patch healing spell?
Taliesin: A Patch Addams.
Matt: Using the patch is an action I think, originally, sorry.
Travis: Can you chew it?
Sam: (laughs) I just chew on the patch.
Matt: So Vax?
Taliesin: It's just jerky you've sewn into you.
Liam: Good.
Sam: (laughs)
Matt: All right, so Keyleth, death saving throw please.
Travis: Oh, I forgot she's unconscious, too.
Taliesin: (groans)
Marisha: Plus my constitution?
Matt: Nope, just a d20.
Taliesin: Nope, straight.
Matt: What'd you roll?
Marisha: Three.
Matt: All right, so you failed one death saving throw. Let's see. Then after that, it's--
Sam: Percy's having a Mai Tai somewhere.
Matt: All right, Vex, Trinket and Taryon, make dexterity saving throws please.
Sam: 11!
Matt: 11. Six points of lightning damage.
Laura: 19 for me.
Matt: Six points of lightning damage.
Laura: And-- fail, like five.
Matt: Six points of lightning damage for Trinket.
Laura: Six?
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: He's unconscious, so he's bamfed to my necklace.
Matt: All right, well, yeah.
Laura: Is he within a hundred feet?
Matt: Yeah, yeah he is. Keyleth, you fail another death saving throw.
Marisha: Immediately?
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: You took lightning damage.
Laura: Oh my god.
Matt: All righty.
Laura: Oh my god.
Sam: This is not gonna go well, guys. (nervous laugh) We got nobody else on the field.
Matt: Vex, it's your turn, you have an unconscious Keyleth over here.
Laura: I'm gonna swim to her and try to cast Cure Wounds.
Matt: Okay. Cast it.
Laura: Good, I'm casting it at third level. So that's 3d8. That's cocked. That sucks. Seven, sorry.
Matt: So that was a total of what?
Laura: Seven.
Matt: Seven.
Sam: -- points. Hey Keyleth, you're alive!
Matt: So Keyleth, you are conscious.
Marisha: Seven points?
Matt: You heal seven hit points, you are conscious.
Marisha: (gasps)
Travis: Back in the game.
Laura: Save my brother! (garbled) Save my brother.
Marisha: (garbled) Okay.
Matt: All right. Ending Vex's turn. Percival-- actually, Vex, you still have movement if you want to.
Laura: I'm gonna try to hide.
Matt: You have nothing to hide behind.
Marisha: Get out, get out, get out.
Laura: I'm gonna just swim away from-- I'm just gonna try to swim towards the fucking door, but try to keep my distance from kraken while I'm doing it.
Matt: It's hard to do that right now, but you have the door that way, there's a little gap. All right, that ends Vex's turn. Percival, anything?
Taliesin: Yeah.
Sam: That thing do anything?
Taliesin: No, it fires electricity.
Sam: Oh.
Laura: Oh, shark is going to attack one of the last tentacles, if it can get to it.
Taliesin: I'm going to hold my action for--
Matt: It can just barely get there. Go ahead and roll an attack.
Taliesin: -- for the vague hope of something useful.
Matt: Okay. Holding your action to?
Taliesin: To attack-- I've already burned it, and it laughed it off. Just to attack the kraken--
Matt: Just sword at the ready?
Taliesin: If it gets close enough, just sword, just--
Matt: Okay.
Laura: 28.
Matt: 28 hits. Roll damage.
Laura: 12.
Sam: That shark is our most effective weapon.
Laura: The shark has been pretty great.
Matt: All righty. That brings us to--
Sam: What can you turn us into?
Matt: -- the kraken's turn. Top of the turn, the acid burns through you even further, Vax. You fail another death saving throw.
Liam: So that's two?
Matt: That's two. All right. Top of the kraken's turn, it's going to-- let's see who's in range, here.
Sam: (sings with the background music)
Travis: This is mindblowing.
Laura: And it's so late.
Liam: Yeah, it's midnight.
Laura: And we're just into the wee hours of the morning, watching ourselves die.
Sam: Guys, I think this is one of our tightest games.
Matt: This is kind of nuts. All right, it's going to make a tentacle attack at both-- at the shark, Vex, and Keyleth.
Laura: But he only has two tentacles left.
Matt: That's right, two tentacles. So it's going to make one at Vex and Keyleth.
Travis: But the shark is so dangerous.
Laura: The shark's been hurting it.
Sam: The shark is literally the most dangerous thing we have.
Laura: And Keyleth just is barely--
Matt: You gather this creature is far more intelligent than you think. It's not a natural beast. It's a fairly intelligent creature.
Sam: What if the shark gets the how do you want to do this?
Matt: That is a 26 versus you. You take-- well, the good news is I'm rolling shit damage. That is 18 points of bludgeoning damage to you, Vex, and you are grappled by one tentacle. And against Keyleth, you are-- it's technically not within five feet of you. That's a natural one. I was like, I'm pretty sure he had advantage because you're prone, but prone is the creature has advantage against any creature that is within five feet of the creature, otherwise it has disadvantage. So yeah.
Laura: That's great.
Taliesin: Oh, god.
Marisha: I'll just go back to doggy paddling.
Matt: That's one thing that saved you. And that's gonna be-- just the two attacks, that's all it can do this turn. All right. That brings us to Grog, you're up.
Travis: Let us whoop the everloving shit out of the inside of this kraken, Reckless, everything. Yeah. Just all three attacks, just hitting it--
Matt: Great Weaponmaster as well, or not?
Travis: It's not really a great weapon.
Matt: Two-handed, versatile means you can hold it with two hands.
Travis: Oh yeah?
Matt: Pretty sure that's how it works. I'll check real fast.
Travis: It's just a hammer, it's not like a greatsword or a greataxe. I thought maybe it was--
Matt: I'll double-check the wording, just to be safe.
Taliesin: You'll decrease the resale value of these books with how much you've been cracking the spines tonight. I'm just saying.
Matt: Oh, it's a heavy weapon. Not-- so yeah, you cannot. You were right.
Travis: I'll make 'em Reckless, though. All three.
Laura: (sings) My honest husband.
Travis: 29.
Matt: 29.
Travis: Hits, right?
Matt: Just gonna double-check, 'cause the internet's gonna get angry at me.
Travis: I'm just gonna roll the damage.
Matt: 29 hits.
Travis: First is a 20.
Matt: 20 points of damage?
Travis: Second one is a 22.
Matt: 22, hits.
Travis: Hits? Okay, good.
Laura: Don't.
Travis: 24 points of damage.
Matt: 24 points of damage, all righty.
Travis: Last one is a natural 20. (all cheer)
Matt: Roll damage.
Sam: Oh my Jesus.
Travis: That's a ten, that's 44, and that's seven, so that's 51 points of damage. 51 points of damage to it.
Matt: That, in its own attack, is enough to make its constitution saving throw. Let's see if it-- That is a four! Plus 15 is 19, is not enough to make its constitution saving throw. It vomits Grog and an unconscious Vax--
Marisha: Oh, thank God.
Matt: -- out in the front.
Marisha: Fucking hell.
Taliesin: Got to get a healing potion in that guy stat.
Matt: Jesus Christ, guys, you're killing me.
Laura: (groans)
Taliesin: Get it, get it in him.
Matt: So, Grog, it's you, you still have your movement.
Travis: I do have my movement--
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: Okay.
Travis: I am going to-- it's such a short shitty movement--
Laura: You better fucking heal him.
Travis: -- can I just rotate around him towards the door and stay within.
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: As far as I can get.
Matt: 25, you can get there.
Travis: Halved, yep.
Taliesin: Ah, fuck.
Matt: All right, ending Grog's turn, Taryon.
Sam: Ah, wait, is Little Elf Boy alive?
Matt: No.
Laura: No, he's unconscious.
Matt: He's unconscious with two failed death saving throws--
Sam: And Grog just ran away from him?
Marisha: But he's out of the kraken, he's out of the kraken.
Laura: Grog can't do anything.
Sam: Okay.
Taliesin: But if you can heal him for a point--
Sam: Nope.
Taliesin: In any way possible--
Sam: Nope.
Taliesin: Okay.
Sam: Nope (laughs). Can't do it.
Taliesin: This is not good, people.
Liam: True love's kiss?
Taliesin: I am very far away, right now.
Matt: There you go, Sam.
Sam: Is it my turn?
Liam: I just mean Sam.
Sam: I mean, that I would love to do.
Liam: Again.
Sam: (nervous noises) Nope, I got nothing. Prismatic Spray will kill everybody else-- ring of the ram's dead-- I can't throw anything that far, right? He's like 40 feet away from me?
Matt: Yep, no, you're right over here you're-- what would Taryon do at this moment?
Sam: 50 feet away? How far am I?
Matt: You're about 50 feet from him, yeah.
Marisha: You have a bag, right?
Sam: I can't throw something 50 feet underwater, and I can only move 15 feet.
Marisha: But you can swim out-- oh.
Sam: (laughs) There's very little I can do--
Marisha: But you can double your movement.
Sam: I will say "crossbow" and change my thing, my rod, into a crossbow--
Matt: Uh-huh.
Sam: And nock the poison bolt and shoot it.
Laura: (gasps)
Matt: Sure, I'll say-- all right, so--
Laura: Look at that, look at that poison bolt.
Sam: I'll also move 15 feet--
Matt: There you go, go ahead and make your attack with disadvantage.
Sam: Okay. (mock-sobbing) It was a one. (all laugh)
Matt: You pull it back and fire and it goes (kerplunk) and the bolt just goes and floats up and you're like, "Shit".
Travis: Wow. Wow.
Sam: But when I moved Matt, I want to move toward it, not away.
Matt: Okay, so you'll be--
Taliesin: I'm gonna get you a new d20 soon.
Matt: All right. Ending Tary's turn, Vax, death saving throw, with advantage.
Laura: (gasps)
Matt: With no Luck left?
Marisha: What what what no? No? Nothing? No luck? Come on.
Travis: Wow.
Marisha: Raven Queen shit? Nothing?
Travis: Wow. Really?
Matt: The last bit of air escapes the lungs of Vax, lifeless on the ground. All right. That ends your turn, obviously, Keyleth.
Marisha: Oh my God.
Travis: What the fuck?
Sam: The kraken.
Marisha: Who do I see?
Matt: You're right here on the ground, you see Vax not moving. You see Vex currently grappled inside there, and Grog and everyone rushing in this direction towards the portal.
Marisha: Vex is grappled, Vax is dead, and then there's me. How close am I to Vex and Vax?
Matt: You are ten feet from Vax and 15 feet from Vex, or ten feet from each, actually.
Marisha: I'm ten feet from each?
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: Can I swim with my Alter Self, grab both of them-- Can I do that? Can I grab both of them?
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: With my swim speed--
Matt: All right.
Marisha: -- Alter Self. Yeah?
Matt: You can, you can grab--
Marisha: In between them.
Matt: You can grab Vax-- and begin to tug him toward Vex at half speed so that's five, ten--
Marisha: No I've got Alter Self! I've got Alter Self!
Matt: Right, but you're--
Laura: You're tugging--
Matt: -- you're dragging him behind you as you go.
Marisha: Come on, man, do I have Vex--
Matt: Five, ten, 15, 20, 25, 30--
Marisha: 30.
Matt: You're like just in the space.
Marisha: (gasps)
Matt: What're you trying to do?
Marisha: And I cast, I cast Plane Shift and I get us out of here--
Matt: Oh shit! Okay. All right. And with that, the three of you vanish.
Marisha: Sorry, everyone else.
Sam: The three of you, wait, you, who, and who?
Matt: The shark vanishes.
Sam: Oh, the shark.
Travis: Who just vanished?
Marisha: Me, Vex, and Vax--
Taliesin: Everyone but you--
Matt: Plane Shifting where?
Marisha: It's you and Taryon left. Get the fuck out.
Travis: Where are you going?
Matt: Plane Shifting where, Keyleth?
Marisha: Back to Vesrah.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: We're out of the portal.
Matt: All right. They vanish. Grog. All right, so that finishes Keyleth's turn. Top of the scale here, I need both of you guys to make dexterity saving throws.
Marisha: Wait, who? Who?
Matt: Grog and Taryon.
Travis: And I have advantage.
Marisha: Wait, Grog is dead?
All: No!
Laura: Dexterity!
Matt: Dexterity.
Taliesin: Dexterity saving throw.
Sam: 18.
Matt: 18, all right, you take eight points of lightning damage--
Marisha: I thought you said death.
Matt: Grog?
Travis: 17.
Matt: That is eight points--
Travis: With resistance?
Matt: Yeah, reduced to four.
Travis: Okay, so just four.
Matt: All right, Percival.
Marisha: Wait, wait, are you grappled?
Sam: It's fine, you're not there.
Laura: Nobody else is grappled right now.
Taliesin: You're not there.
Liam: You're gone, you're gone. You're chill with me.
Marisha: Nobody else is grappled.
Taliesin: I'm-- There is nothing I can do.
Matt: All right. End of your turn, the last legendary action to attempt to grab and grapple Grog.
Marisha: (groans)
Matt: With advantage, because you--
Travis: That's right.
Liam: Fuck you, kraken.
Matt: That is 26.
Travis: That hits.
Sam: (exasperated sigh) Fuck.
Matt: You take nine-- ten points of bludgeoning damage, being reduced, and you are grappled.
Travis: To five? Oh, ten is reduced?
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: Okay.
Liam: Whew!
Travis: And can I make my Retaliatory?
Matt: You can.
Sam: On that tentacle!
Travis: Reckless. 23.
Matt: 23 hits, go ahead and roll damage.
Travis: That is also a 23.
Matt: 23, that one had taken 13 damage earlier. That tentacle is destroyed. There is one left.
Travis: I'm not grappled?
Matt: You are no longer grappled. There is one slightly damaged tentacle left. As you do so, the voice says, "No. Come, join your end here in the depths." All right, that ends your Retaliation, Percy's, it is now-- Wait, so that was Percy's turn, right?
Taliesin: I already, I just--
Marisha: Can't do anything
Taliesin: -- there's literally nothing I can do.
Travis: Yeah, he didn't do anything.
Matt: Right, okay. It's gonna come forward here, it's gonna do Lightning Storm against both of you. I need both Taryon and Grog to make dexterity saving throws once more.
Travis: That's good.
Sam: 18.
Travis: 20. No more blessed.
Liam: Hashtag no more blessed.
Matt: All right.
Travis: Yeah, hashtag no more blessed.
Laura: Hashtag so not blessed.
Matt: That is a really shitty roll. 13 points lightning damage--
Sam: Dead.
Matt: -- 13 points lightning damage.
Laura: Unconscious.
Travis: 20 and resistance for me.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: So it was? Sorry.
Matt: It was 13 minus that to--
Laura: Tary--
Matt: -- seven.
Travis: Seven.
Matt: So Taryon falls unconscious.
Laura: Motherfuck.
Liam: Scanlan appears in a purple puff of smoke!
Matt: I know.
Travis: Are you really? Are you really? Where are you?
Sam: He's right near you.
Marisha: So both Vex and Tary are unconscious?
Matt: So, Grog, it's your turn.
Sam: You don't even like me.
Travis: I'm gonna take the coin--
Marisha: You're unconscious?
Liam: She's with us.
Laura: You took me!
Liam: You just bamfed us out.
Travis: -- I'm gonna Alter Self.
Marisha: Wait, who's unconscious?
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Tary!
Liam: Tary!
Travis: I'm gonna grow gills and fins.
Sam: Wait! Sh! He's doing stuff.
Matt: Okay. So the gills and fins appear, your webbed fingers, and what're you doing?
Travis: I see Tary fall... and I... ... bolt for the portal.
Laura: (gasps)
Sam: Going right past me.
Travis: Yep.
Laura: Oh, fuck.
Taliesin: I am staring you in the deadeye--
Sam: I love it. I love it.
Travis: And can I, can I like--
Marisha: We need, he has a purse.
Travis: -- can I like double my speed?
Matt: No, unfortunately, because you used your action to do the ability on you, however-- Oh! Wait, wait, you have the-- so you have the full movement--
Travis: I do.
Sam: Full movement?
Travis: That's right, 50.
Taliesin: We need the-- (sigh) we need the fucking lodestone.
Laura: Oh he's--
Laura: -- got the other lodestone.
Sam: -- got the other lodestone.
Laura: He does have the third lodestone!
Sam: Fuck you guys.
Travis: Do I make it to the portal?
Matt: You are just on the outskirts of it. And you see Percy yelling at you.
Taliesin: Lodestone!
Travis: What? Oh! (all laugh)
Travis: Right.
Laura: Oh, that was a great way to ensure that you got out of here, Tary. (all laugh)
Matt: All right, coming through at 20, Grog, I need you to make a dexterity saving throw.
Liam: Come on, girl. Get out.
Travis: 19.
Matt: That is 10 reduced to five, five points of lightning damage against you. Taryon, you fail a death saving throw--
Sam: Sure.
Matt: -- automatically 'cause you take the damage from the lightning.
Taliesin: How far is Tary from the-- how many feet is Tary from the portal?
Matt: Tary is--
Sam: 50?
Matt: 40 feet.
Taliesin: 40 feet?
Matt: Yep.
Taliesin: What's my running speed?
Marisha: Get out, get out.
Taliesin: What's my running speed?
Matt: Your running speed is 30.
Taliesin: Okay.
Matt: All right, Percival, what're you doing?
Marisha: Get out, get out, get out.
Sam: You can dash and get 60.
Taliesin: (deep sigh) God damn it.
Marisha: You still have the coin, right?
Taliesin: I've already taken it.
Sam: Your potion of haste.
Travis: Don't complicate this.
Taliesin: I don't have a potion of haste!
Sam: Yeah, sure you do.
Travis: Don't complicate this, I think we'll be okay. I think.
Matt: Percival, what are you doing?
Taliesin: I have a healing potion. I have a healing potion.
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: Fuck.
Marisha: Come on, Percy.
Taliesin: I don't know what the fuck to do.
Liam: That's the title for the episode.
Sam: What's your speed?
Taliesin: 60.
Sam: Yeah, so go over there and heal me, fucker! (all laugh)
Taliesin: Yeah, I'm not going to survive one round in there. I'm 16 points.
Sam: Oh, okay, I will.
Taliesin: Yeah, there's no-- is Grog looking rough?
Matt: Grog, how are you looking?
Travis: I'm okay.
Taliesin: You're looking fine?
Travis: I'm all right.
Taliesin: I'm just going to scowl at you. I'm actually, fuck it! I have something I can do!
Matt: What are you doing?
Sam: Science bros, man!
Matt: What are you doing, Percy?
Taliesin: I'm gonna cast Friends on Grog.
Matt: Grog. Make a wisdom saving throw. With advantage, because of Heroes' Feast.
Travis: I don't even know what that is.
Liam: Wow.
Travis: Three. Five. Zero modifier.
Liam: Holy shit.
Travis: I don't know what that is.
Liam: Love this game.
Matt: Actually, it's supposed to be charisma checks against him. What are you trying to do?
Taliesin: Just toss the nitwit through the door!
Matt: Wait, are you trying to intimidate him?
Taliesin: No, I'm begging!
Matt: All right. Make a persuasion check with advantage. That's how technically it's supposed to work.
Taliesin: Yes.
Matt: But, I'm giving you--
Travis: Through the water?
Taliesin: With advantage, that was cocked, though, was it?
Sam: That's a 20.
Taliesin: Okay. Yeah, it was 20.
Matt: 20? Okay.
Taliesin: Natural 20.
Matt: Okay, Grog. You come through and see Percy looking at you, and oh shit, you don't wanna make him mad. He's your buddy.
Taliesin: Toss the nitwit through the door.
Travis: The nitwit. That's-- okay.
Taliesin: Yeah. I'm good. I'm good.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: I love you. I'm so proud of you.
Laura: What just happened?
Travis: The nitwit.
Taliesin: That's what I said.
Travis: Who do you think I'd think the nitwit is?
Taliesin: I think it's--
Marisha: Grog.
Taliesin: I can't take it back, what I said. I'm well aware.
Matt: All right.
Sam: (sings along with the background music)
Taliesin: I can start to argue with you if you start to do something stupid, which is fine.
Travis: You did cast Friends, so. Technically, I would think nitwit is me, and I'd be like, okay, here I go.
Taliesin: You might. I'm not gonna--
Sam: Why don't you roll for it, Travis?
Travis: No, he cast Friends, and the whole point is to-- yeah.
Liam: You don't know that.
Travis: Yeah, that's a DM call. It's not quite my call.
Matt: The kraken is going to go ahead and make a bite attack against you.
Taliesin: Ah, god damn it.
Matt: Because it only has the one tentacle left. That is an 18 plus six, that is 24. That hits you. You take--
Taliesin: Oh, shit.
Matt: That's 23 points of piercing damage.
Travis: How many?
Matt: 23. Reduced to 12 because of your raging. And you are-- oh, you were not grappled by the kraken. So it does not swallow you. (all cheer)
Matt: That saves your ass there, man. I was just about to eat you. Okay. Been good for you guys. Yeah, that's the kraken's turn. Grog, what are you doing?
Travis: I am going to aquaman run over to Tary.
Taliesin: You have full speed now.
Travis: Yep.
Taliesin: So you can double-speed if you want.
Matt: Well, it's 25 there. It's gonna take an action to pick him up.
Travis: Maybe I just wanna grab the bag.
Laura: He said nitwit, throw the nitwit through the door.
Matt: What do you want to do, Grog? It's your call.
Taliesin: I'm not gonna fight you no matter what.
Matt: Yeah, what do you wanna do, Grog?
Travis: He cast Friends, right? So I wouldn't want to make Percy mad.
Matt: Well, it's up to you. Friends affects him more than it affects you, technically. He just seems very persuasive.
Taliesin: You feel like I had a point.
Travis: I pick up Tary.
Matt: Okay. Moving back with him, because your strength doesn't reduce your movement. (counts) 25. You don't quite reach the edge.
Laura: Can he throw Tary through? Or is that an additional action?
Travis: Do I have anything to toss him through that thing?
Matt: No, it takes your whole-- to pick him up and get there, you only have your bonus action right now.
Travis: Can I take one of the tiny little healing potions, the regular-ass ones?
Matt: If you have one, yeah.
Travis: I have one.
Matt: So there you go. You take it.
Travis: I forget what it's called.
Liam: Red Bull.
Matt: It's 2d4 plus two.
Laura: It's a Red Bull.
Travis: 2d4 plus two?
Matt: 2d4 plus two. Ends Grog's turn. Taryon. Make a death saving throw.
Sam: 11?
Matt: 11. So you're fine.
Taliesin: That's one good one. You get a success.
Matt: That brings us up to the top.
Taliesin: Is it mine?
Matt: Not quite yet.
Taliesin: Fuck.
Matt: We are at the 20.
Laura: Lair actions.
Taliesin: God damn it.
Matt: All right. That's a dexterity saving throw from you, Grog. It's just all-out shocking.
Travis: 16.
Matt: 16. That is 14 points of lightning damage to you, Grog.
Travis: Halved to seven.
Matt: Yep, halved to seven.
Sam: Automatic death fail.
Matt: Automatic death fail. All right, that brings us now to Percival.
Taliesin: I am just going to lean out the fucking door and take three attacks at a tentacle and run back in.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: Since he's right there!
Matt: Well, currently there is no tentacle in your range.
Taliesin: There's no tentacle in the range?
Matt: Right now, the tentacle's in range when it's wrapped around somebody, you can hit it right there. Right now, it's just in the distance.
Taliesin: In that case, I'm going to run out, grab and help drag everybody through the portal if I can.
Matt: You can grab and pull Taryon.
Taliesin: Be cool.
Travis: Pssh. We'll see--
Taliesin: You're going to be fine.
Travis: --Friend.
Taliesin: You won't know for a while.
Travis: We'll find out.
Matt: You pull Taryon through, his unconscious body through.
Taliesin: And I'm-- healing potion. I've got a minor.
Matt: You have a healing potion?
Taliesin: I do. I've got a minor left that I haven't burned.
Matt: Okay. So, I'll say that between your movement, you'll have enough. Go ahead and 2d4 plus two to Taryon.
Taliesin: 2d4 plus what?
Matt: 2d4 plus two to Taryon.
Taliesin: So that's six.
Matt: Taryon is conscious.
Taliesin: Now, I'm standing at the portal ready to, yeah.
Matt: All right. It is now the kraken's turn.
Laura: Oh my god.
Taliesin: He got nothing.
Matt: The kraken is going to sit right here now, directly behind you, Grog. Its tentacles swarm. It's the one tentacle, all these broken tentacles that are trying to extend. You can see parts of it are regenerating and starting to extend a little bit. Not fully, but it's going to take a while for it-- but you can see it does regenerate over time.
Travis: That is a bad, bad creature.
Matt: You know what, at the end of Percival's turn, it's going to use one of its legendary actions.
Taliesin: God damn it!
Matt: To attempt to bash.
Travis: I don't know what that means.
Matt: Natural 20.
Laura: Oh my god.
Matt: So that is 17 points of bludgeoning damage against you, reduced to half.
Travis: To eight? Nine?
Matt: That would be nine, yeah. And, you are grappled.
Marisha: He's grappled?
Matt: Now it's the kraken's turn.
Laura: I think it's going to try to swallow him.
Matt: And it is going to attempt to bite attack you. It does not have advantage. That is a 20?
Travis: That hits.
Taliesin: God fucking damn it!
Matt: That is 18 points of piercing damage, reduced to nine.
Travis: Mm-hm.
Matt: And you are swallowed.
Taliesin: God fucking damn it. Okay.
Sam: So you get any attacks, Groggy? Mm-hm? Okay.
Matt: All righty. Grog, it's your turn.
Travis: All three attacks--
Matt: Go for it.
Travis: -- Reckless. That's a 32.
Taliesin: Things!
Sam: I can heal you!
Travis: It's 20 points of damage on the first one.
Matt: All right, 20.
Travis: 26 is the hit for the second one.
Matt: That hits.
Travis: 24 points of damage on the second one.
Matt: 24, all right.
Travis: And then 23.
Matt: That hits.
Travis: With 19 points of damage on the third one.
Matt: It has to make a constitution save. That is directly a nine plus 15. It's a 24; the DC is 25. It fails, and vomits you out again to the front of it! Jesus Christ!
Laura: Right through the door! Vomits him right through the door!
Marisha: Come on, through the door! He projectile vomits!
Matt: I'm going to take a picture of that so people--
Marisha: Come on!
Matt: -- are like, "That's a little too close."
Travis: With the rest of my movement, can I turn around and look at him and go, yo, O Ancient One, can you read my mind now? And I walk through the portal.
Matt: And you do as you step away through the portal. (laughs) I can't believe that shit!
Travis: Just double birds.
Matt: I just tweeted that final saving throw on his end. Wow!
Taliesin: I hand you my glasses and fall down.
Matt: And that's where we're going to end tonight's game. Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ!
Sam: That was terrible!
Matt: Don't fuck with the titan creatures, man! Hey, your first death, Vax!
Travis: Titan creatures? Titan creatures.
Sam: First death? He's dead! That's not good!
Marisha: He's still fucking dead!
Matt: Yep.
Marisha: He's still fucking dead.
Liam: May be my last death.
Marisha: God!
Travis: We don't know. We don't know.
Taliesin: I think he should just--
Matt: And if so, that's at the bailiwick of your Queen. But we'll find out where that brings us next week. One way or another, a climactic end to the Aramente.
Laura: Oh my god.
Marisha: And all of the guilt complexes.
Travis: Wow. I underestimated that whole thing.
Laura: That was so much worse than I ever thought it would be.
Taliesin: I don't feel good.
Laura: I feel like I'm going to throw up.
Taliesin: Yeah, I feel a little nauseous, and it's not just the kraken.
Travis: Thank you, Loot Crate!
Matt: Thank you, Loot Crate, for being our sponsor!
Taliesin: Thanks, Loot Crate, for the robot and the Legos.
Marisha: Who's still alive? All of us, but Vax and Taryon?
Laura: Everybody but Vax.
Matt: How many points did you have at the end there, Grog?
Travis: Eight.
Matt: Eight hit points?!
Travis: Eight hit points.
Matt: Holy fucking shit!
Laura: Yeah! I was watching him take it down, and I was like, oh my god, one more hit and Grog's unconscious!
Travis: 65, 61, 51, 44, 39, 27, 33, 26, 17, eight.
Liam: Wow. Wow!
Travis: If I didn't get barfed, we would have problems.
Taliesin: I was going to make a running, yeah. I was not willing to, yeah. I was not going to walk.
Laura: You would have been swallowed, too.
Taliesin: I had a thought, but it was a bad thought. I'm really glad I didn't have to go with that bad thought.
Laura: Oh, I feel so sick!
Travis: I guess Tary lives another day.
Sam: I've learned a lesson! Always carry an insurance policy with me.
Matt: Fair enough.
Taliesin: I want to cry.
Matt: Well, guys, well done! You got the lodestones and escaped with the body of Vax, though dead. Had that last death saving throw happened in the stomach of the kraken, there was no way you were getting back.
Laura: So, that's good.
Sam: So, in a way, we won!
Matt: That's a silver lining. Anyway, guys, thank you for sticking through a very long, climactic, intense battle, both players and viewers. Thank you, Lootcrate, for being our awesome sponsor.
Travis: Thank you, Lootcrate!
Matt: We'll be back next week to see the conclusion of this Aramente arc. Much love to you all, and is it Thursday yet?
Travis: Not for another week!
Matt: See you guys soon. [art]

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hi, everyone! Welcome to Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons and Dragons. Good job, Sam. Thank you for your patience. Sorry we were off last week. I'm doing much better, for those who are worried about it. Happy to be back. Missed you guys, and happy to be back at this table. So yeah! It's been a couple of weeks. Let's go ahead and get into some announcements real fast. First off, tonight we have our fantastic sponsor, Shadow of War!
Travis: Shadow of War! Oh shit!
Laura: Are we allowed to say what we did in it?
Matt: Yeah, a number of us actually worked in the game. It comes out October 10th, actually.
Sam: And the full name of the game is Middle Earth: Shadow of War, for all of those who are looking for it alphabetically.
Travis: The sequel to Middle Earth  Shadow of Mordor.
Sam: Yes, and many of us were in the game yelling our asses off. I played a little character known as Orc 4. It was so much! I did 20 recording sessions.
Travis: I remember talking to you! I was Commanding Orc 1.
Sam: Oh, nice.
Matt: I was Professional Orc 1, as well as the Witch King of Angmar, the head of the Nazgul. I'm pretty excited about that.
Laura: Oh, nice!
Liam: I was Troy Baker's fluffer. It's prestigious.
Sam: You were in it, right? No?
Liam: I'm in the first one.
Sam: Oh, what did you do in the first one?
Liam: The thing I killed two weeks ago? That was me.
Sam: Laura, were you in it?
Laura: I am in it. I play the Blade of Galadriel.
Liam: You play a sword?!
Laura: I know! Get this, so I'm an assassin elf, right? She's really cool. The DLC is going to be about my character.
Sam: Do you have a number after your character?
Laura: No, it's the only one. It's the coolest thing! I don't think I ever told you this. When I saw the character design? She's a combo of Vex and Vax.
Matt: That's pretty great.
Laura: No, seriously, though, she's an elf chick. So she's an assassin. She's got dual-wielding, and she wears feathery armor. It's so freaking cool! So basically, it's like if Vax was a girl, which is Vex.
Travis: But with the sex appeal of Grog.
Laura: Of course, baby.
Matt: I will never forget being at the Shadow of War panel at Comic Con, and you mentioning the DLC and then going, "Has that even been announced yet?" And there was five seconds where I watched Laura wither away into a shell of a human before they went, "Oh, yeah, it's announced." And you reverted.
Laura: Even at this very moment, as I said it, aftershocks. "Was I supposed to say that?"
Liam: They scare you so bad that, even when it's official, I'm like "I'm in the--"
Travis: It's such a dope game. The Nemesis system has been improved on from last time. We can testify.
Sam: We're supposed to mention that on the 18th of this month, Shadow of War will be debuting a brand new live-action trailer that will take you near the game? No! Right into the game. Soon we'll need to choose whether to save or slay. During the break tonight, they're going to be showing off some awesome videos from the game. It drops October 10th. Go buy it and try to pick out our voices in the game as you slay us.
Travis: And make us rise to the higher echelons of the orc order.
Matt: By the way, if you haven't played the previous game, the Nemesis system is one of the coolest things I've played in many games in a long time. I'm going to challenge you guys to try and pick out not only who you voice orc-wise, but then to try and make sure our orcs rise to the very top. So you have nothing but generals from Critical Role. I challenge you for this. Because that would be pretty cool.
Liam: I hope you like hearing the word ranger.
Liam: Ranger!
Travis: Ranger!
Laura: Ranger!
Matt: It's going to be fun. All right, thank you, Shadow of War for being our sponsor tonight. We're excited about the game, and hope you are, too. Also, there's been a lot of insane weather tragedies that have been in the news recently. I want to make sure that everyone knows that if you want to help support relief for both of the hurricanes that have come and torn through the U.S., we have a link to the Red Cross to donate and be part of that. It'll be available in the chat and throughout the rest of the game tonight, so if you have the opportunity to help out, I highly recommend it. Come help these people that have lost a lot in the past couple weeks or so. Give what you can. I've given, and we really appreciate that support.
Travis: They'll let you delineate between Harvey and Irma, too, in case you want to pick one over the other. Harvey had a lot of support from J.J. Watt's $30+ million dollars. Irma, the damage is still accruing.
Matt: I grew up in Florida. I know the area well, and I have family out there that endured it. It's very close to me. So if you can, greatly appreciate it. Let's see here. Merch! Laura.
Laura: This feels so weird to say after you mentioned that.
Travis: Nah, but we make happy stuff.
Laura: Happy stuff! Which, by the way, you're wearing your Dalen's Closet shirt, Matt, and it matches your eyeballs so beautifully.
Travis: Ooh!
Matt: I'll show it to you, and my back brace, to make it really better.
Sam: Are we selling those in the store?
Matt: The back brace?
Travis: Critical Role back brace! Do you DM 20 hours a week? We've got something for you!
Liam: We missed an opportunity to put Backblaze on that back brace. (groaning)
Laura: Next time.
Matt: Next time.
Liam: No next time!
Laura: There are Dalen's Closet shirts in the store. Go check them out. There's tank tops. They're really cool; they're cheaper because they are sleeveless. That's less material. Dagger, Dagger, Dagger; it's been re-released. We have the Scanlan tee; we have all the tees. And it's getting cooler now, so the hoodie is still in the store; the softest hoodie ever is there. Go check it out. We have hats and we have key chains and necklaces and pencils and aprons and tarot cards, and other stuff. And more stuff coming! So keep your eyes peeled.
Matt: Thank you, Laura. Also reminding you guys, we have up to episode 40 of Critical Role now released on iTunes, Google, and geekandsundry.com has all the information for it. So if you want to listen to the podcast, or your friends have been like, "I don't want to watch it, but I just want to hear it."
Laura: I want to watch it, but I don't want to watch it.
Matt: It's good for commutes.
Marisha: Also, clarification, speaking of saying things prematurely before I should have. I've gotten a lot of questions being like, "What happened to that plan of rolling out one a day once a week?" Yeah, that plan didn't turn out to be feasible. And I might have said that-- I said it, and then I looked down at the announcement sheet and it said in parenthesis afterward, "But do not announce this part." Which, why was it even on our announcement sheet? Still my fault.
Matt: To be fair, I remember looking down at the sheet as you were announcing it.
Marisha: Oh shit. Anyway, it's never going to happen because they're easier to do in batch. So ten at a time. That's what you get.
Taliesin: It's like one cookie at a time. You can't bake one cookie at a time.
Marisha: It's just better to do them in a block.
Matt: Thank you for the heads-up on that. We announced a while back the Critical Role six-issue mini-series comic book. We announced last week that it's going through Dark Horse, which I'm super excited about.
Travis: DM is very excited.
Matt: Oh, yeah. Dark Horse was my introduction. I was probably in fourth grade when I got into the Alien comics through Dark Horse. I didn't realize there was more to explore. Dude, I've been a fan of them ever since. Being able to take this into their realm is brilliant. I'm so excited. First issue drops on the 20th, guys.
Marisha: The digital issue. The first issue releases digitally this coming Wednesday.
Sam: Is it good? I haven't read it.
Laura: It's so good!
Sam: Why have you all read it and I haven't?
Marisha: Because you don't read your emails.
Sam: Yeah, that's fair.
Liam: You show up ten minutes after we start, you leave an hour before we end the game every week.
Sam: That's true.
Matt: So that's coming up. It will be on Comixology, iBooks, Dark Horse Digital, Kindle, Nook, Google Play, etc. It's written by our good friend, Matt Colville. It's drawn beautifully by our good friend, Olivia Samson from the Critter community, and the coloring and lettering by Chris Northrop. Super stoked, hope you guys enjoy it. So look out for that next week.
Liam: Looks fucking awesome! The writing is awesome! The art is awesome!
Matt: What he said.
Laura: Did you already say about the physical copies, too? When those will be released?
Matt: We'll have a trade available in spring 2018.
Liam: It's coming out with the DLC for Middle Earth.
Matt: Yeah, to tie in with it. Of course, we have Talks Machina coming up this Tuesday at 7:00pm Pacific, here with our fantastic host, Brian. We'll be talking about our episode tonight. So look for that next week. All the Critical Role episodes are now available on Alpha. They've gone back and added the bells and whistles, the information, the stats, everything, for all the episodes before Alpha even launched. So if you ever watched it there, it's all updated.
Sam: I really should check my email!
Taliesin: We would miss this sense of wonder that we get to share with the community. It's really nice.
Marisha: They get your unbridled reaction.
Taliesin: It's like watching Home Alone next to Macaulay Culkin. It's great. I'm getting so much out of it.
Matt: All righty. Last few things. One  this is Sub-tember, guys, by the way, for Twitch. Sub-tember means for the next few weeks, Twitch has a special promotion where subscriptions are half off for new subs for every Twitch channel, including this one. So if you've been watching and you've always wanted to subscribe, but you never really felt like you can give the full $5, it's half off this month. So if you want to subscribe to our Twitch, now's the month to do it. Just giving the heads-up. It's pretty rad, and thank you, Sub-tember. Last but not least, Laura and Travis, you are going to be at an event soon, aren't you?
Travis: Yeah! End of this month, we're going to be at Anime Weekend Atlanta. The last week of September. Hotlanta, Georgia. We're going to be there with other people like Jennifer Hale and people like that. But we're going to be there. Come out, say hi, smack our hands, not our faces.
Laura: Give a high-five.
Marisha: I love Atlanta.
Travis: It's pretty dope. I want to get in that aquarium with those whale sharks. That's what I want to do. We're not going to have time for that. And then, also, in the middle of November, we're going to be going to Australia. Laura and I are going for two weeks. We're going to be in Adelaide, Brisbane. So for all the Aussies-- what?
Laura: I've got to get my passport.
Travis: Oh shit!
Liam: Expedite!
Travis: So barring Laura's passport showing up--
Matt: You can hear the $400 burn away instantly. That's how much it costs to expedite.
Laura: Oh my god. I'm doing that tomorrow! I'm going to write a note in my calendar.
Travis: (sighs) Adelaide, Brisbane. If you're there, you want to see us, come see maybe just me. (laughter)
Sam: Everybody tweet Laura tomorrow at noon, saying--
Laura: No, but seriously! If you want to, feel free.
Travis: Will Friedle will be there, too. He's going to be my convention wife. Me and Friedle.
Laura: I'm writing an email to myself.
Marisha: Australia? Is that when we got caught with having to have those weird travel visas, as well?
Matt: Yeah. Make sure you get your travel visas.
Marisha: Yeah, we didn't know until we got to the airport. And then they're like, "You have to have one." And then we're like, "Oh, okay." Luckily, you can do it online.
Travis: Oh, I totally have that covered.
Matt: All right. Well, cool, guys! Thank you so much. Thank you for dealing with our long announcements. It's been a few weeks. However, I think, with that, it's time to dive into tonight's episode of Critical Role. [dramatic music]
Matt: Welcome back. I'll remember this. Why's everything targeting Scanlan in this battle? Welcome back, everyone. So last we left off, Vox Machina, preparing themselves for a final fray with the recently ascended god, Vecna, the Undying King, discovered that he had brought the city of Thar Amphala about 300 miles northwest, of Vasselheim on the continent of Issylra. Upon gathering allies to assail this region, you discovered that it was shifting, moving. And apparently the corpse of the long dead primordial earth titan had been risen and began marching its way towards Vasselheim with Thar Amphala embedded at the top of its torso, protected by some sort of magical barrier. With an advance army of wyvern riders at your back and J'mon Sa Ord giving you a ride between their wings, you made your way southward. Quickly depositing yourselves within a waterfall, expelling opening towards the hip of this large titan undead beast, you began to fight your way to the interior. Dealing with corrupted earth elemental shards, you began to make your way through the catacombs, the long ruined and abandoned dwarven city of Thomara, where you encountered the tomb of the dwarven king. Where you also managed to raid the tomb, found a magical item, and dealt with some fun traps in the process. Then, continuing to follow where this route led you upward, hopefully towards the underbelly of the city of Thar Amphala, you uncovered a mostly cleaned out vault and did battle with some undead trolls that immediately rushed in and attacked you. You managed to destroy them, and make your way out through a small cavern that had just momentarily collapsed, clearing out of the way. You all began to squeeze through the opening to find the next length of your journey. And that's where we left off. As you guys all crawl through this recently cleared opening, you come into a partially collapsed cavern about 20 or so feet wide in places with elements of the ceiling fallen in. You can see the rocks that are scattered amongst the ground rumbling with each impact of the feet of the titan you're currently riding within. It seems to be going at a steady incline beginning baseline and then about 20 feet ahead, begin to rise upward to about a 30 to 45-degree angle with the next 25, 30 or so feet.
Sam: How do you play Dungeons and Dragons?
Matt: Two weeks, Sam? It's too much for you?
Sam: I've forgotten entirely what we're supposed to do now. Insight check! I got nothing.
Liam: I'm going to do my due diligence and scoot a little ahead of everybody and start looking for traps or anything hinky.
Travis: Wait, Vax. You should consult that little scrawny NPC fellow that was supposed-- oh, wait. Oh, he's dead.
Liam: Did anybody see that guy?
Travis: Nope.
Laura: Yeah, we did. We saw him.
Matt: Well, you saw the corpse after it was there, yeah.
Liam: Nobody asked me about him.
Laura: No, because you did a good job of killing that.
Liam: That clearly undead cannibal dwarf eating flesh, as I saw it, so problem solved. We're on a time table, yeah?
Laura: We should keep moving upwards, I'm assuming?
Sam: Did we get any items recently?
Travis: No, I picked up that hammer that was hitting me in the face.
Laura: Well, yeah. But Percy, the belt?
Sam: Yeah, what does it do?
Taliesin: Stuff, things. I'm using it right now.
Marisha: Do we need to do a switchery-poo of our items?
Laura: I think we maybe should do that, actually.
Sam: We all have potions, right? Did we pass out potions?
Travis: We all have at least the one superior from the brass dragon.
Liam: Are we going to take a little 20-minute breather here?
Sam: This is just for us to remember what we're doing. I don't know. Should we stop? I think we're on a timetable. We should keep moving, right? Does anyone need to heal?
Marisha: We just stopped, right?
Matt: You'd taken a brief rest after the battle with the trolls where you guys began to look about the inside of the vault. And that's where the part of the exit collapsed.
Travis: I didn't roll any hit dice. Should we roll some hit dice?
Marisha: You dug things out?
Laura: But he was doing something? He was reading, or something.
Sam: Yeah, you were trying to read Dwarvish, or something. And it took an hour.
Travis: I clearly do not remember this. That's right, I remember. I don't remember what I read, but I remember.
Sam: It just said, "Do not enter."
Travis: Yep. There were things.
Liam: We're doing the Vox Machina thing and standing around like a bunch of dumb fucks trying to figure out what to do. I'm going to attune the Deathwalker's Ward to necrotic damage.
Matt: All righty. Necrotic it is.
Travis: We also need to be on the lookout for that sword, remember? In the story?
Sam: The sword of Kas?
Travis: Just saying. Keep your eyes peeled, high-perception people.
Laura: All right.
Taliesin: I literally can't see anything.
Laura: Wait, we have light.
Marisha: (whoosh)
Laura: Yeah, see?
Matt: Between her hand, his dagger, and Pike's mace, you have a few light sources that you guys maintain.
Laura: Pike's mace is lit up. We said that last time.
Matt: But do keep in mind that light sources also do make you a bright beacon in dark places.
Laura: Probably your hands are less noticeable than Pike's mace.
Liam: Oh, I don't know.
Taliesin: I think they would be less intimidated by a glowing mace than by glowing hands, at this point.
Matt: Glowing hands is like a small torch firelight. The Mace of Disruption--
Liam: Is like a headlamp.
Laura: So maybe we'll not have the mace on.
Liam: "Yeah, okay. I'll put this away."
Laura: That sounded just like her.
Sam: She's turning more and more Canadian as you go.
Liam: She's kind of Canadian already. Come on.
Matt: So if I could have a marching order, please?
Liam: Yo. Up front, looking for traps.
Laura: Did you want this acid-resistant armor? You'd at least be resistant to acid.
Travis: And Vex is probably with her brother. I'll be right behind the twins. It's the twins and then me. Who wants to be behind?
Taliesin: I'll be behind you.
Matt: Okay. Do you have Trinket out, Vex?
Laura: Yeah, Trinket is out.
Matt: Percy's after Grog.
Marisha: Me.
Matt: Keyleth, and then we have Pike and Scanlan holding up the rear. All righty, there you go. Have that marked down. How far ahead are you tracking?
Liam: 20 feet.
Matt: So 20 feet ahead, you begin to make your way up the incline, and it is loose rock in this tunnel. As you step, there are elements that skid and fall beneath the pressure of your feet, and you have to be careful as you progress up the incline based on how much it continues upward to keep your footing.
Laura: Brother.
Liam: Yeah?
Laura: Make sure you stay within 60 feet of me.
Liam: I turn around and look at her and go  all right.
Laura: You said you're 20 fucking feet in front of me, I'm using my fucking earring to whisper to you.
Liam: You're stage-whispering and that's very easy to hear.
Laura: Stay within fucking 60 feet of me, all right?
Liam: I love you. Perception check. Investigation for traps? Yeah. That is a 25.
Matt: Okay. No traps catch your attention. As you progress forward, you begin to notice the tunnel seems to be pincering a bit the further you go. The sides of the walls begin to close in and eventually, about 30 feet ahead, comes from the 15, 20-foot width that the initial entrance way into this carved tunnel was, pinches to about three feet wide.
Sam: How tall?
Matt: About five and half, six feet tall?
Taliesin: Is this pressure by design, or is this what's been done to the structure by the transformation?
Matt: You'll probably have to get closer to see. Where you are currently, it looks like part of the tunnel was carved outward and then shaken, and elements of it collapsed and loosened the earth that at one point was packed at the sides.
Laura: And the tunnel's rising steadily upwards?
Matt: Yeah. It's coming at an incline.
Travis: How's it look?
Liam: It's dark up there. I can only see about 60 feet up. Does it keep going beyond that?
Matt: The incline isn't increasing. It gets to about a 45-degree incline and then maintains that up until the outside of your visual range.
Liam: Okay. I'm a punching bag for this shit. Why don't you all wait here a minute. Wait.
All: Wait.
Laura: Do you want me to fly up there?
Liam: Well, will you go with me?
Laura: Of course. Can you not use your wings?
Liam: They're gone.
Laura: Well, then hop on.
Liam: This could be the last time we do this. Come on.
Sam: Oh god.
Liam: Well, there's only four games left, Sam.
Laura: You don't know that!
Liam: It's scripted! (laughter)
Marisha: That's going to be a Reddit thread later.
Laura: Do we have Pass Without a Trace on?
Liam: Yeah, I think that probably faded by now.
Matt: Not if you haven't recast it because after the short rest it would've been gone.
Laura: Should I cast that on us?
Liam: Yes.
Laura: No, wait! I shouldn't because I got a proficiency, so we're both stealthy stealth. We're fine. So we're just going to go. I'm not casting it. But here's the thing. Everybody stay right at the bottom. We're going to fly up, but we're not going to fly up more than 60 feet away from them.
Liam: Right. We'll go 60 feet up, see what we can see.
Laura: And then come back down.
Liam: Sure. Or you could stay there and I could go even further up 60 feet--
Laura: All right. As long as everybody's within 60 feet of me. Because we're getting really close and I don't want Vecna to see us. I've got this ring.
Taliesin: That's right. I forgot about the ring.
Liam: All right. Let's do that.
Matt: So as you guys glide up on the broom, stealthily, I want you guys both to roll a stealth check, please.
Travis: Pick from your fucking 300 dice.
Laura: Ooh, that's good.
Travis: Almost poked my eye out. You almost made me Vecna.
Laura: 30.
Liam: 29.
Laura: 30.
Matt: All right. That's impressive. So as you both quietly coast your way past this entrance way, squeezing into this two and a half, three-foot-wide location, you get just within the 60 foot range and look up and Vax, you step off the broom and make your way quietly up to the other side of the range. You get about 30 feet beyond the broom before your vision meets where this tunnel seems to end and it looks like there is a solid, rocky blockage.
Laura: What do you see?
Liam: It's corked up. It's all right. Yeah, it's blocked up with stone. I guess I'd have to get a closer look to see if we could get through.
Laura: Well, get a fucking closer look.
Taliesin: If we have to, we can just have Grog beat it down.
Laura: Yes, but quiet is the key word.
Taliesin: Is it? We can try and time it to a step.
Liam: Hand on the sides to get my way up closer to it. Looking for any traps.
Matt: Go ahead and make an athletics check as you're climbing up to maintain the strength, as the incline is now towards the end getting more and more steep.
Liam: Get ready to catch me.
Laura: I'm going to hover.
Liam: Yes! My athletics is a two, but I rolled a 19, so 21.
Matt: Deftly, you manage to find the proper handholds and pull your strength up as the final bit becomes a little bit of a upper body weight carrying situation, and you come to the edge of the rock and you see it. It does appear to be a rocky cave-in or larger boulder that has fallen or been placed to close. It looks to be one solid rock, yeah. At this point, the entrance is about four foot by two foot. And it's all blocked by one solid piece of rock.
Liam: Yeah. We're not getting through this. Hey. I'm not getting through this, you're not. Maybe Kiki can.
Laura: Do we see any other openings?
Matt: This would be a perception check.
Sam: Matt, my friends just told me to start paying attention to the cadence of the steps to see if they change in any discernible way.
Marisha: That's what we're doing. While they do that, we're timing the steps out.
Matt: Make a perception check.
Laura: 20.
Matt: 20? Okay.
Taliesin: Ugh.
Marisha: Ugh.
Sam: 15.
Marisha: 15.
Taliesin: 12.
Matt: It's not that difficult to discern the pattern of the steps. The entirety of this titan shifts and quakes with each footfall, so it's pretty easy to find the pattern. It rarely changes, and you imagine any slight shift that you feel as they're going about this is because it's stepping on or through terrain that is not flat. But it is a pretty discernible pattern.
Taliesin: We could go have Grog smash it down in tempo with the steps so that the sound will be covered.
Travis: Like Shawshank Redemption and the poop pipe.
Taliesin: I was thinking of the Tainted Love Levi's commercial.
Laura: Do I see any other--
Matt: Not really. It mostly looks like loose rock and the more you glance about with each impacting footfall, you see two or three errant rocks go. You guys watch as more rocks tumble down the incline.
Laura: Maybe we need to do this quickly. This doesn't seem like the most stable sort of tunnel. Hop on the broom, darling.
Taliesin: I like the idea of you punching this at the appropriate moment.
Marisha: It also saves me a 6th-level spell.
Travis: Well, that's what's most important. Are the Knuckles still doing that vibrating hum thing?
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: Can I go into a rage?
Matt: You may.
Travis: And I would like to try and bash the shit out of this--
Taliesin: In tempo.
Laura: In tempo.
Matt: This is a tight tunnel for you. You have to crouch down, round your shoulders as you're doing it.
Travis: I'm going to do the one-inch punch.
Matt: Make an athletics check. With advantage, because you are raging.
Travis: Yeah, because I'm an angry monster. 21.
Matt: Okay. Here's the scenario  Vex and Vax, as you guys are on the broom in the tunnel, you look down and you know in Labyrinth, when the cleaner comes through the tunnel that fills the entirety of the space? You watch as this angry goliath starts up the tunnel towards you, and there does not appear to be much of any space you could squeeze through.
Liam: Is there a bubble at the top, maybe?
Laura: Grog?
Travis: What? (angry panting)
Laura: Can we pass under his legs or something?
Liam: Dive, dive!
Laura: Rage quietly.
Matt: You can both attempt to. Make an acrobatics check to attempt to squeeze between his legs.
Laura: At the same time? Acrobatics. 22.
Liam: 30-something.
Matt: It's not comfortable, but you both (popping) out the back, between his monstrous goliath thighs. From a backward perspective, those of you who are still waiting a little further down the tunnel from Vex: it's a unique sight, as the back end of your goliath friend suddenly gives birth to two half-elves. It's very Ace Ventura 2. However, you eventually climb your way angrily up to the very edge and there is the boulder, there, and you're about to go right towards it, but then stop and remember what your friends had said, and you wait patiently for the pattern of the next footfall. (boom)
Travis: (punch impact)
Matt: Go ahead and roll an attack.
Travis: Can I make it reckless-- oh, I didn't say it.
Laura: But you do extra damage because you're--
Travis: Oh, yeah, siege. Oh, it's fine. 30.
Matt: Yeah, all right, so roll 1d4 damage.
Travis: Okay, 1d4. Four!
Matt: Plus your strength modifier and your rage damage.
Travis: Eight. 27.
Matt: Whoa, wait, did you double it already?
Travis: No.
Matt: Wait, so it's four plus eight, 12.
Travis: And my rage damage is 15. Well, that's with the axe.
Matt: That's with the axe, yeah. No, that's your overall. So your rage damage at this level is four, because you just went up a level. So it's 12 plus four, so it's 16. So you do 32 points of bludgeoning damage with a single punch to this rock. With one hit, the entire boulder shifts and cracks, and you watch as part of it breaks away, and you see a brief glimmer of a dull light from the opposite side, as it rests back into place, heavily damaged.
Taliesin: (singing) Wait for it to go again and bump, bump, bump.
Matt: You wait for the next footfall of the titan (impact). You feel the impact and the shake. Do you want to go for another punch?
Travis: Do I hit it now?
Sam: Yes!
Taliesin: Yes!
Laura: Yes!
Matt: Roll another attack.
Travis: Oh, that's even better. 33.
Matt: Easily enough. Go ahead and roll another d4.
Travis: Two plus eight. Ten plus--
Matt: Four for rage damage.
Travis: 14.
Matt: All right, and so with that, your fist slams into the boulder a second time. It explodes and shatters into hundreds of crumbled pieces of rock and stone goes firing across the distance of this tunnel, now revealing a little bit of flickering firelight. As you're sitting there seething with anger and your muscles and veins bulging with each breath--
Travis: I'm so swole right now.
Matt: Yeah. You can see above you, this entranceway opens up into a five-foot wide, ten-foot tall hallway that goes to the right and left. As you emerge, it goes a little bit to the right and front, and then to the back and behind you that direction.
Travis: Hey guys, it's a Z.
Laura: What do you see?
Travis: Let me find out. So I wiggle up a little more.
Marisha: So you know the first and last letter of the alphabet? Don't worry about it.
Matt: So you squeeze out of the small entrance way and step up into it. You can see now a well-constructed hallway. You can see there are stone slabs that are carved. The patterns and the angular architecture of this hall as it comes up into a trapezoid position. The hall comes in a bit, and the hallway rooftop is a flat, even surface. This is apparently a hall of dwarven make and seems to be a continuation of some sort of structure or pathway of Thomara.
Taliesin: Let the twins take a look. I think it would be safe.
Travis: It's a well-constructed hallway of dwarvish make. (groans)
Laura: We sneak under his legs again to like see what's going on.
Matt: You guys all eventually make your way up into this hallway. Now, it is still a five -foot-wide hallway, so you're still here in single-file progression one way or the other.
Liam: Twins are already at the top looking for problems.
Matt: Right, so you guys would be able to because it's a ten-foot-tall tunnel. You guys would be able to occupy a space above another party member if you were both on the broom.
Laura: Oh, should we be on the broom? No, you should be off the broom because you might check for traps. I'll check for traps along the wall and ceiling. And he's going to check for traps--
Liam: I'll take the lower half. That's called advantage.
Matt: So go ahead and make and investigation check.
Laura: Both of us or just him with advantage?
Matt: Both of you separately because you're investigating different elements of the hallway.
Liam: 18 for me.
Laura: Investigation? Natural fucking 20!
Matt: As you guys glance up and focus on the surrounding location. The hallway behind you goes for about 30 or so feet before it looks like a cave in. It looks like a mass of fully collapsed, broken stone. You can see bits of the hallway slabs that originally held up that part are collapsed inward and broken, left scattered across the ground. The other direction you go continues on and opens into a dark chamber about 60 feet ahead of you.
Laura: We should go toward the cave in, don't you think?
Matt: There are small built-in sconces that are magically, perpetually burning firelight.
Laura: Does this seem like there's any traps that could be set off as we walk towards the--?
Matt: You do not notice anything, as you were investigating specifically for that.
Taliesin: Check the sconces, see if they trigger something.
Laura: I'll look at the sconces.
Liam: I will look at the sconces.
Laura: I'll look at them better.
Matt: I included that as your perception for traps above. You did not notice anything that would be considered a trap.
Laura: You guys, there's no traps. We should head towards this darkened room.
Marisha: Save a life, check a sconce.
Liam: I'm going to creep about 40 feet down the hall and continue that search.
Matt: About 20 feet before this darkened chamber is there before you. As you get to the edge, you can see a little bit the very inside of this chamber. You can see a darkened brazier. It's your mind playing tricks on you. You thought you heard a raven.
Liam: Every day when I'm on the crapper, Matt. Everywhere.
Matt: A cold metallic brazier in the middle of the room. And that's as far as you can see into the chamber, before the edge of your visual range goes dark.
Taliesin: People don't install those unless there's something awful that needs to be done.
Marisha: Do we have any idea how far we've climbed?
Matt: You can make a nature check.
Liam: And do I need to make a extra roll to look for traps around this brazier?
Matt: If you want to enter the chamber, you can. You're too far away.
Marisha: Hey! Natural 20! That's a Gil 20!
Matt: As you take a moment, and think back to how far you've traveled path-wise and inclines and where you entered this titan and to where the city of Thar Amphala is placed upon its torso, you gather you're close to halfway through its torso, if not a little beyond it.
Marisha: If not a little beyond?
Sam: He's big.
Marisha: Okay, all right. Nipple level?
Matt: Sternum.
Marisha: The heartburn region? A little acid reflux?
Liam: We are the acid reflux.
Marisha: He has acid resistance against reflux.
Liam: Jesus Christ. Whoever that is.
Matt: You scoot up to the edge.
Liam: I don't want to go further than roughly 60 feet away from my sister.
Matt: Right. Which will put you right at the entryway to this chamber.
Liam: Yeah. So I will peep in from here.
Laura: I follow up and stand next to him. Did you want to go in?
Liam: I did.
Laura: Feel free.
Matt: So the marching order is the same? We got the twins up the front.
Taliesin: Yeah. I like this marching order.
Liam: Let this shit blow up in my face, so everybody hang back for a second. And I'm going to pitter patter in and look around the sconce, the room.
Laura: I think I was more stealthy than you a moment ago, so are you sure you want to be in front of me?
Liam: I love you anyway. Here I go.
Taliesin: He's better at blowing up than you are, dear.
Travis: Yeah. His heart beats once a century, so let him go.
Liam: Slower than this titan's footfalls.
Matt: All right. So as you enter the chamber, it's a small, about 20-foot radius square-shaped dark iron chamber with rounded corners. So it's about 40 feet wide from side to side, 20 feet from the center where the brazier is and the corners are slightly curved. It doesn't come to a straight, hard corner. There is no exit door currently visible; the chamber comes to an end. The room looks mostly bare, aside from an eight-foot-tall, five-foot-wide mirror coated in dust, framed in intricate gold and brass that sits across the chamber on the opposite side of where you entered.
Liam: Mirror in brass. So it's an iron room, right?
Matt: Iron room with a brass edge around this eight-foot tall, five-foot wide mirror. You can tell it's a mirror from this side. What little bit of light there is behind you, you can see your silhouette waving mirrored in the mirror.
Liam: So doorway, brazier, mirror.
Matt: Mirror. And then the rest of the chamber seems fairly empty.
Laura: And the brazier is complete dark?
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: It's cold.
Taliesin: Oh no.
Laura: This is not good.
Liam: Look at his fake innocent face.
Sam: I think it's just a vanity.
Liam: Going to check for traps from right here to start. All right. That's totally fine. That's a jellyfish. That is a 17.
Matt: You begin to glance around the chamber, best you can, to take in the scenery. You notice small gold piece-sized buttons or pressure knobs set in the rounded corners of the chamber on the mirror side. One's embedded within the upper left and right corners and within the lower left and right corners.
Sam: Pressure knobs?
Matt: They're like little buttons that are gold piece-sized that are embedded in the upper right and left corners and the lower left and right corners.
Travis: Push them!
Liam: Stubby, come up here. I have a real bad history with pushing buttons.
Matt: You also notice very thin light piles of black residue or ash scattered in places across the floor.
Marisha: Called it. This is a fucking incinerator. I knew it! This feels like an incinerator. No? What? He's looking at me-- (nervous laughter)
Liam: (sighs) So we've got buttons.
Marisha: Or lasers.
Travis: Incinerator or lasers.
Marisha: Laser incinerator! Duh!
Travis: That was a great jump for me and my character.
Liam: If something stupid is going to happen here, I don't want it to be on me alone for once. So we've got an unlit brazier, there's mirror over there, and buttons, yeah.
Laura: Maybe the mirror is a door.
Liam: I thought that, as well.
Laura: Should we try to walk through it?
Taliesin: Maybe a second interrogation room and there's another room behind it, maybe?
Liam: Can we get your hub up here, please?
Taliesin: I am up here. I'm right here.
Liam: Jesus!
Laura: Hi, darling. I don't know why he didn't hear you. You used to be so good at that. Is the mirror leaning or is it on the wall?
Matt: It's on the wall.
Marisha: Is it curved? No. The whole room isn't curved. It's a square room.
Matt: It's a square room but the corners curve ever so slightly so there's no direct corner and in those curved corners on the side that the mirror's on, so the far side from you, there's these little buttons in the upper right and left corner and the lower left and right.
Laura: Can I reach down and touch the iron on the ground? The floor? Does it feel warm?
Matt: Mm. It's cold.
Liam: I catch her wrist. Just a second. You two do the thinking, all right? And I take a step into the room.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: What do I do?
Laura: Go see if you can walk through the mirror.
Taliesin: Tap the mirror.
Travis: Light the brazier!
Laura: We've done that before and we all exploded.
Travis: Yeah, but it's Vax.
Marisha: Wait. Before we do that, can I reach some of the ashy stuff?
Matt: If you enter the chamber to, yeah.
Marisha: Hand me some ash. I'll test it.
Liam: I scoop some ash. Lady of the Grey Hunt, here. I scoop up some ash and I pour it into her hands.
Marisha: Okay. I do a nature check. What does this ash feel like it's made out of?
Sam: Human bones.
Marisha: Yeah, that's what I'm wondering. (groans)
Taliesin: Wow.
Laura: No. What is it? (groans)
Travis: Is it for real? You are lying!
Liam: Look at that face! You are not lying!
Marisha: Oh man. That's a one. Thanks, Gil. I blame Gil for his natural 20 in the balance of the universe.
Matt: It's light ash. You're not sure what the basis of what may have burned here. You see more of it gathered near where the brazier is.
Taliesin: Is it in piles that would be about human-amount of ash?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Taliesin: All right. I'll Gil this one. Yeah, natural 20. That'll do.
Sam: Only ones and 20s tonight.
Liam: That's it, yeah. Just quarters. Heads up, heads down.
Matt: More of it seems to be around the base of the brazier, but you do see there are thicker traces at different places throughout the chamber.
Taliesin: It's organic ash?
Matt: You've dealt with different types of ash. The carbon appears to have been organic-based at some point.
Liam: I pull off my belt and say  Hello, Simon. Wake him up.
Matt: Okay. (slithering)
Liam: Hi. Gosh, it's been a while.
Laura: Simon, go through the mirror.
Liam: That's right. Go check out the mirror, Simon, all right? Off you go.
Travis: Are we still in the room?
Laura: No, nobody's in the room. He's the only one in the room.
Matt: (slithering) Scoots over and heads up to the mirror and presses up against it.
Liam: I dart back one step out of the room as it happens.
Matt: The snake trying to push up against the wall but half of its body sliding against the mirror before it eventually scoots off and lands. It tries again, pushing against the mirror and then eventually (sliding).
Taliesin: I hate to say this, but tap the button?
Liam: That's on the list. Simon, buddy. Crawl up the brazier. Wrap around it. Go up to the top.
Matt: The snake slithers around and makes its way. It's a cross-metal cage. There are inch wide metal bars that all curl up like a basket and then there are bars that cross around it to hold the shape. It looks like there are some long-burned, blackened pieces of wood that have been left for a long time. So Simon curls up into the brazier and curls up around the metal, comes around the top of the outer rim of it, rests there.
Liam: There's two buttons low down. Oh man. The nostalgia here. All right, buddy. I take two steps back away from the door. Buddy buds. Will you go push those low buttons in the room?
Matt: Which one?
Liam: There's two, right?
Matt: There's four on the opposite side.
Liam: There's two high up. And I don't think he can reach the high, because he doesn't stick to walls. Get the one over here on the left first.
Laura: What if we all have to push every button at the same time?
Liam: That's true. That could be.
Matt: Simon (slithering) moves over.
Liam: I lean over to Percy, I say  science!
Matt: Hits the button. (click) Right on the entrance of where you are in the chamber, slams closed. Iron metal now closes off that entranceway.
Taliesin: I'm going to touch the door.
Sam: And say goodbye.
Taliesin: Simon, we barely knew him. Is it warm?
Matt: It is beginning to get warm.
Taliesin: It's an oven. I'm looking for some sort some sort of cancel mechanism somewhere on the outside of the door.
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Sam: Is Vax in the room?
Liam: No, I took two steps back from the door.
Laura: No, nobody's in the room.
Taliesin: Let's say that investigation was somewhere around a seven? (laughter)
Matt: It's pretty solid at this point. The walls that lean in towards the ceiling there-- it is a perfect solid iron slab that has closed off at the entrance.
Travis: No problem. I'll get it down.
Laura: No!
Liam: Wait. Simon is technically a magical item, so I don't think he would be harmed by anything going on in there, so why don't we give it five minutes?
Marisha: And maybe it'll open again.
Liam: Yeah.
Travis: Is there anything going on in the tunnel, on the outside of this door, where we are?
Laura: Coming up from behind us?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Travis: Temperature check, anything like that? Natural 20.
Taliesin: We have been gone so long!
Matt: Gone for two weeks and you guys can't find middle math. It's only extremes.
Liam: Yeah, we've had blue balls for two weeks, and it's all coming out now.
Matt: So as you guys glance back in the shadow of the tunnel behind you, nothing seems to be catching your eye. It's still dark. About two minutes in, what was once dark metal is now giving a slight orangish hue. You can feel the heat emanating from it.
Travis: There's no ash on the floor in the hallway that we are in right now, right?
Matt: I'd say, because of your perception check, as you glance around, there does not appear to be any ash.
Travis: I don't want that door to fucking open all of a sudden.
Matt: About five minutes go by as you guys are waiting. Eventually, the iron wall begins to descend. The dull orangish glow of it is still there. As it opens, a wave of heated air emerges from the chamber. You all have to immediately close your eyes. Some of you instinctually begin to step further back into the hallway. On the inside of the room, you can see the black iron interior of the chamber is also that same orangish glow. The mirror is unscathed. You all step back and watch and a few minutes pass as it slowly begins to cool off, the metal slowly darkening. You're too far away to look. You make a perception check to try and glance in?
Laura: Can't you call to him?
Liam: Simon? Come here, buddy.
Matt: There's no response.
Liam: (gasps) He's a magical item! Oh, but he could have turned back into a belt.
Taliesin: What's he going to say if you call to him? Was he going to say something?
Liam: He would come to me, Percy! Jeepers creepers! Perception check? 29!
Matt: You glance past where the button was that it hit. You see a limp belt left on the ground.
Liam: Okay, I'll get that in a minute.
Laura: When you go pick him up and put him back on your fucking waist.
Matt: Technically, since Simon's taken enough damage to revert to the belt form, Simon cannot turn back into a snake for the day.
Laura: How about that unseen servant?
Liam: I'm thinking, having no knowledge of magic, that we either want to somehow push all four of these buttons at once, as my sister said, or light this brazier, or both.
Laura: What about the brazier? Is it cold? Does it look like it's hot?
Sam: The brazier's the source of the furnace, I assume.
Travis: Are there still charred wooden pieces in the middle of it?
Matt: The pieces are still there, but it's black carbon. There's nothing in there that could burn. Whatever's been in there has been heated so much to the point--
Travis: It's not the source of the flame. Not for that much heat.
Marisha: If I was the person who designed this, why would I put a failsafe in here?
Liam: A way to get through that only the creator would know how to use?
Marisha: I feel like there's got to be another entrance because we can see another room, right?
Laura: There's no other room, it's a mirror. Oh, Keyleth, that's our reflection.
Marisha: No, I know that, but a lot of things have reflections.
Liam: Listen, all of you, or I, are going to be dead very soon. Are you sure you want to be that sarcastic right now?
Marisha: I go up to the mirror and check it out. It's cooled off enough, right?
Matt: Well, no. If you guys want to take a few minutes, you can wait until it cools off, if you want to.
Taliesin: Why don't we try pushing all four buttons at once?
Sam: Wait, before we do that, I'm going to enter the room and look around at the walls and the ceiling.
Matt: Okay, I take it you wait until it cools off. It takes about ten minutes or so for it to fully cool off, to the point where it's comfortable.
Sam: I'm looking for markings, indications of instructions, arrows, any hidden words--
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Travis: Look for Dwarvish. I'm aces with that.
Sam: Ooh, a lot. 29.
Taliesin: He's coming up with some bullshit.
Matt: Okay. Because the room is not fully cooled off, it's still warm in there, somewhat. You glance through. The ceiling and the walls all appear to be solid iron, and there's a layer of dust across a lot of it, a bit of ash from whatever previously may have been incinerated in here, long ago. As you look from the opposite side of the room into the reflection of the mirror, you see a very faint orangish glow in the reflection. It looks like, in the upper corner and the lower corner of the opposite side of the mirror as you're glancing off across to the other side. As you look over to the wall, of the room you're in, there's no glow.
Sam: Wait, so the wall that we came in through?
Matt: Let's say you enter the chamber and you move to the corner immediately to your right. You look in the mirror at an angle. You're now seeing the reflection of the corner opposite to you, right? Looking in that reflection, you can see this very faint orange glow in the upper and lower corner, but you glance over to the physical corner across from you, and it's not there.
Laura: What do your gnomish eyes see, Scanlan?
Sam: I think there's magical buttons in here and we need to find them? So I'm going to look in the mirror. I go to the opposite corner and do the same thing.
Matt: As you have this conversation and look back, those two glowing sigils are gone.
Sam: Even in the mirror?
Matt: Even in the mirror. What you saw earlier is now gone.
Travis: But they're revealed by heat.
Marisha: Where were they?
Sam: They were upper and lower corner, yeah.
Marisha: I walk over and I heat them with my heat hands.
Matt: Okay, so you take your hands and you put them up near there. As you put your hands on the wall, nothing seems to happen. As you glance through the reflection where she has her hands, that symbol seems to be appearing again.
Laura: What is the symbol of?
Sam: It's so far. I don't know. Can I see it?
Matt: It looks to be a simple triangular symbol, marked in a circle. Make an arcana check.
Sam: Oh yeah. 14 plus six, that's 20.
Matt: It's the most basic of arcane marks. It's a variation on a spell that basically is a mark that a certain enchanter or somebody places to mark as their own. However, this is meant to be a basic marker, a visual draw. There's no language behind it. It's just an indicator.
Sam: Keyleth, do that same thing to the lower one. Same marking?
Matt: As you head down there, the one above begins to slowly fade. As her hands go there, the symbol appears below.
Sam: Same symbol? Let's do that to the other walls and see if we can find other ones.
Matt: As you guys reverse, opposite sides, you go to the other corners, the ones that were immediately toward the entrance of where you walked in. Sure enough, two more symbols, mirroring where the buttons are on the far side corners.
Sam: So we push those? But there's a hidden button in there.
Travis: When you're a big fire, the walking thing--
Marisha: A fire elemental.
Travis: Sure. Do you take damage from fire? So you should be in here.
Laura: You should go in there, see if you can disengage the trap.
Liam: So you are impervious to being set on fire or burned?
Marisha: Well, when I'm a fire elemental.
Laura: Can you do that?
Marisha: Can I do it right now? Yeah. I just took a short rest, so yes, I can do that.
Travis: We also have an unseen servant.
Sam: So we're going to need four people.
Marisha: So what's the end goal? What am I doing?
Liam: Press all four buttons at once, although we've got at least three sharpshooters--
Sam: Not the buttons that we can see. What are these symbols here? I think they're buttons, as well.
Travis: It might be a depression on the wall or something.
Marisha: But what if the buttons are correlated with the symbols?
Taliesin: Let's try pushing all four buttons.
Travis: The regular buttons or the magic ones?
Liam: Please stand by.
Laura: I want to go look at where the symbol is and see if it's a fucking button.
Marisha: Yeah, if I touch the symbol, there's nothing there, right?
Sam: Was there anything there?
Matt: You put your hand on there. Nothing. The wall doesn't move.
Marisha: It's just a wall.
Travis: No depression, no toggle?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Travis: I've got this, you guys. Oh! Minus two. 17!
Matt: 17. Grog, as you step up and glare down at the place where Keyleth had placed her palm, you get frustrated and (sighs heavily). As you exhale, it looks like a bit of soot and ash that had been slowly drifting in and filling this space flutters away. You can see two lines, parallel to each other, about an inch tall.
Travis: Fifth Element, anyone? Oh look! Breath of Grog reveals all! Look, behold! Two. Lines.
Laura: What did you do?
Travis: I breathed on the wall.
Sam: What do they do? What do these lines do?
Marisha: I do a quick Gust cantrip.
Matt: Across the parallel lines? All right. As the wind blows across it, a lot more of the soot and the ash blows around the area. It creates an open space where it pushes out to the edges and darkens areas of the floor and the vicinity around Keyleth. That edge of that corner, where you blew the Gust cantrip that Grog had unfurled, is now clear, the iron revealed. Nothing beyond the two.
Laura: I fly up on my broom and do it to the symbol up on the corner and go (blowing).
Matt: Okay. So up there. You blow on that one and it looks like--
Marisha: Hang on, I've got a paper ready.
Liam: How many people at home do you think have figured this out already?
Laura: We already figured it out!
Sam: Wait, you guys are blowing on the arcane symbols?
Laura: Yeah, to clear them out!
Travis: If you're looking at the door we came in, Grog blew on the lower right?
Sam: And that's two lines. Boom.
Matt: That would be lower right.
Travis: Two vertical lines.
Matt: Correct.
Laura: I'm in the corner above Grog.
Matt: That would be upper right.
Taliesin: I'm going to do bottom left.
Matt: All right, you blow, and you watch as the dust reveals. It's two more lines.
Laura: Two lines? Shit. I thought it was going to be another--
Taliesin: Bottom left. Getting out a hanky and (blows).
Liam: Did you use your ascot?
Taliesin: Yes, of course. That's what it's there for. The back of it.
Laura: The one clean spot left on it.
Matt: That one has four parallel lines.
Laura: Ooh! I'll go into the corner above Percy. There was a reflection there, too, right?
Sam: Blow! Laura, blow!
Laura: (blows) I looked straight at the camera as I did it. It was really awkward.
Matt: All right, that one has a single line.
Sam: Wait, so we've got one, two, two, four?
Laura: Is there one with three lines, or are there any more areas we saw a reflection?
Travis: What about above the door? It is opposite of the mirror, right? If one's a door, and the other one's a door?
Laura: Okay, I'll blow above the door.
Liam: And I'm going to start blowing around the mirror.
Laura: We all walk around going (raspberries).
Travis: Constitution check to see who passes out first?
Matt: What was that?
Taliesin: Does the mirror have a fancy frame?
Matt: It's not extremely intricate, but it looks like there's a brass or bronze frame around it.
Taliesin: Are any of these symbols mirrored in the frame itself? Is there a mirror of any of these symbols in the frame?
Matt: As you look in the actual frame itself, you don't see anything that matches the symbols.
Laura: What if these are numbers and the order you have to push the buttons?
Sam: Except we have two twos, and no three?
Laura: I know. One, two, four!
Taliesin: No, because you have to hit one, and then you have to hit the two together--
Sam: And then why not three? Okay, all right. Can we do a sweep for more?
Travis: Can I clear off the door area that we walked through?
Matt: So Grog, you go through, (rapid blowing). Blowing around. Okay. Make an investigation check.
Marisha: I take my mantle and start doing a--
Matt: You clear that archway very well, around the door. You do reveal Dwarven runes on the upper right corner, upper left corner, lower right, and lower left corner of the doorframe.
Travis: I only know Dwarven writing. I don't know runes.
Matt: Well, the runes are part of the Dwarven language.
Travis: The runes are part of the Dwarven language, so I know them.
Laura: Pike goes over and she helps you.
Travis: Help me, Pike! Yeah, I would like to decipher what these symbols mean.
Laura: "If you lift me up, I could see the ones above the door!"
Liam: "Yeah, the last time I wanted you to do it on your own, but I think we're pressed for time."
Travis: I hold her up to the upper left corner of the doorway.
Matt: Okay, so turning around, upper left corner. Okay. That one is the Dwarven rune that represents the number three.
Travis: Three. All right. Now, to the upper right-hand corner.
Matt: That is the number one.
Travis: Okay. I put her on the ground and I say, okay, look at the lower right-hand corner.
Matt: So lower right-hand corner would be a two.
Travis: And now the lower left-hand corner.
Matt: A four.
Laura: Oh, yeah! We know! That's the amount of times you have to push the button!
Taliesin: So one-one, two-two-two-two, three, four-four.
Sam: Possibly.
Laura: Wait, I think we reversed it.
Liam: How long does your unseen servant last?
Sam: Not too long.
Liam: How long? An hour? Ten minutes?
Sam: I'll look in my memory. One hour, but I have to be close to it. How big is this room?
Matt: It's a 20-foot radius from the center of the brazier, so it's 40 feet on each side.
Taliesin: Is our physicality of this map correct? If we show you this?
Liam: Well, I have this jar. It's an oil of etherealness. You could potentially be standing in here, but not be in here. Lasts an hour, though. Same time gap as your friend. You could stand in here and not be in here.
Sam: From the doorway to the mirror, is it less than 60 feet?
Matt: Yes.
Sam: Oh, then I can be out of the door. Am I right with what I wrote down there?
Matt: All right, so this is the-- facing from the inside--
Sam: Yeah, from the brazier-- Frasier Crane. Looking at the door that we came in. Right?
Matt: I'm going to have to draw you one. I think you guys got confused on that one.
Laura: I think me and Travis got it right.
Sam: I think, Matt, you're wrong.
Travis: I have the same thing as Laura.
Liam: I'm pretty sure it's up up down down left right left right A B A B.
Laura: I hope we passed the test.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Did we get it right?
Matt: There, that's what you get! Sorry, I'm limited in my reach right now.
Marisha: I love that we all did something similar but all wrote something different. We're like, numbers, somewhere!
Matt: Yep, almost. Almost.
Marisha: Did you help us, or are you just saying "almost?"
Matt: I'm saying, looking back and seeing where the numbers lie and the runes in there, you have the correct configuration.
Laura: (victorious laughter)
Marisha: I think this is right. I think you have this. I think I have the right part of this and you have the right part of this.
Laura: We'll copy it and you can see what the fuck is correct.
Travis: Yes.
Laura: No, this is wrong. I'm just going to draw it. (counting)
Sam: Guys, Shadow of War! It's a great game by-- I don't know, who makes it? Warner Brothers!
Laura: Okay, so now we know the order to push the buttons and the amount of times to push the buttons.
Sam: Yes, so now we've just got to do it.
Travis: Should we check around the mirror frame to see if there's anything to dust off? The mirror frame?
Taliesin: I gave it a little bit of a rub.
Marisha: I'm going to go up and go tap-tap-tap on the mirror.
Matt: Okay. It taps.
Travis: Can I wipe off the edges around the frame and see if there's anything around the frame of the mirror, since I seem to be so good at this?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Travis: Three.
Matt: Three. You smear a bit of ash, but eventually get some semblance of shine through. Nothing catches your eye.
Travis: It's clear. We found everything there is to find.
Marisha: Grog draws boobs on himself in the reflection out of the ash.
Sam: All right, should we leave the room and have Mr. Invisible start tapping buttons? All right, we'll do that.
Laura: We step just outside the door again and let his invisible servant push buttons.
Liam: (singing) Scanlan Man, Scanlan Man. Does whatever a Scanlan can. Makes a guy, pushes buttons, Scanlan Man-- I'm out.
Taliesin: Look out!
Liam: (singing) Here comes the Scanlan Man.
Marisha: (singing) Here comes the Scanlan Man.
Taliesin: (singing) Here comes the Scanlan Man.
Sam: Would a person who cannot fly be able to touch the top buttons?
Matt: Nope.
Sam: Shit.
Travis: Well, there's no saying that it will activate if we do it correctly.
Liam: Also, what about shooting the button or firing an arrow at a button?
Laura: Yeah but the buttons are on this side.
Taliesin: How high up are the buttons?
Matt: The buttons? The top are about ten feet up.
Taliesin: So if he had something that was-- if he had a mop, basically, he could probably tap it.
Laura: The buttons are on the side of the mirror, so we could shoot arrows at them.
Taliesin: But only if we're in there and then we don't need an unseen servant to do it.
Sam: Want to give him a pole or something?
Taliesin: Let's give him a stick.
Sam: Do we have a stick in the bag?
Travis: I have a lance.
Taliesin: Yeah, he has a lance.
Travis: It's almost broken.
Taliesin: My god, it will finally be useful one last time.
Liam: We do have three trammels.
Taliesin: No! We are not disengaging a smoke alarm with a fucking trammel. There is a limit!
Travis: You have a slightly splintered lance.
Laura: Okay. Let's hit buttons. Let's do it! Let's get through this room.
Taliesin: Let's explain to the unseen servant what he's supposed to do.
Sam: Matt, can he hold a lance, or is that violating some-- he's not allowed to hold weapons.
Matt: He can hold them. He can't attack; he cannot be a combatant. It can hold things for you.
Liam: He's like a Kids in the Hall character.
Matt: Kind of, yeah. You're not wrong.
Sam: I conjure an unseen servant, whom I will name Simon Two.
Taliesin: Electric Boogaloo.
Liam: Not cool, man, not cool.
Matt: All right. There's this brief shimmer, and you watch as a bit of ash displaces on the ground where two footfalls (landing noises).
Sam: All right, Simon Two, take this lance. We're going to go tell you what buttons to press over there, good speed-- good speed? (laughter)
Sam: Godspell. You'll be fine. Hope you don't like burning alive. So you tell me what to tell him, because I don't have the paper. Upper left? Upper right? What do we start with?
Marisha: It's this. Tell him to do this.
Laura: The reflection of that.
Sam: Okay, so two upper right. Two pokes. Oh, wait.
Laura: So the upper left corner from where we're looking.
Sam: Yes, we're going to go mirror image of this, so project that across the room.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Oh, that was the mistake.
Matt: Okay, so pressing the upper left twice.
Sam: Yes, mirror image of this, so upper left. Let's try that.
Matt: Heads over, holding the lance. You watch the lance wobble, and it misses a couple times, (clicking) hits the button, and it clicks inward. The lance is pulled back and the button presses back out outward into its position.
Sam: Any door?
Matt: No door.
Laura: We'll know if we push it again then we did it the wrong order.
Matt: Second time, (clicking) pulls off, the button depresses.
Taliesin: All right, keep going.
Sam: So below it, two presses.
Laura: In the corner, bottom corner.
Sam: Just like your name, Simon  two.
Matt: (clicking)
Sam: Okay, opposite corner, up. One press.
Laura: Upper right-hand corner.
Matt: (clicking)
Sam: And then below that, bottom corner. Four presses.
Matt: (clicking) (laughter)
Matt: The fourth one hits. There's a moment of pause, and the mirror shimmers faintly. You watch as, almost like a stone thrown into the middle of a still pond, begins to ripple from the center, and as it ripples, each ripple seems to fade, until eventually the five-foot-wide mirror is now an oval portal that leads to darkness behind it.
Laura: Let's go in!
Marisha: I told you there was a room behind the mirror.
Travis: Yeah, let's go. Hurry! We don't know how long it will stay open for.
Sam: Simon Two is coming with us.
Matt: Okay. You hear the faint footfalls of sound behind, and Trinket takes a moment to try and squeeze through this small entranceway. Trinket had a hard enough time getting through the incline. (moans) Into the necklace. You make your way through the opposite side, and as you all step through, the portal remains open for at least a moment.
Laura: Hey, we did it, guys.
Sam: We beat a door.
Travis: We beat a door.
Marisha: Guys, it took 111 episodes, but we bested a door.
Liam: The last episode of the third campaign will be a door that we do not open.
Matt: So the darkness you step through leads into a ten-foot-wide hallway of similar dwarven stone. Same slightly angled hallways about ten feet tall or so, about five or six foot wide. You get a few steps in and about 20 or 30 seconds after you guys make your way in, the mirror portal behind closes up.
Liam: Can we see?
Marisha: Can you see through it?
Matt: Through the mirror?
Liam: I meant where we are. Are we in pitch black?
Matt: You're in pitch black, but you guys with darkvision can see there is a staircase not too far, maybe ten feet from where you stand into this next hallway.
Travis: Iron stairs? Stone stairs?
Matt: Stone stairs.
Liam: I've got a dagger out.
Matt: All right, lights up briefly and you get a little bit of a vision beyond that, and it's gradual stone steps. They're not too wide; they're made for dwarven gait, so there are many steps that are relatively shallow.
Travis: These are dwarven steps that are relatively shallow.
Sam: We can see it, Grog.
Liam: Pike says, "That's actually right".
Laura: Is there any traps?
Matt: You're welcome to search for traps.
Liam: And I'm going to scoot 40 feet up the stairs and look as I go for traps. One. I'm taking it, but I'm still going and looking for traps.
Matt: You do have reliable talent, don't forget.
Liam: Does that oversee ones? Because I've been counting ones as ones for a long time.
Matt: The reliable talent as a rogue specifically says any roll lower than a ten you take as a ten.
Sam: Any roll?
Matt: Well, not any roll. Any ability check he has to make.
Liam: Okay, well, we wrongly assumed that ones and 20s were king, but no.
Laura: So he rolled way better than me because I rolled a ten.
Liam: That's an 18. My one is an 18 now.
Matt: Yeah, because that's one of the cool things about rogues. You guys make your way up about 45, 50 or so feet up the stairway, you keeping an eye out, no traps, nothing catches your eye as iffy or strange, and the stairs now switch back into another set. It's a small landing and then it continues upward.
Liam: Okay, but I'm only going to go 40 feet in advance. That's like ten fucked rolls of mine from the past 30 games! Anyway, I love it.
Marisha: So it's a big 180, going right up?
Matt: Yeah, it's a switchback. The staircase ascends, then there's a landing, and it continues upward and around.
Laura: Do we hear anything?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Taliesin: I'll join in that perception.
Matt: So you're joining them up the staircase?
Taliesin: I'm behind. You know, the standard--
Matt: All right, so you guys are keeping up.
Marisha: Did you fuck the roll, too? Oh, what the fuck!
Taliesin: I got a 25.
Matt: Seriously, welcome back after two weeks and people just cannot-- wow.
Liam: But do you remember when we were at home and we'd go six weeks without playing and we'd spend 45 minutes trying to remember what we did, how the rules worked, what our names were, who you were.
Taliesin: Vex is right.
Travis: 25, you said?
Taliesin: 25.
Matt: 25. Okay. It's hard to discern what shifting in the distance is not the rumbling from the ever-occasional titan footfalls, but nothing seems to catch your attention. Occasionally, you hear dislodged rocks and stones clacking across the stone floor and the steps, and every now and then you catch a stone or two fall past and eventually come to rest either near or below you. You continue up the switchback stairs and lead into a third switchback that continues upward.
Liam: 40 feet in advance.
Marisha: We are following behind.
Laura: Are you looking for traps as you go, brother?
Liam: I am. That is an 18, anyway.
Marisha: I still have my hands guiding Percy, our blind human.
Matt: Leading the old man forward.
Taliesin: (old man voice) Where's Steven?
Marisha: (laughs) Where's Steven?
Matt: You do not find any other traps. There's no other issues that worry you upon this climb. You do eventually come to the top of the third switchback stairway and it leads you into a slight curved cavern. The stairs stop and it leads into a continuation of the dwarf-like hallway structure that you had below, but it is curving around now, in sections. I would say, as opposed to a gradual curve, the design in the structure here has a very rigid, geometric shape, so the curvature is in sections.
Liam: Yeah, I appreciate it as I go, and I look for traps.
Matt: All right, go for it.
Liam: Love it. That's an 18.
Matt: Okay. Coming around the edge  no traps, no plates. Nothing catches your attention. However, this tunnel comes to an end, and it opens up into a larger crevasse than the one that you previously saw that held a number of city buildings of the remains of Thomara. It looks to be about 100 to 120 feet tall, you assume, from the bits of the stalactites that you can see, barely reaching the edge of your visual range. Very faint bit of light here, bioluminescent fungus in a dull orangish color that dots the edges of this interior chamber.
Liam: And is it like where I killed that motherfucker? They were built into the cliff face, right?
Matt: Yes. This one is larger than the one you were in before, and you can see just beyond your visual range, a number of these buildings, partially crumbled in some places, some still standing obstinately against the ever-shifting interior of the titan's form, the chamber curling upward as the ceiling crawls higher and higher just beyond your visual range, and you can faintly see the images of dozens of thin bridges that weave over themselves across different levels, up into the higher portion.
Liam: I want to confirm an intuition and use my last Divine Sense and feel undead.
Matt: Okay, what's the range on that one?
Liam: 60 feet.
Matt: 60 feet? You do not sense any undead within the 60-foot range.
Marisha: I think we're in the lungs. I think we're in its chest cavity.
Liam: Speaking into the earrings; they're all behind me. I think we're in a more populous place with the undead cannibals, know what I mean? There's a very large cavern in here and a lot of room.
Taliesin: I'd be grateful if anyone got a sample of that bioluminescent fungus.
Marisha: I can get that. I'm interested.
Laura: Do you want me to fly up and get some?
Liam: We're on a schedule here.
Marisha: Well, if it's on the way. We have to go that way.
Laura: We have to go up, right? Does it look like there's openings in the ceiling?
Matt: Well currently you're the only one who's stepped into this entrance to look up, the rest of you are now exiting into the chamber.
Liam: I'll wait, obviously. Nothing's going to explode on my friends, so they catch up with me.
Matt: Okay, so they're all behind you now where this entrance is, and as you look past it, this hallway that you're entering, it looks like there was a doorway here. There was some sort of hinge on the edge that held a door that had since been broken or toppled forward. You can see pieces of the door that once held this entranceway, and a number of the buildings immediately to the right and left. That's where you stand, what do you want to do?
Laura: Does it look like there's any footprints coming in and out of the doorway that we came from?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Travis: Can I look for a doorknob or a keyhole?
Liam: Everything we were told is that this place is full of undead cannibals.
Laura: 23.
Matt: Not in a long time.
Travis: Is there shattered remnants of the door?
Matt: Yeah, you see a couple of shards here and there--
Travis: Any doorknob or a keyhole that's on the ground or anything?
Matt: Make an investigation check. Lot of investigation checks today.
Travis: Two.
Matt: You scramble about and find a couple of pieces that might be, but no, it's just more stone.
Marisha: Can I see any stairs carved in the side, in the walls, trying to head up to this-- is that what you just checked?
Laura: No, that's what I was about to look for, too.
Liam: Is there any movement, because there's bioluminescent shit on the walls in here, so there's a little bit of light, right? Yeah. 26.
Matt: 26. As you glance about-- once again, your vision, because there is very little light in here and the very, very faint bits of fungus in the distance that give you a sense of the shape of this entire chamber. There isn't enough light for you to make out any shape beyond the exterior of your visual range, so you can't really tell.
Liam: A second thing I want to look for is what other exits from this gigantic cavern. Ways through, up. Yeah, you looked, but I didn't look.
Matt: Let me finish what I was saying first.
Travis: Roll! Roll again.
Matt: But based on the size of this chamber and the bits of what small elements of structures that you can see of the architecture within, this definitely appears to be more of the heart of the city of Thomara when it was once at its ancient height. You can see at the very edge of your visual range a cracked central fountain that is empty and dry, and you see, just beyond your range, the exterior of a large temple-like building that rises out of the ability to see any more of its height and structure.
Taliesin: Temple.
Matt: But like I said, you guys are still standing at the entrance to this cavern.
Marisha: What about the temple? Why?
Sam: Want to fly through here? Can we fly?
Liam: I don't think we want to stay here--
Sam: I know, that's why we just fly through.
Liam: Find another exit, yeah, but where?
Travis: I'd like to see the temple, if I can.
Sam: What are you talking about?
Travis: Well look, all right, my gloves--
Laura: Keep your voice down.
Travis: (whispering) My gloves come from the heart of a ruined primordial titan. So if maybe they harvested pieces of my gloves, and it's in a temple, I don't know, you smart people could do something with that.
Liam: Right, what's your plan? You expect us to come up with a plan to explain why your gloves are connected to that temple, and you're going to get what? A Mighty Morphin Power Ranger bonus for doing so?
Travis: Yes.
Marisha: Are your Titanstone Knuckles exalted yet?
Travis: Yep. They're just buzzing.
Liam: Yeah, are they still dildoing on your fingers?
Marisha: Are they buzzing more?
Travis: Are they humming more?
Matt: Doesn't appear to have changed.
Travis: Nope, just humming.
Marisha: Step two steps closer.
Travis: Two steps closer to the temple.
Marisha: Do they appear to be buzzing more?
Travis: Are they appearing buzzing more?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Travis: Ooh! 19.
Matt: Not bad. Nope.
Taliesin: Is the temple on the way? Does it make sense to cross through the city, or does it make sense to fly up?
Liam: We're moving towards Vasselheim now. I'm negative on our chances of dealing with this before Vasselheim, but that's the goal, right?
Taliesin: We've got some time, and I feel like this city is an opportunity to find some more advantages.
Travis: We are also looking for the Sword of Kas. What's if it's in the temple?
Sam: Why would Vecna keep the thing that could kill Vecna near Vecna?
Liam: I'm pulling Percy aside. I hear you, but this is a city that has existed here for a long time. Vecna didn't create this city. Vecna doesn't own these people. This is a fucking mountain that existed and now they're going for a ride. What do these people have to do with Vecna?
Taliesin: It's not a city that just existed.
Liam: No?
Taliesin: This is a giant primordial beast that people inhabited. God only knows what existed in here.
Marisha: Yeah, but as we've already seen from the other tomb, it's already been heavily, heavily plundered.
Liam: And Vecna's just a user. This place was just sitting there. He lifted it up and took it away. These assholes don't have anything to do with--
Travis: Why did he choose this?
Marisha: How far away is the temple? Do we know? Can we football range guess it?
Matt: I'd say, because you guys have darkvision of 60 feet?
Taliesin: If gods really understood how this world worked, this would not be happening right now.
Matt: It's at about the 50, 55 foot areas where the wall begins, then it vanishes beyond that.
Liam: Percy, this shitbird has appeared like three times wherever we were.
Laura: Well, he's not going to be able to do that right now because I've got a fucking ring.
Taliesin: He doesn't necessarily know this place as well as--
Marisha: Hang on. How long have we been in here, versus how far have we been from Vasselheim? Because we are on a time crunch.
Travis: 200 miles away once we entered is how far away we are from Vasselheim. 200 miles. With steps of?
Taliesin: What was the average land speed of a laden undead?
Matt: You've been within the titan for, I'd say, roughly three and a half hours, maybe.
Liam: Yeah, he's 110 miles out from Vasselheim, at this point.
Travis: We have time to check the temple.
Sam: All right, let's swoop in and swoop out.
Marisha: Super fucking fast!
Taliesin: I'm not even saying look in it, let's take a look at what it--
Laura: Did I see any stairs?
Matt: You do not see any staircases within a 60-foot radius of where you're standing.
Taliesin: We might be harder to spot if we stay on the ground for now, anyway.
Marisha: I just want to say, we gave you guys the other temple, in which you found your stupid waistband, but we got really fucked up from it! Everything has a consequence and a price and shit. Nothing is free.
Laura: I'm going to cast Pass Without a fucking Trace. It's my last Pass Without a Trace, but I'm afraid--
Travis: No, don't do it.
Laura: What if we bring out an entire fucking city of undead dwarves upon us?
Marisha: Let me do it. I have Pass Without a Trace and one more 2nd-level spell left. I'll do it. Save yours.
Liam: I'm also going to put something on the table here: we're trying to save Vasselheim, but we're also trying to save the world. We might not be able to do this without recharging before Vasselheim.
Taliesin: I'm aware.
Sam: You want to go to sleep in this undead city?!
Liam: No, but we're trying to save the world, not just a city.
Sam: So sacrificing Vasselheim so that we can feel better about a fight?
Liam: What if we lose the fight Scanlan? Then who fucking cares? Vasselheim is gone. Westruun is gone. Kaylie is gone. Everything's fucking gone if we fuck this up!
Sam: Well, let's stay on the path and see how long it takes.
Marisha: How about this? Hold. Wait! We still don't know how to get up there, right?
Sam: Is that purple eyeliner?
Marisha: Yeah, do you like it? Thank you. It's a little metallic. Thank you, I bought it while I was waiting for--
Travis: Oh my god!
Laura: Oh my god!
Marisha: Okay. I hate to say split the party, but what if we split the party? What if a few of you check out your fucking temple, and then the rest of us try to figure out a way to get up.
Travis: I'm cool. I'll vote for a temple party.
Marisha: Temple party. Who else is on temple party?
Sam: They need somebody who can help them in there.
Liam: I hate the idea, but I'm the stealthiest motherfucker in this room.
Taliesin: And then you three on the carpet, you on the broom.
Travis: I need the carpet.
Marisha: So wait, just the two of you are going to go check out the carpet?
Laura: Vax is going in with you.
Sam: I feel like one person with magic should go with them. I'll go with them.
Taliesin: We're all ear-pieced.
Marisha: Okay, so Grog--
Liam: Everybody but Keyleth.
Sam: No, it's Keyleth, Vex, and Pike are going searching. The boys are going in the temple, and the girls are going searching.
Marisha: Okay, cool, I'm on board.
Taliesin: This is in no way, by the way, an amazing mirror of that one time underneath Kraghammer. They're just going to find another Clarota.
Liam: The boys all die. The girls go to glory.
Laura: I want to kiss Percy before he goes. Don't die in this stupid temple.
Taliesin: I will not die in this stupid temple.
Sam: I'm going, too.
Taliesin: I slap him in the face.
Laura: Right on, Scanlan. Sorry, Percy.
Matt: Who's traveling in what group?
Laura: Girls are going to look for stairs, the boys are going in the stupid temple.
Liam: I yank the druid in for a kiss.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Oh wait, shit. Your fucking ring.
Laura: Fuck! My fucking ring! We can't split the party.
Taliesin: Okay, can't split the party. We all go looking for the stairs. Oh, you asshole, stop it! (laughter)
Laura: He was really excited about it!
Matt: I was waiting on that.
Laura: Oh my god, he was so excited about it.
Sam: All right, into the temple. Come on, let's just fucking go to the fucking temple.
Matt: I was like, you guys literally had this conversation an hour ago, but okay.
Taliesin: Whatever we do, we can't split the party (fast-forward noise). Okay, we're going to split the party.
Travis: Sam saved our asses.
Taliesin: That was Cabin in the Woods shit.
Liam: 40 feet in advance, Vax walks ahead of the group, hating himself. Here we go.
Matt: Go for it. What are you doing, you're checking for traps?
Liam: I'm checking for enemies hiding.
Matt: So as you push forward--
Laura: We're stealthed, we're Pass Without a Traced.
Matt: Okay, then roll some stealth, guys.
Laura: She Pass Without a Traced us.
Matt: Right, then roll some stealth.
Sam: Oh, we're all rolling stealth?
Liam: 34.
Sam: 25.
Taliesin: 26.
Marisha: 26.
Laura: 39.
Travis: Natural one.
Marisha: Are you serious?
Sam: He's so excited about that temple.
Laura: Natural 20 for Pike! Oh wait, she gets disadvantage.
Matt: She has the boots that make it not at disadvantage.
Taliesin: First time ever.
Liam: But that's a lot of good.
Laura: So much good for one shitty--
Matt: You begin to push forward past the cracked fountain, heading ahead of everyone, keeping an eye out for what's ahead of you. The high walls of the temple-like structure begin to reveal themselves, standing ominous over the debris-strewn streets with shattered carts and bone fragments. The bone fragments faintly quaking beneath every footfall of the walking mountain that you currently are walking through. You see long-decomposed dwarvish bodies brutalized beyond reanimation lying scattered across the broken street paths ahead of you, deep grooves marking the splintered bone. A tangled network of partially ruined catwalks begin to reveal themselves above you, carved from the mountain, contains a ghostly image of a multi-level metropolis long fallen. You, make a perception check.
Liam: 29.
Matt: 29. You can see, as soon as you get to where the fountain is, the center of the street ahead of you. Dozens of slow shifting creatures moving throughout the streets and rubble of crumbling structures. You can see now, many of the undead citizens of the catacombs are now wandering, shaken awake by the lumbering titan that now carries them within. You also see a very faint blue pulsing glow emanating from one of the windows of the temple.
Liam: Can we put the goliath on the carpet so he doesn't kick something or be himself?
Laura: We don't know that he rolled shittily.
Liam: I know that, but he's a big, blundering mother fucking asshole when he wants to be--
Travis: On the chain. Literally on the text chain.
Matt: Which, as you're saying this, you hear a (clattering), and you glance over real fast and watch as Grog is walking by and the edge of his-- which weapon do you have attuned right now? You have the Blood Axe? The Blood Axe hits the edge of a large dwarven statue that had fallen off at a corner angle and is currently being held by a small barrel, and as the axe hits it, it shifts (crashing) and rolls and comes to a rest for a second with this clattering, grinding sound. Parts of it chip and break, but most of it remains strong and sturdy upon impact. At which point, you see at the edge of your visual range, about seven of the wandering creatures go (raspy groan) and begin slowly slinking their way in the direction of the noise.
Sam: So a rock just fell?
Travis: A big statue just fell.
Sam: And is in pieces?
Matt: Parts of it are broken. It's still pretty sturdy.
Taliesin: Let's try and serpentine around and see if we can trace back.
Liam: And they're to the right or the left or ahead of us?
Matt: They're ahead of you.
Laura: Do they look like they saw us?
Liam: Go left. Jenga, jenga, jenga. Can we put Grog on the carpet now?
Taliesin: Yep.
Marisha: We're trying to go up, right?
Sam: No, we're trying to go towards the temple.
Laura: Towards that pulsing light.
Liam: We've got a little bit of business, a little bit of activity ahead of us, so we want to curve to the left.
Travis: All right, we move accordingly.
Matt: All right. So you guys move along the left and curve around the side. As you begin to move along the edge, you watch as about eight of these mostly-skeletal dwarvish corpses begin to shamble in the direction of where the noise came from. You can see elements of their long-mummified skin pulled tight against elements of the rib cage and the skull. Bits of chipped teeth, now broken against whatever things it's attempted to chew on its long un-life. As they move past, two of them glance over in the direction of Grog, and then all of them shift over in the direction and begin rushing forward in your path.
Liam: What's the distance?
Matt: At this point, they're probably about 50 or so feet from where you are.
Liam: Oh shit!
Laura: We don't want to make too much noise. I'm going to shoot a couple.
Travis: We could just go straight up.
Laura: There's only eight of them. We can take eight undead.
Liam: Pickle walks forward and takes a knee and waits with her holy symbol of Sarenrae, waiting for them.
Laura: I take two of them by surprise. That's auto-crit.
Liam: Vax does the same, watching his badass sister, and Pike waits to turn whatever's left of them.
Laura: Yeah, they're super-silent arrows.
Liam: So what happens first?
Matt: All right. She's preparing for it, right?
Liam: Yeah. She's waiting until she sees them.
Matt: Oh, well she also has darkvision of 60 feet.
Liam: So she's waiting until they're within range of her holy abilities.
Matt: What's the radius on that one?
Liam: That's a good question, because I'm a rogue paladin. (sighs) Goddamn it.
Matt: That's all right.
Liam: What if I look in the sorceror rules?
Matt: Nope. 30 feet.
Liam: 30 feet. So she's waiting for the twins to do their work and anything that's left over she's going to scatter.
Matt: Okay. All right. So as she holds position--
Laura: So it's auto-crit?
Matt: They know you're there. It's not a surprise. There's as threat, and they're rushing. But you do have advantage on the hits because they don't see you.
Laura: Well great, that's great. 20?
Matt: That definitely hits.
Laura: Okay. Oh, the other one super-duper hits. It's a 19 plus 14.
Liam: 25, 31, natural 20.
Matt: Okay. All right. So go ahead and roll damage on those. Are you shooting two different skeletons or one each?
Liam: I'm after my sister. She talked before I did.
Laura: I'll see how the first arrow hits?
Matt: Okay.
Laura: 14. Oh, I didn't Hunter's Mark. Whatever. 14, 15, 16. Two lightning damage. Do I add anything? Sneak attack!
Taliesin: Been a while.
Laura: How do we D&D? Plus ten sneak attack.
Matt: Okay. So the first skeleton, the arrow hits it and the torso explodes behind with ribs shattering and scattering across the stonework, its body falling and collapsing to the ground.
Laura: I hit another one.
Matt: Yes, you do.
Liam: Oh, and we go first, so it's advantage.
Laura: 14 plus four lightning damage. And that is plus eight.
Travis: 26.
Matt: 26. This one right behind it, its jaw unhinged slightly. Its tongue made of this slick rotting material that dangles through the hole in the bottom of the jaw. Comes around the corner, and you watch as part of its head explodes off one side from the secondary arrow, taking out what remains of the center of its skull, and the body crumples to the ground. Two skeletons down.
Liam: Sneak attack hits the first time we connect, right?
Matt: Yeah. You don't have to roll damage for that one.
Laura: Oh. Sorry, I did sneak attack on the second arrow.
Matt: Well, you can do sneak attack once per round.
Laura: Okay. I did eight damage too much.
Matt: It was still enough.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: You don't have to roll damage for sneak attack.
Liam: So then that one's gone?
Matt: A third skeleton now is ruined. You hit it with the arrow in the middle of the spinal column, and it folds on itself.
Liam: Okay. So paladin action-action and my bonus action. So that's the first of three. The last one's the one that was a critical hit so the second one goes onto the next whole skeleton. It's just an eight.
Matt: Okay. This one the arrow slides into the side of the skull, and it keeps coming forward towards Grog.
Liam: Okay. And then the last critical hit, which is Whisper again, because it bamfed back, is two plus eight is ten. Two and three. It's not that much. It's 15 total.
Matt: Okay. And that one does finish it. So that's three skeletons down. Grog, I want to to individually roll an initiative check for me.
Travis: Natural 20. With Gil's dice.
Matt: So as you guys are watching this happen, the other five rush in to close the gap, but you are at the ready, and you get to strike before they do.
Travis: Nice. Am I hitting them? Yeah, Okay. Reckless, great weapon master. 31 for the first one.
Matt: That hits.
Travis: Okay, cool.
Matt: Your minimum damage will kill them. So as the first one comes up towards you, you swing up. As you slam into it, you watch as its bony body blows up against the side of the nearby stone building and then scrapes to the ground.
Travis: Can I use the other strike on another?
Matt: Yes, you can.
Travis: Reckless great weapon. That'll hit. That's like 30.
Taliesin: If there's anything left on Grog by the end of this, I'll try to swipe them off with my sword.
Travis: 32.
Matt: All righty. So two more detonate on this point. So there's three left. They're closing in on Grog. Does Pike want to take her turn?
Travis: We might want to save that Turnt Undead.
Laura: No, I think we should save.
Liam: I've already said it, but she's whispering to me to hold. She's half of Pike right now. You're half of Pike right now.
Taliesin: I'd like to pop in and see if I could take a couple--
Matt: Make an initiative roll.
Laura: Don't shoot, Percy.
Taliesin: I'm not; I'm going to use my sword.
Liam: Pike holds, breathing hard, looking at them coming on.
Taliesin: 16.
Matt: Yeah, that beats them by one. So yeah, as the three remaining ones start charging in towards Grog--
Taliesin: I'm going to run in, draw the silvered sword, and take some swipes.
Matt: Go for it.
Taliesin: Let's take three swipes right out of here.
Laura: Pike can use her mace on anything left in that area.
Taliesin: That's one natural 20, one natural 19. Do I crit on a 19 with the sword?
Matt: No.
Taliesin: Okay, never mind. And a two. But that might be enough, because I have a really high-- that's a 15 as my lowest to hit. Does a 15 hit?
Matt: 15 does hit. Yes.
Taliesin: So the 15 is-- That's 14 piercing damage to the first one with a silvered sword.
Matt: Okay. You rush up and you carve through the first skeleton, and it breaks on the ground in front of you.
Taliesin: Number two is 13 points of damage to the second one.
Matt: Okay. The second one, you bring the blade down into the skull and cleave it in half. You watch as part of its skull breaks off to the side and the jaw falls to the ground and the rest crumbles in place.
Taliesin: I twirl around and take my third wonderful pirouette attack, which is 20 points of damage.
Matt: Okay, and as the final one lunges forward, in a fervent-- strangely faster than you expect for a skeletal undead, it begins to accelerate towards Grog. And with that, you take the blade and take the head right off at the neck, and it falls and crumples to the ground.
Marisha: So it's like 28 Days Later zombies?
Travis: 28 Days Later, they run.
Marisha: He said that they were fast.
Matt: Well, the last one-- it was flavor.
Marisha: Just wanted to make sure they weren't special.
Matt: Okay. As you finish the fray and hold yourself, you wait and wait. You do not hear or notice any more advancing undead from that direction.
Travis: Okay, how about I don't move and somebody with flying ability go to check out that blue glowy window?
Taliesin: We have to stick together.
Laura: Is the glowy window within 60 feet?
Taliesin: No, it's far.
Travis: When we were at the opening, we were 50 to 60 feet away.
Matt: The temple where you guys were at, at the time was 50 feet away from you, but you would have crossed the other side of the hall. So now it's about 100 feet away from you. At this distance, you can see it's a round, almost cylindrical building, Colosseum-esque. And there's a small square window about every 25 to 30 feet. And it's big. It's large, but you can see that faint glow between multiple windows from this distance.
Travis: So should we fly up to that window?
Taliesin: I think it'd be safer to stay on the ground level and sneak. Because if we're the air, they are going to see us.
Travis: Let's do it.
Marisha: And we still have Pass Without a Trace, so let's go.
Laura: Yes, we do. She cast it.
Matt: All right, now that this brief combat has finished, those who took place in it, which would be you, Vax, Grog, and Percy have to remake your stealth checks.
Laura: You're like, "Gladly!"
Taliesin: Yes.
Laura: What about Pike? Because she just knelt down. She didn't really fight.
Matt: She stepped out of her stealth. She was making herself visible.
Laura: My natural 20 for Pike, wasted!
Taliesin: 23.
Liam: We still have Pass Without Trace?
Marisha: Yes. I didn't do anything.
Travis: 26.
Marisha: Keeping that concentration.
Taliesin: (singing) Concentration. Concentration.
Marisha: (singing) Concentration. Concentration.
Liam: You're the doctor! Keep your patients on the run!
Laura: 30 for Pike. 29 for me.
Matt: All right. You guys begin to slowly make your way along the left wall of this large cavern.
Liam: 37, by the way.
Matt: Good to know. As you slowly move through the shadows, dodging through open doorways and through windows, trying the best you can to stay out from the center thoroughfare of this opening, you see more and more of these undead. Dozens, maybe even a hundred have crossed your path at the perimeter of your visual range and you can see in the catwalks above too, with the faint bit of the orange glow, occasionally shapes breaking across the orange. This entire cavern is swarming.
Laura: (whispering) Do we still have the thing?
Sam: Oh, the filter? The censer?
Laura: Do we have it in the Bag of Holding?
Taliesin: We also have the herbs.
Laura: What if we use it? What if we use it and it just repels them?
Taliesin: When it's time. We don't have a lot of it.
Marisha: Yeah, it's a very small amount.
Liam: Is it ready to go, though?
Taliesin: Let's prepare it, and when it's time--
Liam: Is it ready to go, though?
Marisha: Yeah it's dried. I spent that time. I spent time during the break.
Taliesin: It's just burning the herbs, though. We don't need the censer. Just hold it in your hands.
Liam: Do we have any sense of where we started in this giant cavern? Or are we totally fucking turned around?
Matt: No. I mean you have a decent sense. You are maybe 100 to 150 feet from where you began. Because you've been moving slowly. Staying stealthily, you're moving very carefully and very slowly and judging by the shape of the cavern and where you are currently, you're about halfway through it, or close to halfway.
Taliesin: It's good that we didn't go on the catwalk.
Matt: The temple's on the opposite side of the chamber.
Liam: Oh! All the way on the other side. I thought it was central.
Matt: I'm sorry. When you entered the entrance, the temple was to the front and to the right of you. You guys curved around the left, on the other side of it, keeping a view on it so you could see it from across the way. Are you making your way across to the temple?
Liam: So it's pressed against the opposite wall of this big place?
Sam: Are the undead all around the temple?
Matt: Further in. Nothing directly around the outside of the temple. So you guys curve around the entrance where you came and slowly make your way towards where the temple emerges from the rock wall. About a third or so of its exterior wall is actually built into the side of this cavern, and the large cylindrical-like Colosseum temple structure curves outward. You can see as you get closer to it, there's maybe the three floors to it but edges of the top wall have crumbled inward and you can see areas where it looks like it's sustained some physical damage or eroded over time. You eventually make your way around the outside wall of the temple to one of the first doorways, and it is an archway, maybe six feet tall and about four feet wide. Very simple. This is an old temple.
Liam: Is that light you talked about coming from one specific source, or all over the place? Every window.
Travis: Is there a story?
Matt: It looks to be coming from the base.
Liam: From down below.
Laura: Can we see in one of the windows?
Matt: You can look inside. Make a perception check.
Sam: Are there any bone laying around?
Matt: Plenty.
Sam: I am going to pick up two bones, give them to Simon Two, and tell him to go across the street, 50 feet away from us, and wait there in some building. Hold these bones.
Matt: You watch as two bone shards slowly glide over, then stand there.
Laura: 34.
Matt: Okay. As you pull up to the window and glance down, you immediately look inside the temple, and you see about 30 or so silhouettes of shambling dwarven corpses all standing inside the base floor of this temple. You see the silhouettes and shapes because they are all faintly outlined from the source of this blue light. You see a small, baseball-sized, bluish crystal that is resting, not in the perfect center of the temple but somewhere in the open middle floor area, and it looks like these 30 undead are surrounding it, and standing.
Sam: Smash and grab. You could go in there and get that thing, be out before they even saw you in there.
Taliesin: Also, have your unseen servant make a bunch of noise and have them all--
Marisha: Be a distraction?
Laura: Yeah, but making any kind of noise would draw large crowds.
Taliesin: We can have the unseen servant pick it up.
Marisha: How far away can he be, though?
Sam: He's 50 feet away, right now, and he's waiting to make noise.
Taliesin: What if he were to go in and get it himself?
Sam: He could.
Travis: He is invisible, isn't he?
Sam: He could go and pick it up and come right back with it.
Laura: But first don't tell him to come right out, tell him to like walk a little bit to see if they follow the light.
Liam: But what are our options if that doesn't work?
Sam: If he picks up the crystal and it doesn't work, or it doesn't move?
Liam: I want to do that. If that doesn't work, I can click the boots, and I can be there in a heartbeat and run, but what do we do next?
Sam: We need an escape plan, right? How many can fit on the carpet?
Liam: This goes back to my conversation with you, which is: are we going to find a pocket and rest?
Taliesin: Yes, but not here.
Liam: Agreed, but we're talking about Vasselheim, and is damage to Vasselheim a sacrifice needed to be ready to do what's necessary?
Travis: If he destroys Vasselheim, he does his miracle, his display of power, and he will be even stronger. That is not an option.
Taliesin: If we were to be clever, if we're at the edge of Vasselheim, the Vasselheim forces will be distracting his forces, so we'll have less to deal with, so we want this fight to happen at the edge.
Liam: So we're talking about no rest. I'm not talking about a short rest.
Taliesin: There will not be a long rest, I don't think.
Laura: There might be.
Liam: Not without him spilling into Vasselheim.
Marisha: I've been very conservative with what I've been doing for a reason.
Travis: I don't think a long rest is in the cards.
Taliesin: I've only burned one thing that requires a long rest.
Marisha: I agree with Grog. We can't sacrifice having him gain all of those followers, because then the only option would be murder a lot of his followers, which I'm not really comfortable with.
Travis: And he may be too strong at that point.
Sam: We don't need to discuss this now. We need to get the crystal and get the fuck out of here!
Taliesin: If we can pull this off without burning anything important, then it doesn't matter.
Marisha: I want to go on record and say I think this is stupid. Okay, let's go.
Laura: That crystal looks really appetizing, and I want it.
Travis: How about we get ready to leave? I'll get on the carpet.
Laura: It looks really super magical.
Travis: Who's on the broom with Vex?
Laura: Me.
Travis: No, who is on the broom with you?
Taliesin: I'll be on the broom with her.
Travis: Do you want to get on the carpet with me?
Sam: Yeah, of course.
Marisha: I have to come with you because I have the Pass Without a Trace spell.
Taliesin: We all have to be together. We can't separate.
Travis: And he can fly.
Sam: No, he can't. He's done with his wings.
Liam: Yeah, that's right.
Sam: We have too many people for the carpet and the broom.
Liam: My wings are gone. There's no wings for Vecna unless we rest.
Travis: Well, kick Trinket out of the necklace, and I'll get in there.
Taliesin: I can also climb up the wall, if need be.
Sam: We can leave Trinket.
Liam: It's fine, I still have the boots. Just the wings. It was death or wings. I chose wings.
Travis: All right, so how do we fly? How do we do that?
Sam: I can burn a spell and be a giant eagle or something.
Taliesin: Just for shits and giggles, I'm going to take one last look around to see if there's any infrastructure for getting up. There must be infrastructure for getting up here. There wasn't layers of a city on top of each other.
Sam: We could just run.
Liam: But wait, where are we going though if we get this thing?
Sam: Up away.
Liam: We have no verification of an exit or a hole or anything!
Travis: Yeah, sometimes you just got to leap, okay?
Liam: That's my entire life, but this is the last moment.
Sam: Every organ in a body has an entrance and an exit, right? Wait, no, lungs don't; they just have the one.
Marisha: Wait up, we argued more this game more than anything else. Okay, we know we still have to fly upwards, including on flying up to the blue crystally thing right?
Laura: No, the blue crystal is right here.
Marisha: Well, then what the fuck?
Laura: I don't know!
Liam: We have a plan for getting the crystal, just not how to get the fuck out.
Marisha: We fucking fly!
Travis: Who burns a spell to become an animal?
Marisha: I can burn a spell.
Travis: You do that.
Marisha: We're probably going to take another short rest, right?
Travis: Probably.
Marisha: Okay.
Sam: I can recall Simon 2. I can send him across the room, make a bunch of noise, draw a bunch of people over there. You run, grab the crystal, and then we hustle out of there.
Travis: What if only half the room leaves, though?
Laura: No, you go get Simon 2 to go get the crystal.
Sam: And there's going to be a floating crystal that marches across?
Travis: They don't give a shit. Do it. I'm on the carpet. We're ready to go.
Marisha: You're on me? And you're on carpet, and you're on broom?
Travis: Percy and Vex are on the broom.
Matt: Gnomes on the carpet with Grog. You and Percy on the broom. You're transforming into what creature?
Marisha: Giant eagle.
Matt: Giant eagle.
Marisha: Not yet, though.
Laura: And then we all, within 60 feet of each other, fly up.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: Okay, who's doing what?
Laura: Simon 2.
Sam: Simon 2 is going to go get the thing. Let's say they all start watching the thing come towards us. Grog, are you here? Are you with us?
Travis: Yeah, I have to be.
Sam: Can you throw something across the room to make a noise?
Travis: Yep. I can absolutely do that.
Laura: I'll prime an arrow.
Travis: I have a hooded lantern that has fuel in it. It will even burn when it lands. It's been sitting in there for four years.
Sam: This is a terrible plan.
Taliesin: This is why we hoarded it in the first place.
Sam: Guys, I'm just going to say this one more time before we do this: he's way faster than Simon 2. Simon 2 could create a distraction. He could (snatching noise).
Liam: Scanlan, only with the boots.
Travis: If they chase the jewel, fuck the jewel, and we'll leave.
Taliesin: If they chase the jewel, we can grab it and run, anyway.
Sam: All right, Simon 2. Come back with your bones!
Matt: The bones shift over towards you ever-so-slowly.
Liam: (singing) Don't worry, be happy now.
Sam: All right. Simon 2, go to the middle of the room. Throw the bones away, far, then grab the crystal. You don't have pockets. Run back to us! Away, yeah. Should he cover it with a blanket or something? Do you have a hood?
Matt: The bones begin to drift.
Taliesin: Okay, I'm not saying no.
Laura: A handkerchief to put over the light.
Sam: So it blocks the light? All right, so go put this handkerchief on the thing, pick it up, and bring it back to us. Go, Simon 2. You're our only hope.
Matt: Is Simon holding bones or a blanket?
Sam: He's holding a blanket.
Taliesin: He's holding a hanky.
Laura: He's holding a hanky.
Travis: Put the bones down gently.
Sam: Give me the bones. I put the bones down. Here's a handkerchief. You'll put it over the crystal, pick up the crystal, and bring it back to us.
Matt: Simon begins to slowly walk, the handkerchief floating by.
Taliesin: This is like those little handkerchief ghosts you would make in kindergarten.
Matt: As you glance inside and watch as it happens, you can see all the undead that are in there are standing, unmoving, swaying a little bit in place. Simon's about 30 feet out from them. About 20 feet out. They don't notice his presence. You notice that all the undead are facing the crystal, by the way.
Laura: Why didn't you tell us that before?
Marisha: Why didn't you tell us that before?
Marisha: (laughing) That's crucial information.
Sam: Right before he picks it up, hock a rock as far as you can.
Travis: Not the lantern?
Taliesin: Not the rock, the lantern. Light the lantern and throw it.
Marisha: By the way, they're all staring right at you. They're 100 percent aware of what's going on.
Matt: They're not staring at you. They're staring at the crystal.
Laura: They will be staring at us. What if we destroy the crystal? I wonder if all the undead would die. Let's keep going.
Matt: The handkerchief makes its way forward. Simon walks between the undead, and they don't even notice.
Sam: That's a good guy, that Simon 2.
Marisha: What happens?
Matt: The handkerchief moves over onto the crystal, and all the undead look over to the crystal, and the crystal lifts, and they all begin to (groans).
Travis: I take the hooded lantern and I (laughs) I throw the fucking piss out of it.
Matt: Make an attack roll. Roll and add your strength modifier.
Travis: Oh, that's good! 19.
Matt: You're adding your strength modifier to that? Yeah. You're aiming at the opposite end?
Travis: If the entrance is here, I'm throwing it in the opposite direction of where we are.
Matt: With your strength? Easy enough. You lob it. It arcs over (flame noises) and explodes. The oil spreads across the ground. Flames ignite, and the bright light that emanates from it and the flames burst, and all the undead turn over (grunting) and begin to retract away. Two of them are following Simon. Only two of the undead are following Simon, currently. The others are distracted by the detonation of flame. They look confused.
Liam: How close are the pursuers?
Matt: They're making their way slowly. No, they're much faster than Simon.
Liam: I'm throwing.
Laura: I'm going to get down and shoot.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Just the ones following Simon!
Matt: Both of you guys roll an attack.
Travis: Are they far away from the other ones that aren't leaving yet?
Taliesin: It doesn't matter; they're not paying attention.
Laura: 25. No, 33.
Liam: 29.
Matt: Roll damage.
Taliesin: They drop out of nowhere. They faint. It's going to be good.
Marisha: So we hope.
Taliesin: I thought you were made of sterner stuff, Travis. Come on. Now is not the time to get squeamish.
Laura: 24.
Taliesin: We made a solemn oath.
Sam: They were innocent.
Taliesin: We agreed, weeks ago.
Liam: I rolled a 77 for mine.
Sam: 77?!
Matt: These two skeletons almost atomize. As they're walking, they're both gaining on Simon, and as they both start reaching towards where the dull bluish glow, mostly muted by the handkerchief, is floating in the air, they (growl) towards it. You watch as both their heads and torsos scatter across the ground, like a heavy wave of force blasted them across the stonework. The scraping sound hits as the detonation hits. The flames are dying down, and... no, no other undead see it. Slowly, the stone floats past, out of the doorway, and makes its way back to you.
Taliesin: Drop it in the Bag of Holding.
Matt: At this point, Simon's getting real close to the end of his hour-long casting time.
Sam: You've served us well.
Travis: Bag of Holding. It doesn't hurt my hand, or anything, does it?
Matt: No.
Travis: Cool! We've got that.
Matt: Whatever it is.
Laura: I guess we have it.
Marisha: Nothing happened to them when we put it in the Bag of Holding? They were like, (groaning) and kept going? All the undead?
Matt: All the undead inside that were distracted by the explosion of the lantern are riled up now, and they're starting to wander around, and some of them are starting to make their way towards the entrance to the temple. Some are making their way toward the staircase to head upward.
Marisha: Are we flying?
Travis: Yes, we fly up.
Matt: All right. You go into eagle form, grab Vax, and all of you guys make your way up into the cavern entrance.
Laura: Bubble. Tight bubble.
Matt: Currently, I believe the eagle form has darkvision. Right now, you have no light source.
Liam: I do. I can say things to her. I can see.
Matt: Right, so you guys are able to maneuver. So as you guys head up into the center part of the cavern, above the catwalks, you can see as you push through, about a third of them are still standing. A lot of them have collapsed in the center, and there's edges of bridges that come to a halt where they've collapsed and tumbled down into the cavern below. You can see straggling undead wandering the catwalks and these pathways along the edges of the cavern. As you pass forward through them-- I imagine you guys are cruising through as fast as you can?
Taliesin: Trying to avoid them.
Laura: We'll try to avoid the clusters.
Matt: A few of them seem to glance up and see you as you pass and reach, but they have nowhere to go. As you begin to cruise through the center of this cavern, following it to the opposite side, it widens further, and now as you look down, faintly, you can see bits of the orange bioluminescent fungus that are growing within this city below. You can see elements of these beautiful statues that are partially crumbled. You can see small homes that litter the center of this chamber. You can see some of the catwalks that meet in the center of this actually meet in a suspended platform that contains another dome-like structure that is partially caved in. With another shake and impact of the titan's footfall, you watch as one of its suspension pillars cracks, and the entire center finally gives way and falls and slams down, collapsing into the center of the chamber, it being there for the final moment of its tensile strength. As it slams down, you watch as it crushes about 40 or so various skeletons below, and from that blast, you can see something on the interior of it was apparently explosive or flammable, and it explodes, giving a brief flash of light into the center of this cavern. Where you had the brief outside of your visual range, you now look around and see the entirety of these dozens of catwalks and the city below you. Hundreds and hundreds of roving skeletons and mostly decomposed, mummified dwarven corpses that all glance towards this explosion. Some have been blasted away from it by the impact of the detonation. Others are making their way towards what the strange sound was, drawn towards it, but you're keeping this central safe space between, where none of them can grasp or assail you.
Laura: Were there other buildings like that, ready to fall from the ceiling?
Matt: Currently, what you see is just the one.
Liam: I'm looking for gaps or holes or anything in the ceiling of this cavern or anywhere to get out. MATT; You see entrances to homes that are built into the sides.
Sam: What about a tunnel or anything?
Matt: Make a perception check. Anyone who has darkvision can make a perception check.
Marisha: I have keen sight. Does that count?
Matt: You have advantage on your perception.
Marisha: Oh, shitty and shittier.
Liam: 27.
Travis: 18.
Laura: 18.
Sam: I didn't do one.
Marisha: 28.
Sam: I'm weeping over Simon 2.
Matt: Oh. Your keen eagle vision-- wait, you said you rolled shitty and shittier and still got 28?
Marisha: I have a plus 13, plus advantage.
Matt: Right. All right, cool. So glancing through your eagle vision, you can see the top of the chamber almost seems to come to a conical shape, and as you look up to the top of it, it emerges into a completely vertical chamber that rises up and out of the central opening of the city of Thomara.
Sam: Let's go.
Marisha: I take the lead, I guess. (caws)
Laura: (shushes) Caw quietly.
Liam: Vax is trying to appreciate his last ride.
Travis: Debbie Downer.
Liam: No way! I'm not going to stop. Fuck you all. Every game until the end, motherfuckers!
Matt: As the group of you make your way up into this vertical cavern, we're going to take a break. I need to take a break, myself.
Travis: Remember, we have the--
Travis: Sponsored announcement.
Matt: That's right. We have the Shadow of War video coming up at this break to give you a glance at this game coming up that we're all part of. If you haven't seen it, or if you have seen it, check it out, anyway. It's pretty awesome. Also, for this week's giveaway, Wyrmwood, we've got a little video for you here to show you what's up and what you can do and try to win it at the break, so pay attention, stick around, and we'll see you guys here in a few minutes.
Liam: This is what's up!
Travis: Yeah! [break]
Matt: Hello, everyone, and welcome back. All right, so last we left off, you guys were all traveling upward through various means of flight, through a peak in the central cavern chamber in the center of Thomara, the long-dead dwarven city. As you begin to climb upward through this 15-foot-wide or so upward hallway, this cylindrical cavern, you continue upward for about 50 or so feet since passing through the ceiling of this chamber, and then it opens up into a domed room. Immediately, as you fly up, you see a ceiling come up, and you have to coast off to the side. You catch yourself, hovering there as the rest of you guys make your way in there. This domed, mushroom-shaped chamber with a very thin, circular floor around the outside with the hole that you entered at the bottom. Whoever would stand on the edge there would have the opportunity to either leap into or toss something down into this hole that would then drop them right into the center of the city.
Taliesin: Weird question  if I were holding the blue gem and had dropped it down this hole, what would be the likelihood it would have ended vaguely where it ended up?
Matt: Not at all. It was a ways off.
Taliesin: Just checking.
Laura: Are there any undead around us right now?
Matt: Currently? Glancing around, you do not see any undead.
Marisha: You said things or people? Is this a body-sized hole?
Matt: No, it's about 15 feet wide. The full chamber is maybe 50 or so feet across. About a 20-foot walkway, circular, before the hole in the center.
Liam: Did you say the hole is a natural gap in the cave, or does it look made?
Matt: If you glance down and look about the interior of this chamber, it is not natural. It is all carved.
Laura: Can we look at the gem for a second, since there's no undead around?
Matt: If you want to. Grog has it.
Travis: Do you want me to pull it out?
Laura: Yeah. Can you do an arcana check on it?
Sam: Sure. I can look at it.
Laura: How big is it? Is it baseball-sized?
Matt: It's about that big.
Travis: No undead, right? No creatures, nobody that's going to (whoop) to the shiny blue light?
Laura: We can't see anything around us?
Matt: Not at the moment, no.
Sam: I remove the handkerchief. I look at it. I inspect it like a jeweler inspecting a jewel. 18 arcana check.
Matt: Okay. It's definitely magical. The blue light from it grows stronger, then weaker. Stronger, then weaker. It has this rhythmic flash to it, like a heart or something that has a pulse to it.
Marisha: How is it lining up towards the steps of the giant?
Matt: Not at all. It's much quicker.
Marisha: Much quicker.
Matt: It's cold to the touch.
Taliesin: Does it do anything to the Titanstone Knuckles?
Liam: Is it faster than my heartbeat?
Matt: It's slower.
Liam: Slower.
Travis: That's slow.
Marisha: So it's very slow, but not as slow as the rate he's walking.
Travis: Is it a cut jewel, or is it rough?
Matt: It's rough. No jeweler's hand has touched it. There are some edges that have flat surfaces; it looks like there have been things that have chipped off the stone.
Taliesin: Does it have the vibe of something petrified?
Matt: No, it has almost a quartz-like look to it. Elements of it appear to be cloudier or imperfect, and some areas appear to be clearer, and light shines through a little brighter.
Liam: It's like a hunk at the natural history museum of minerals.
Matt: Yeah, but there is an enchantment.
Sam: What about Pikey-pants? Can she detect if it's evil or good or something? Does she do that?
Laura: You should do that.
Liam: I'm going to do that.
Matt: Okay. You don't get a sense of any evil from the stone.
Sam: You said no sense of evil?
Matt: No evil coming from the stone.
Laura: Okay, I'm going to gaze into it super hard.
Matt: You look really hard into the stone as you hold it to your face, and your eyes almost cross as you glance into the very core source of this pulsating arcane energy. It's bright.
Laura: So bright, y'all.
Matt: It hurts a little bit, and you wince after a while.
Laura: I saw so many things.
Liam: She looked at the eclipse, too.
Travis: We don't have Identify or anything like that, do we?
Marisha: No.
Sam: No.
Laura: You know who had that?
Sam: No, who?
Laura: Our good friend, Tary. He was wonderful.
Sam: Who is it? Oh, the fancy fellow? He's probably dead somewhere.
Travis: I think we should try and smash it.
Sam: Don't you think that about everyone and everything?
Marisha: I'm not against this idea.
Travis: What else are we going to do to it before we face El Vecna?
Taliesin: My only other thought of how it could be useful, at this point, with what we know about it--
Sam: Is "El Vecna" Spanish for Vecna?
Travis: Sí.
Taliesin: It seemed like the undead were crowding towards it, which means that if we do get attacked by a group of undead, we might be able to shiny-object them, unless, of course, it's dangerous in their hands.
Travis: Or we spike it down the hole, and it causes a hydrogen bomb, and we shatter this titan in half.
Taliesin: That literally made the dungeon master laugh, so I don't know if that's necessarily--
Travis: It's blue, right? That is the color of hydrogen.
Taliesin: That's the color of Dr. Manhattan. I don't necessarily know if it's the same thing.
Travis: It is known.
Sam: Why don't we hang onto it for now? In a moment of peril, we can throw it or smash it.
Taliesin: Not crazy, trying to crack it.
Liam: What if it stops this thing where it stands? We're all thinking that this thing could be its heart.
Sam: Its heart?
Travis: It's palm-sized, right?
Taliesin: It could be a chunk of heart.
Laura: Is it the same color as his Knuckles?
Travis: No, these are stone-gray. This is blue crystal.
Matt: There's nothing about it that gives you the sense, based on what you've seen both outside and within the titan, that it is of similar essence to the titan, from what you understand.
Travis: It could be a soul or something.
Sam: Soul glow?
Travis: Does Pike have anything that detects a soul?
Liam: It's not evil. It's not good. It could be the thing that's keeping these undead moving.
Travis: Well, then I don't know what else to do. I think we keep moving.
Liam: I like the spiking idea.
Laura: I'm okay squishing it with the hammer.
Liam: I think that you should let me squish it, because if that blows up--
Laura: I think it's funny that we spent so much time getting it, and then we're going to destroy it.
Liam: We spent ten minutes getting this thing.
Travis: We'll think about smashing it when we take our rest. Maybe a cause will reveal itself.
Taliesin: Hold onto it for now. It could come in handy.
Marisha: It's like that dress you bought four years ago you still haven't worn. It might find a purpose.
Sam: All right, focus!
Laura: Let's get out of this dome.
Travis: Is there any writing or engraving or runes on the edge of the circle that's been engineered?
Matt: On the edge of the circle? No. It's smooth stone, intently designed to be a drop or opening of some kind.
Taliesin: Are there exits?
Matt: Make an investigation check. You don't see any doorways or passageways.
Marisha: Wait, there's not a hole that we can go up?
Matt: There's a hole that you came through to come into this chamber. Imagine a dome. You're in the chamber.
Taliesin: I literally rolled a one. I'm aware that there's a hole.
Matt: You get vertigo as you stand in the chamber.
Laura: Is this investigation or perception?
Matt: You look about, and you don't see any exit. Investigation to see if there's any hidden or not-immediately-noticeable exits or entryways.
Laura: 23.
Matt: 23. As you do a pass around, looking closely along the wall, you see two small domed doors that have metal rods jammed through, almost like a small barricade that's been placed down on one side of a doorway. However, they are closed from this side.
Laura: So you could open them up?
Matt: You could.
Laura: Are they trapped? I'll look to see if they're trapped.
Liam: On it.
Travis: Also fair to assume that whatever's on the other side of that door--
Liam: 27.
Matt: 27?
Laura: I rolled an 18.
Matt: You're both looking at the same one?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: Neither of you notice any traps.
Laura: All right, then I'm going to try to jimmy open that lock.
Travis: Whoa.
Laura: I already said it.
Matt: Make a strength check.
Liam: Not locked.
Laura: Two! Wait. Yeah, that's straight-up strength, not a saving throw? Two!
Sam: Two?
Laura: I'm really fucking weak. You'd think I'd be stronger pulling the bowstring, but no.
Travis: Use your legs. Really, use your legs.
Laura: Okay. I put my legs up on the wall and (grunts).
Matt: It is not budging.
Liam: Can I use my finger skills to see if it's locked? Just my finger skills. I made a perception check to see if it's trapped. Wouldn't I know if it's locked?
Matt: The lock is the barricading mechanism on it. There is no handle.
Liam: I'm going to try to sidestep this lock with my lock-picking skills.
Travis: It's a barricade.
Marisha: It's a barricade.
Liam: There's nothing to do?
Marisha: It's like steel rebar in front of the door.
Travis: Is there any decorating or writing or scratching around the door frame or wall around the door? Anything other than a portal to go through?
Matt: Not from what you can see, no. The room's pretty simple. The construction of it may be older than most of the things that you've seen in the city below and previous chambers. It seems to be built almost for function rather than ceremony.
Laura: It's a trash chute.
Marisha: That's what I was going to say. Is it a water chute? Drainage? Is this a drain pipe?
Laura: We could fill the city with water. Drown all the zombies.
Matt: One thing you do notice, which is interesting as you're glancing around at the side, looking at the ground at the bottom of it, there's a very faint groove in the ground that leads toward the central hole at the base of each of these doorways.
Marisha: Does there appear to be any other type of chutes coming into this room?
Matt: No, just the two doors on the opposite sides.
Travis: How far apart are the doors?
Matt: Opposite sides of the chamber, yeah.
Taliesin: So there's a bar. The door is barred, then?
Matt: Correct.
Taliesin: So break it. Let's get out of the way and pop the bar. See if we can pop the bar right off the door.
Travis: Do we want to have Keyleth there in case 900 undead zombies start pouring through, and she can Wall of Stone the door?
Marisha: I'll be with you. Yeah. I'm right behind you, man.
Travis: I will try and remove one of the doors. I don't know how to delineate between them.
Taliesin: The left one.
Travis: Sure. Yeah. It's a circle. That one. 25.
Matt: 25. It immediately comes off to the side, and when you lift it, you realize that it's bolted to the wall to the side, and it curves upward and holds it in place. This is meant to stay in place.
Laura: Wow. Really? It was meant to move? I think I loosened it for you, Grog.
Travis: I didn't get that sense at all.
Matt: As you lift it up, the door is now unbarred.
Travis: Shall I?
Laura: Yeah, open the door!
Travis: Are the hinges on this side so it looks like it opens towards me?
Matt: It looks like it opens towards you, yes.
Travis: I'll pull open the door.
Marisha: I'm at the ready for whatever.
Matt: Okay. We'll say as you entered and landed, the door on the left. Okay, so as you pull that one open, immediately preparing yourself, a couple of rocks tumble out, and it reveals a packed-tight mass of earth and stone.
Laura: Shit! Let's try the other one.
Travis: Should I punch the rubble?
Laura: No, let's try the other door first.
Travis: I make my way around.
Taliesin: We set ourselves up.
Travis: 20 on the dot.
Matt: 20. (metal creaking) It lifts over without an issue. Pull the door open. You lift it open, and a few rocks tumble past, but a slick rockslide incline continues upward, dry, no water. Nothing.
Travis: A rockslide continues onward. Slick, dry.
Laura: How big is the tunnel?
Matt: It's about four feet wide or so.
Laura: So we can fit in?
Matt: Yeah, you can fit in.
Taliesin: We have some Immovable Rods.
Matt: When I say slide, I mean smooth stone, like an actual slide. You get the sense that there was some sort of aqueduct-type scenario.
Laura: We brace ourselves on the wall to make sure we don't slide down.
Taliesin: Whoever's in the back should have the Immovable Rods, so if there's a sudden rush of water, we can create a grate for ourselves.
Matt: You envision that at one point, long ago, this would have been a beautiful waterfall in the center of Thomara's chamber that has now dried.
Travis: Dope. That's awesome. I'm getting creepy as fuck now. I've got the Immovable Rod; I'll be the caboose.
Marisha: I've got the other one, so I'll be second.
Matt: So Grog is the caboose.
Marisha: Keyleth in front of Grog.
Matt: Keyleth in front of Grog? All right. Who's in front of them?
Sam: Me.
Matt: Scanlan.
Laura: Pike.
Matt: Then Pike. All righty.
Taliesin: Myself and the twins, I suppose.
Laura: Yeah. I want to be in the front.
Travis: I'll go ahead and take the Immovable Rod out and have it in my hand.
Marisha: Samesies.
Matt: So you've got both of those. Oh, I totally forgot there was a winner for this. I'm sorry. I should do that, huh? RyanBoo, you're the winner. Danoba will contact you and get you your cherry deck box soon. Now that's taken care of. You make your way up the slide, and it's relatively gradual; it's not too heavy of a scenario. You make your way upward, upward, and about 30 or so feet up, the walls of it separate out and appear to break into two smaller chambers, like this was a breaking point where a person could enter from either side to check on the flow or do maintenance on whatever the ducting was. The slide continues upward. Vax and Vex, you get to that portion and lift yourselves up, looking right to left. It ends on one side, and it looks like there's some dry-rotted wooden crates, and to the left, a staircase.
Marisha: So it looks like a landing?
Matt: It's a brief landing for somebody who needed to come in and do repairs, maintenance, or checking on the flow of water.
Laura: Keep going up the slide or take the stairs?
Liam: Quick glance in the crates?
Marisha: No, if you're going to take a quick glance, then we have to bust them open like a proper RPG.
Travis: They're dry-rotted. They'll break easy.
Matt: They will. What do you do?
Liam: Check them out. I eat some edamame.
Matt: So you lift the crates. There are only two of them, and they're relatively small: two feet by two feet. The first one, you open up and look inside, and there are rusted tools. Long iron bars; some appear wrench-like. It looks like whatever mechanism was used as the early aqueduct system for this, this box contained materials, though you're uncertain as to what their application was into this system.
Taliesin: I'll take a glance at these things to memorize their general shape.
Travis: After you're done with them, I'll actually take them.
Matt: You go and grab a few. There's five rods of varying widths. Some appear to be ratchet elements, where they fit around different metal caps. There's one that looks like a wide crowbar that's used to hold or wedge elements separately. Very basic; nothing too intricate.
Taliesin: This is some basic shit that you're picking up right now.
Liam: That was the first crate. What's the next crate? Is it whoopee cushions?
Matt: No, the next crate you open up and it looks mostly empty, but it looks like there are a couple of rows of small glass vials, half of which appear to be broken or shattered, but there are three remaining, with a faint bluish liquid on the inside.
Laura: Does that sound familiar to us at all?
Liam: Healing potions are blue.
Matt: These don't resemble healing potions, actually.
Taliesin: Do these resemble underwater breathing?
Matt: They do. You've seen these before.
Liam: For toilet diving.
Taliesin: Emergency, yeah. Let's take those.
Travis: Okay. I got them.
Liam: I give one of them to Percy for being so sharp. I give one to my sister. You don't need it. I keep one. No, I don't. I'm barely alive. I give one to Scanlan.
Sam: I give it to Grog.
Travis: I've got one. I've got two, actually.
Sam: All right, then I'll keep one.
Taliesin: Just in case.
Travis: I've got two vials of underwater breathing.
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: Why is there no water running?
Travis: Any other boxes to smash?
Matt: No.
Marisha: I'd imagine because he's vertical now instead of horizontal.
Travis: And undead.
Sam: Let's keep going up the stairs.
Matt: All right. Heading up the stairs in the same order?
Liam: 30 to 40 feet in advance.
Matt: All righty. 30 to 40 feet in advance? Okay. You make your way up the staircase. Roll stealth.
Travis: Immovable Rod's out.
Liam: 28 for stealth.
Matt: Okay. Are you stealthing, as well? Are you going along with him, or are you letting him go ahead?
Liam: She's coming.
Laura: Natural 20.
Matt: All right, so the two of you very quietly make your way ahead, the rest of you keeping within, I assume, the range of the ring. The staircase doesn't go too far; it goes maybe 30 or so feet, and then it opens into a hallway. You're stepping up through the floor, and there's about ten feet behind and to the sides of you. There's a slight element of a cave-in to the left of you, where part of the stone seems to have collapsed, and a bit of the earth has filtered in. It's a smooth stone floor that's tiled in places. The walls continue on, a somewhat trapezoid-like angle. There are other portions of the wall that have caved in on certain elements, and there are two large pillars that mark the center of this hallway, either used as support beams or decorative, but they go from ceiling to floor. You glance over the side, and you see a distant staircase on the far end of this hallway, maybe 80 to 90 feet from where you are, if not further, with larger stairs. You've seen some of the dwarven-based ones. These seem to be a little more grandiose as they lift up higher and higher. Part of that hallway is completely collapsed; it's a wall of fallen earth. But there's a hole carved out of it. There's a tunnel that has been pushed through. You hear this very faint buzzing sound. Very faint. This (low humming). A very faint vibration. You also see a figure stepping from a side wall crevasse, an opening of a similar shape to the circular opening in the wall.
Liam: I hide.
Laura: We were stealthed.
Matt: You guys were stealthed. You re-hide, while stealthed.
Liam: That's what I do.
Matt: You hear some muttering across the way in the shadow. There's a faint source of light that looks like a glowing orb that's floating in the air above and giving this faint greenish-white light; a bauble that's giving a light source to whatever this cloaked figure is. You hear the muttering, and two more walk down the staircase to join them. You recognize, from the faint bit of light, a glimmer of metal around the neck of one of them that is the symbol, the hole with the metallic fork. You see Remnants of Vecna.
Sam: Remnants?
Matt: You don't see any faces. You see a glimmer or shine on the metal from the light cast from the bauble.
Marisha: What?
Taliesin: What?
Taliesin: This can't be happening right now.
Liam: We don't recognize faces? We don't see faces?
Matt: You see hooded figures that are walking in. There are three of them.
Marisha: Oh, so they're cultists.
Matt: Okay. So which ones are you aiming at? There's three of them.
Laura: I'm aiming at the first one I saw.
Matt: Okay, the first one you saw just stepped out of the center of the hall there, and then the two others walked down the hallway. You're aiming at the one that came out of the side of the wall?
Laura: Has he seen the two coming down the stairway yet?
Matt: There's been discussion over the shoulder. They seem to be aware of each other's presence, but they haven't come together to engage as three in the same area yet.
Liam: I will follow my sister's lead. If she attacks one, I send one to another one and two to the third.
Laura: I'll attack the first so he can take the second.
Liam: One. Two, three.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: All righty.
Laura: These are auto-crits, though, because we are surprising them.
Matt: This is true.
Laura: Can I Hunter's Mark him?
Matt: Yes, you can Hunter's Mark him.
Laura: Oh, so we don't have to roll for attack? It's an auto-crit.
Matt: Well, no, you still have to roll to see if you aim. You have advantage on the attack.
Laura: 27.
Liam: 27 on my first.
Matt: Okay, both hit.
Laura: Second attack. Oh my god, 20. 20 on the second attack.
Matt: Okay, that hits.
Laura: I got a one on both. Thank god they were both at advantage.
Liam: 27. 19, 25.
Matt: Okay, all three hit.
Laura: And they're all critical?
Matt: No, the first one crits.
Liam: Oh, really? Okay. The first is sneak attack.
Matt: They're not all crit. Once you hit the person they are no longer surprised.
Laura: Okay, so the first one is a crit. Solid! That's okay.
Marisha: Yeah, I feel so bad for you.
Liam: You are the most powerful person at this table.
Laura: 14, plus six lightning damage. Oh wait, you know what? Should I single out the lightning damage or say what all the damage is?
Matt: Well, it's an auto-crit, so lightning damage is doubled, as well.
Laura: So it's 12 lightning damage.
Matt: Right, plus whatever your sneak attack damage is.
Laura: Okay.
Taliesin: Yeah, that's happening.
Travis: You already did 40 point of damage without doubling.
Laura: Don't do that.
Sam: Travis, shut up! These two and their gigantic damage rolls.
Taliesin: Huge, mammoth.
Sam: Huge, bulbous.
Taliesin: Turgid.
Laura: I had already rolled that, but it was a six again, so 40, plus 12 lightning damage. On the first.
Matt: 52 points of damage.
Liam: I got 48 on my first, but that's it. 48, done.
Laura: I didn't do Hunter's Mark damage on that first guy.
Matt: This is on the other guy; the second guy.
Laura: Add ten because of Hunter's Mark on the first one.
Marisha: Little bit of that reach around.
Sam: The dice smell a little bit.
Liam: 48. 20, ten.
Matt: So 48 on your critical.
Liam: That's the critical. That's the dice damage. I rolled really low.
Matt: 20, ten. Okay, then. All righty. Are you shooting the same guy, Laura?
Laura: Yes, I was all on one, unless he went down. Would I notice?
Matt: No, he did not go down.
Laura: Okay, then the second one. 21 on the second one.
Matt: That does it.
Travis: How much damage? Total.
Matt: Total on that round from you would have been 110 with the first hit between the two of you on the first guy and the second hit. So the one that was off to the side, who is leaning forward, hunched over, and looking over his shoulder. The first arrow goes into the throat and he reaches for it, and as he does, the dagger (impact) into the face, into the socket where there is no eye, which then looks up with a groan. Finger goes out as soon as the second arrow takes the other eye out, and then falls back down to the ground, dead. Pointing your direction like (gasping). As soon as the two other daggers go into the other two, they both see the one crumple to the ground, the two left there, the guy who is standing at the stairs--
Liam: May I also dump some poison?
Matt: Sure, into which one?
Liam: Into the first one. I did one into my first target and two into the second; the poison would have gone into the second person. It's a DC of 15.
Matt: All righty. DC of 15? Yeah, that succeeds. 16.
Liam: So nothing, right?
Matt: Nothing, yeah.
Liam: Balls!
Matt: As soon as the one crumples to the ground and the two other daggers into the other two that are there, they (grunt). They see the one fall. The one in the center of the chamber glances over his shoulder and says, "It seems I'm the lucky one. Odell, run back and tell that Viskorad found sneaky prey." The one immediately to the left begins to run up the stairs.
Laura: Can I shoot him again before he runs away?
Matt: Nope because you took your turn. This is their reaction.
Sam: Oh shit. You need help, Matt?
Liam: Initiative!
Matt: We're about to roll initiative, motherfuckers.
Laura: Sorry, guys. We did it.
Marisha: Viskon? We've heard the name Viskon before.
Sam: We've also heard the name Odell.
Liam: Yeah, Odell.
Marisha: Odell comma tell Viskon we have visitors. Wait, when did we hear Odell before?
Liam: I just know we've heard it.
Sam: There's been three Jamieson's in our campaign, too. Matt isn't an infinite fount of names.
Matt: Everyone else is still down the stairs right there.
Laura: I wonder if we should have let them talk for a second. Oh, well.
Liam: That's not our way.
Matt: Apparently not, as recent events have shown. So now, I need everyone to roll initiative.
Travis: Don't fuck me, Gil.
Laura: No, it's okay. I've got advantage.
Marisha: Don't let them leave. I agree with that.
Taliesin: Leave one of them alive, but don't let them leave.
Liam: Not good for Pike.
Marisha: Did everyone roll shittily?
Travis: No.
Matt: 25 to 20?
Laura: 23.
Travis: 21.
Liam: Get that long range. Get that runner.
Matt: 20 to 15?
Sam: 18.
Marisha: 15.
Matt: All righty.
Marisha: What's up, bro?
Liam: I'm not fast.
Taliesin: 13.
Liam: 13.
Travis: That's weird for you.
Taliesin: It's almost as low as I can go.
Matt: 13 for Pike? No, that's Vax. What's Pike?
Liam: Pike clocked in at four.
Matt: Pike is clocking in as Pike.
Liam: Yeah. Where's the remix of this song?
Taliesin: I know. (beatboxes)
Matt: All righty, so beginning of the round. Vex, you're up first.
Laura: Okay, I'm going to cast Grasping Vine around here, so he can lash up and try to catch that wizard, the cloaked guy that's running away.
Matt: What's he have to roll for that?
Laura: He has to roll a dexterity save above 15.
Marisha: Get it! Get it, son!
Matt: That's an eight. He is running up the stairs.
Laura: So it snatches his ankle.
Matt: And then drags him.
Laura: Backwards. Then I'm going to shoot him twice.
Matt: All right. Go for it.
Taliesin: Not that one. That one looks like he knows too much.
Laura: What is that? 32.
Matt: 32, that hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
Laura: 14, plus four lightning damage. I don't get sneak attack on this guy, though?
Matt: No.
Laura: Okay. 14, plus four lightning damage, and then I'm going to hit him again. That is also a 32. No, that's-- well, it's very high. 27? 28
Matt: 28. All right, that hits. Roll damage. Grog, you're up next. You're in the back of the marching order.
Travis: We're not up at the top, are we?
Matt: No. So you've got at least 25, 30 feet before you can get to the top there.
Laura: 12, plus six lightning damage.
Matt: Nice. All right, 36 points of damage in one round. The arrows (impact) as he is pulled through the rock and rubble by the Grasping Vine that is currently wrapped around him.
Laura: I am going to use my movement to stand behind this little pillar right here.
Matt: Okay, go for it. Grog, you're up.
Travis: As I hear the sweet melodical Miami Vice tunes of warfare being played, can I double dash up past my mates and into the fray?
Matt: Sure, so at 30 feet, it'll get you right at the edge of the stairs. Still have 20 more feet you can go.
Travis: Yeah, straight towards them.
Matt: All right, so that's there.
Travis: Then can I use dash to go the rest of the way?
Matt: To close the gap there? Sure.
Travis: Now, I only have my bonus action left, so can I go into a rage?
Matt: You may, yeah. All righty, so at that point you go into a rage.
Travis: That's my turn.
Matt: All righty, so now it is his turn.
Marisha: You have that guy? But this guy was the runner, I thought.
Taliesin: Yeah, but he's vined.
Marisha: Okay. He's currently grasped.
Matt: Okay, as soon as you rush up into his face, you hear the individual, the hood pulled back at this point. You see shaved entirely bald, older, late fifties to early sixties, missing one eye, but in that socket you can see a faint spark of arcane energy. Shouting out amongst the space, "Glory and reward is mine! Wraiths, go forth and devour, while I bring oblivion to them." As you rush up, is going to cast Wall of Force right in the space between there.
Marisha: Between him and Grog?
Laura: (singing) The space between.
Sam: (singing) Your wicked lies.
Matt: It pushes you back five feet, and now there is a Wall of Force that is blocking that side of the hallway from where he is.
Marisha: Him and the other guy? Or just between him? How big is it?
Matt: Sorry, the entirety of this chamber is the Wall of Force.
Marisha: Fucking fuckface.
Travis: What does Wall of Force do? Can I walk through that shit?
Marisha: Yeah, it just might hurt.
Travis: Will it?
Matt: As soon as the wall appears there, you see a slight short barrier that forces you back about five feet. You catch your back foot, and now as the barrier finishes shimmering, it's invisible. Looks like there's nothing there. He's grinning from there. He glances over to the right into the hole in the wall where his friend was earlier.
Travis: Which was that way, right?
Matt: As he glances over, he goes, "Odell, bring me the sphere." You hear the humming noise, the faint humming vibrational noise, now louder. That ends his turn. Actually, he is going to take a step back up onto the stairs there. Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: I'm up? What can I do?
Matt: You're 20 feet down from the staircase.
Sam: My speed is 25.
Matt: That'll get you right up to about there, with five-foot steps.
Marisha: Don't let them leave!
Sam: Oh god, this looks like a crazy thing.
Travis: (counting) 60 is how far away he is.
Sam: Wow. There's a Wall of Force. Do I see a Wall of Force?
Matt: You don't. You actually rush up, and it looks like it's an open hallway right now.
Sam: Okay. I see Grog in attack mode, right? I see these two bad guys. I will send a Lightning Bolt at somebody.
Matt: Which one?
Sam: Looks like I can't see this guy because there is a pillar in between, so the other guy.
Matt: That's true, so it'll be that guy. All right. You'll have to move off to the side, or else you're going to hit Grog with the Lightning Bolt. It's going to be hard. He's up a few steps, though. You could probably aim it above and hit him without Grog. I'll let you do that. As you get to the top, you release your bolt of lightning. (crackling noise) It arcs forward, and as it gets right above Grog, it hits something solid and splinters. No effect.
Liam: So this Wall of Force visually is floor to ceiling?
Matt: You don't know; you don't see it. He saw a faint shimmer because something pushed him out of this space, but right now you have no visual perspective. That's going to end Scanlan's turn, I believe. All right. The other guy, who is currently held by the vine that falls limp off of his body--
Laura: It falls limp off of his body?
Matt: Well, it doesn't wrap around or keep him held. Every turn, it can pull something towards it. He's going to glance over towards the side, listening to what the other, Viskorad, said. Okay. At which point, that humming gets louder and louder.
Taliesin: He had the map. If he built the map, there's a way out.
Matt: You watch as a two-foot-wide black sphere of void-like nothingness comes carving through the stone wall immediately to the left of you, Grog, leaving a completely disintegrated form roughly the shape of its sphere. It's coasting in towards and into your space.
Travis: It's a Sphere of Annihilation.
Liam: Yes, it is.
Taliesin: Oh shit, son!
Laura: Oh god!
Sam: Is someone controlling it?
Matt: So Grog, I need you to go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw.
Laura: Oh my god, roll so well! Do you get advantage?
Travis: I do. I have Danger Sense. It fucks you up. Yeah, it hurts real bad.
Sam: I see this happening, right?
Travis: 16.
Matt: 16, okay. You manage to duck out of the way as it enters the space, and you can feel this weird energy. Your beard is almost being pulled toward it, and the loud vibrating (vibration) hum before you. It's like staring into an absolute nothingness.
Travis: Take my life, but not my beard.
Marisha: Who looks like he's controlling it? Odell?
Matt: The guy who is being pulled by her is concentrating and moving it over, at that point.
Laura: Oh, the guy in red? The guy in red is controlling it!
Matt: All right. That's going to end his turn. Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: (yells)
Matt: I've got to rest for a second. Controlling enemies hurt. It's okay.
Sam: We can get dudes behind you to hold you up.
Matt: We'll see how I can do it. Keyleth, your turn.
Marisha: Oh my god. So much has changed from what I thought I was going to do.
Matt: You're about 25 feet down the staircase.
Marisha: Yeah. So I come up from the staircase.
Matt: Okay. That gets you up to the edge there, where the staircase stops.
Travis: Does the Sphere of Annihilation get an attack of opportunity if I run away?
Taliesin: Probably not.
Sam: Is it a thing? Is it a weapon?
Matt: It's a black sphere of void. One of the guys is looking focused, concentrating on it, and it moved under his willpower in the direction of Grog.
Travis: It's real bad.
Marisha: Okay. I'm going to come up. I'm trying to think of what I have in range, and I'm terrified. And I'm going to stick with my original instinct and do Wall of Stone and try and wall these guys in so they can't run. I think they can still carve through it with their big black death orb now.
Travis: They can, but at least they'll be here.
Taliesin: They'll have to move the orb to do that.
Marisha: Okay. I can do ten ten-foot by ten-foot panels, so I want to be a semicircle block off, bring up a whole wall of stone behind them.
Matt: Okay. Hold on a second.
Travis: Who can get to the other side? You have Dimension Door. But that's it, right? That's the only person that has that kind of a thing.
Matt: As you attempt to concentrate and create a Wall of Stone, you are unable to pick a point or an area beyond the barrier.
Travis: The Wall of Force? No!
Laura: Say it again?
Travis: And you need to focus, or is it a random?
Matt: It doesn't fizzle the spell. You have no area to release it on. The barrier, while invisible, is preventing targeting a specific area to create.
Taliesin: We need to dispel this shit.
Marisha: I do have Dispel Magic.
Matt: You've used your action to attempt it. You didn't lose the spell slot, but you spent your action attempting it.
Travis: Hey, man. That was a nice try.
Marisha: Can't cast through it.
Laura: Good to know. But the orb went through it?
Matt: No, the orb is on the other side.
Marisha: Even though it's a nature thing, going up underneath there, I can't get around it? No?
Matt: You're targeting on the other side of the wall. It has to be in visual range for you to create it to happen.
Marisha: (singing) I'll see you on the other side of the wall. (laughter)
Matt: All right. That's Keyleth's turn. No, sorry. At the end of Keyleth's turn, you hear this (breathy noise) sound as these two shadowy figures emerge from the nearby walls.
Liam: Ghosts! Shadows!
Travis: No. What? Ghosts or wraiths?
Marisha: Wraiths.
Liam: There's ten different kinds of things like that.
Marisha: Hey, was wraiths what fucked me and you up when we were evil Vax and Keyleth?
Taliesin: Oh shit, and look what they're doing!
Matt: This one hovers over and lands behind Keyleth. And it's going to attempt, as it seems to shift through the pillar--
Marisha: I look over my shoulder and go  Oh no!
Matt: This one here stays within the pillar, and it reaches out, as it's incorporeal, and strikes at you. That is 24 against you, Vex.
Laura: That hits.
Matt: All right. You suffer 21 points of necrotic damage, and I need you to succeed on a constitution saving throw.
Liam: Fuck! Come on.
Travis: My fucking god!
Sam: It's a 20? (screaming)
Matt: All right. Well, you suffer the 21 points of necrotic damage, and your maximum hit points are reduced by 21.
Laura: Forever?
Matt: Until you finish a long rest. The other one's striking at you, Keyleth. That is a 16.
Marisha: Misses!
Matt: That's right, because your AC is 17 with the ring.
Marisha: That's right! I leveled up, motherfuckers!
Matt: All right. Cool. Technically, leveling up didn't affect your AC; however, calculating the magic item did.
Marisha: But I feated, so I'm good!
Matt: I know. So as it swings toward you, its claw streaks out and has no effect. And then they both vanish. You want to take an attack of opportunity? You can if you'd like to.
Marisha: War Caster?
Matt: War Caster. You can attempt to cast a spell on it as a reaction, if you'd like. This one's going to back away into the wall, as well. Vex, you also get an attack of opportunity if you'd like, with a melee weapon.
Marisha: Does it have to be a bonus action?
Matt: No, it can be an action. That's part of the War Caster feat.
Laura: I have a dagger, but I don't even have it drawn.
Matt: Then yeah, you're fine.
Liam: They're both out of visual range, right?
Matt: They both are now backing up.
Liam: One's in a pillar, and one went through a wall. Are they moaning and shit, in the wall?
Matt: You can't hear them.
Liam: I can't hear them. Can't see them, can't hear them. All right. Thanks.
Matt: No worries.
Laura: I have resistance to necrotic damage, by the way.
Matt: You do! Then you take ten points of necrotic damage, and your hit points are only reduced by ten.
Laura: Okay.
Marisha: Sorry, I'm trying to figure out what would be a good idea right now.
Taliesin: I have no ideas for anything.
Marisha: I have never done this before, but I have it learned. I will Ice Knife it in its face. Ice Knife! Level one, you create a shard of ice, fling it at-- oh, it's a flingy-thingy. But it's 1d10 piercing damage, and then it explodes?
Matt: Okay. It's right next to you. She has the feat where she can cast the spell as a reaction when something comes at her. Just know that whatever you're hitting is right next to you. So if it explodes, does any radial damage, it might come back and hit you.
Marisha: No, hit or miss, the shard then explodes, the target and each creature within five feet of the point where the ice explodes. Oh. I'm fine. I'm doing it anyway.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and roll to hit.
Travis: And Scanlan's in five feet of her?
Laura: No, he's behind her.
Taliesin: Oh, for fuck sake.
Marisha: What's wrong with us?
Laura: Wasted all of our 20s on goods.
Matt: Tonight is ridiculous.
Marisha: One.
Matt: All right, so as you release the Ice Knife, it slams into the wall. No effect. However, it does still explode, right?
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: So it does what damage?
Marisha: 2d6.
Matt: 2d6 damage. So go ahead and roll 2d6. To both you and the creature?
Taliesin: Yeah, all creatures within range.
Marisha: Technically, reroll ones. Three, four, five, six, seven. Yeah, each creature. Hit or miss, the shard then explodes.
Matt: All right, so you take seven points of ice damage, and it hits the wraith. However, the cold damage doesn't seem to have as much of an effect as you would expect.
Laura: It's a fucking wraith!
Matt: That ends their turn. Percival, you're up.
Taliesin: I hear a whole bunch of commotion, so I'm going to pop my head up out of the hole and see what the fuck is going on.
Matt: All right. You glance up and get just beyond where Keyleth is, pushing past. You have five more feet you can move if you want.
Taliesin: Well, I'm coming up the hole. I take a look. Oh, sweet god. I'm going to take a shot at the guy I see up on the table there.
Matt: Okay, go for it.
Taliesin: That's better.
Matt: Which guy?
Taliesin: Yeah, the gray. And that's 28?
Matt: Okay. (gunshot) You fire a shot and watch as it detonates against some sort of invisible wall that you didn't see was there before, scattering helplessly against the space in the air.
Marisha: I hate this force field shit.
Travis: It explodes near my head, and I'm like Stop shooting into this thing!
Taliesin: I'm going to drop back down the hall.
Matt: All right, you get right back down to right there. That ends your turn, Percy? Vax, you're up.
Liam: Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to dance through to here, where I can see Grog and these guys, and I can see all my friends here, and I'm going to hold my action to attack anyone who comes right up to one of my friends within striking range.
Matt: Okay, good to know. Perfect. Ending Vax's turn, Pike's up.
Laura: Pike comes running up the steps.
Matt: She can get right up to here, and that's as much as she can move. She can still cast a spell if she wants to. She's going to cast Beacon of Hope for all of the allies within range, which is 30 feet.
Matt: All right, so that is everybody but Grog.
Laura: Sorry, Grog.
Travis: That's my fault.
Laura: That gives everybody advantage on wisdom saving throws and death saving throws, and any time you're healed, you regain the maximum number of hit points.
Sam: Even if we move out of the radius?
Matt: It affects everybody at that moment, and then you carry it with you.
Laura: Wisdom and death saving throws.
Liam: You got glitter-bombed with holy goodness.
Marisha: Wisdom and death plus what?
Laura: And full hit points when you get healed.
Taliesin: You don't roll; you get the max.
Marisha: Beautiful.
Matt: Okay. So ending Pike's turn brings us to the top. Vex, your turn.
Laura: Oh, great. Well, I've seen all the things explode. Fucking hell. I'm going to pull out my Vecna symbol, that necklace that we still had, and put it around my neck, because that fucking sphere is out and I don't know if it matters.
Matt: Okay, so you quickly throw it around your neck.
Laura: Do I still have control of the vine?
Matt: Currently, yeah.
Laura: Okay. And it's on the other side of the force?
Matt: This is true.
Laura: So I'm going to use it and I'm going to try to grab a hold of the guy-- the guy in gray is holding the force wall, right? But it probably is a concentration. The guy in red is holding the sphere.
Matt: Correct.
Laura: The guy in red is holding the sphere. I'm going to try to knock him down and see if I can break his hold on the sphere, maybe? Is that stupid?
Matt: He does not make his save. He isn't moved. It wraps around him and pulls him tight against the area where it is again, but it's barely shifted him, so he gets moved a few inches, but doesn't seem to affect him at all.
Laura: That's a bonus action. I still get an action.
Matt: Yep, and movement.
Laura: And movement. Oh god. I'm going to spread out. I'm going to come over here, maybe? Or here. Oh jeez. I don't know. I can't hit anybody! I'm going to wait. I'm going to hold my action until I see something getting through that fucking force wall.
Taliesin: Until there's something to hit.
Laura: So that I can attack him.
Matt: Sounds good. All right, Vex, that's the end of your turn. Grog, you're up.
Travis: I'm going to try and run through the Wall of Force. It's only five feet of my movement, and we'll see what happens.
Matt: All right, you slam face-first into a stone wall. Immediately, the anger fills through you, the familiar smell and taste of iron-like blood as you seem to have busted some element of your nose in the impact.
Travis: Probably some eyelids? Do I go anywhere? Not even an inch?
Matt: No.
Travis: What if I channel all the rage from my life, and I draw on the undead? Okay, cool. I'm going to turn around and run the other way.
Marisha: You didn't get through?
Travis: No, it didn't even give, apparently. (counting) 50, right there.
Matt: Okay. That ends your turn, Grog?
Travis: Yeah, that ends my turn.
Matt: This guy turns around and begins to make his way up the stairs and move double dash, and disappears up the stairs.
Marisha: (screams in frustration)
Travis: We can't do anything. Nobody knows Disintegrate or anything?
Marisha: Whose turn is it?
Matt: That finishes that guy's turn. It is now Scanlan's turn.
Sam: I'm going to take a few steps forward. I will inspire Grog, I guess.
Travis: Or yourself.
Sam: I'm okay.
Travis: Really? Okay.
Sam: I'll sing to him. (singing) Don't mess with that big black ball, it can really fuck you up. I really hate that big black ball, all it better do is miss you, make it miss you.
Matt: Oh my god, that was not my intent in creating this encounter. Take your d12 inspiration die.
Travis: Thank you.
Sam: And I guess I'll Dimension Door, try to go through the Wall of Force. We've tried this before, Matt. Who knows how this shit works?
Travis: And the previous ruling was it worked.
Sam: Yeah, but that could have been a gentle nod.
Matt: The wording is important on this.
Liam: I think the cultist shits his pants and his brain explodes. I think that's in the book.
Matt: I've had to look this up very carefully. With elements like this wall, it's a targeting thing. You cannot target something that is in full cover, total cover, which being behind a wall is. Teleportation, however, you're the target and Dimension Door and Teleport is unaffected by that.
Sam: Matt fucking hates this.
Marisha: Get the runner!
Sam: I don't know where the runner went.
Marisha: He went that way.
Sam: I don't see him, right?
Matt: You saw him run away, you just don't know where he is at the moment.
Sam: Can I gauge roughly how far he went down that hall? Do I see down the hall?
Matt: Not from where you were over there.
Sam: So I'm going next to the red guy.
Liam: Also, if you get out of range of Vex, Vecna knows all.
Laura: Oh yeah. Stay within 60 feet.
Matt: All right, so you Dimension Door there. That's your action.
Sam: That's my everything.
Marisha: We've got to take out these guys' eyeballs.
Matt: That's the end of your turn. At which point, Odell, who's standing there currently, is physically sweating, concentrating on this sphere right now. Looks over and sees you appear and goes, "Viskorad, the little one made it through!"
Sam: Who are you calling little?
Matt: At which point, you glance over your shoulder and you can see that the darting, cloaked one stops and spins and faces towards you.
Sam: That's not good for me, guys.
Marisha: It's not good for you, but it's good for us. Fuck them up!
Travis: Oh god.
Matt: That's as far as they can get. However, it completely disintegrates the central pillar. It is obliterated, like it lays with a top part and a bottom part, but wherever the sphere passes through, about a good six inches around it is turned to dust and is gone.
Laura: Oh my god, what if we fail these rolls?
Matt: He's then going to go back around--
Taliesin: No, he's grappled.
Liam: No, he's grappled.
Matt: No, it doesn't grapple. It just moves things toward it.
Marisha: You're confusing Entanglement with Grasping Vine. Two totally different things.
Matt: He's backing up, and he's looking over at the sphere, concentrating on it. You can see the beads of sweat pouring down his face, and he's glancing over nervously at you, but smiling at the idea that his friend is returning. That's going to end his turn. Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: Okay. Seeing Grog slam into that. Ugh, fuck. This is a pretty beefy spell, yeah? Force Wall? Should I do fifth or sixth level to dispel this? Okay. Fifth or sixth level? Sixth level. I'm going to Dispel Magic this wall.
Matt: Okay. As you focus and concentrate, you release the essence of the Dispel Magic, the burst of arcane energy casts forth, and falls harmlessly against the exterior.
Laura: It's a higher level.
Liam: It's a higher level.
Marisha: Higher than sixth level? The spell.
Matt: Didn't appear to have an effect on the wall.
Travis: Come on, maybe it needed to be something else.
Liam: No. He did what Scanlan does with Counterspell. He beefed it up.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: You can move.
Marisha: It's higher than seventh level? Did you have to roll?
Matt: No effect on it.
Taliesin: Okay, it's going to be okay. Everything's okay.
Liam: So about that long rest...
Marisha: I don't know now, you guys.
Laura: We're fucked.
Marisha: I move forward. I guess. I don't want to move that far forward. No, I don't move that far forward! (laughter)
Marisha: I don't want to die!
Matt: That finishes your turn, Keyleth?
Liam: (singing) I want you to be alive.
Liam: (singing) I want you to be alive.
Marisha: (singing) I want you to be alive.
Laura: Oh no, here they come.
Taliesin: Oh no, here they come.
Matt: They take minor damage being in the physical wall, but that's fine with them.
Liam: Boom, I attack! Sneak attack on the one near Keyleth.
Matt: Emerge. All right, so the one near Keyleth. Go for it.
Laura: What was I holding for? I was holding until I could attack something, or until I could get through the wall? I think it was through the wall.
Matt: The wall.
Liam: All right, 27 on that guy.
Matt: That hits.
Liam: Okay. So that is three, plus three is six, so ten. (counting)
Taliesin: If we can hit them, they're probably squishy.
Matt: You took out one of three between just two of your surprise attacks.
Liam: 34 for the first hit, and I have the second paladin attack, so if it's not dead, I will attack again.
Matt: Go for it.
Liam: That is eight for the second.
Matt: As it emerges from the wall, its blackened shadow form giving off small tendrils of dark black ether and abyssal energy, it reaches out to strike at Keyleth, and you immediately release two daggers in its direction. Both hit its form. It gives this pained sucking sound as you watch its beady, burning red eyes seem to blink in the pain, and it angrily lashes out at Keyleth, its form somewhat more disparate and unable to maintain a corporeal form.
Liam: When is Pike? Is it her turn? No? Okay.
Matt: No, she cast Beacon of Hope. So attacking against Pike. That is 21. What's her AC?
Laura: 23!
Matt: 23. It tries to strike at her, and she manages to take the shield and bash it away. The light from her mace arcing around causes it to flinch, and it actually strikes a little too wide. The one that's arcing towards you, Keyleth, that is fucking 16 again! Yeah, because it's plus six to hit. Okay. You dodge out of the way a second time. It's then going to move back into the wall over here. He's going to move back into the wall, as well. Both of you get reactions.
Laura: Pike definitely takes it. With her Mace of Disruption, she gets an extra 2d6 radiant damage.
Matt: All right, so roll an attack on that one.
Laura: That's a 21 to hit.
Matt: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
Travis: I am wickedly out of my element. I'm running from an 8-ball.
Taliesin: We've got to get everyone away from that thing.
Laura: 27 for Pike.
Matt: 27 points of damage?
Laura: Is it a fiend or an undead? So it has to have a wisdom save of 15.
Matt: If it has 25 hit points or fewer after taking the damage, which it does not. That one has not taken a whole bunch of damage. However, it did take a relatively decent hit, and you watch as she swings the mace out. As it pulls back, where the mace impacts, it seems to almost evaporate part of the shadowed form, and it shrieks as it disappears into the wall.
Liam: For clarification, that is the one I hit, as well, right?
Matt: No, the one that you hit is where she was.
Liam: Oh, Pike hit the other one.
Matt: Correct. Keyleth, are you doing anything as a reaction?
Marisha: Yeah, I'm going to pull out my staff and do a Burning Hands on him. Dexterity saving throw.
Matt: Natural 20, so it takes half damage.
Marisha: Half damage.
Laura: Ooh, that's good. You did the six and the four.
Taliesin: And then there was a third one.
Marisha: And then there's a third one that is a six? Was that right? Six and six is 12, so 16.
Matt: 16 points of fire damage reduced by half which is eight, and even that impact seems to be lessened by the wraith-like being seemingly absorbing some of the heat from the impact.
Laura: Radiant damage is the bomb!
Taliesin: Radiant damage is what we need in here.
Matt: All righty, that ends their turn. Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: I'm going to stay in my little cubby hole. I've got some good visual on a couple of these guys down here. I'm going to yell at everybody to get the fuck away from the ball. I'm going to hold my attack until something happens that's going to give me something to shoot at.
Matt: Okay, so as soon as an enemy reveals itself that you can shoot. Okay, that ends Percy's turn. Vax, you're up.
Liam: Fucking hell. I'm going to do the same thing except I'm going to move to here and wait for something to attack one of my friends.
Taliesin: That's awfully close to the ball.
Liam: I know it is. That's what I do. I'm waiting until one of them attacks one of my friends. One of the undead. I can't do anything about that. That's what I'm doing. That's my turn.
Matt: All right, Pike's turn.
Liam: Stupid, I know. That's what Vax does.
Laura: I can only do this as a bonus action so that she can have that up, right? Okay, she's going to cast Spiritual Weapon. Should she do it at a second level? Okay, she's going to cast Spiritual Weapon up near the wall as a giant sword that looks like it's on fire.
Matt: Whereabouts? On the wall here?
Laura: No, near the wall, yeah. Up close to the wall so that she can attack as soon as that thing is down. And then she's going to hold her physical action until there's something that she can attack.
Matt: Okay, she's holding her physical attack?
Laura: Yeah, her mace.
Matt: Okay, that ends Pikes turn. Vex, you're up.
Laura: Oh, that's me!
Matt: Yeah, that's you, actually.
Liam: You're Vex.
Laura: I'm Vex. I'm going to dart away from this ball as fast as I can, and I'm going to come up here.
Sam: Hey, you broke through!
Laura: I broke through the wall. I can't reach. I'm too fucking-- It's fine; I got it.
Sam: Make Matt stand up, Laura.
Matt: Please do. I appreciate it.
Laura: And I'm going to hold my fucking attack until something comes out that I can attack.
Matt: Okay. All righty.
Marisha: I can't believe I couldn't fucking dispel that wall.
Matt: Grog, you're up.
Travis: Yeah, I am, aren't I? Okay. Cool.
Laura: Wait, I have bonus action still.
Matt: You do.
Laura: Okay, I'm going to use that Grasping Vine that I still have up, and I'm going to re-grab onto that stupid guy's fucking neck and yank him towards the wall he's right in front of.
Matt: That's a 15. What's your DC on that?
Laura: 15.
Matt: He succeeds, unfortunately. It slaps out towards him and this time-- I forget the adage, but never mind. He dodges it. (laughter)
Liam: It took 425 hours, but we did it. We broke his brain.
Matt: Blame it on the painkillers. The vine whooshes out and tries to wrap around him. He dodges out of the way, and it slaps harmlessly against the stone and withdraws back into the small crack of stone where it's based. That ends your turn. All right, Grog.
Travis: I'm going to put my faith in Scanlan that some sort of impossible miracle happens. (counting) 30. Right up against the wall. Can I look to the left down that hallway? Can I see down there at all? Is it blocking the hallway off from vision? Is that a moveable space?
Matt: Looking off, it looks like the orb was being used to carve a path.
Travis: It hadn't finished doing it?
Matt: No. It was maybe 25 or so feet down and was hitting solid rock.
Laura: My spell DC may be higher. I don't know if I have increased that in a while.
Liam: It's eight, plus proficiency bonus, plus her spell bonus.
Laura: So my spell DC is 17.
Matt: You need to keep up on that, girl.
Marisha: That was how I lost to Grog in our battle.
Laura: I wanted it around his neck, just to make him annoyed.
Matt: It hits him against the wall. He's still glancing over his shoulder.
Taliesin: He's lost visual range of the ball?
Matt: No, he can still look over the rubble there.
Travis: Not enough to make a concentration check?
Matt: If that's what it does.
Travis: I'm there. I can't get into that hole anymore, can I?
Matt: Not with the way the Wall of Force is placed, no.
Travis: Fair enough. I will hold my action until someone comes within melee distance.
Matt: Okay, ending Grog's turn. At the top of the staircase--
Laura: Oh no! He's coming back for Scanlan!
Matt: This guy here, we'll say he got about that far from the stairs and continues that way.
Marisha: Sanctuary!
Taliesin: Like he's parting the Red Sea.
Taliesin: You shall not pass!
Marisha: You shall not pass!
Laura: Oh my god, we're going against Gandalf right now, you guys.
Taliesin: That's not Gandalf. That's a cosplayer.
Liam: Do you know many hobbits I have under my cloak?
Taliesin: Five hobbits in a cloak. That's all it is. It's not a wizard.
Matt: He glances down at the staircase where you are, and as he begins to smile, the flash in the eye begins to glow briefly, a pale comparison to Vecna, but there is an essence of energy lent to him from his worship of the newly risen deity. He begins to speak in a language you don't understand. And as he speaks one alien word-- how many hit points do you have?
Sam: A lot. 167.
Matt: Fuck, okay. I miscalculated. No effect.
Sam: Power Word?
Matt: Power Word  Stun. He assumed the smaller stature of the gnome was not as hearty.
Travis: He's upset that he miscalculated. The DM wants blood!
Liam: That's what he gets for profiling.
Matt: He's going to continue moving upward, 30 feet back up into the staircase as he keeps focusing on you. That's going to end his turn. You're up, Scanlan.
Sam: Hold on. I need to look up the range of a fucking spell. How far is he from me?
Matt: It's hard to tell at this point. You'd say somewhere between 50, 60, 70 feet.
Liam: I bet your spell is 120 feet, Sam.
Sam: I'm looking. That one's not.
Liam: Is it Thaumaturgy? Because that's right where your eyes are.
Sam: You said how far? Oh shit.
Matt: Between 50 and 70 feet from you.
Laura: You can move.
Liam: You can move.
Sam: Yeah, I'm going to move 25 feet towards him.
Matt: Okay, so that puts you up here.
Sam: And with my darkvision, do I get a sense for how far he is from me now?
Matt: Yeah, you'd say he's about 40 feet from you.
Sam: Fuck no, it's not. Shit, I need 30.
Laura: You can move five more feet. You've got more movement.
Sam: No. That's my movement. I have tiny little nubs.
Travis: Tiny little nubs?
Sam: Yeah.
Liam: What about long-range shit, man?
Sam: That's okay. Yeah, I've got longer-range shit, but it's not as bad news.
Marisha: Keep them from running away.
Travis: Damn it, Matt. Why'd you have to back up?
Matt: Because that tactically made sense.
Liam: Bigby's Hand him? Grab him?
Sam: I'm thinking. I'm trying to decide between two things.
Travis: Yeah, do it. Take your time, baby. Take your time. Taliesin, give him a backrub. Come on, let's focus up here. There you go. Support. Feel the love.
Marisha: This is all on you, man. This is all on you.
Travis: Do your thing. Listen, Shadow of War comes out October 10th. A lot of us are in it.
Sam: It's going to have a lot of wisdom. All right. I will Bigby's Hand. I assume he's got a lot of wisdom, so I will Bigby's Hand him. At level seven. And I will punch the shit out of him.
Laura: Punch him back toward us. Bigby's Hand on the opposite side of him and punch him back toward us.
Marisha: That's a good call.
Matt: All right, so that is 8d8 force damage if you hit. Roll a melee spell attack.
Laura: Inspire yourself!
Taliesin: Inspire yourself!
Sam: I didn't. I forgot. I rolled an 18.
Matt: 18 hits. He's a caster; he doesn't have a lot of armor.
Marisha: Kill him!
Matt: All right, so roll 8d8 force damage.
Taliesin: I have three.
Sam: And I've got one.
Liam: That's just some dude from Sea Org in a bathrobe. Punch him!
Taliesin: Wow, that was a deep cut.
Sam: Wait. Shit. What did I just roll? 16 plus four. That's 20. And then this is another-- 40.
Matt: 40 points of force damage.
Sam: 40 points of force damage.
Matt: All right, that's a 20 DC concentration check.
Sam: Yeah.
Travis: Come on.
Matt: 16. No.
All: Wall down!
Laura: Did we notice? Did we notice that the wall went down?
Matt: No, you don't see it.
Sam: I don't know. Right?
Matt: But Grog would feel it. Grog is sitting there waiting for something, as Bigby's Hand full-on sucker punches him in the body, and he slams against the steps and has to shake his head as he glances at the giant fist and down at you.
Sam: As a bonus action, can I do anything?
Matt: If you want to do a bonus action, you can't do Bigby's Hand again.
Sam: No, but can I throw something to see if it goes through the wall?
Matt: Sure. I'll let you do that. Roll an attack roll, just to aim it.
Sam: Sure. 17, plus I don't know.
Matt: What are you throwing?
Sam: Scanlan found these two really crappy daggers in the desk in the casino.
Matt: He pulls one of these jeweled daggers that he wore and throws it behind, and Grog, you watch as this dagger passes through.
Taliesin: I see that, and I take three shots at this fucker up here immediately. How far away is he?
Matt: Which guy? The who Bigby's Hand just punched? Okay, he is about 120 feet.
Taliesin: I'm going to use Bad News, then, because that is within range for my fucking sniper rifle. He's going to take that.
Laura: I'm going to shoot at the dude in red in front of me.
Taliesin: I can't use a bonus action, and I have to reload once, so I can only take two shots with my action. I can't take three. So two shots with Bad News. Here we go. That's a 25 and 27 to hit.
Matt: Both hit.
Taliesin: First shot is 22 points of damage. Second shot is not as good. 14 points of damage.
Matt: So as you fire those two shots, the echoing noise of Bad News's explosions echoes through the hallway and stairway above. Vex.
Laura: I'm going to sharpshooter him, the guy right in front of me.
Taliesin: There's a lot of noises going on in this place. I think it'll be okay.
Marisha: Oh, it's fine. There are tunnels collapsing and shit. It's fine. I'm not concerned about the noise at the moment.
Laura: 22 to hit?
Matt: 22 does hit.
Laura: 21 damage on the first. And then 19 on the second. That's also Sharpshooter.
Matt: Nice.
Laura: No, that's 19 to hit.
Matt: Gotcha. That hits.
Laura: 27 on the second.
Matt: All right, nice. The guy who's controlling the sphere, after the first arrow strikes him right in the chest, he looks and starts to run up the stairway, and as it does, you take aim with your second arrow and release it, and it hits the base of the skull. You watch him go down one of the stairs.
Taliesin: So the sphere is still there?
Matt: The sphere is still there.
Laura: But he doesn't have control over it anymore. This guy in red is down, so all that's left is the guy and the wraiths?
Taliesin: Was there a third guy?
Laura: We killed him. That was the first guy we killed.
Matt: That finishes Scanlan's turn, right?
Laura: Yeah, that was your turn.
Sam: Yeah, I'm done.
Matt: Keyleth's turn.
Marisha: Okay. I run up as far as I can, 30 feet. Do I see this motherfucker?
Matt: Yeah, you see him. You have a 60-foot range of darkvision?
Marisha: Or I see the glimmering of Bigby's Hand?
Matt: Yeah, I'd say you could probably see him okay. A little bit. It's very dark, but barely.
Marisha: Fireball! (laughter)
Taliesin: That's an answer.
Matt: As you rush up, from the edge of the staff, a bead of red light engulfs the hallway above in flames. You see a split second of him and Bigby's Hand's outlines before fire engulfs the space. Go ahead and roll damage on that. That's a natural 20 on his save, so he gets half damage.
Marisha: What the fuckballs?
Matt: I didn't even roll with advantage on that one.
Sam: You said Fireball on this guy? Bigby's Hand takes damage.
Marisha: Does he? Magical?
Sam: Yeah, he has hit points.
Taliesin: He could roll a save, though.
Sam: He could!
Matt: Let's check. Yep, it has no bonus, so you roll a d20 and see what you get.
Sam: 11.
Marisha: 29 points of damage.
Sam: It's fine. Bigby's Hand has 167 hit points.
Matt: Yeah, it has your hit points.
Laura: That's amazing!
Sam: Yeah, it's me.
Matt: That ends Keyleth's turn. He's still alive. This one's going to move through the hallway here.
Marisha: He's still going after my ass?
Matt: This one's going after Pike.
Liam: I get to attack. I've been holding.
Laura: Pike gets to attack. Pike has been holding her action to attack as soon as she could, too.
Matt: So Pike gets her attack, and so do you.
Laura: So 20 to hit on Pike.
Matt: 20 to hit? That hits.
Laura: Where is my other d8? Here it is. (counting)
Liam: When you hold, does bonus action carry over?
Matt: Nope, just the action.
Laura: So it's 22.
Matt: 22. All right. And what's the saving throw?
Laura: Saving throw is 15.
Matt: 15. Four, no. As it comes out of the wall reaching for Pike, she swings wide with the mace. As it slams into it, there's a flash of divine energy. Her eyes seem to pulse with a matching burst of radiant power, and as it hits, the creature squeals and squeaks as the light from the mace actually dashes it from this existence or any other. That is scattered into nothing from the shadows.
Liam: I rolled an 18 and a one.
Matt: 18 hits. One misses.
Liam: Okay, so sneak attack. One.
Sam: One misses?
Laura: I know, right?
Liam: 39 for the second attack.
Matt: 39 for the second attack. All righty. And with that, as this one reaches out towards Keyleth, your dagger strikes the back of its body, and as it impacts, you watch as its shadowed form turns into nothing but a splash of dark, half-existing ether, which then fades as your dagger clatters to the ground motionless.
Liam: Back to the belt.
Matt: All right. Percival, you're up.
Laura: Kill him!
Taliesin: Reload. Going to take another shot.
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: Going to take a shot. Yeah, let's take another shot. Probably got a low AC. Let's make this a sharpshooter, just for fun. Yeah. That's a sharpshooter shot, so that's a 24 to hit?
Matt: 24 hits.
Taliesin: All right. So let's do (counting) 26 points of damage.
Matt: 26 points of damage. (gunshot) The echo of the impact as you watch part of the lower jaw and throat of the cultist in the robe gets blown apart. He stumbles back onto the steps that he had barely started to get up off to and you watch and you hear the horrible coughing sound as his last moments of life are robbed of it as it tries to get back up and then stumbles right back and bleeds out against the steps.
Taliesin: We can still interrogate him. He doesn't have to be alive for that. Any other problems?
Liam: How's the ball doing?
Matt: It's hovering there in the center of the hall.
Laura: We can't do anything about that floating ball. Cover it with a handkerchief.
Marisha: You beat me to it, man.
Taliesin: Let's rifle through these guys' stuff. Which one do we want to interrogate?
Marisha: Keyleth goes up to the red robe.
Taliesin: Let's throw gray robe into the annihilation ball. Let's get rid of him.
Travis: Vax. Why don't you go down the hallway and see if anyone else is coming? Keep watch.
Laura: But stay within 60 feet. Everybody gather up around me again.
Liam: Sis, come up to where Scanlan is so I can go a little further ahead.
Matt: Everyone is barely still within 60 feet.
Taliesin: Everyone gather up. We're going to get our stuff.
Laura: Avoid the ball.
Marisha: Vax, can I borrow a dagger?
Liam: Yeah. I give her Whisper.
Marisha: I take it and I stab it in his other eye. Red robe guy.
Matt: Okay. (splat) Other eye is destroyed.
Sam: I'm going to use Bigby's Hand to grab the sphere.
Matt: Do you? Okay. Bigby's Hand reaches over and grabs towards the sphere, and as Bigby's form attempts to grasp the chaotic point of destructive energy, Bigby's Hand suffers 26 points of force damage and is forced to pull back.
Sam: That's not so bad.
Matt: But cannot grasp it. Cannot move it. (electrical shock)
Laura: I'm going to rifle through the robes of red robe.
Taliesin: I'm going to get Odell.
Matt: That's the one she's rifling through.
Taliesin: Oh, okay. There was a third guy, right, that they killed early on?
Matt: Oh, the first guy. Yeah. Okay, gotcha.
Taliesin: Assume we're going through everybody and taking their shit.
Liam: I'm standing as far from Vex as I can, but I can't go much farther because obviously-- yeah.
Matt: Okay. Interestingly enough, based on the current scenario and what preparation has been, no money on them. They have no worldly possessions that are what you consider of use. They each carry a gnarled wooden wand that they've been using as a focus for their spellcasting. Beyond that, they have nothing on them except for the one that you shot has, you notice the left hand is withered and gray, the skin is pulled taut against the bone. But beyond that, there is no other possessions on them, beyond the symbol of Vecna they wear around their throat.
Marisha: How many of those symbols do we still have, and how many robes do we still have?
Laura: Well, we can grab their robes, I don't know how many of those we have, but I think we also have a necklace.
Liam: Also, we can have Pickle talk to one of these arseholes.
Taliesin: I think that's a good idea.
Marisha: The guy that I'm standing over, red robe, I'm going to rip his necklace off.
Matt: Okay. You tear it off.
Laura: I'm going to take his robes.
Taliesin: Oh yeah, we're taking all this shit.
Matt: So you take every set of robes. And these robes are different from the robes that you had seen in Thar Amphala before. These appear to be a little more ornate. They seem to have a little higher station, which is why it's interesting that beyond the robes and some basic undergarments and the wand, they have nothing on them. They are a sheer conduit of their own power.
Taliesin: Were they drilling? I want to take a little bit of an inspection. Were they drilling with this thing? Is that why they had it?
Matt: Looking around the pathway, you can see that a lot of the staircase probably was more caved in, but has been cleared out by the movement of this orb. It's being used as a form of excavation tool as they push deeper into the catacombs here.
Marisha: So they were holding on to that orb the whole time.
Laura: Yeah, the guy in the red was controlling it.
Marisha: Yeah. He didn't cast it, though. We didn't see him cast that.
Laura: It came out of the wall.
Matt: Yeah, it came out of that little gap on the side there.
Sam: I'm going to go over to the sphere and say to it: I command thee to respect my authority and obey me as your new master.
Matt: Are you trying to exert your will on the sphere?
Sam: I'm intimidating the sphere.
Matt: Make an intelligence arcana check.
Sam: Intelligence arcana check?
Matt: Just an arcana check.
Sam: Oh! 19.
Matt: 19? And you're standing right next to the sphere to push your will into it?
Sam: Yeah, I came closer to it.
Matt: Okay. As you stand there, you focus on the orb, and you can feel your will push past the event horizon of the sphere. However, the force is too strong inside, and as you pull out of it instinctually, it moves towards you. (screaming)
Taliesin: Why did you have to tamper with the fundamental forces of nature?
Matt: Yeah. Ten feet. Which is right where you are, so I need you to make a dexterity saving throw.
Liam: Matthew McConaughey is going to reach out of it for you.
Sam: That's not good. 11.
Matt: 11?
Sam: Bigby, save me!
Matt: The orb pulls back and slams into the edge of his gnomish face and chest, and you watch as his flesh is pulled towards and disintegrated at the exterior of the sphere.
Laura: Can we reach down and grab him away from it?
Marisha: Yeah, Grasping Vine!
Matt: You take 30 points of force damage, and it's currently now right in your square, right up against you.
Laura: I use my Grasping Vine and I yank him away from it.
Marisha: Yeah, move away!
Matt: Okay. So you all push him out of the way and the vine pulls him.
Travis: Two-Face!
Matt: Yeah, you look a little rough.
Laura: Scanlan, you're hideous now.
Sam: Don't look at me! I'm fine.
Travis: Some other voice starts coming out of him.
Sam: I think I can take this thing.
Liam: "So did you want me to talk to one of these guys?"
Matt: You got the sense that there is a way to exert your will over it the way these guys did, but in that moment, your will faltered, and you didn't quite understand the nature of the sphere.
Sam: I just need to try again harder.
Marisha: Wait!
Laura: You got to roll higher than a 19. Can you give yourself inspiration?
Sam: This is an ability check, right?
Matt: This is an ability check, yes.
Taliesin: Wait, was that a wisdom saving throw?
Matt: No. It was an arcana check.
Travis: It might be high, dude. You might have to roll a 30.
Taliesin: Let's leave it. Tend to the sick and leave the well alone.
Travis: Indiana? Let it go.
Laura: Or Dominate that shit.
Sam: I'll try one more time.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: All right. Let's all back up.
Laura: I get ready with the vine to yank him away in case it starts moving toward him.
Matt: Okay. And everyone else backs up a little.
Marisha: Keyleth stares with a vague familiarity.
Sam: I'm going to inspire myself.
Matt: Okay. So make your roll first, as you begin to focus and exert your will towards it. You add it on to it.
Sam: Pretty good.
Laura: Now inspire!
Sam: And inspire?
Matt: Up to you.
Sam: Okay. Plus my what? Arcana?!
Matt: Yes.
Sam: Ooh, that's a lot. 30.
Matt: Okay. As you this time begin to push your will towards the sphere, you push past the event horizon, your consciousness connects with some--
Sam: (garbled) Listen to me, damn it! Respect my authority!
Matt: Some ancient space of the void within this blackened circle. As it connects-- What's your intelligence modifier?
Sam: Plus three.
Matt: Okay. What are you trying to will it to do?
Sam: I'm trying to will it to-- Shit, it's just a big black ball. Slam straight into the ceiling!
Matt: It moves up ten feet and then it hits, devours the stone above it to create this small tunnel right directly above.
Laura: Oh my god! You did it.
Sam: We can use it!
Taliesin: Finally.
Sam: Have you guys seen The Explorers?
Taliesin: I'm in The Explorers, motherfucker. I'm in The Explorers.
Sam: You are?! That's one of my favorite movies of all time! Can I get your autograph?
Taliesin: No.
Liam: Were you kidding? Are you really in The Explorers?
Taliesin: Yes! I'm really in The Explorers.
Liam: Stop the game!
Taliesin: I'm one of River's little brothers. I'm Ludwig.
Sam: Oh, wow!
Marisha: Yeah, he knew River through that.
Laura: What if we use the orb and go straight up? We don't even keep tunneling, we juat go straight up to the city.
Sam: It only listens to me.
Laura: Yeah. Do you need us to heal you or anything?
Sam: No, this is a cool thing.
Travis: Yeah, but it only makes a hole its size. It's two feet across.
Taliesin: I think he's not ready to pop a wheelie on this thing yet.
Travis: Plus, remember the guy was concentrating super hard, so it's the only thing Scanlan will probably be able to do.
Marisha: But if he cores out a tunnel for us, we can carry Scanlan like on a palanquin? Like We Are The Champions?
Sam: Guys, I think we can make it. No, we can't! We'll never make it! Yes, we can!
Liam: All I'm thinking is I could come up and do Lay on Hands and heals, but I'm like, you made your bed, lie in it.
Taliesin: Yeah, no. I'm okay with this.
Laura: What do you think? Do you want to go up?
Sam: We're still investigating these guys and stuff.
Marisha: Fuck these guys! We got all their shit. Let's go!
Sam: I'm going to call this ball Simon 3.
Travis: Do we know how far the sphere can move in a single movement?
Matt: You watched him push it, and it went about 15 feet.
Travis: The sphere can only move 15 feet.
Sam: It will slow us down.
Matt: It's a very slow-moving ball of destruction.
Taliesin: Bring the sphere back down so that we can throw their bodies into the sphere so that they don't turn into undead fuckwads.
Liam: Wait a second, though! God, I don't know what this will do. I have a spell called Zone of Truth.
Laura: So it forces them to speak the truth? Does it work on undead?
Liam: A creature that enters the spell's area for the first time. If it fails.
Laura: So you could cast it, and then Pike could cast Speak with Dead, and it would come up into the Zone of Truth.
Liam: That's right.
Travis: No, they have to tell the truth when you do Speak with Dead.
Liam: No, they don't.
Matt: They don't have to.
Marisha: They can lie.
Taliesin: Here's a weird question  what saving throw do they have to make to speak the truth?
Liam: An affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. So it could avoid the questions.
Laura: But they have to answer the questions.
Liam: But they have to answer the questions because of the other spell.
Laura: Right?
Sam: Double mumbo-jumbo?
Matt: It can't tell a lie, as you're discussing this. Technically, a creature would be unable to lie in the area.
Liam: Unable to lie, and with Pike's spell--
Laura: They have to answer the question.
Liam: They have to answer the question.
Matt: Let me double-check for you.
Taliesin: And what's the save?
Liam: Charisma saving throw against my spell save DC, which is not huge.
Marisha: What is it?
Liam: 16.
Matt: I mean, it does have to answer.
Liam: I like it.
Taliesin: Are we going to try this crazy shit?
Laura: Let's do it!
Marisha: Might as well. Okay, hang on, though! What are we going to get from this guy?
Laura: Find out how close we are to Vasselheim.
Taliesin: Yeah, what's the plan? What are they trying to do?
Liam: What has Vecna got cooking?
Taliesin: What's Vecna planning? How many of them are there?
Marisha: I'm going to go pee, you guys.
Liam: He might not know everything. How long does it take for Keyleth to pee?
Laura: No, but how close we are to Vasselheim? What's the plan of attack in Vasselheim? How big is his army? We get five questions, I think, with Speak with Dead.
Taliesin: Five?
Sam: How close are we? What's his plan? Where is he?
Laura: Where is Vecna within the city?
Sam: Who's with him?
Laura: Who's the death knight?
Taliesin: He might not know that. But what are they excavating for? What are they looking for?
Travis: I think I know that.
Taliesin: I think I know, too, but I want to hear him say it. It'd make me feel better.
Laura: Let's do it! Cast your Zone, yo!
Taliesin: Get in the zone.
Laura: (singing) Autozone!
Matt: (chuckling) Autozone of Truth?
Liam: Shit. So can anyone drag him down on his roll to save, or boost me?
Taliesin: No. Not me.
Laura: I don't think so.
Liam: Does anyone have a cantrip? Okay. All right. Let's do it.
Matt: All right. So which one?
Liam: Well, first Zone of Truth, then Pike.
Matt: Okay. So you create the Zone of Truth, you create the area, the radial space where the divine energy kicks in and the compulsion to not lie remains within. And then Pike--
Laura: Casts Speak with Dead.
Matt: On which corpse? There are three corpses.
Liam: Red robe seemed more fancy.
Sam: Who seemed more senior?
Liam: Red robe did.
Matt: There are three, technically.
Sam: There was the guy they killed right when they burst on the scene.
Taliesin: We'll take the fanciest cloak.
Matt: Okay. It's relative, but the guy who was controlling the sphere seemed to be at least different.
Laura: He had a different color. Yeah, red robe.
Matt: All right. So as Pike takes the time to focus and recite the incantation, she grabs her holy symbol and focuses and speaks aloud the words in Celestial of the blessing of Sarenrae. And as she completes the ritual, she suddenly screams out in pain and grabs at her head and falls to her knees. No effect. And she suffers--
Laura: Oh no! What did he do to Pike?
Travis: Oh shit.
Matt: On 6d6, I rolled four sixes and a five. That's 31 points of psychic damage to Pike.
Liam: She tried to cast Speak with Dead Dumbfuck.
Matt: She's shaking and grabbing her face and rubbing her eyes, and it takes her a moment to come back to you and she looks around, and you can see a faint bit of blood slightly dripping out of the corner of her eyes. She's like, "All I heard was laughter."
Sam: Laughter?
Laura: And you said it was minus 36 damage?
Matt: 31.
Liam: Vecna is in these motherfuckers' brains.
Marisha: Everyone looks upset.
Laura: Pike got psychic damage from that dude.
Marisha: How much? A lot?
Laura: 31 points of psychic damage.
Marisha: Oh, that's a lot, yeah.
Taliesin: Burn the bodies. Fuck it.
Marisha: Throw them down the well.
Taliesin: Throw them into the sphere.
Marisha: Oh yeah!
Sam: Sphere! Do your worst.
Matt: One by one, you grab and take the corpses and thrust them towards the sphere, as they immediately crumple, fold and get pulled in, turned to nothingness, disappearing into the black void. There are elements of the way the sphere acts and manipulates things that remind you of the siphons, though differently. It's more violent in some ways, and it is its own contained magical entity. With each body, it vanishes in the sphere, and you all sit there for a moment taking a breath and deciding the next order of business in traversing the insides of this titan. And that's where we'll end tonight's game, because it's 11:30.
Marisha: I feel like I always come back from the bathroom right as we're ending games.
Sam: First of all, it's so great to be back!
Taliesin: It's so nice to be back.
Sam: Matt, thank god you're totally 100 percent healed and all better again.
Matt: It's great. Sorry. But yeah, missed you guys. We'll be back next week, pick up from here, see as the final charge gets closer and closer. What will you guys do next time? In the meantime, rest well, don't forget, if you can, to give to the Red Cross to help support the victims of recent hurricane battering in the US.
Laura: Look for Shadow of War.
Matt: Shadow of War coming out on October 10th.
Marisha: Our comic on Wednesday.
Matt: Yep, look for that. And we'll see you guys soon. Have a wonderful week, we love you, and: Is it Thursday yet? Good night. [music]
