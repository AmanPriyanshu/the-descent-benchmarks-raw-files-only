[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello everyone, and welcome to the second episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us crazy voice actor, nerdy types sit here and play Dungeons and Dragons. We'll be continuing from last week's adventure, so in the meantime, let's go ahead and show you some of the character backstory.
Travis: Right, listen up. If you have ale, then you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw. A goliath of towering height and size, this barbarian has an appetite for the two great loves in his life: combat, women, and ale. (record scratching) Wait. Easily the brains of the group, Grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes, colors, and shiny things. Also ale. In his early years, armed with his two-handed greataxe, Grog oft enjoyed proving his might amongst the ranks of his family's wandering herd, but after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly gnome in the woods, he objected to the killing of such an innocent life. A creature of impulse, Grog felt only pity for this, (chuckles) this terrified little thing. His disobedience cost him dearly. Beaten bloody and banished by the herd leader, his uncle Kevdak, Grog was abandoned and left to die. Exiled from his herd, it was then that the relative of the very gnome he fought to save, saved him. It was the kindness of a gnome cleric named Pike that healed Grog, bringing him back from death's edge. And they have remained close friends ever since. Most nights, Grog can be found challenging entire taverns to wrestling matches, ha! Or accompanying Scanlan to the nearest house where you pay for lady favors, huh. Also ale.
Marisha: A first impression of Keyleth would leave you with little information on the half-elven druid. You might even think that her social awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is kind of sweet. Of course, it would be unwise to underestimate her based on first impressions. (lightning roaring) Under that unintimidating, petite frame is a vicious beast waiting to be unleashed whose natural powers have made even the fiercest of champions pee their pants, literally. (giggles) Born to the air tribe of the Ashari people, Keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and the elemental magics. It is her people's inherent duty to protect the delicate areas in Tal'Dorei, where the four elemental planes begins to bleed with this realm. Since she was a little girl, she had quite a knack for air manipulation and beastshaping abilities. Well, if you consider kittens and flying squirrels to be little beasts, which I do. (clears throat) Anyways, it wasn't long before the headmaster of the tribe, her father, Kohren, realized her true prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster. Just like that, her jovial childhood was stripped and replaced with endless spell memorization, teachings from ancient traditions, and exceedingly high expectations. Every druid leader-to-be must embark on a journey to seek out the sister tribes in order to introduce and establish respect amongst the fellow headmasters. They call this the Aramente, or Noble Odyssey. When her father felt she was ready, he set her on the path to truly discovering herself. Not knowing when, or if, she will ever return. As she hikes down the mountain towards Stillben, she meditated on the task ahead. Part of the Aramente is proving yourself a strong warrior, a valiant protector, and a wise and compassionate leader. With this knowledge, one thought plays in repeat in her mind: Is she even worthy?
Taliesin: Percy was the third child of seven children, born to a noble family who lived far to the north in the ancient castle of Whitestone. With so many siblings to share the burdens of lordship, Percy turned his attention to the sciences, engineering, and naturalism. One day, a mysterious couple named Lord and Lady Briarwood came to court. During a feast held in their honour, the Briarwoods violently took control of the castle, killing or imprisoning everyone who would stand in their way. Percy awoke chained in the dungeon, only to be freed by his younger sister. Together they fled, chased by the Briarwoods' men. As they ran, Percy's sister took several arrows to the chest and fell. Percy kept running, eventually jumping into a freezing river and floating unconscious to freedom. He did not remember waking up on a fishing boat. He barely remembered the next two years, as he slowly made his way as far south as possible. Then one night, Percy had a dream. A roaring cloud of smoke offered him vengeance against those who destroyed his family. When he awoke, Percy began to design his first gun. (gun clicking) (explosion roaring)
Sam: Oh, you haven't heard of Scanlan Shorthalt? Well, gird your loins, ladies, because he has his eye on you. A talented musician, master of disguise, and dashingly handsome in his own mind, Scanlan sings songs almost as much as he sings his own praises. Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used his endless charm and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and support his single mother. One day he was discovered by a half-orc promoter, and joined Dr. Dranzel's Spectacular Traveling Troupe, where he learned the ways of the world, and honed his skills as a bard extraordinaire. A loner much of his life, Scanlan has never quite come to terms with the violent death of his mother at the hands of a goblin invasion. While his years on the road provided many, shall we say, educational experiences with the opposite sex, deep down Scanlan yearns for the one thing he's never known, the true love of a fellow gnome. Still, Scanlan considers himself a lover first, performer second, and fighter distant third. On the battlefield, he'll support his allies, but rarely draws blood unless it's to protect fellow gnome, Pike. Count on Scanlan for a hearty laugh, a rollicking song, and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts and makes the females swoon.
Orion: Greetings and salutations. I am Tiberius Stormwind. I hail from a town called Ty'rex, located in the heart of Draconia, from a politically respected family. At the age of 15, I succeeded in passing the Sorcerer's Rite, showing prodigy-like control of my magic. The judges and the Draconian high council were amazed at how powerful my spells were for how long I had been training. At 20 years old, I was the youngest appointed member of the magic guild in Draconian history. For the next few years, I almost went mad from the malaise of being a guild member, as it's rather boring. However, one day I happened upon a chamber, unused for quite some time. In the room were stacks of books and maps of the surrounding cities and areas around the known world. For months I would frequent the chamber, and learned of artifacts from legend. After a long period of research, I made a list of artifacts that caught my eye. I brought these findings to the high council and was told that all of the information in the chamber I stumbled upon was either believed to be fiction, or unsolvable mysteries, and hence were lost forever. I found those answers to be unacceptable. A year later I devised a ruse and managed to convince the city council to lend support in me leaving Draconia on a mission of peace and diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms. Going from town to town and making friends and allies, in and for the name of Draconia. Being a red dragonborn, I had quite the task on my hands in that respect, but it was exactly what I needed, so I could explore the world and find these artifacts, as I felt the truth was out there. Some may describe me as buffoonish, but I say poppycock to all that. (mutters) I am much sharper than most give me credit for. I just don't pay attention to things sometimes. I've also been known to be rather cunning, loyal, happy-go-lucky, and well, dangerous. I can't help but show my true scales every now and then. But overall, I think I'm quite friendly for a dragonborn.
Liam: Never entirely welcome in the company of elves or men, Vax'ildan learned at a young age to skip past formality, preferring instead to invite himself in your door. Along with twin sister Vex'ahlia, Vax was born by a chance encounter between elven royalty and human peasantry. Raised by their mother in their early years, the twins were eventually sent off to their father in the elven capital of Syngorn. But their cool reception among the elves there never warmed, and their time in the capital didn't last. The siblings stole away one autumn night and set out on the open road. After a few years of wandering, they eventually decided to return to their mother, and journeyed back to the lands of their youth. But instead of finding their childhood home, they returned to a pile of rubble. Their mother was gone, their home burned to ash. Pressing the townspeople for answers, they learned of the day the dragon came. (loud roaring) With their ties all severed, Vax'ildan and his sister set out to find their fortune together in Tal'Dorei. An outsider since birth, Vax quickly learned to solve life's challenges in his own particular way, often by sidestepping them entirely. And when his knack for circumventing adversity isn't enough, (sword slicing) the way of blades the elves schooled him in more than makes up the difference.
Laura: Like so many half-elves, Vex'ahlia has spent most of her life suffering the cool reception of a people who don't fully accept her. Born of a human mother and an elven father, who only later in life took an interest in their existence, Vex'ahlia and her twin brother Vax'ildan quickly realized the only people they could truly rely on in this world were each other. It was at the age of ten when the two were taken from their mother, and brought to live in Syngorn, the isolated elven city for which their father was an ambassador. He quietly took them in, but always kept an icy distance, and after too many years of disdainful looks, the pair decided to leave his indifference behind, and set out on their own. Vax took to the cities, stealing small trinkets and learning the ways of the thief, while Vex kept to the woods. She preferred the isolation. Always the keen observer, she learned to hunt and to track, to spy and to shoot. And through a series of fateful events, earned herself a companion in the form of a bear, her own stolen trinket, (bear growling) to fight alongside her and protect her fiercely. Also, he is adorable and gives expert massages. Welcome back everyone. So, know that you're a little more affiliated with the characters, let's get this party started. So as a head's up, I wanna let you know, once again, we're waiting for the charity elements of this stream to open up again, since the big charity that happened a couple weeks ago. Once we do, we're gonna be taking donations, half to go to help run the channel, the other to donate to 826. Marisha will explain that here in just a second. As a head's up, Ashley, who plays our cleric, Pike, unfortunately couldn't make it again this week, because she's busy filming amazing stuff with her career being amazing. But she says she's sad she can't be here. She loves you guys, and as soon as Pike can re-enter the campaign, hopefully in a couple weeks, all awesome gnomeness shall double. So also tonight, there was a goal to try and hit 1000 subscribers on the channel. So what we're gonna do is, we only have 130 people to subscribe tonight. If we can get all 130 before the show ends this evening, we're gonna do a random selection of a person within those thousand subscribers to win a copy of the Player's Handbook signed by all of us, as well as a really, really cool image that was tweeted out earlier by Geek & Sundry, also signed by all of us. So, go ahead and pull your friends, see if we can get some more subscribers before the show's out tonight, so hopefully that'll be fun. So, Marisha, if you wanna go ahead and explain a little bit about the charity 826 we'll be plugging in the near future. Yes, 826 LA is a non-profit charity organization that helps kids though the age of six to 18 with their creative and structural writing skills, and they also help teachers and yeah. Good artsy creative things. So donate, and definitely visit the Time Travel Mart.
Sam: Wait, can we donate?
Matt: Tonight we can't donate here.
Marisha: We can't donate tonight yet?
Matt: It's not available yet. Start saving your money.
Sam: Not yet.
Marisha: But you can still go to the Time Travel Mart in Echo Park and you can also go to their website, 826LA, and I'm sure you can donate through there if you want to do that.
Matt: Yes, but we'll be getting that going in the near future. So, anyway. Let's go ahead and do a little recap of what happened last week. So the party has been hired by their friend, Arcanist Allura Vysoren, in the city of Emon to head towards the dwarven town of Kraghammer, as a good friend of hers, and one of the members of the Council of Tal'Dorei, has gone missing. This, being a halfling paladin, named Lady Kima of Vord, who was on a vision quest as part of a pilgrimage and was drawn towards some dark evil she said was manifesting somewhere deep beneath Kraghammer and hadn't been heard from since. So the party was sent there to go ahead and seek her. Upon arriving in Kraghammer, shenanigans ensued. They made some friends, made some enemies, wandered the town. Brother, sisters, walked around as if they were married.
Laura: No! (group laughs)
Matt: Bears almost got into fights in rings. And eventually the party made their way towards the bottom ring of Kraghammer proper, talking to Lord Nostoc Greyspine, who is--
Orion: That's right, Greyspine.
Matt: Yes, Greyspine indeed. Who is the head of the Greyspine Mines at the bottom of Kraghammer, where supposedly this paladin disappeared to. After having a conversation with him, a bunch of goblins and ogres began to spring from the mines and attacking the workers. The party swooped down to aid, realized that the goblins and ogre's weren't attacking, they were fleeing from something else, of which emerging from within the mines proper some strange naga-based hydra-ish abomination. The party then proceeded to slaughter it, final blow dealt by Scanlan via lightning bolt.
Sam: Hi, Scanlan here, hi.
Matt: Our resident gnome bard.
Travis: Yeah, you did!
Matt: And that's where we pick up. So, as all of you are still riding the adrenaline of the battle, Scanlan feeling the tingling in his fingers as the little bolts of arcane energy kind of (imitates electricity crackling) spark throughout, the rest of the nearby workers and miners slowly converge in and begin to walk up to the party. And someone starts, "That was great, that was well done! Fantastic! Where'd you learn that?" One of them comes up there, "Ah, I could've done better than that." And they start just shouting off at each other and pat each other on the back. A few moments of this progresses before, all of a sudden, there's a hush comes about the crowd, and you see about five or six Carvers pull their way through, Carvers being the guards of Kraghammer, with Lord Nostoc Greyspine himself stepping through. He looks at the rest of the group and goes, "All right, so you've certainly proven yourselves in battle."
Orion: Well, of course we have. I'm sorry.
Matt: "I would like to continue this conversation that we had back in my office if you don't mind." He turns around and begins to walk back.
Marisha: Oh wait, Nostoc. He's not even listening, he's just walking off. (group laughs) Yeah, mmm. Ooh, shall we turn and follow?
Laura: Are you still an eagle? Can you even talk to him?
Taliesin: Shouldn't you just go caw?
Marisha: Well I'm not an eagle. But I am still poisoned.
Laura: Oh, I can help you.
Marisha: Oh, that'd be great.
Laura: Yeah!
Laura: Hold on, I'm gonna go up, and I'm gonna cast--
Sam: Cast? Yeah, I can cast spells.
Sam: You can cast?
Laura: I can. I've got plenty o' spells.
Liam: You can kill?
Sam: All right, fair enough.
Laura: I'm gonna cast Protection from Poison on Keyleth.
Matt: Okay. Essentially go ahead and make a saving throw with advantage. This'll be Constitution.
Marisha: I made the second one.
Matt: What'd you roll?
Marisha: A 10. Plus my constitution which is two, three, thirteen.
Matt: So thirteen?
Marisha: Yes.
Matt: That'd be enough. So, after you finish casting the spell, you feel the poison leave the rest of your body. You can kind of take a breath to yourself. The rest of the miners kind of look about and Awkwardly staring back at Nostoc as he walks off, kind of looking back like, what "Are you gonna go? Talk to him?"
Sam: Yeah, I guess we should go follow him.
Taliesin: We have two very important questions.
Travis: Can't we look in the hole a little bit more.
Orion: No Grog, we need to go do this.
Laura: We're gonna go in the hole in just a minute, Grog.
Orion: Then you can smash, you'll be fine.
Travis: You promise?
Liam: You did that last night. We need to take care of business. Let's go talk to the man. I'm sure it's going to lead back to the mines.
Marisha: To the hole.
Liam: Yes, to the hole. Everything's back to the hole.
Sam: Percy, do you have something to say before we go?
Taliesin: Well, this is good. We have to find out what that was, and we have to see if he'll finally give us some of that ale, I think are the two most important things.
Laura: It was wine, I believe.
Sam: No, it was bloody, bloody beer.
Laura: Bloodline. Bloody wine, blood wine.
Travis: Bloodier, ale. Beerwine.
Matt: It was delicious is what it was.
Travis: It was really good.
Laura: Let's go talk to Nostoc.
Sam: Let's follow him, let's follow him.
Taliesin: Okay, this is what's important.
Matt: All right, so as you head back to the ramp that heads up from the mine enclosure itself to the top of the realm, which is where the Greyspine Industries mining facility is, you are brought into the building again, brought back to Nostoc's office, in which he's not sitting, he's kind of pacing behind his desk, waiting for you as you approach. As you enter the room, he stops pacing, turns around, puts his hand on the desk, and says, Please, enter and close the doors behind you. (loud thud)
Orion: Sorry, I didn't mean to slam the door like that. (group laughs)
Matt: "A flatulent dragonborn, eh?" (group laughs)
Matt: "All right." So as you close the - (laughs) Tiberius. (Orion clears throat comically)
Sam: Sir Greyspine. Lord Greyspine? Mr. Greyspine?
Matt: "Lord Greyspine is fine."
Sam: Lord Greyspine, yes. Why have you summoned us here? Is it to tell us information about what just came out of your mine, I hope.
Matt: "Well let's be clear." "We dwarves don't need help from outsiders. We can handle our own business just fine."
Laura: Of course.
Marisha: Speaking of outsiders, you wouldn't happen to have seen a Lady Kima, would you?
Matt: "As what the discussion was based on previously, you're searching for her, and last we saw her, She went down into the mine."
Laura: We already talked about that, Keyleth.
Travis: Yep, we did.
Liam: They don't like her, she was a troublemaker and she went in.
Travis: You're an eagle.
Laura: She's in the mine. We'll go in and find her. Right? Lord Greyspine?
Matt: "You're welcome to. As far as I know, she's down there somewhere. Hopefully still in one piece."
Laura: While we're there, would you like us to take care of any other problems?
Matt: "Getting to that. You see these small intrusions have been bad for meeting our quotas with the Bronzegrip metal warehouse and export shipments. Employees have been forced to collapse a non-negotiable portion of our tunnels to prevent incursions like this. Without my approval. And this is a pattern I wish to stop at once. Thus, I have a proposition for you. Now, I will give you free reign to our mines. I shall get the proper approvals to make sure no Carvers bother you as you wander the city's lower ring. And I will contract you to delve past our tunnels and investigate the source of these creatures, where they come from, where they live, and if there is some sort of a leader who gives them their commands. Eliminate them. For this, I will reward you with not a trifle sum. 25,000 gold pieces. Plus 250 gold per beast scalp you provide upon returning."
Laura: Ooh, I like this.
Orion: Grog, this seems like a wonderful job, doesn't it?
Sam: Money is wonderful. We like money. But we've been charged to find Lady Kima. We need assurances that we will find her or at least some evidence of her in the mines.
Matt: "The brazen halfling bitch went in there without my approval and wandered into the mines, not to be seen. So if she is down there, I hope she's in one piece. I can't guarantee it. But if there's any place to find her, that's probably it."
Liam: We're the group of adventurers for you. I don't know if you've heard of the heroes Emon, who just recently- I'm sure you've heard something. Word travels fast.
Matt: "Not beneath this mountain, it doesn't, of human closers."
Liam: We've just done a lot of good to the ruler of Emon.
Matt: "Great. How does that help us dwarves?"
Orion: We're saying we are going to help you, too. And everything will be fine, and we'll all be happy.
Laura: Well, we've discovered, in our past adventures, however, is that every realm seems to be having trouble with the same sort of creatures, coming up from the Underdark perhaps?
Liam: All we're saying is, help us help you. What exactly have you seen before this day? More of the same? Or other creatures?
Matt: He sits back for a second. "The types of creatures, I do not know. I mostly deal with the business and just know that there's some bullshite going on down in the mines. You could ask our foreman, Hieris. He's dealt with the cleanup each time we've had an incursion like this, so if anyone has information on what these creatures are, he'd be the one to talk to."
Liam: Sorry, what was his name again?
Matt: Hieris.
Sam: Hieris.
Laura: Hieris.
Matt: "He's a foreman at the mine proper."
Laura: All right.
Taliesin: I think this seems like the sort of job we'd want to take.
Laura: Yes.
Orion: Yes.
Travis: Will we get paid for the monsters and creatures we've already slayed?
Matt: "This deal was not sewn in yet, so no."
Travis: Oh.
Matt: "But we thank you for your aid."
Taliesin: It is customary in our culture to seal a deal with a drink.
Taliesin: As I think you are all aware.
Laura: Truly, truly.
Liam: See, I wasn't just fucking with you last week. (group laughs) That's a thing we do.
Taliesin: And since we are about to risk our lives...
Travis: I forgot you did that.
Matt: Make a persuasion roll.
Taliesin: Yes! Happily.
Travis: Roll good, it's the first one.
Liam: Come on, Percy!
Taliesin: 14.
Laura: Oh.
Sam: It's pretty good. Not great.
Matt: You can see this long, distant, angry, dwarven, mistrusting stare. Rubs his chin, his well-kept, blackened beard and goes, "Huh, but a sip, as it was a gift."
Laura: Yes!
Sam: (laughs) We'll take it. He pulls the ale barrel which you guys provided, sets it on the side of his desk with the same spigot that you had placed in when you presented it earlier and says, "Take a bit." "A bit."
Laura: (whispering) Put some in a bottle.
Orion: We have to save some for those guards.
Liam: Let me take care of it. I'll pour everyone a glass.
Liam: Oh, thank you, brother. I take my empty water flask that I emptied out before, and am smiling and pouring glasses and also squirting a little bit here and there as I want. I start to just play a little ditty on the flute. I thought we could accompany our sip with a little bit of music, not to distract you, just to-- (group laughs) just to sort of accompany us.
Matt: His nose squints at the sound. (SAM imitates a jaunty flute)
Matt: "Gnomish tunes aren't to my ears and liking." However, you do get an inspiration dice.
Laura: Yay.
Matt: All right, so go ahead and make a - (laughs) Make a sleight of hand check on this.
Liam: Okay. That's what we do, right?
Laura: Roll well. Here we go.
Laura: Oh, no.
Liam: Oh, no.
Sam: You have inspiration dice.
Taliesin: Inspiration dice are d8?
Matt: Yep, you add a d8 to it as well.
Liam: Okay, and I can add a d8 to this?
Matt: Correct.
Taliesin: The ale is that good.
Liam: Oh good. Now I'm at 19. (Travis groans in relief) Hey.
Matt: As he's listening to the gnomish music and kind of pushing it away with his hands, like, "Stop, I don't- no. I appreciate it, but I don't."
Sam: All right, there's not accounting for taste.
Matt: As you do that, your wineskin goes to full. (imitates liquid sloshing) Swollen to its brim. You switch over to one of the cups, you pass around the drinks. All of you manage to get your drinks passed around.
Laura: Huzzah!
Matt: "To a contract!"
Travis: Aye! Huzzah!
Taliesin: To a contract.
Marisha: Contracts.
Sam: L'chaim!
Marisha: Love contracts.
Liam: Is that Draconian?
Sam: It's Gnomish.
Taliesin: To risking our lives. For money.
Laura: How old is Nostoc? Just out of curiosity.
Matt: It's hard to tell. Dwarves live quite a long time. He would be equivalent to like a human forties. Dwarven time, somewhere in his mid-hundreds.
Marisha: Smells like its been in the barrel for a hundred years.
Orion: It has been.
Laura: This is excellent.
Liam: Tastes like two buck Chuck. (group laughs)
Orion: Oh, I know him from Quimdendale.
Travis: What do you know of a Ballsac up in the tavern?
Matt: "I'm sorry, what?"
Travis: Do I have that right?
Laura: Ball, ball -
Marisha: Balgus.
All - matt: Balgus.
Matt: "Ah, Balgus, that's the brand of what you brought me."
Sam: You know what, I think we asked about him last time.
Laura: I think we did.
Orion: Also, may we take a short rest before we leave this facility?
Marisha: Yes, could we do that? Is this considered a short rest?
Laura: Oh yeah, that actually would be good.
Matt: If you'd like to do that, that would just be taking a short rest outside, probably not in the office proper.
Laura: Understandable.
Matt: You can leave and just sit down and get some rest.
Laura: When we take a rest, can I look for Hieris?
Matt: You can as well. So, while you guys are taking a short rest, you're able to use any of your hit dice to heal up naturally.
Travis: We don't naturally heal up?
Matt: That is your natural healing. Not to full. It's a continuation, Grog.
Sam: I will sing a song of rest. And it goes a little something like, ♫ Scanlan make you feel good ♫ ♫ Scanlan make you feel real good ♫
Orion: Oh, I feel so good.
Sam: No wait, you get an extra d6 on all your heals.
Travis: I appreciate the slow jam.
Matt: Yeah, on every hit dice, you get an extra d6.
Travis: R. Kelly would agree. (Matt laughs)
Laura: I didn't take any hit points. I'm at full health.
Matt: So you got a slow jam just for the sake of the slow jam.
Laura: That's right. And it was great.
Matt: All right, roll an investigate check.
Orion: It feels good. Real good.
Laura: Okay. Oh, 25.
Matt: A brief discussion with a few of the other wandering dwarf miners that are in the outskirts of the buildings' facilities. Eventually it leads you over to what is a small, secondary building maybe 200 yards off from the main property. That apparently is where Hieris resides and keeps watch over the entire establishment.
Liam: I've tagged along.
Laura: Knock knock knock.
Matt: All right, the rest of you going with her?
Sam: Yeah, we'll go with her.
Matt: Why not! Why split the party? So the the group makes their way over to the outskirts of the building. Opens up and a very nice, portly looking dwarf with a big tuft of a chinstrap beard. Big reddish, ruddy nose. Leather apron on. And he opens the door. "Aye, hello! Nice to meet you. What can I do for ye?"
Laura: Hi. You must be Hieris?
Matt: "I am, I am. Foreman of this here fine mine."
Laura: Wonderful to meet you. I've heard wonderful things about you.
Matt: "Oh, have you! From who?"
Laura: Uh, from Lord Greyspine himself.
Matt: "Really? Oh. All right. Well, how can I be of service?"
Laura: We were curious. I'm sure you witnessed all of those wonderful goblins and trolls and other nonsense coming out of the mine.
Matt: "Aye. Nasty lot. It always makes my weeks that much more interesting."
Laura: Weeks? So this has been happening for quite a while?
Matt: "Unfortunately, at least five or six."
Laura: And what kind of monsters have you been dealing with?
Matt: "Terrible kinds." He starts rubbing his chin for a little and goes, "We generally deal with the occasional goblin den we stumble across when opening new tunnels. That's part of the norm. Other nasty underground beasties. However, over this past few weeks, we've seen some real nightmarish things slither out of the shadows. Many goblins stitched together, like some kind of ball of screaming green lint."
Sam: Ooh, god.
Matt: "Slimes and oozes that would mutate and change color rapidly before seeming to dissolve on their own. Unstable-looking really, in their form."
Sam: Like a goblin centipede? (Laura, Liam, Travis laugh)
Matt: "If you will, aye aye."
Orion: Sounds more like some type of necromancy magic.
Matt: "Perhaps, but they're not undead, per se. They're still alive. At least from what we can tell. Whatever agony face them in their physical form."
Orion: Oh, that's even worse.
Matt: "We even had one brief run-in with what looked like a duergar that had swollen and sprouted eyes and mouths all across his body. That was a sight."
Sam: What's a duergar?
Liam: That's a dark dwarf. They're little fuckers, those are.
Matt: "Aye, duergar." And he spits to the side. "Filthy lost souls. Dwarves of old that turned to a darker god. Thankfully, they live far beneath the mountains, and usually far north enough to not worry about it. But one of them found its way up here, in this strange, awful, maw-covered form. It was terrifying. And the smell! Oh ho ho! Anyway, we've even seen a few creatures from the surface that normally aren't found down here as well, which is strange. They don't wander down. Something's bringing them. Weirdest thing. Oh! And I just heard we had some weird, many-headed serpent thing that just got killed down there."
Laura: Oh, we just killed one of those.
Matt: "That was you!"
Laura: Yes!
Travis: Our hero is right over here.
Sam: (clears throat) Hi. (group laughs)
Matt: And he steps onto his back leg, shifting his weight, and cocks an awkward eyebrow. "Really?"
Sam: I'm really strong for my age.
Orion: We were all surprised.
Taliesin: We're as surprised as anybody.
Travis: Fearsome Scanlan.
Sam: Actually, Hieris, I have a question for you. You know the mines very well, yes?
Matt: "Aye, I do."
Sam: Far from asking you to draw us a map, are there any tunnels or directions that we should avoid or particularly head towards? Anything that we should look for in terms of traps or tricks?
Matt: "Not within our mines. They're usually well-guarded. Or, they were."
Orion: Also, do you have a map?
Matt: "Of the mines? Yeah, I do."
Orion: Wonderful.
Matt: He starts going through his notes here.
Orion: I'll take that.
Sam: That's where we're going, right?
Travis: We're goin' in the hole.
Matt: It's kinda haphazardly scrawled across a piece of parchment, but he hands it over to you.
Matt: And he says, "So that's the front part of the mines. Unfortunately, half of our tunnels have been relinquished to close off some of these beasties coming through, so we're gonna have to recarve portions of the mine as we progress forward. Kind of starting at square one best we can. But that at least is what we're currently working with. There is a subterranean level as well. We have an elevator inside that brings the various mine carts to and from."
Laura: Is there a particular area on that map that most of the baddies seem to be coming from?
Matt: "No, we've closed it off each time."
Laura: Just kind of everywhere?
Matt: "Oh no, we've had a few tunnels they've come through, but we've managed to collapse those and make sure they're not coming through again."
Liam: And we noticed the, I believed it was the naga we fought, it seemed to have several extra heads stitched on. Have you no knowledge of these creatures? It seems very odd. Is there any connection in dwarven history or past? Or this is totally out of the blue?
Matt: "No no, not to my knowledge, at least. I mean, most beasts we find are in one piece, not several together. It's a bit disturbing to be honest. I told my nephew about it and he was crying for hours."
Laura: Oh.
Marisha: Oh.
Orion: (laughs)
Travis: Do any of the beasts go back into them?
Matt: "Oh no, we've killed them as they come out each time." Right, they don't take anything back.
Matt: "Not from what I've seen, no."
Marisha: Hieris, do you know if there's any other entrances into the mine? Any old secret tunnels, something that someone could be using to get in?
Matt: "Not to the mine, this is all proprietary. This is the business we run, so we don't have any internal or secret entrances. That would leave us open to a sort of a thief to come in and steal our mithril."
Liam: And what's security like on the mine? Is there any chance someone could've slipped in through Kraghammer without you knowing, or is that all locked up?
Matt: "Oh, I highly doubt that, not with the way our carvers are trained."
Liam: Understood, understood.
Laura: They are quite--
Matt: "That's what I'm talking about."
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: "Fine dwarven study."
Travis: Before we go--
Laura: Strong ale.
Matt: "Finest of military classes, aye. Proud of 'em."
Travis: What do you use for the--
Matt: "I had a cousin who was once a carver. Raised him there. His whole family brought him up on that side. Military weapon training every day. Couldn't come out and play with the rest of us. I felt bad for him. But he grew up to be a right nasty dwarf, aye."
Liam: You say had.
Laura: Where is he now?
Matt: "Unfortunately, he was slain in one of the incursions. That duergar I was telling you about. But, such is the nature of the fighter, I suppose."
Laura: A damn shame. I'm so sorry.
Matt: "I appreciate that. To be honest, he was kind of a bastard, but um-- don't miss him too much. But I appreciate the thought. That's very kind of you."
Sam: We won't avenge him then.
Matt: "I mean, still avenge him."
Liam: Literally or figuratively?
Matt: "I'm not sure."
Travis: He had parents.
Matt: "He had parents. We were related somewhat. I'm not gonna say too closely."
Laura: Can I ask a question?
Matt: "Ah, yes."
Laura: Not to you, to the other guy, Matt.
Matt: Ah, yes. (group laughs)
Matt: Yes, Laura?
Laura: When we take a rest, do we get our spells back for the day?
Matt: Not a short rest. It has to be a long rest.
Laura: All right, cool.
Taliesin: Which is why we're gonna take a proper nap.
Laura: We're gonna take a real nap?
Taliesin: I think we should go buy some potions and take a nap.
Liam: I think so.
Laura: All right, this could be really bad. I mean, we're about to put the dungeons in Dungeons and Dragons.
Travis: Let's go get drunk and go to sleep then.
Laura: All right.
Matt: There you go.
Taliesin: And stock up on some potions. Hieris, you've been so helpful.
Matt: "Of course, I'm happy to."
Marisha: One last question.
Matt: "It doesn't have to be last. You're welcome to stay as long as you like. I don't get visitors to often up here in my booth."
Marisha: You should come drink with us at the tavern.
Matt: "Oh well, I have to stay here. Work, at least for the next six hours."
Liam: All night, do you get off in six more hours?
Matt: "Aye. But I have some dried fruits. I've got some meats inside. I've got two chairs and you could fit in my lap," and he kind of pats you on the head.
Sam: I've killed. (group laughs)
Matt: "Right."
Orion: This one needs a whore, sorry. (Sam grunts)
Matt: "Fair enough." Also, apparently my mic's a bit loud. If you can turn it down a bit for you guys.
Liam: What's a mic?
Matt: "Forget that, you heard nothing. It's a strange echo in the caverns of Kraghammer. Anyway--"
Travis: Look at the time.
Laura: We have to go. We'll come see you again, Hieris.
Matt: "Of course, anytime. When we're not busy. But when I'm not busy, you're welcome to come by."
Orion: All right.
Marisha: Oh, that'd be nice.
Liam: Tell you what, when we drag our asses out of that mine, we'll come straight to you and buy you a drink.
Laura: And we'll have some of that dried fruit.
Travis: We're lying, right?
Matt: "Oh, I'll save a batch for you, you half-elf lass."
Laura: All right.
Liam: Do the wink thing you do.
Laura: I did, I already did.
Liam: Oh, you did it already. She's good at winking.
Matt: "I saw, it was a good wink. Aye. Made me tingle in my shoulders."
Travis: Just your shoulders?
Matt: "That might be the diabetes, but--" (group laughs)
Matt: "But mostly the wink, I think."
Travis: Good.
Marisha: Oh, we should get him something other than dried fruit. That's not good for diabetes.
Travis: Back to the tavern.
Taliesin: At least it means he's regular.
Travis: Or did you have something?
Sam: No, we're good. Back to the tavern. We go back to the Iron Hearth Tavern, right? Is that what it's called?
Matt: For those who are asking, that's West Country, is the accent.
Laura: Yes.
Matt: Cornwall.
Laura: What time is it? Should we buy potions now?
Travis: If we're underground--
Laura: Oh, is everything open?
Matt: As far as you guys know, it's somewhere in the neighborhood of sunsettish afternoon.
Laura: Are the stores still open?
Travis: It's summer.
Matt: You can certainly check.
Sam: It's like La Vegas, it's always twilight.
Travis: There you go.
Orion: If you all don't mind, I suggest we item up a bit, and before we get too late, and we get too drunk, Grog, go back to that lightning -- main-- manor-- lightning cage.
Laura: Oh, that place.
Matt: House Thunderbrand?
Orion: House Thunderbrand. (Matt laughs)
Travis: Where do we item up? Do we get potions and stuff somewhere?
Laura: Yeah, that's what we're looking for.
Liam: When you say too drunk, do you mean "we" the adventurers or the humans back in Los Angeles?
Orion: Both parties. Cross-plane.
Marisha: Cross-Realm.
Orion: And I tell them what happened, again.
Sam: What happened?
Orion: Well, I went to this door because--
Sam: Oh yes, yes, yes, yes.
Matt: You later rested, shot arcane magic at the home of arcane magic in Kraghammer.
Orion: And if we are to go down into this cave, perhaps they have some insight into what's going on there as well. Especially at this point in.
Laura: Let's hurry and try to get them before they go to sleep.
Marisha: Maybe they have magical items. I want stuff.
Orion: And I priorly had luck with more than--
Travis: Like plant stuff or potion stuff?
Marisha: All stuff.
Liam: Have you had any luck finding an arcane--
Laura: That's what we're talking about.
Liam: No, I know that. Did you send any fireballs at doors again like you've done in the past, or--?
Orion: Yes, I knocked, as I do often do. And nothing doing.
Laura: All right.
Liam: Got it.
Travis: So, magic stuffs.
Laura: Let's go find them.
Taliesin: All right.
Marisha: So wait-- it seems like they really don't want you in their door. It seems very heavily guarded. So what's our plan, we just going to try again?
Laura: Well it was nighttime before. Maybe they'll be more--
Sam: We're gonna do what we always do  wing it.
Taliesin: We're gonna try it again, except we're gonna watch this time. It'll be fun.
Matt: There you go.
Marisha: Let's do it.
Liam: I walk back to the door, because we're all just standing outside the door.
Matt: Correct.
Liam: I walk back to Hieris's door and knock on it and poke my head in. Hieris, I'm sorry.
Matt: You catch him with a handful of dried fruit, "Hmph! Hi!"
Liam: Just a quick question. We have no fucking idea what time it is. Because we usually use the sun. Do you know what hour it is? Are businesses open at the moment?
Matt: He reaches over and grabs this really awesomely intricate piece of clockwork on his desk. It's this brass, cylindrical piece that as he pulls out you hear this (tongue clicking), fring! And springs and things making strange whirring sounds. "Oh, I reckon it's about two hours from sunset."
Orion: Oh, very good.
Liam: Are the stores open at the moment?
Travis: Better question.
Matt: "As far as I know, aye. Depending on the store."
Liam: How much time do we have left?
Matt: "Few hours."
Liam: Oh, thank you, sir.
Matt: "You sure you don't want to stay?"
Liam: Let's go shopping.
Travis: Thank you, Hieris thank you. Oh, gotta go, sorry.
Matt: "Goodbye."
Marisha: It's the mine that never sleeps.
Matt: "Good luck."
Liam: Byeee!
Matt: You hear the door open behind you, and he starts waving at you guys. "Stay safe!"
Taliesin: Stay regular.
Marisha: Eat some veggies! Fruit's bad for the diabetes!
Travis: Oh, I put my head back in the door, and I throw him a turkey leg and a beef jerky stick. I gotta get rid of this stuff. It's been in here for years.
Taliesin: The fact that you just checked your inventory for that worries me.
Travis: We gotta lotta shit in this bag.
Matt: The bag of holding, not so much a freezer.
Travis: I didn't say it was good. I just want it out.
Marisha: And then you just throw it at him?
Matt: The mildly rotted turkey leg (imitates moist impact) across the floor. The remainder of what was once meat, now a slush sloughing off the bone as it slams across the stone floor.
Travis: It's really tender.
Liam: You're a goliath, you'll eat anything.
Travis: Yeah, those are the best parts.
Matt: You see he immediately steps back and his face squints back.
Marisha: That's not polite, Grog.
Travis: I gave him a turkey leg.
Matt: "It's the thought that counts." As he closes his door.
Orion: Hold, hold on. Before he does that, I cast prestidigitation, and I clean it up real quick.
Matt: Okay, that's really kind of you.
Orion: And I hand him a parchment and go, if there's anything wrong, just write the message on this, and we'll come help. If there's any emergency. And I hand him a parchment from the Scroll of Telescription that I made.
Matt: "All right. Thank you kindly."
Laura: How many pages is that scroll? Is it endless?
Orion: I made like 15 tickets right now. And it takes me an hour to craft.
Matt: He takes it from you with trepidation. You can see he probably hasn't encountered dragonborn often, and he's like, "Thanks."
Orion: Remember, dragonborn, we're good.
Matt: "Right."
Orion: So long. And I leave.
Matt: "Thank ye." Closes the door.
Laura: Do you want to go with him to the enchanting place or do you wanna go somewhere else?
Liam: I think I will go with him just to keep him from setting fire to the entire city.
Laura: All right, shall we all go to the manor?
Taliesin: We have time, we might as well.
Orion: Are we iteming up first?
Taliesin: I figure we do that after.
Laura: I think we'll do that.
Marisha: I'm gonna go ahead and turn into a squirrel and hide in your pocket.
Laura: I like it.
Marisha: Okay.
Laura: Ugh, Grog.
Travis: What, it was a burp! (group laughs)
Matt: Technically in character.
Travis: Much worse from the other end, I guarantee.
Sam: Okay, so we're going to House Thunderbeards? Thunderbirds?
Matt: You guys head to the House Thunderbrand.
Sam: Brand.
Matt: All right. So, Tiberius leads you to where it's residing. Once again you come upon what looks like a very out of place, very well-kept green lawn that stretches for a good 60 feet before you see this really beautiful-looking alabaster and gold building, slightly domed with these four towers to each corner, with these blue pointed crystals on top of each tower.
Liam: How does the grass grow down here?
Laura: Can we see any traps or glyphs that are active?
Matt: He points out to you as you approach, there are a series of stone sigils carved into the stonework that surrounds the exterior of the lawn.
Orion: Those things!
Laura: Can we look around and see if there's any way to, a bell to ring that's outside of that area.
Matt: Go ahead and make a perception check.
Taliesin: Can I assist on that?
Laura: Yeah, please do, 'cause I rolled a one. One, baby.
Taliesin: It's a 10.
Laura: I failed it hard, I failed it.
Taliesin: If you rolled a one, there's nothing I can do anyway.
Matt: What'd you roll?
Liam: We ain't found shit.
Travis: She rolled a one.
Matt: Rolled a one naturally?
Laura: I did.
Matt: Best you can tell, stonework's pretty solid.
Laura: Cool! Hey, it's a house.
Matt: Yeah.
Matt: There are dwarves around. No.
Travis: Good.
Matt: As you look about, it's hard to tell the nature. This looks just like a lawn with a well-framed stone exterior.
Laura: Cool.
Matt: But there's no fence. There's nothing keeping you from walking into the lawn and towards the building.
Marisha: Can I do a nature check to see what light source is making all this grass grow, or if it's like magical growing?
Matt: No nature check required. There is no light source, other than the green rocks that generally permeate the interior of Kraghammer to give its kind of strange luminescent atmosphere. This kind of dull red glow that's around the entire city. Other than a couple of sparks of lantern light. There's no light source.
Sam: I wonder what Keyleth is doing. She's squeaking an awful lot. (Marisha imitates squirrel)
Laura: Oh that's right, she's in my pocket. Hi!
Travis: So we just walk up and--
Laura: Can I pet her little head.
Orion: No, I don't suggest that, Grog. I shoot firebolt.
Matt: I forgot that wasn't water. (coughs)
Taliesin: Did you actually try to walk up?
Liam: Is there a front door?
Taliesin: Perhaps you should, before you do anything. Just try and walk up.
Matt: From what you can see, There appears to be a large, almost like beachwood, Light wood double door in the front of the compound.
Laura: Grog's gonna go.
Liam: I'm gonna use my rogue abilities to walk up to the front door, and knock on it.
Orion: Great.
Laura: Sorry Grog.
Travis: I have one job. To take damage.
Liam: Can I see if I detect a bell?
Marisha: Is that a talent you picked, is that a feat?
Matt: So, you walk towards the grass. You step onto the walkway that leads towards the front of the building. As soon as you cross into the threshold where those stone sigils are, you make a dexterity saving throw. (Travis laughs)
Laura: Oh no. Roll well, my brother.
Liam: This is really not good for their business. [LIAM and LAURA groan] (group laughs)
Liam: 12.
Matt: 12.
Laura: Oh no.
Matt: So, as you pull your cloak around you and take a few steps to jaunt upwards, suddenly there's, you guys hear it. The strange (tongue clicking) sound, and a poof, poof of arcane blue energy kind of, just pulses around his feet. You instinctively begin to pull back, but as you do, there's a blast of blue electric energy that (imitates explosion), streaks out from all around you, shocking your body and throwing you about 15 feet back, straight onto your shoulders. You (imitates grinding) skid to a halt (imitates thud).
Liam: Which one of these do I roll for damage?
Travis: Electrified sound effect.
Matt: You take...
Liam: Higigigigi!
Matt: 14 points of lightning damage.
Liam: All right.
Orion: This is as I'm paused telling him not to do that.
Matt: Yes.
Orion: Don't!
Travis: Should've let me go.
Matt: Your muscles eventually relax.
Orion: As I was about to say, that was going to happen.
Travis: We have a flying carpet.
Laura: Hey, we have a flying carpet! We have a flying carpet.
Orion: Let me try one thing that I didn't think to do last time. I'm gonna cast Dispel Magic on the runestone.
Liam: Don't tase me, bro.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and--
Travis: It's really not that bad.
Matt: Let's see.
Laura: Pull it out.
Travis: What?
Laura: Pull out the flying--
Marisha: Phrasing.
Sam: Going for the handbook.
Matt: Yeah, so we know what's going on.
Travis: Oh, the magic carpet, hold on.
Sam: Guys, don't forget to subscribe to Geek and Sundry.
Laura: Oh yeah!
Orion: Oh, and I cast it at my fourth level slot.
Travis: You wanna fly it up to the door?
Marisha: What are you casting?
Orion: Dispel magic.
Matt: All right, make an arcana check.
Laura: It can't carry you, you're too heavy.
Travis: I said you, not me.
Laura: Oh, gimme that flying carpet.
Travis: That's what I said.
Orion: 13.
Matt: 13?
Orion: Yeah.
Matt: Okay. As you concentrate and these kind of shimmering bands of arcane energy wave off your hands toward the enchantment, they impact and dissipate without effect.
Orion: Are they fourth level or higher?
Matt: They seem to be.
Orion: Fuck.
Laura: I hop on the flying carpet.
Matt: Okay, so you pull the flying carpet, Mary Poppins-style, out of the bag of holding. (imitates soft thud)
Laura: Yes. And see if I can fly up and over to the door.
Travis: Do you wanna tie a rope around your waist in case it goes bad?
Orion: It's a flying magical carpet.
Laura: Somebody. Oh. Is that bad? Is that a bad idea?
Travis: No, do it.
Orion: It's a flying magical carpet.
Sam: What could go wrong?
Marisha: I think you'll just, like, hit a wall.
Laura: What if the flying carpet gets ruined?
Sam: Let's not do that then.
Travis: Oh my God, really?
Liam: It's not gonna be ruined.
Marisha: Wait, wait, wait, I'm in squirrel form. So I go out.
Laura: Oh, and you're with me. Let's both fly to the door.
Liam: I have nine healing potions--
Sam: Hey, hold on, hold on.
Travis: What what, you turned invisible and walked inside a house last time.
Sam: Yeah, I can do whatever we want. Do you want me to knock on the door, is that what we're trying to do?
Laura: Oh yeah, use your--
Sam: Okay, so yes. I send an unseen servant to knock on the door.
Travis: What kind, like a buddy?
Laura: Oh, he tried it before.
Matt: Where do you create the unseen servant?
Sam: Where do I create it?
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: Right on the doorknocker. Like, hanging on the doorknocker.
Travis: Feet touching the ground?
Matt: All right. So the distance unseen servant can be summoned--
Laura: Oh no.
Matt: I believe you may be able to actually summon it within the boundary of those arcane sigils.
Travis: I'm just sitting back here holding the carpet. ♫ I can show you the world ♫ (group laughs)
Matt: 60 feet, so yeah. You go ahead and you walk up to where that sigil is, you finish your spell, you cast unseen servant.
Sam: ♫ Unseen servant, ho ♫ (group laughs)
Matt: Which he says every time.
Sam: Yes.
Matt: Every single time. You see this strange shift of air as some sort of humanoid form then materializes in the opposite side of this boundary and stands at your ready and command.
Sam: We still haven't knocked on the door, correct?
All - matt: No.
Matt: It's about a 60 foot walk.
Sam: I command the unseen servant to (imitates knocking)
Matt: It kind of saunters over. You guys see this kind of shifting, barely, barely visible form make its way up to the front door. In the distance, you hear a dull (knocking). Eventually, the door slightly opens. And you see a hunched figure with bright white, chalk-white hair, kind of look out the doorway, "Oh, where's he come from?" Looking at the form in front of him.
Sam: Oh, the ghost.
Matt: Yeah. "That's where you come from. All right."
Sam: Hello!
Orion: I'm waving. Hello.
Matt: Opens the door, comes out. You now see this dwarven figure hunched, very, very old, with a long, very, very well-crafted brass staff, looks like a black or purple gem at the top. Spectacles at the tip of its nose. And it begins to kind of shift its way over towards you. (breathes heavily)
Orion: Watch out for that rune. It's still on.
Sam: I think he knows that. (laughing)
Matt: Eventually making its way.
Travis: He's coming towards us?
Matt: Yes. Walks right to the edge of the sigil. Puts his hand up, and the unseen servant vanishes. He goes, "So, you have my attention."
Orion: Well, it's a pleasure to meet you. My name's Tiberius Stormwind, and these are my friends.
Matt: He puts his hand up and there's no sound coming out of your mouth. (Travis laughs)
Sam: Maybe we should listen.
Matt: "This is the one who would-be attacked our home abode not more than a few hours ago."
Sam: He has emotional problems.
Matt: "Apparently. He needs to learn respect for other people's property."
Laura: Yes, he does.
Liam: We agree wholeheartedly. He's dragonborn, he's weird. He's a little weird. We're sorry to interrupt. I don't know, it's dinnertime, I think. I don't know if you've heard yet, it just happened. We just fought some sort of many-headed beast down at the mines, and Lord Greyspine is sending us in. So before we go, we were sent here. We were told you were the dwarf to speak to if we needed--
Laura: To know about the magical entities.
Liam: I think it was just to get shit. (Travis and Sam laugh)
Liam: To get ready for those entities.
Matt: "If you're looking to but trinkets and magical oddities--"
Laura: Trinkets!
Matt: "You've come to the wrong place. This is a house of study. This is where hardworking dwarves of arcane persuasion put their lives towards pursuing--"
Travis: Say something!
Matt: "--the magical forms and fields that--"
Sam: And we have come to seek your knowledge.
Matt: "I'm sorry." Your sound is back.
Orion: That's what I'm trying to say is that I came here looking to ask about the arcane studies. I'm extremely interested in that. When I heard that your house Was the only one that was in that particular study, I was immensely intrigued. I respect the arcane arts so much that it's, well, it's been my life. And right now, we're in bit of a situation where we have to go slaughter a bunch of nasties in apparently one of your mines. And we don't know the source. And it appears to be of an extreme arcane nature of the dark sense, and I figured we could come to you for help and some kind of guidance. And I will-- Scanlan, will you stop it! And it appears that you very well know something that we could learn from, with all due respect, of course.
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Marisha: Holy shit. What the fuck. Breathe.
Orion: 11.
Travis: God, what is with these rolls?
Taliesin: We've been middling.
Laura: Terrible rolls today.
Matt: The dwarf gives you a disapproving brow shift and goes, "Look, I mean no disrespect. But understand, this is a dwarven house of arcane practitioning and study. Don't see any dwarves among ya. I think our business here is concluded." "If you're looking to buy stuff, we produce and sell through the Value of Valor house of sale."
Travis: Oh Tiberius, can't you become a dwarf?
Taliesin: Of course, sir, we completely understand if you're not up to such a challenge. It makes perfect sense, and we'll be more than happy to go and buy some wares somewhere else if this is too much for you.
Matt: "Bah! Challenge."
Orion: I will send you my associate. The dwarf turns around and begins walking away with his staff.
Laura: What a beautiful staff that is.
Orion: I'm gonna cast Alter Self on myself to be a dwarf.
Travis: And jump behind me, and act like you just--
Laura: Actually sir, we do have a dwarf with us.
Marisha: No wait wait wait! Cast it on me! I'm a squirrel in her pocket.
Orion: Oh shit, I cast it on her instead. (loud thudding)
Laura: We have a dwarf with us who wanted to actually say hello to--
Travis: (whispering) What's your dwarf name?
Matt: Turns around. Saunters back.
Orion: Keyleth, where have you been?
Marisha: I guess it's Keyleth.
Matt: Looks at you.
Travis: Keyleth Kraghammer.
Sam: You better fucking speak dwarvish.
Matt: Smiles for a second as he looks at you and goes, "Ah, how nice to meet you. Where are you from?"
Marisha: (bad Scottish accent) Oh, hello. (group laughs)
Laura: Oh, shit. (Liam speaks in Swedish-accented gibberish)
Sam: Ya, from Sweden.
Travis: I'm gonna choke on a chip. (coughs)
Marisha: Keyleth is not good at this.
Liam: Roll with it player, roll with it.
Marisha: I hail from the mountains up north.
Orion: She had an accident on the way over here. We were hoping maybe--
Matt: Roll a persuasion roll with disadvantage. (all talking and laughing)
Matt: You. Roll with disadvantage.
Liam: Let the dice act better than us tonight, please. (group laughs)
Travis: (high-pitched voice) Oh, hello!
Marisha: Wait, persuasion--I don't have--oh, wait. I have a zero. Eight.
Matt: That's your first roll. Now roll again.
Marisha: Oh, I have advantage.
Matt: No, you have disadvantage.
Marisha: Oh, disadvantage. So eight.
Matt: Eight. He goes, "I've been practicing the arcane arts for over 250 years."
Marisha: And I've been practicing my Cornwall accent for five minutes. Shit.
Matt: He raises his hand, and the Alter Self spell dissipates. Where stands Keyleth.
Sam: Oh Keyleth, you've been lying to us this whole time? (Travis laughs)
Orion: Who are you?
Sam: We thought you were a dwarf.
Liam: Vax steps forward, steps in front of Keyleth and says, Good sir dwarf. Clearly we are idiots. We are--
Matt: "That's the first true thing you've said since you've called me out of my home."
Liam: Stay with me on this. We are strangers in a strange land. However, we are working with Lord Greyspine to empty your mines and end the evil that is spewing forth from them. Now I know that we are a bit stupid-- (group laughs) --in a number of ways.
Laura: But we fight well.
Liam: But we fight well, and we have the best of intentions, and when it counts, we're there. We just need a little bit of help going into the mines. And again, Lord Greyspine himself sent us, so please excuse my--
Taliesin: Cornwall?
Liam: --challenged friends.
Travis: My cornhole friends.
Liam: We're here to help. I promise.
Travis: That's a very Disney moment.
Liam: Wink, wink, wink.
Laura: I wink twice. Make a persuasion roll at disadvantage.
Laura: Can I assist him 'cause I winked?
Matt: No.
Laura: Damn it.
Travis: It's a powerful wink.
Matt: It's a powerful wink, but not this powerful. Not the way this conversation's been going.
Travis: Yeah, apparently not. Oh hello!
Liam: Best roll of the night. I rolled a 20 and a 17. So 19.
Matt: 19. He glares at you two and goes, "I've said my piece. Good luck to you all." (group groans)
Sam: Further.
Laura: If you had gotten the 20.
Liam: How about a chocolate-covered mallomar?
Sam: I'm gonna have one more try at this.
Matt: He turns around and starts walking away.
Sam: There must be so many arcane things down there that we will discover and bring to you upon finding them.
Laura: Good call, Scanlan.
Sam: Things that you could use for your research. Historical items.
Matt: As he's still walking away, you hear him shout over his shoulder, "And when you bring them, then we'll talk!"
Sam: Okay, that's fair.
Matt: "Till then, good day, and don't bother me when I'm eating."
Laura: Thank you, Lord Thunderclap.
Liam: This game has consequences.
Matt: At which he shouts again at a booming, booming prestidigitation voice, "It's THUNDERBRAND!"
Laura: That's what I meant.
Matt: You hear the door slam, boom!
Travis: That was fun.
Sam: That was great!
Laura: Should we go buy some potions then?
Taliesin: Yes, let's go buy some potions.
Sam: He gave us a little bit of information. The valve of valva, what's it? Valor of -
Travis: Vulva?
Sam: The place to place to go buy potions.
Orion: The House of Valor.
Sam: No, the valva--
Orion: It's not the House of Vulva, Scanlan.
Matt: The Value of Valor.
Laura: The Value of Valor!
Sam: The Value of Valor!
Travis: If you want to visit the House of Vulva, you and I can go later but not now.
Laura: The Value of Valor, let's go find that.
Orion: (in Marisha's bad accent) Let's go to the North.
Marisha: I'm sorry. I didn't think about the fact that I was gonna have to do an accent. I'm not good with that stuff.
Laura: It's okay, Keyleth.
Travis: Women, fighting, ale, that's my job.
Matt: So after a bit of discussion, you manage to make your way around town. You eventually find your way to the Value of Valor, which is a--
Laura: Terrible.
Matt: (laughs) It's a stone building. Like reddish brick, it looks in construction. With fine purple--
Laura: Please be open, please be open, please be open.
Matt: (laughs) Fine purple tapestries in the front that show various battles of old dwarven history of two glowing enchanted permalight lanterns hanging from the front.
Taliesin: Classy.
Matt: And an entryway that is currently open and a warmly-lit interior welcomes you.
Travis: Awesome.
Liam: So easy.
Sam: Hey, before we go in there and just make asses of ourselves, As a group, what do you think we need to get down into these mines?
Laura: Potions.
Taliesin: Healing potions.
Sam: Healing potions. Some light sources--
Orion: We don't need that.
Sam: Climbing anything?
Laura: I have climbing gear.
Sam: I have some climbing gear, but--
Laura: That's included in the dungeoneering kit, right?
Matt: Yes.
Sam: Oh, what about something for breathing?
Sam: Like what if we get trapped down there with no air?
Orion: Don't worry about that.
Laura: She can make plants, and we'll get plenty of oxygen.
Marisha: Oxygen's good, although if we have something to help with poison, that might be good. Can we get some antidotes?
Liam: Vex. How much gold do we have at the moment?
Laura: That is a wonderful question, brother.
Orion: By the way, I pull out a bottle of air. Just an empty bottle and go: and plus, we have this.
Laura: We will more than double our gold if we take this mission.
Travis: So we got like 24,000 gold pieces?
Laura: Less than that.
Travis: 23 thousand.
Laura: Less than that.
Travis: 22 thousand?
Liam: More than double, that means it could be one thousand. 'Cause anything is more than double.
Laura: I don't like sharing.
Travis: Math is stupid.
Sam: All right, we go into the House of Vulva.
Matt: All right.
Sam: Open your vulva!
Matt: That's not what it's called. (group laughs)
Travis: Are you sure you don't wanna think about renaming it now?
Matt: It's the Value of Valor guys, come on! (whines)
Matt: All right, so.
Taliesin: You're tearing the party apart.
Liam: Tearing me apart, Lisa.
Matt: A giant boulder falls out of nowhere and crushes Grog. (group laughs)
Matt: So you make your way inside. Suddenly, hit with the smell of heavy incense and jasmine. This is the equivalent of a Psychic Eye Bookshop.
Orion: Groovy!
Marisha: Oh, we were just there.
Taliesin: We were just there.
Travis: Nag champa.
Matt: You walk inside. There's not a lot of folks inside looking about the establishment. But there is one person sitting at the front desk, which is a beautiful long oak table with a red trim that hangs to the ceiling. Not a dwarf, actually. What you see there appears to be an elven individual, sitting at wait, hair pulled back behind the ears. Very, very slight, thin build. And smiles as you enter and says, "Welcome to my establishment, may I help you?"
Laura: We both stand a little taller, and try to look more noble.
Liam: Hello.
Matt: "Yes."
Liam: It's a beautiful shop you have. It's so startling to find an elven establishment here in the middle of Kraghammer. How did this come about?
Matt: "Well. They didn't have one." (Travis and Sam laugh) "And I found there was perhaps money to be made in starting one. I've been here for over a hundred years."
Travis: Oh sh-- Are you guys that old?
Liam: No, we are not.
Orion: So business is good?
Matt: "Dwarves have a hard time buying from those who are not dwarves. But I've made my established connections with business individuals. So, what can I help you with?"
Taliesin: We're in the market for some healing potions to start with.
Travis: Yep, yep.
Matt: "Of which intensity are you looking for?"
Travis: Level three for this one, please. Two.
Matt: "So looking for a superior healing potion."
Travis: Yeah, superior.
Matt: "I've only got two of those currently."
Laura: They're expensive, Grog.
Marisha: We don't have Pike, though.
Matt: "I can sell you the two superior healing potions."
Marisha: I'm still not feeling well.
Matt: "Those will run you 1,500 gold pieces each."
Travis: Fuck! Really?!
Taliesin: This is why you buy medium healing potions.
Marisha: On second thought, I'll just read some books tonight,
Travis: I take damage fast.
Marisha: Refresh myself on my healing spells.
Laura: Can I ask your name?
Matt: He gives you a keen look and says, "Tremaine."
Laura: Tremaine.
Travis: Oh, here we go. (Liam and Taliesin laugh)
Marisha: It's what she's good at.
Travis: Everybody take five while we haggle.
Laura: I'm just saying. We're heading into the mines. We are going to encounter very many arcane objects potentially. In fact, Lord Thunderbrand sent us over here. That's his name, right?
Travis: You got it.
Taliesin: You did it right.
Laura: Sent us over here telling us to find his wares here. And we've made a deal with him that if we find arcane objects we could potentially, you know, I lost track of what I was saying, but you get the idea.
Sam: Oh boy.
Orion: What would you suggest? And do you know of any things we should particularly buy before we leave going into the mines and encountering nasty naga-type creatures and other kind of things.
Matt: "Superior healing potions."
Travis: How much are they each, 1500?
Matt: "1500 gold pieces."
Travis: I'll take one for me, thank you.
Matt: "Very well."
Laura: We'll very much like to perhaps make a deal with you, that we'll bring you objects of arcane nature for a discount on your wares.
Matt: Make a persuasion roll.
Travis: Oh shit. I just paid for--
Laura: Oh, no you didn't. Not yet.
Liam: Roll, sister.
Laura: Oh, come on, no whammies, no whammies. Okay, well. 15, hm?
Travis: He's an old elf.
Matt: He says, "And I appreciate this perhaps offer. Once you return from your mines--"
Laura: I know, I know, I know.
Matt: "--with these magical accoutrements, you are more than welcome to bring them here, and we'll make a deal."
Laura: How many dragons have you come across, sir? Are you interested in dragon parts?
Travis: Oh, we have a lot of dragon bits.
Matt: He extends his hand to a shelf on the side labeled, "Dragon Parts."
Laura: Oh. (group laughs)
Laura: Lovely.
Matt: "And to answer your question, three."
Laura: Oh, really?
Travis: What about basilisk eggs?
Laura: What kind of dragons, actually?
Matt: "What was your question, sir?"
Travis: We have also, if you're interested in trade, basilisk eggs and parts of an umber hulk.
Liam: And a troll dick.
Travis: No, that's gone. (group laughs)
Travis: We flogged him with it and then it disappeared.
Liam: I detract my offer.
Travis: It was used very well.
Matt: He gives you a very concerned look.
Travis: I'm a collector of sorts.
Matt: Both of you. And he goes, And he goes, "I work in trade, meaning gold pieces for my wares."
Laura: Yes.
Matt: "If you have interest, purchase. If not, I have other business to attend to."
Sam: Any other healing potions to buy? Come on people.
Laura: Maybe a moderate.
Liam: All right, well friends, we're about to descend into hell itself, so I reckon we should probably pay the price.
Taliesin: Two moderates.
Matt: Greater. In the new edition.
Taliesin: Greater.
Marisha: How much are the greaters?
Matt: "The greater healing potions run 300 gold apiece."
Laura: Oh, let's get a few of those.
Travis: I need like three of those.
Matt: "So, three?"
Travis: Yeah, three.
Laura: Do you have any arrows that--
Travis: Well let's do the potions first.
Laura: Okay okay okay, two for me.
Matt: "So, five."
Taliesin: Two for me as well.
Matt: "Seven."
Travis: Keyleth.
Marisha: I'll take one.
Matt: "Eight."
Travis: Tiberius?
Matt: "Anyone else require a moderate healing potion?"
Travis: Tiberius?
Orion: I could take one.
Matt: Pathfinder to 5E.
Travis: Scanlan?
Sam: Well, do we have ours leftover from what we had before? [LAURA, TRAVIS, MATT] Yes.
Sam: Then I'm fine.
Travis: Vax?
Laura: He's Vax.
Liam: No, I'm good actually.
Laura: He's Vax.
Travis: Oh, my intelligence is six.
Liam: I'm so fast I don't really use them that much.
Travis: So nine.
Liam: You'll get to that point as well.
Laura: Nine potions then.
Travis: Nine times 300, work that out.
Matt: As he pulls up his arcane calculator.
Laura: So 2500 for all nine then.
Taliesin: It's an abacus, God, abacus!
Travis: I believe it's 2700 gold pieces?
Laura: Why would you do that? I was trying to make him--
Matt: "It is 27."
Matt: He says, "Impressive for a goliath. I don't mean to assume, but in my experiences, your kind is--"
Travis: It's Professor Grog, actually.
Orion: All right, calm down.
Matt: "2700 gold pieces for your nine greater healing potions."
Laura: All right, 27. Do you have any arrows that perhaps have magical properties?
Orion: Enchanted arrows is what she's asking for.
Laura: Yes.
Matt: He kind of glances over his shoulder and says, "Ah, we haven't had much a request for arrows in a while. We have bolts for crossbows, as that seems to be the staple for the carvers of the city. I have two sleep arrows, perhaps, if that is of interest to you."
Orion: Yes they would be, very much.
Laura: And what would you charge for those, sir?
Taliesin: Ooh, I should build some interesting arrows.
Marisha: You should.
Matt: Arrows. (whispering and muttering)
Matt: "That would run you 250 gold per arrow. I have two currently."
Laura: All right, all right, I'll take 'em.
Matt: "All right, 500 gold. With that, that is a total of 3200 gold pieces."
Travis: Scanlan, underwater breathing or air, oxygen supplies?
Orion: Dear sir, have you happened upon any--
Travis: Ask with your fancy talk.
Orion: --relic or artifact around here, or heard of something called the Pale Stone?
Laura: Sorry, you have to watch us buy things.
Orion: This is a rare artifact I've been looking for for quite some time.
Orion: I figured an environment like this might lend to something.
Laura: What is it a mess you've made?
Matt: "I don't believe I have, but should you come across one, I would be interested to have a look."
Orion: Oh, you appraise?
Matt: "If you don't mind."
Orion: Very good.
Sam: And do you have anything for adventuring underwater or for helping to breathe in tight spaces?
Matt: "Mm, potion of waterbreathing, I do happen to have."
Sam: A potion of waterbreathing?
Matt: "Yes, I do."
Sam: How much?
Matt: "I have four of them available, and they run 500 gold apiece."
Sam: Jesus.
Travis: We'll take it. We got all this platinum I forgot about.
Sam: Take one, two, one?
Laura: Don't say that!
Travis: He can't hear--
Orion: I don't need one. I bring out my bottle of air. And I go, "I have this." And I put it back in.
Sam: I'm okay as well. You want one, Grog?
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: All right, we'll just take one of those.
Travis: Just one?
Sam: Well, I don't need it. He doesn't need it.
Travis: We'll take two.
Sam: Two.
Matt: "1000 gold. That brings us to 4200 gold."
Laura: Wait, 42?
Matt: "Yes."
Liam: Have you any elven gear for a son of Syngorn?
Laura: Are you taking it off of your pot now?
Travis: Yep.
Matt: He gives you a keen look and goes, "We don't get many requests for this, but I think this may fit you." And he reaches below and pulls up a fine piece of mithril chain, elven in make.
Laura: That's what I'm wearing.
Matt: Mm hm.
Travis: Show-off.
Matt: He says, "Would you perhaps be interested in this elven chain?"
Liam: It's beautiful. I am a bit of a light-footed one. Would it suit me?
Matt: "Hm. Chain does make a bit of a racket. Might not recommend it, unfortunately."
Liam: All right. I'll pass.
Travis: You couldn't buy it for me?
Laura: It won't fit you, it's for elves.
Liam: You're gigantic.
Travis: Could go on my pinky or something.
Laura: All right, cool.
Liam: Could fit on your left nut.
Laura: Well, thanks.
Travis: That's an important nut.
Matt: He goes ahead and accepts your gold. Go ahead and mark off 4200 gold for those.
Laura: I did already.
Matt: All right, very well. "Thank you for your patronage. I look forward to hopefully having you back when you return with whatever artifacts you manage to find."
Travis: Thank you, you're very nice.
Laura: Big expensive artifacts.
Taliesin: I say, you're one of the most charming people we've met so far down here.
Travis: And it smells pretty in here.
Matt: "Well of course, they come in rare ordinance in this city, it seems." You hear under his breath a little bit of a mutter. Apparently it's like elves don't like dwarves, it's weird.
Travis: Do we sleep before we get to go kill shit?
Taliesin: We're gonna go sleep.
Travis: Well can we go do that?
Laura: Let's go sleep and then get up in the morning and go down and kill things.
Taliesin: And I'd love to do a crafting roll right before I go to sleep just to put together a little thing.
Matt: What would you like to put together?
Taliesin: I'd like to try and build a bolo arrow, a trapping arrow.
Travis: Yeah!
Matt: Interesting, okay. As you guys head back to the inn where you've rented rooms for the week,
Travis: You clever fucker.
Matt: Which would be at the Iron Hearth Tavern.
Travis: Is Ballsack in there? When we walk in?
Matt: Balgus is not in the tavern, no.
Travis: He's not?
Orion: He's Balgus, Grog.
Matt: No, sorry.
Travis: Really?
Matt: He's got a home.
Travis: Yeah, but doesn't mean he have to go to it.
Matt: True.
Laura: I walk Trinket down into the storage area that he can stay in.
Matt: [bear noise] Trinket goes down begrudgingly.
Orion: Damn it.
Laura: I look around for something that can look like a pillow for him.
Matt: You find a couple of sacks of grain that can probably work.
Laura: I put them down and make them comfy for him.
Matt: Okay, you think they're probably not gonna last the night with those bear claws. But you don't care, it's not your grain.
Laura: That's fine. Also, I feed him.
Matt: Okay, Trinket is very happy. (imitates bear eating) Tears into some meat. You guys make it back to the tavern for an evening's rest. For you--
Taliesin: Not a super complicated thing, but, you know, I've gotta--
Matt: Go ahead and make a Tinker's Kit roll.
Taliesin: What am I rolling with my Tinker's Kit? I've never done this before.
Matt: For this, I would go ahead and make it an intellect modifier to your roll.
Taliesin: Intellect modifier?
Travis: Rock that shit, Perce.
Taliesin: And I'm spending my bonus die as well.
Laura: Oh, we have bonus die, don't we? From Scanlan.
Taliesin: Thank God, because I rolled really badly. 10.
Matt: 10? You spend and toil away for the next four or so hours trying to find a way to get this trigger to work. Twice you nearly sprain a finger. You manage seemingly get it to function, then the arrow itself splits and shatters. You can see there being something to it, but this night it's not gonna come to you.
Taliesin: I'm gonna have to try again later. Okay, that's fine. It's on the list. That was a terrible roll.
Matt: It was a terrible roll.
Marisha: It's been a bad day for rolls. It's been bad day for rolling.
Laura: Fresh start in the morning.
Sam: Well, tomorrow is the day that it counts, because that's when we begin to crack some heads.
Laura: When we could die.
Taliesin: Out with this system, new dice.
Marisha: To be fair, it's been a long day. I'm still bleeding everywhere.
Sam: Should we rest and get on with it?
Laura: Let's do it!
Sam: Or should we visit some whorehouses?
Travis: Nah, let's sleep.
Sam: Let's just sleep tonight.
Laura: Just sleep and go.
Travis: Oh, they're still tired from the other night.
Sam: Oh yes, one of them battered me quite--
Travis: I don't know what this is.
Sam: That's me getting beaten up by a whore dwarf.
Travis: Oh, it's you getting the elbow drop.
Travis: She's giving you the Randy Savage from the bedpost.
Travis: Oh yeah! (crosstalk)
Travis: We're sleeping now.
Matt: All right. So you guys go to sleep. Wake up the next morning fully healed, spells restored, well rested and ready for the day. You think it's day. It's hard to tell. Still, this underground circumstance is really messing with you guys.
Sam: Well, should we go plunder some mines and kill some goblins?
Laura: Let's do it.
Taliesin: Let's go plunder some mines.
Travis: So we head down to the mines.
Matt: All right.
Travis: To the hole.
Matt: All right.
Travis: ♫ Takin' it to the hole ♫
Matt: You make your way down to the bottom ring of Kraghammer. To the mines proper. The miners have gone back to work, and from what you can see, there's just an all around crazy business with people cleaning out, still trying to clean out the ichor that's on the ground left over from the battle you guys had the day before. You make your way to the front of the mines, and immediately three of the carvers that are standing at the front approach as you begin to walk, and then upon noticing you, kind of like, step back and put their weapons to the side.
Travis: Yep.
Matt: Acknowledging the orders they received from Lord Greyspine.
Laura: Oh, Trinket's with us.
Matt: Trinket has come along with you.
Sam: Trinket the bear, Trinket the bear.
Laura: I just saw that, don't forget Trinket. I didn't forget Trinket.
Matt: I assume Trinket comes with you unless you say otherwise.
Matt: In general.
Travis: Are they especially bowing to Scanlan the snake slayer?
Matt: (laughs) No. (group laughs)
Travis: No love!
Matt: They're busy working.
Matt: And fair play to the gnome, but they're dwarves.
Sam: Sure.
Orion: Yeah. They see that crap all the time.
Matt: You make your way into the mine proper. It goes back for a good 10 minutes of walking and of winding. You can see the actual track of the minetrack leading around. You come upon a couple of dwarves that look over their shoulders begrudgingly at you guys as you pass going, "Hey? Eh, shh," and go right back into mining whatever remains in the inside of this. It looks like this portion of the mine has been nearly picked clean. The dwarves that are in there are probably just wasting time to get their pay for the day. You go further back and eventually it opens up. I think I have the map available.
Liam: I've got it right here.
Sam: It's over there.
Matt: Cool.
Sam: Can you put it so that the people can see?
Laura: Oh, yeah.
Sam: Is that a thing?
Travis: They can't see that.
Matt: We can put it on there perhaps. For the most part I'll be describing it as you go, so it's not too important.
Laura: Okay.
Taliesin: Looks like Italy.
Matt: Yes.
Travis: It's a boot.
Marisha: It's the boot, yeah.
Matt: Following it, you get to a portion of the mine that is very busy. You can see, since this is probably one of the portions that wasn't collapsed in previous incursions buy whatever creatures these were, you get the feeling that this one has basically taken most of their workforce to try and find and carve a new vein. Or find a new path to pull things from. You get towards the portion where all these dwarves are working, and you notice that some of the doors have been shattered, knocked off the hinges. You imagine whatever creatures were barreling through before, this is probably where they came through.
Laura: All right.
Taliesin: That's where we're going.
Travis: Make an arcane check. Somebody with arcane.
Laura: Oh yeah, can I look around? Perception.
Matt: You look around. What are you looking for?
Laura: I'm looking for, you know. (group laughs)
Travis: Be specific.
Taliesin: 15 arcana check.
Laura: Scratch marks for anything.
Marisha: I like the idea of magic perception.
Taliesin: I just wanna see if there's anything familiar about the markings, if I can identify any signs of something mystical that's come through here.
Travis: Like a portal or a prison or a--
Matt: That'd be more of an investigation roll.
Taliesin: Oh, well, alright.
Laura: I'm gonna look for tracks.
Matt: Okay. That'll be an investigation roll for you as well.
Marisha: I'm gonna assist her, look for animal tracks.
Laura: I'm scared, I don't know which one to roll. Both my die have been rolling so bad.
Orion: I want to detect magic for a while.
Matt: All right. (loud thud)
Matt: Aid roll, Keyleth?
Laura: This one is no longer in service.
Taliesin: Oh, wow!
Marisha: Five.
Travis: Well hers is a lot better.
Marisha: Good.
Liam: Sorry, I've got the map, so I'm looking at the mine. Are we still in the dwarven carved out, sort of structure portion of the mine.
Matt: You are. You have just essentially started on that map.
Sam: So let's go down.
Liam: Guys, I'm holding a map. I see one room that they've scrawled "Supply" on, so it should be the next right up ahead. I'd like to just take a peek in there and see what we can see before we head deeper in.
Matt: All right, you are--?
Laura: I rolled a one again.
Matt: A natural one.
Laura: A natural one. Vax and I get dressed up in Sherlock Holmes cosplay, and we say, "Golly gee, I think I see some animal tracks over here."
Taliesin: They are staring at their own footprints on the ground.
Marisha: "The trail's going cold!"
Taliesin: Following around in a circle.
Matt: Oh man, this has turned completely back from the first game. You guys are failing consistently.
Laura: Everything.
Matt: Let's turn this around, let's turn this around.
Liam: Anyhow, I've got a map, so let's use this. Stay on point here.
Matt: You make your way towards the supply room as you head to where it was. One of the dwarves is guarding it. Not a carver, just one of the miners that was hired for this purpose is standing there. Leads you into the door, kind of opening it for you, awkwardly going, "All right, whatever you're looking for, fine. Go inside." Looking inside, there are just racks and racks and racks of pickaxes, shovels, utensils for the purpose of mining and constructing. There are wooden boards lying down. There are just giant barrels of nails and clipping utensils, and things that are used in the continuous expansion of a mine.
Liam: I've seen enough. We should keep going. (group laughs) This map says that there's an elevator a short ways up.
Laura: That goes down.
Liam: That goes down. But then there's a railway that goes further in into the caves, so I'm not sure.
Laura: We should probably go down.
Marisha: Yeah, I feel like going down.
Liam: Elevator straight down?
Marisha: Let's go further, all the way down.
Sam: How many of us can the elevator hold?
Matt: Elevator can pretty much hold all of you guys.
Sam: Okay, let's go.
Liam: It's a safe assumption that Lady Kima did not just walk to the back of the upper floors, she probably went down.
Sam: Yeah, let's go down, come on!
Liam: Get shit done, let's go.
Matt: All right.
Laura: Let's do it.
Marisha: Get low.
Travis: Air high five.
Liam: We have a map to the elevator.
Travis: Make 10.
Matt: As you guys are walking over to where the elevator is, you do notice there are two places in the mines where there is just large piles of rubble. And part of the ceiling has collapsed. You can see that there were portions where the mine expanded much deeper into the mountain that were detonated or collapsed in the idea of preventing any further incursion by whatever these creatures are pouring through. You also can see that there are some dwarven corpses being loaded out from the mine below, as well as goblin corpses, individuals that were caught in the attack that happened yesterday before it managed to emerge from the mine.
Liam: Scanlan, are you all right around these goblin corpses?
Laura: We should follow those.
Sam: Any goblin corpse is a good goblin, I say. I'm fine with it. I'll just quickly spit on their bodies as they go by.
Matt: And you do so quite quickly (spits). It's rapid, it's amazing.
Laura: So we follow the corpses and see where they're coming from.
Matt: All right. So that heads away from the elevator.
Sam: No no no, no no no. That's being taken to be buried, let's just keep--
Laura: No no no, where they're coming from.
Sam: Oh.
Liam: So we could either go to the rear of the mine on this level and see where they're coming from.
Laura: I thought we already went downstairs?
Liam: No, not yet.
Matt: There's a spiral staircase on the map. On the lower right hand side.
Liam: Yes, I see it.
Matt: That's where they're coming from.
Laura: Does that lead down probably?
Matt: It seems to.
Laura: Well then let's take the elevator, whatever. Let's go down.
Matt: All right.
Travis: You should put it under the thing.
Taliesin: We're good with down.
Matt: You guys go ahead and approach the elevator. It's a large wooden platform with a series of chains. My terrible, hastily drawn map there for you.
Travis: It's kinda crap, but it's kinda great.
Matt: Yeah, I know. It was actually more designed as a DM utensil, but you guys needed a map--
Travis: I love it.
Matt: --so I gave you my map.
Travis: There you go.
Laura: Take it back.
Matt: So I'm taking it back. (group laughs)
Orion: Give it to me.
Matt: It's-a mine. No, I'm keeping it. It's all right. So you get back to the elevator. There's a large 15 by 20 platform with a series of chains and there are two dwarves in the back that run a giant iron wheel. As you approach, they kind of give you a look, like, "Well, are you serious about going down?" [Travis, Laura, and Marisha] Yeah.
Matt: "Okay, step on the platform."
Laura: Let's do it. The two dwarves grab and begin to rotate the giant wheel, as it does you here the winch and the chain begin to tighten as it does. The platform shudders for a second, begins to lower. As it begins to lower, you can feel the actual platform shake a little bit as the whole weight is placed on the chains.
Taliesin: Guys. We're on an elevator.
Marisha: This is scary.
Orion: I love elevators.
Matt: As the winch begins to release, it--
Laura: I pet Trinket, calm him down.
Marisha: I've never been on one of these before.
Matt: Trinket is a little nervous.
Marisha: It's really tight.
Taliesin: I'm on an elevator with a bear.
Marisha: It's really dark, tight.
Orion: Oh, light! (snaps)
Taliesin: Thank you.
Laura: Are we down yet?
Marisha: Keyleth's getting a little claustrophobic. She's never been in this tight of a space.
Travis: Are you claustrophobic?
Matt: As the light spell bursts out from his staff. You all kind of have to cover your eyes for a second. But the lower area is opened up.
Liam: Word of warning, Tiberius.
Laura: Can we see out?
Orion: She said it was dark, and then I cast my spell.
Travis: Yeah, it's what you do.
Matt: (imitates loud thudding) You guys hit the bottom floor. You step off the platform, and you can see there is a secondary minecart that leads from this elevator that curves to the left and leads deeper into the mine proper. To the right of you is the spiral staircase. And you can see now two of the other miner dwarves are dragging a dead body across.
Laura: Can I look for goblin tracks down here and follow those?
Matt: (laughs) You can attempt another investigation check.
Sam: Why don't we just ask the dwarves where they were getting the bodies?
Travis: You're gonna roll crap. You're gonna roll crap.
Laura: Don't curse me.
Marisha: Please don't do that.
Laura: What am I, what is it? That I add it to?
Matt: Investigate.
Laura: Perception?
Matt: Investigate. But you advantage on the roll, because you're a ranger, tracking.
Laura: Oh sweet. Okay.
Sam: Why don't we just ask?
Laura: Well that's good, okay. Let's go with a 17.
Matt: 17, alright. So as you guys are going to ask somebody about this, your ranger gets down and begins inspecting the floor.
Laura: Yeah, I see things!
Matt: Where you can see there were struggles that apparently occurred. You can see slash marks on the ground. You can see bodies, or the impacts of bodies where some of these dwarves have been pulled away. A few minutes later, you can see tracks, dwarven tracks, of bodies being pulled and dragged, not in the direction they're going, but further down the tunnel.
Travis: Yeah, let's go there.
Laura: Oh, no.
Matt: As you look and follow that track, you notice that maybe a good 200 feet to the left of the cavern, there is a new tunnel breach that is currently open. About a 20 by 15 size tunnel that is fresh and blasted out from the other side. You can see rubble and rocks strewn across the floor.
Laura: I hear, I hear birds coming from the--
Travis: It's a fucking trip, right?
Laura: I know.
Sam: Let's go down there. Let's go down where it's dangerous.
Matt: All right.
Laura: Can we see?
Travis: Can we ask one of the guards?
Taliesin: It's a mine canary.
Liam: Is it black or is it dim?
Matt: With his light spell, it's fairly bright.
Travis: Nice!
Matt: Otherwise, it's fairly dim.
Travis: I cup my hands over my face and go, Grog, Grog, Grog. (laughs)
Matt: And it does echo. Grog, Grog, Grog, Grog.
Laura: Why would you do that?
Travis: Why not?
Matt: (faintly) Grog-Grog. Grog. Following the tracks, you can see the dragging of the bodies does indeed go in the direction, and into the newly carved tunnel. In this mine network.
Laura: All right.
Matt: What you do notice is the dwarves' bodies that are being dragged away: you can see footprints of those that are also pulling them aside. You kind of figure out the idea of the pattern of the footsteps that are leading in that direction.
Laura: Big, small?
Matt: Most of them are also dwarven in shape.
Laura: Oh, okay.
Marisha: Most of them.
Matt: So, there are, you can gather, dwarven feet dragging dwarven bodies deeper inside.
Liam: Duergar.
Laura: Dwarven centipede.
Liam: It's the duergar.
Matt: However, there are two bodies that are being dragged with no footprints whatsoever.
Travis: What?
Laura: Wings.
Sam: They're being used like skateboards. (group laughs)
Marisha: Legolas style.
Orion: Who and what are those?
Liam: This is 2015.
Travis: Is there any residue?
Marisha: Yeah.
Sam: Wow, if only we had asked some dwarves what's been going on down here.
Laura: Is there any residue, blood?
Orion: We already know.
Laura: Green, red, black.
Matt: From the dragging marks, there is no blood. There's no signs of them dragging dead bodies off, at least.
Laura: Does it look like they struggled?
Matt: No, there's no struggle either.
Travis: Oh crap, fire.
Marisha: What about the walls? How close are the walls?
Matt: The walls here for this tunnel are about 15, 20 feet in width. And about 10, 15 feet high.
Marisha: Are there any scratch marks or anything like that on the walls?
Matt: No.
Liam: Let's stop dicking around and go into that mine.
Travis: Yeah.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Laura: Might as well.
Matt: All right.
Travis: We go further.
Matt: You push further in. (Liam imitates sword being drawn)
Matt: So, this tunnel, pitch black. There's no light source aside from the one that you're creating. You guys push forward. And push forward, following the tracks. And push forward. And the the tunnel winds and winds and descends. And winds and descends. About two hours-- [Laura, Marisha, Travis, and Sam] What?!
Matt: --of following this tunnel with little variation.
Laura: Should've grabbed some dried fruit.
Travis: We got a ton.
Matt: Steadily declining and winding as it progresses. Three hours go by. This tunnel goes extremely deep. Whatever managed to dig its way up here came from pretty far under this mine.
Laura: At no point does it look like the bodies ever moved?
Matt: Nope, no change in physicality. No sign of struggle.
Marisha: But there are the drag marks all the way?
Matt: Yeah.
Liam: And two hours ago, I started stealthing and taking the lead. When we're in the dark.
Matt: All right, go ahead and roll a stealth check.
Laura: I thought I was tracking.
Liam: Uh, 29.
Laura: Whoo, that's a good roll. Yay, first good roll of the night.
Matt: All right, there we go. Your luck is changing now.
Laura: Changing it around.
Travis: Let me touch you.
Matt: You feel pretty stealthy. You guys look like, wait, where the hell did Vax go?
Marisha: Oh shit, I hope he didn't hear me just say that about him. Dammit.
Laura: Oh thank you, brother.
Taliesin: I'm having a serious Tom Sawyer island vibe.
Laura: I found him.
Liam: Looks fine.
Matt: About four hours--
Marisha: Are there any drafts? Do I feel any wind flows or anything like that?
Matt: No. It is still. It is stagnant air. (Laura coughs) Even more stagnant now. Four hours of traveling deeper into this tunnel's path until--
Laura: Anybody else have to go to the bathroom?
Travis: He rolled, he rolled something.
Laura: Oh no, he rolled.
Marisha: And so, that is how I spent my 12th birthday.
Sam: Great story, Keyleth. And, yeah.
Marisha: Let's see, what else.
Travis: Hey Scanlan, you kill me, I kill you.
Liam: There a great little cave alcove here, perfect for peeing in.
Laura: Oh brother, good to see you.
Liam: For everyone to pee.
Laura: Am I over here, or am I over here? Perhaps we could take a pee break here and proceed further into the mines.
Marisha: I agree with that.
Laura: That's a good idea.
Liam: Do you catch my drift?
Matt: As the four hour mark of travel into this tunnel presents itself, the tunnel finally widens and opens. As the sound of distant water rushing reaches your ears.
Laura: Oh no, I have to go to the bathroom.
Matt: As Tiberius steps into this opening, the light cascades into this new cavern. A large, beautiful open space presents itself, a good 100-foot-up ceiling. From what you can see, a roaring river is now pouring out of the nearby rock, cascading over a cliffside into a waterfall down into this deeper, giant cavernous space.
Laura: What about the tracks?
Matt: The tracks continue in the direction of that river.
Marisha: Into the river? Like it goes into the water?
Laura: Do we want to step into the room fully?
Marisha: Why don't we send--
Laura: I'm gonna stealth. I'm gonna stealth, too.
Marisha: Stealth twins.
Orion: Do I detect any magic? Stealth twins, 2015.
Matt: You detect no magic. You roll stealth.
Laura: 17.
Matt: Let's go ahead and take a bio break--
Laura: Okay.
Matt: --as the mystery begins to unveil. (group laughs)
Orion: I love a mystery.
Matt: Be back here in about five, ten minutes, folks. So keep an ear out.
Travis: Quick, quick break.
Orion: I'm gonna pee my face off. (Liam imitates rushing water)
Matt: We'll be right back.
Orion: Enjoy our butt shots, everybody.
Matt: And everyone runs off to take care of their business.
Travis: Right, listen up. If you have ale, then you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw. A goliath of towering height and size, this barbarian has an appetite for the two-- [audio resets]
Travis: Right, listen up. If you have ale, then you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw. A goliath of towering height and size, this barbarian has an appetite for the two great loves in his life: combat, women, and ale. (record scratches) Wait. Easily the brains of the group, Grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes, colors, and shiny things. Also ale. In his early years, armed with his two-handed great axe, Grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst the ranks of his family's wandering herd. But after coming upon an unsuspecting, elderly gnome in the woods, he objected to the killing of such an innocent life. A creature of impulse, Grog felt only pity for this, this terrified little thing. [no audio]

But after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly gnome in the woods, he objected to the killing of such an innocent life. A creature of impulse, Grog felt only pity for this, this terrified little thing. His disobedience cost him dearly. Beaten bloody and banished by the herd leader, his uncle Kevdak, Grog was abandoned and left to die. Exiled from his herd, it was then that the relative of the very gnome he fought to save, saved him. It was the kindness of a gnome cleric named Pike that healed Grog, bringing him back from death's edge. And they have remained close friends ever since. Most nights, Grog can be found challenging entire taverns to wrestling matches. Or accompanying Scanlan to the nearest house where you pay for lady favors. Also ale.
Marisha: A first impression of Keyleth would leave you with little information on the half-elven druid. You might even think that her social awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is kind of sweet. Of course, it would be unwise to underestimate her based on first impressions. (lightning roars) Under that unintimidating petite frame is a vicious beast waiting to be unleashed, whose natural powers have made even the fiercest of champions pee their pants. Literally. Born to the air tribe of the Ashari people, Keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and the elemental magics. It is her people's inherent duty to protect the delicate areas in Tal'Dorei, where the four elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm. Since she was a little girl, she had quite a knack for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities. Well, if you consider kittens and flying squirrels to be little beasts, which I do. Anyways, it wasn't long before the headmaster of the tribe, her father, Kohren, realized her true prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster. Just like that, her jovial childhood was stripped and replaced with endless spell memorization, teachings from ancient traditions, and exceedingly high expectations. Every druid leader-to-be must embark on a journey to seek out the sister tribes in order to introduce and establish respect amongst the fellow headmasters. They call this the Aramente, or Noble Odyssey. When her father felt she was ready, he set her on the path to truly discovering herself. Not knowing when, or if, she will ever return. As she hikes down the mountain towards Stillben, she meditated on the task ahead. Part of the Aramente is proving yourself a strong warrior, a valiant protector, and a wise and compassionate leader. With this knowledge, one thought plays in repeat in her mind: Is she even worthy?
Taliesin: Percy was the third child of seven children, born to a noble family who lived far to the north in the ancient castle of Whitestone. With so many siblings to share the burdens of lordship, Percy turned his attention to the sciences, engineering, and naturalism. One day, a mysterious couple named Lord and Lady Briarwood came to court. During a feast held in their honor, the Briarwoods violently took control of the castle, killing or imprisoning everyone who would stand in their way. Percy awoke chained in the dungeon, only to be freed by his younger sister. Together they fled, chased by the Briarwoods' men. As they ran, Percy's sister took several arrows to the chest and fell. Percy kept running, eventually jumping into a freezing river and floating unconscious to freedom. He did not remember waking up on a fishing boat. He barely remembered the next two years, as he slowly made his way as far south as possible. Then one night, Percy had a dream. A roaring cloud of smoke offered him vengeance against those who destroyed his family. When he awoke, Percy began to design his first gun. (gun cocking) (gun firing)
Sam: Oh, you haven't heard of Scanlan Shorthalt? Well, gird your loins, ladies, because he has his eye on you. A talented musician, master of disguise, and dashingly handsome in his own mind, Scanlan sings songs almost as much as he sings his own praises. Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used his endless charm and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and support his single mother. One day he was discovered by a half-orc promoter and joined Dr. Dranzel's Spectacular Traveling Troupe, where he learned the ways of the world and honed his skills as a bard extraordinaire. A loner much of his life, Scanlan has never quite come to terms with the violent death of his mother at the hands of a goblin invasion. While his years on the road provided many, shall we say, educational experiences with the opposite sex, deep down Scanlan yearns for the one thing he's never known: the true love of a fellow gnome. Still, Scanlan considers himself a lover first, performer second, and fighter distant third. On the battlefield, he'll support his allies but rarely draws blood unless it's to protect fellow gnome Pike. Count on Scanlan for a hearty laugh, a rollicking song, and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts and makes the females swoon.
Orion: (clears throat) Greetings and salutations. I am Tiberius Stormwind. I hail from a town called Ty'rex, located in the heart of Draconia, from a politically respected family. At the age of 15, I succeeded in passing the Sorcerer's Rite, showing prodigy-like control of my magic. The judges and the Draconian high council were amazed at how powerful my spells were for how long I had been training. At 20 years old, I was the youngest appointed member of the magic guild in Draconian history. For the next few years, I almost went mad from the malaise of being a guild member, as it's rather boring. However, one day I happened upon a chamber, unused for quite some time. In the room were stacks of books and maps of the surrounding cities and areas around the known world. For months I would frequent the chamber and learned of artifacts from legend. After a long period of research, I made a list of artifacts that caught my eye. I brought these findings to the high council and was told that all of the information in the chamber I stumbled upon was either believed to be fiction or unsolvable mysteries and hence were lost forever. I found those answers to be unacceptable. A year later I devised a ruse and managed to convince the city council to lend support in me leaving Draconia on a mission of peace and diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms. Going from town to town and making friends and allies, in and for the name of Draconia. Being a red dragonborn, I had quite the task on my hands in that respect, but it was exactly what I needed, so I could explore the world and find these artifacts, as I felt the truth was out there. Some may describe me as buffoonish, but I say poppycock to all that. (stammers) I am much sharper than most give me credit for. I just don't pay attention to things sometimes. I've also been known to be rather cunning, loyal, happy-go-lucky, and well, dangerous. I can't help but show my true scales every now and then. But overall, I think I'm quite friendly for a dragonborn.
Liam: Never entirely welcome in the company of elves or men, Vax'ildan learned at a young age to skip past formality, preferring instead to invite himself in your door. Along with twin sister Vex'ahlia, Vax was born by a chance encounter between elven royalty and human peasantry. Raised by their mother in their early years, the twins were eventually sent off to their father in the elven capital of Syngorn. But their cool reception among the elves there never warmed, and their time in the capital didn't last. The siblings stole away one autumn night and set out on the open road. After a few years of wandering, they eventually decided to return to their mother and journeyed back to the lands of their youth. But instead of finding their childhood home, they returned to a pile of rubble. Their mother was gone, their home burned to ash. Pressing the townspeople for answers, they learned of the day the dragon came. With their ties all severed, Vax'ildan and his sister set out to find their fortune together in Tal'Dorei. An outsider since birth, Vax quickly learned to solve life's challenges in his own particular way, often by sidestepping them entirely. And when his knack for circumventing adversity isn't enough-- (sword slicing) --the way of blades the elves schooled him in more than makes up the difference.
Laura: Like so many half-elves, Vex'ahlia has spent most of her life suffering the cool reception of a people who don't fully accept her. Born of a human mother and an elven father, who only later in life took an interest in their existence, Vex'ahlia and her twin brother Vax'ildan quickly realized the only people they could truly rely on in this world were each other. It was at the age of ten when the two were taken from their mother and brought to live in Syngorn, the isolated elven city for which their father was an ambassador. He quietly took them in but always kept an icy distance, and after too many years of disdainful looks, the pair decided to leave his indifference behind and set out on their own. Vax took to the cities, stealing small trinkets and learning the ways of the thief, while Vex kept to the woods. She preferred the isolation. Always the keen observer, she learned to hunt and to track, to spy and to shoot. And through a series of fateful events, earned herself a companion in the form of a bear, her own stolen Trinket, to fight alongside her and protect her fiercely. Also, he is adorable and gives expert massages.
Producer: And back to you. Welcome back. Thank you for waiting. We've all had our fill of snacks, drinks, and relieving ourselves of the ones we had earlier. So, before we return, we actually want to thank you guys for having all the subscriptions you have. Since we started playing, we hit a thousand very quickly. You guys are awesome.
Travis: Yeah! So thank you for that. Big round of applause.
Travis: Round of applause. Subscriptions have been awesome. And as such, we have a winner for these evening's event. Hi, Tiberius.
Orion: Sorry everyone. Tiberius has returned. So, in character as always. So, the winner of the evening is going to win both a signed photo of the cast of Critical Role as well as a signed Player's Handbook of D&D's 5th Edition is: (clears throat)
Sam: Visitor. (group laughs) No, on the backside. The winner is Yareth. Congratulations. Thank you for subscribing and paying attention and being in the chatroom and being awesome. We're gonna go ahead and get your information, and we're gonna make sure that you get our awesome first Critical Role giveaway. (group cheers and claps) Well done, Yareth. Thank you for coming.
Marisha: Yareth. (group repeats Yalreth in funny voices)
Matt: All right. (Marisha speaks gibberish)
Liam: Enjoy your Player's Handbook 5E.
Matt: (laughs) Hopefully more to come down the road. We'll have more fun things for you guys. So, anyway. So, bringing it back to the game at hand. As you've stepped into this large, cavernous space, you can hear the rush of water as the underground river begins to turn into a waterfall and drifts into a smaller body of water. It's just out of sight beyond this cliff face. Into this open, cavernous area.
Laura: Oh, we just stealthed.
Matt: You guys also stealthed, and what did you roll for stealth?
Laura: I rolled 17.
Matt: 17, got it. All right.
Liam: Oh, less than that.
Laura: You didn't.
Liam: Oh, no I didn't, 18.
Matt: All right.
Laura: You were already stealthed, though.
Liam: That's true.
Matt: As you guys step into this space, there are sections of large rock, portions of stone that just jut out and block off portions from your view of this area. Giant stalagmites and stalactites that just permeate the entirety of this cavern, which has been long, just building and building with elements drawn from the ceiling, from the waters that flow through. You also faintly see a light source--
Laura: (whispers) Oh no.
Matt: --behind one of those rock pillars in the distance.
Laura: (whispers) Should we go check it out?
Liam: Do we perceive anything in here with us before going that far in, yes?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Liam: 18.
Matt: 18?
Liam: Yes.
Matt: You hear a very, very faint sound in the distance. (sharp noise)
Sam: Jesus. (laughing)
Orion: Did you hear that?
Matt: That's not the sound. Tiberius.
Orion: I'm sorry.
Laura: I have a passive perception of 21.
Matt: Yes you do. You hear a: (clicks tongue quickly)
Laura: Oh, no.
Sam: A skittering.
Matt: (continues clicking)
Liam: I might hear spiders.
Marisha: Oh.
Laura: Ugh.
Travis: Or crab.
Liam: Or something.
Marisha: Making it old school.
Sam: Maybe it's a very faint maraca dance of some sort.
Laura: What direction is it coming from?
Travis: That would be better.
Matt: It's hard to tell at this point, it seems to be just kind of loosely atmospheric.
Travis: Is the light coming from over the water?
Matt: The very, very faint light you see, no. It's adjacent to the water to the right of you.
Travis: Okay.
Liam: I think we're dealing with spiders.
Matt: (continues clicking)
Laura: I think you guys should hang back, and we should stealth over and see how many it looks like we're dealing with.
Liam: The twins will creep forward.
Matt: Okay. You both creep forward.
Laura: Trinket stays with the group. Trinket, stay with Grog.
Orion: I'm gonna dispel my light spell.
Matt: Pitch darkness falls upon all of you.
Travis: What did you do that for?
Sam: Because now they don't know where we are.
Laura: But we can't see anything.
Travis: They're spiders.
Marisha: While he does that, I'm gonna go ahead and turn into a cave bear.
Orion: Can you not see now?
Laura: We can see in dim light.
Marisha: Cave bears have darkvision.
Marisha: I'm pretty sure.
Liam: No, dim light only.
Matt: Do they?
Laura: What'd you turn into?
Orion: It doesn't matter, do you want me to turn it back on?
Taliesin: A cave bear.
Marisha: Yeah, subterranean bears, they have darkvision.
Matt: All right. So.
Sam: He can just make light again.
Matt: Go ahead and roll a perception check.
Liam: Turn it back on.
Marisha: No, leave it off!
Orion: I dispel it again, I'm sorry.
Marisha: Fuck! Fuck!
Matt: Light, light light, light light.
Taliesin: How did you do that?
Marisha: It's been a bad night.
Laura: Oh no.
Marisha: 12 total.
Liam: Clap on (claps), clap off. (claps)
Matt: As you glance about in cave bear form, you look up and all you can make out is shifting movement across the ceiling. (group groans at once)
Matt: But it's large. It's not a small creature. You glance off to your left and you look up and you see a second one.
Laura: Oh no.
Travis: Oh fuck.
Matt: And both dislodge.
Laura: Oh no!
Matt: All of you hear two loud, cacophonous, thunderous slam sounds-- (imitates loud thudding)
Laura: Definitely hit light now.
Matt: --on the ground next to you-- (screeching noise)
Liam: I quickly whisper to my sister, to the boundaries.
Marisha: And I just go  (roaring noise)
Orion: Light!
Matt: All right.
Liam: Vex and Vax dance backwards against the walls.
Matt: There is a surprise round.
Laura: Oh, no. (group groans)
Travis: Oh God.
Liam: But I heard them.
Marisha: I know. (roars)
Laura: Transform back.
Matt: All right. So you guys are stealthed off to the side there.
Liam: That's beautiful.
Laura: I'm on the other side.
Liam: Look at that fun map.
Matt: There's Trinket.
Liam: Thank you, Matt, for doing all the work on these maps and shit.
Matt: That's what I do. So there's the water there, rushing off into the waterfall that goes further down.
Laura: Can I stealth against the other wall?
Travis: Waterfall is where on that map?
Matt: The waterfall is right here.
Travis: Got it.
Matt: So the river kind of pours over, falls into the water below. There are some of these large rock elements here.
Sam: What are they?
Matt: You cannot tell what's beyond this area, which is where the light source is coming from. (imitates thudding)
Laura: Oh no! (group groans) (imitates thudding)
Travis: Those look like umber hulks.
Matt: They are. (group screams) You've had one brief run-in with a single umber hulk in the past.
Laura: Now we have two. As two slam into the ground beside you, dropping from the ceiling portion.
Laura: Fudge!
Travis: I have their claws still.
Laura: Wait, do you guys remember-- (Matt growls and snarls)
Laura: Do they respond to vibration?
Orion: I cast stoneskin on myself immediately. You don't have that much time, unfortunately. Because they are upon you, it a surprise round.
Travis: Shit!
Laura: Do they respond to vibration? I forget.
Travis: They responded to something.
Matt: They respond to the something.
Laura: Can we remember with investigation or insight?
Liam: Limericks, limericks, they respond to limericks.
Matt: So this one shifts up over there, and this one moves up to there. Gleans past you, as it does not notice you.
Laura: Yeah, but it's still big.
Matt: This one comes towards you, Percy.
Taliesin: Damn it.
Matt: Attacking you with each of its claws and its mandibles. The first strike comes at you with a 13 to hit with its first claw. What's your AC?
Taliesin: Ah, 17.
Matt: You, woomf, just manage to dodge out of the way as these giant-bladed claws sweep next to your face. The second strike comes to you at a 21.
Travis: Oh shit. That hits.
Taliesin: That hits. I'm going to use a gunslinger's dodge.
Laura: Gunslinger's dodge.
Taliesin: Wait, let's see if I can do this. It's not enough, nevermind, so no. I just gotta take it.
Matt: All right, so the claw finds purchase across your torso. (imitates claw slicing) The armor catches most of it. However, the slash does leave an impact on you, as you can feel the taste of iron in the back of your throat. You suffer nine points of slashing damage.
Taliesin: Oh, okay.
Matt: And just as you pull back the mandibles, time to crunch down upon you. And that is going to be a 27 to hit.
Laura: Oh, no.
Travis: Do their eyes do something?
Matt: You take 14 points of slashing damage, as the mandibles slice down, clamping onto your shoulder. You manage to pull free, but in doing so, you wrench the pointed portions of the mandible across your shoulder, pulling open the flesh in this horrible jagged pattern.
Taliesin: Ow.
Matt: That brings us to the other one, who is attacking Grog.
Marisha: Grog! You're right there in front of it. The biggest and most viable visual it can find.
Sam: ♫ No motherfucker, miss ♫ I start singing using my Cutting Words reaction. To try to distract him.
Matt: All right, so go ahead and roll your d8 to reduce his attack roll.
Travis: (laughs) No motherfucker, miss.
Sam: d8?
Matt: d8.
Sam: Three.
Matt: All right. That would have been a 20 to hit. That brings it to a 17.
Travis: 18. (group cheers)
Sam: I saved your life!
Matt: So, as you begin singing out, as it pulls back with--
Sam: ♫ No motherfucker ♫
Matt: --its mandibles to strike at Grog, it (clicks) looks off to you for a second, goes back, at which point Grog has put his axe up to its face and is holding it at bay. As its mandibles are tied in with its blades, and the handle of the axe is trying to hold it back. It strikes at you with its two claws, Grog. That is going to be a 27.
Travis: That hits.
Matt: And a 14.
Travis: Misses.
Matt: Okay, then from the one claw that gets you, you take six points of slashing damage.
Travis: Okay.
Matt: All right everyone, roll initiative. (group groans)
Laura: I'm so scared to roll.
Marisha: I know, it's been so bad.
Sam: Best one of I've had.
Taliesin: Ah, not horrible.
Laura: Oh, good.
Travis: Ball sack.
Marisha: Uh, it's okay.
Matt: All right, so, 25 to 20?
Laura: 24.
Matt: 24.
Travis: There you go. A little redemption.
Laura: That's right.
Matt: Nice, we got some Vex up top. 20 to 15 anyone?
Taliesin: 17.
Marisha: 17 as well.
Sam: 19.
Travis: Ah, yeah.
Liam: 15, 15.
Matt: All right, got some Scanlan up there. 17, 17.
Laura: (whispers) They're both surrounding me even with my awesome things.
Matt: Percy, Keyleth.
Matt: So 15 to--
Liam: 15.
Matt: 15.
Orion: 13.
Travis: I'm 14. Tiberius and I are 13-14.
Laura: Ugh, come on Grog!
Matt: Wait, uh, 14?
Orion: 13.
Matt: 14. Grog and Tiberius.
Travis: It's the ghost pepper cookies.
Matt: All right, cool. Top of the round. Vex.
Laura: Hyah! I am going to shoot the one.
Matt: Before you do that--
Sam: Oh, shit!
Matt: As you're going to reach back, you look over into its strange, glistening, black, dead, insect-like eyes of the umber hulk, and you feel this strange wave of mental confusion hit your head. Go ahead and make a--
Travis: I knew it.
Matt: Go ahead and make a saving throw. This is going to be charisma saving throw.
Marisha: Is this what confused you and had you running out the door?
Travis: I fell out a fucking 120 foot hole.
Matt: So you roll d20, add your charisma saving throw at the top of your character.
Laura: Okay, so I gotta do my math. That's 11, but I get a plus two from my ring that I'm wearing for saving throws, so.
Matt: Okay, so it's 13.
Laura: 13.
Matt: All right. The wave of confusion takes hold over your brain. (group groans) We're gonna go ahead and find out what happens. (Laura groans)
Travis: Maybe he'll ask you to make some cookies.
Matt: All right--
Laura: You're gonna have me do nothing wrong?
Matt: You reach for it, and you space out for a second. Your hands fall to your side. And you stand there.
Travis: Aw, fuck.
Matt: Trinket is looking for some sort of cue from you of what to do.
Laura: Does he look confused too?
Matt: No, but Trinket's looking to you for some sort of direction and is getting none. This is a very clustered space, too. Can barely see you over this.
Matt: That brings us to Scanlan.
Laura: But I was stealthed, though.
Sam: Don't worry, I'll help you my dear.
Matt: I know. Doesn't matter if you're stealthed. He couldn't see you, but you could see him.
Sam: I'm gonna take a step back behind Trinket.
Matt: Okay. (Travis Laughs)
Laura: Good call.
Sam: Actually, wait. How far am I from my furthest--
Matt: Are you averting your gaze from the guys, or are you looking at 'em directly?
Sam: No, averting my gaze. But how far am I from my--
Laura: Nobody look at them.
Sam: --my furthest fellow? Oh, I'm 60 feet, okay. And I sing my counter-charm song. ♫ Magic magic, go away, come again another day ♫ So all of us have advantage on saving throws for the charming spells. If they are charming us. I don't know if they are.
Matt: This is confusion.
Sam: No, what?
Matt: I don't think--
Sam: Frightened or charmed, it's not the same thing?
Matt: Mm. This is technically a confusion effect. So yeah.
Sam: Okay.
Laura: Oh, wait. Oh, no.
Sam: Okay.
Matt: So as you finish your song, you're like--
Sam: It did not work.
Matt: Doesn't seem to be having an effect unfortunately.
Sam: Okay. And then as my bonus action, who got hit first? You did? I'll just throw a healing word to him.
Matt: Okay. Just go ahead and roll, feeling him. That's a d4 plus five. Yeah, you got it. Percy.
Taliesin: Mm.
Matt: You heal--
Sam: What is this?
Matt: It's a four.
Sam: Oh, that's a four. Okay.
Matt: So you heal nine hit points, and it's your turn. What do you got, Percy?
Taliesin: Up to 58, let me just fix that, there we go. Okay, where am I on the board?
Matt: You are right here in front--
Taliesin: Okay, so there's no getting away. I'm gonna-- I can basically without-- I remember I'm not supposed to look at these things. I know where this thing is. I can pull my gun and just take a shot, right?
Matt: So averting your gaze, you take a shot. You are at disadvantage on the attack roll.
Taliesin: How much?
Matt: Just disadvantage.
Taliesin: I'm just disadvantage?
Matt: Yeah.
Taliesin: Well okay, that's fine. I'm gonna spend a grit point for a deadshot, so I'm gonna get a plus one to hit.
Matt: All right.
Travis: Come on, Perce.
Taliesin: Aha! That will be a-- with the plus one, that's a 28, 29, 30 to hit.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: Get after it, nasty!
Matt: Roll again, as you have disadvantage. Because you're not looking at it directly.
Laura: Ugh, please be good.
Taliesin: That's still 25 to hit.
Matt: That hits.
Taliesin: 26, actually.
Matt: Go ahead and roll damage.
Taliesin: And then I get extra damage because I did deadshot. So that's plus one, so that will be a-- it's a 2d8 plus five plus ice, because I'm hitting with my ice shot. And that's seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12. 14 points of ice damage.
Matt: 14 points of ice damage. Nice.
Taliesin: And then I have a second shot and I'm just gonna take one more shot at him really quick.
Matt: Okay, also at disadvantage.
Taliesin: I fail. In fact, my gun jams. (group groans)
Matt: Okay. So as you go to fire, it's like you-- (imitates gun firing) fire the first shot averting the gaze.
Laura: We're all gonna die. You spin the barrel, go back to go ahead and fire again, as you do (imitates gun clicking) You pull the trigger for a second, and you feel a slight (imitates fizzled explosion) inside the barrel.
Travis: Damn it!
Marisha: Oh, no.
Matt: And you feel the actual metal get extremely cold, and you have you have to shake it out like, aw, damn it.
Taliesin: Since I can't move, I'm gonna-- my movement, my minor is gonna be just fixing my-- yeah, so.
Matt: Okay, so your action is just trying to fix the gun?
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: All right. That brings us to--
Taliesin: Damn.
Matt: Keyleth.
Laura: Keyleth, don't look at them.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: Just as a note, your inspiration dice that you give can be used on saving throws as well.
Sam: Okay. But I haven't given any.
Matt: No.
Marisha: Um, I'm a bear right now.
Matt: You are a bear, which I will, for the sake of this, give you the kitty.
Marisha: Bring out Minxie.
Travis: Minxie.
Matt: Minxie is the form, but you are a bear.
Marisha: Okay, first and foremost, I'm gonna go ahead-- and I don't know if this is gonna help. But I'm gonna throw up a fog cloud.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Maybe.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: No?
Matt: So fog cloud. The entire space, it's a 20 foot radius? I believe, if I recall from the one he did yesterday.
Marisha: But it screws our vision, though, doesn't it?
Laura: Well, yeah.
Matt: Everybody gets obscured vision.
Marisha: But I mean, we wouldn't be able to see them. Would it help with the confusion is what I'm hoping.
Laura: That could help, that could help.
Sam: Do your thing. Do what you do.
Marisha: Or would it be bad?
Laura: Try it. Do it, Keyleth, go with your instincts.
Taliesin: Don't think about what's the worst that could possibly happen.
Marisha: I'm bursting out a fog cloud, and then--
Matt: Well to cast, you have to get out of creature form, remember?
Marisha: Oh, that's right. I didn't throw a bow.
Matt: So you're a bear.
Marisha: I'm a bear. Nevermind, I'm just gonna do a full round of attacks.
Liam: It's go time, go time! (claps)
Marisha: That one right there.
Laura: Keep your eyes closed.
Matt: All right, so you move up to there. Go ahead and do your full round of attacks.
Matt: I am doing multi-attack.
Matt: Okay, are you averting your gaze or not?
Marisha: I'm a cave bear, I'm blind. I'm like a blind fish. I have darkvision and, like, cataracts.
Matt: Darkvision means you can see in the dark.
Matt: But it doesn't mean that you don't see. (Sam laughs)
Marisha: Well I'm a bear.
Matt: You are a bear. I'm eating at his leg. I'm not looking at his eyes. I'm not, like, waxing poetically at how sexy he is.
Matt: No.
Marisha: Not whispering sweet nothings in his ear.
Matt: I know.
Marisha: I'm gnawing at his leg.
Matt: That's true.
Liam: Go for the kill!
Matt: Make a charisma saving throw.
Marisha: Make a charisma saving throw?
Matt: Yes. (Travis laughs)
Laura: Next time just avert your gaze. [Taliesin And Marisha] Oh!
Marisha: That's good. 16.
Matt: 16? You can feel the oppression of the umber hulk's gaze, but you shrug it off, your bear mind not affected by the measly tricks and traits--
Marisha: Urgh, I'm a bear!
Matt: -of these strange underground entities.
Marisha: Okay. Now I'm attacking.
Matt: Roll for your four attacks.
Marisha: First one probably misses. With my claw, 14.
Matt: 14 misses. (group laughs)
Orion: She got a pizza.
Marisha: With the claw attacks, do I have two claw attacks, do I roll for both?
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: Okay, so the first one is 19,
Matt: Hits.
Marisha: Second one, second claw attack is 18.
Matt: Also hits.
Marisha: Okay. So I am doing 2d6 plus five twice. So six plus--
Taliesin: It's 11.
Marisha: Five, so 11.
Taliesin: Ooh.
Marisha: Plus 17-- 20 damage.
Matt: 20 damage. Nice.
Taliesin: 25.
Marisha: Oh, 25. Sorry, 25.
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: Yes.
Marisha: 25 damage.
Matt: So, as you shake off the effect, you reach for it, lashing out, two large strikes. The second one gets a distinct carve into the back of the umber hulk's hide. You can see a portion of its chitinous back armor gets kind of pulled off in a chunk. And it (snarls), reels back from the impact and readies itself for a second round of attacks.
Marisha: Me and Trinket.
Matt: There you go.
Marisha: Going at this. (Matt laughs)
Marisha: Bear style.
Matt: They go. This one turns towards and moves this way to focus on the cave bear that just thrashed against its hide. While this one turns and moves in towards Grog. But now turns and sees the-- actually no. It stays there, fixed to Grog. So making its multi-strike against you, Keyleth. That is a 26 to hit.
Marisha: Hits.
Matt: That's mandibles. 17 to hit with its claw.
Marisha: Hits.
Matt: And 18 to hit with its claw.
Marisha: Hits.
Matt: All right, so you take six points of slashing damage from the first claw. Eight points of slashing damage from the second claw. And then the mandibles deal fifteen points of slashing damage, as the umber hulk just turns to you, and as a reaction to your assault--
Marisha: What was the last one?
Matt: The last one was 15. Just unleashes an array of strikes against you. (Matt growls)
Liam: Hit it in the face.
Matt: That brings us to the other one who's attacking you, Grog.
Marisha: Back at him, yeah.
Matt: That is a 12 to hit. Pretty sure misses.
Travis: Misses.
Matt: Another 12 to hit, 'cause it likes to roll fours, apparently.
Travis: Give me another four.
Matt: For the mandibles, it's a 20.
Travis: 20 hits.
Matt: You're taking damage, fool. That is 18 points of slashing damage against you.
Travis: I have a half damage to all bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage?
Matt: You haven't raged yet.
Travis: So I'm not raging?!
Matt: You haven't raged yet! It isn't your turn yet.
Travis: But I'm so angry.
Matt: I know. You're about to be so angry.
Travis: 18 points.
Matt: You're gonna be so angry. 18 points of slashing damage. The mandibles crush down on your body, and you can feel them pierce into your chest. Your exposed musculature is then torn in a jagged form as you feel the blood begin to pour down the front of your torso.
Travis: It's all right, it's okay.
Laura: That's brutal.
Travis: My turn's coming.
Matt: That ends their turn. Vax.
Liam: So I can see what's up. I saw what it did to my sister, so I'm gonna jump on its back. I'm gonna swivel my daggers around and just stab it in the face.
Laura: But keep your gaze averted.
Liam: Yeah, I'm seeing the back of his fucking spine or head. I'm gonna stab him in the face twice.
Matt: Go for it.
Liam: Okay.
Liam: Nine-- 20.
Matt: That hits.
Liam: Okay. So then I'll do damage. The other one's an 18. I rolled in advance.
Laura: That counts, that counts!
Matt: That one, that's the one!
Liam: So, 10, plus sneak attack damage, right?
Matt: Yeah.
Liam: Yeah, okay.
Matt: He doesn't know you were there, you were stealthed.
Liam: Okay. One. Four. Eight. Nine. 13, 26, 36 damage from the first dagger.
Marisha: Whoo!
Liam: Face, in his face, and the next was an 18.
Matt: Not in his face. Not in his face.
Liam: Not in his face?
Matt: It's back.
Liam: But I wanted I wanted to do this to his head. Okay, whatever works.
Travis: The reach around?
Orion: The old reach around stabbing.
Liam: The reach around, the reach around. That what I was going for. And then, where's my four, 1d4. One's a three, but no, just three.
Matt: Three, okay.
Liam: With my flametongue dagger which I don't know if he likes or dislikes, but that's what I've done.
Matt: Okay, so, as you leap on its back, grab purchase on one of its chitinous plates, bring your first dagger forward and jam it into the side of its head, as it pulls back, you hear a (snarling) as it reacts to the immediate pain and begins to reach one of its claws to try and knock you off. As you do, you put the blade back into your belt, grab with your other hand, pull your other dagger, and slam it into the other side of its head.
Travis: Yeah!
Matt: This time it shrugs you off, and you manage to just land on your feet barely, behind it, still faced away from you. That brings us to Grog. (Travis grunts) Rage.
Marisha: Rage!
Travis: Now I'm angry.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: I would like to rage, and not only rage, I would like to go into a frenzied rage.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: For three full attacks.
Matt: All right.
Travis: While I'm raging so hard, that I pop all the capillaries in my eyeballs, so I can't really see that well. And I just swing a lot.
Matt: All right, I'm gonna check one thing real fast.
Laura: Oh, no.
Travis: Oh, shit! Don't check, look, I'm rolling. (Marisha and Laura laugh) 30.
Liam: There once was a bard from Nantucket. (group laughs)
Liam: Who got his flute caught--
Travis: I gain one level of exhaustion with a rage hit.
Liam: --in a bucket.
Matt: I will say, situationally, because of the fact that your rage that you have advantage on the saving throw against the confusion effect. [Marisha and Laura] Oh. Your mind is so filled with aggression.
Travis: I got that big, like, nasty thing.
Matt: So make charisma saving throw.
Taliesin: Oh, what a good idea.
Travis: Is that a 20?
Matt: Yep.
Laura: Plus one.
Travis: 11.
Matt: Roll again, you have advantage.
Liam: Better, better, better, no.
Travis: Five.
Laura: Oh no!
Matt: Let's see what happens.
Laura: No!
Orion: Roll a two.
Matt: So-- (group groans)
Laura: Now he's raging, too.
Matt: --as you rage--
Marisha: No, dammit.
Matt: --you feel the influence of the umber hulk's gaze pierce your eyes and the fury fills you, and you reach out and slash with your axe. However, it does not reach for the umber hulk. Go ahead and roll an attack, Grog.
Laura: Oh no, who's he hitting?
Travis: A one! (group cheers)
Sam: Finally!
Marisha: Yes!
Matt: There's a loud clanging sound, as a giant, angry, swooping bladed greataxe misses Tiberius's head by inches.
Orion: Oh! Grog, what are you doing?
Matt: Before slamming into the stone right up against the side of the wall. You can just see now this kind of loose, crazed look in his eye. (growls maniacally)
Matt: Foam begins to gather at the side of his mouth.
Orion: Oh, now you're all screwed up.
Liam: We have a problem.
Laura: Yeah, this could be bad.
Liam: We have an angry Grog.
Matt: Tiberius, you're up.
Orion: Damn it, Grog.
Travis: It's my turn?
Matt: No, that's your turn.
Travis: Oh, that's my turn.
Marisha: Tiberius, help.
Laura: At least your rolled a one.
Travis: I did. I didn't hurt anybody yet.
Orion: I look at Grog, and I'm like, will you stop it! I cast Dispel Magic on him. (Travis snarls)
Matt: Cast Dispel Magic?
Orion: Yeah.
Laura: On Grog?
Matt: Okay.
Sam: I don't think it's magic.
Orion: Yeah, he's being controlled by it.
Travis: He can do whatever.
Liam: It's more natural, it's creature-based.
Travis: She's also being controlled.
Orion: I know, but you're a big, hulking, crazy mofo.
Matt: No, it is a magical force.
Orion: Yes, it is.
Matt: Forced to make a save.
Travis: Save me, save me.
Matt: Go head and make an arcana check. (Sam and Laura sing along with tense background music)
Orion: Uh, 17.
Matt: 17. The chaotic influence in your brain begins to dissipate, and the rage-filled gaze begins to fill your eyes once again, this time clarifying on the umber hulk in front of you.
Laura: Thanks a lot, Tiberius.
Sam: Thank god.
Orion: I'm not done yet. I slap him. Just get on this, will you? (Travis snarls)
Orion: I use two SP points to do quickening spell. I cast Grand Column under myself. (imitates rock moving) Fifteen feet up in the air.
Marisha: Nice. (Orion spits)
Matt: So, the stone beneath Tiberius's feet rises up, creating a column fifteen feet above the rest. He is now raised on a platform. I'll put him right there. Looking down upon the battlefield.
Orion: (clears throat) that is my turn.
Matt: All right, Vex, you're up.
Laura: Oh, do I have to cast a saving throw or am I fine?
Liam: Be a badass, be a badass.
Matt: Are you looking at it, or are you averting your gaze?
Laura: No, I'm averting my gaze even though I'm confused apparently.
Matt: Well, the confusion only lasts one turn.
Laura: Okay, good. I am not. What's that thingy behind me?
Marisha: Oh, we've got these.
Matt: This here?
Laura: No.
Matt: This here?
Laura: Yeah, what's that?
Matt: This is rock.
Laura: How high is it?
Matt: This is about 25, 30 feet up.
Travis: Use your laser pointer, dude.
Matt: And this is where the light source is coming from. You can't look over that way.
Laura: All, right cool. I avert my gaze but I listen very carefully to the sound of where it's coming from. (Taliesin whistles)
Laura: And I shoot in that direction.
Matt: Okay. (Taliesin and Marisha imitate birds)
Matt: So go ahead and make your attacks against this fellow.
Travis: That's some Hawkeye stuff.
Matt: You shooting this one?
Laura: Let's do the one that is surrounded so I get like, what, flanking bonus or something.
Matt: For ranged, you would not get a bonus for that unfortunately.
Laura: Lame. All right.
Matt: So are you shooting at the one behind you? This one?
Laura: Sure. Okay.
Laura: No, no, no, no, the other one.
Matt: Okay, all right. So, make your attacks with a disadvantage, as you're kind of keeping your eyes back and shooting in its general direction.
Marisha: Big money, no whammies.
Laura: 12, both of them were 12. But plus 11.
Matt: Plus, eleven? Hits.
Laura: Yes! Oh, and I get two attacks, right?
Matt: You do, yes.
Laura: Okay. Still disadvantage?
Matt: Yep.
Laura: 15 plus 11, hits.
Matt: That also hits, yeah. So both attacks hit.
Laura: Yes!
Matt: Did you want to use your bonus action for anything?
Laura: Oh yes, Hunter's Mark.
Matt: All right, so you throw Hunter's Mark on this umber hulk there.
Laura: Yes, I do.
Matt: But you're like, you're my quarry, ugh. Keeping your eyes back. You go ahead and pull your first and second arrow, (imitates bow firing arrows), letting them loose, kind of letting a little bit of faith take your arrows to the wind. Both finding purchase on your foe.
Laura: Can I use bloodseeking bow on that one?
Matt: You can, yes.
Laura: Sweet. All right, cool. So that's 15, no, 11. And then 15. (group laughs)
Laura: It was good so I kept it.
Travis: She dropped it, but it was a good roll.
Orion: Yeah, take the drop.
Laura: Plus bloodseeking, which is 10 damage, plus Hunter's Mark, which is a six, which is 3.
Matt: So total damage of...?
Laura: Oh, I have to add. (Matt laughs)
Laura: 15 plus 11 plus 3. 26, 29 damage.
Marisha: Woo!
Matt: Nice! (Liam imitates arrows firing)
Matt: So, as your arrows sink into him, one blasts into him. Fire cascades up the side, you can see the middle of its plates beginning to burn and torch the cinderous glow. It reels back, gets its claws ready, now fixated on you 'cause you just announced your presence to it.
Laura: I'm looking again, so.
Matt: All right. Anything you wanna do with...?
Laura: Trinket?
Matt: Trinket.
Laura: Oh, yeah. Can he run up and attack the other one? While keeping his eyes down?
Matt: He would have to use one of your attacks to do that.
Laura: Oh okay, well then he's just hanging out.
Matt: Trinket's just hanging out.
Laura: He's protecting Scanlan. (Matt imitates bear growling) Yeah, big old bear protecting your gnome.
Laura: Protect the gnome!
Liam: Gnome coverage. [Marisha And Taliesin] Gnome coverage.
Matt: No healer this week. What could possibly go wrong?
Marisha: Gnomewatch 2015.
Matt: Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: Scanlan.
Liam: Ride the bear, Scanlan.
Sam: Ride the bear.
Travis: Oh my God.
Sam: I will just step forward a little, and I will cast polymorph on our big friend that we're surrounding. And I'll turn him into a snail.
Marisha: A snail? Aww!
Matt: All right.
Travis: Can you do that?!
Sam: Yes.
Matt: What's the DC, the difficulty class on your spells?
Sam: Through the horn of clarity or whatever. So it's 17.
Matt: 17, alright.
Sam: Or no, 19, sorry, 19.
Matt: 19.
Sam: It's plus two.
Matt: So, as the two umber hulks are there, the one that's in the center of the group, (snarls).
Laura: Oh, Tiberius.
Laura: Rears back, beginning to unleash its series of attacks, and then (sharp hiss), into this tiny--
Travis: What?!
Matt: --snail form on the ground.
Laura: Awesome!
Liam: Don't touch the snail until the--
Laura: Why?
Liam: 'Cause he'll poof out into the fucking big guy again.
Sam: Don't hurt the snail.
Liam: Leave it, leave it.
Sam: Don't pick up the snail. Just be nice to the snail.
Liam: Leave it alone. Hit the other one.
Orion: Don't do anything. I'll take care of the snail. (talking over each other)
Matt: There's a tiny, tiny little snail on the ground now that looks very confused.
Laura: That's confusing.
Matt: Very confused, which is ironic for an umber hulk, to feel confused.
Sam: As a bonus action, I give dice to-- who's coming up next? Who's coming up soon?
Matt: Next'll be Percy.
Sam: Percy, you get dice.
Taliesin: What dice do I get?
Matt: d8.
Sam: A d8 for inspiration.
Taliesin: A d8? All right. Excellent.
Matt: Percy, you're up. (Sam imitates flutes) Gotta do my app.
Matt: Do your app, fuck it up.
Orion: Do the app.
Sam: No, it's not ready. (group laughs)
Taliesin: I'm gonna take one of my two actions to clear my gun.
Travis: Yeah, the jam.
Taliesin: Clear the jam. And then set up for a fire shot. And I'm gonna take a fire shot. Am I at a disadvantage? (tinny electronic music)
Matt: You're inspired.
Sam: It's so weak, it's so weak.
Travis: You've gotta get it better.
Matt: So, who are you shooting?
Taliesin: I'm shooting our friend over there. I've just sort of turned, and I'm firing.
Taliesin: So am I at a disadvantage?
Matt: Averting your gaze?
Taliesin: I'm averting my gaze, but I know where it is.
Matt: Right. So go ahead and fire at disadvantage.
Sam: You got the dice, you got the dice.
Taliesin: Okay. 14 with the disadvantage.
Matt: 14 with the disadvantage will miss, unfortunately. (imitates gun firing) The fire shot arcs off into the distance--
Taliesin: Oh oh, actually--
Marisha: Oh yeah, inspiration.
Matt: Add the inspiration dice.
Taliesin: 17.
Matt: 17 will just barely hit. (group cheers)
Taliesin: Well done, well done, ha ha!
Orion: Good shot!
Liam: Good stunt work, Tiberius.
Taliesin: So, that's gonna do-- ba-bumpa-bum.
Orion: I have to wait to figure out when to open which one.
Taliesin: That's 17 fire damage, 17 fire damage.
Matt: 17 fire damage, nice. Okay, you hear the shot hit, and you hear a cracking sound as one of its plates actually freezes and shatters off of its body, exposing kind of a fleshy undercarriage.
Marisha: Nice. [Orion And Marisha] Undercarriage.
Matt: This umber hulk is starting to look a little rough. That brings us to the top of-- Do you want to move or stay where you are?
Taliesin: I'm going to step back to-- bring me back two to three steps, just like, back away.
Matt: Back here.
Taliesin: Yeah. Just like, here.
Laura: Avoid the snail.
Sam: Yeah, don't step on the snail.
Taliesin: I'm not stepping on the snail.
Taliesin: Yeah, that's good.
Matt: There? Okay, good. All right, that brings us to--
Laura: I'm using it!
Matt: Laser pointers, we have use. Keyleth, you're up. KEYLETH Okay, after seeing Grog get confused, I turn, and I go straight for his throat. And I'm trying to drag him into the creek.
Travis: Ooh.
Laura: Ooh.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: I wanna take the umber hulk into the creek right behind me.
Matt: Okay, so go ahead and roll for a grapple.
Marisha: All right.
Travis: Come on, cave bear.
Marisha: How do I grapple as a bear?
Liam: Bear hug, man, bear hug.
Laura: Yeah, just take him.
Taliesin: How does one grapple as a bear? It is a strength check, I guess.
Matt: Does anyone else-- Can I have the book real fast? Just to be sure we know how we're doing this.
Taliesin: Have you noticed there's a rhinoceros in here?
Marisha: I can be a a rhinoceros.
Matt: It's a contest, yes.
Travis: Why have you not been a rhinoceros yet?
Marisha: It just hasn't been useful yet.
Sam: She usually picks a bird of some sort.
Marisha: I'm waiting for the right time.
Liam: She can only turn into things she's seen.
Sam: I'm a squirrel and a bird! You should be a rhinoceros.
Taliesin: We're just waiting for you to scream, "It's morphin time!" It's morphing time! Bear!
Marisha: Oh my god, can you make me smoke bombs that smoke, and I say, "It's morphin time"?
Matt: So you can make a grapple attempt in place of one of your attacks.
Marisha: Okay. That's what I want to do.
Matt: All right.
Marisha: So I just strength check then?
Matt: So it is an athletics check.
Marisha: Oh. I don't have stats, I'm a bear.
Matt: No, you use the bear's stats.
Marisha: But all I have are the basic six.
Matt: Right, what's the strength?
Marisha: Five.
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: So that's what I do.
Matt: Yeah, roll the dice, add plus five. (group cheers)
Orion: It's 20!
Matt: Natural 20. (clapping) You reach forward and latch onto it with your claws and your teeth, onto the umber hulk.
Marisha: Going for the throat.
Matt: Alright. So that's your first attack. You can go ahead while it's grappled and attack with the other strikes.
Marisha: I'm taking him underwater.
Matt: Okay. You pull.
Laura: Oh god, you're doing it, Keyleth.
Marisha: Pulling him underwater.
Liam: It's a waterfall, oh.
Matt: (imitates thudding) You both plunge underneath the water's surface. Take a big old breath right beforehand, and I'm going underwater.
Orion: Wait, can you let him go and let him drown?
Laura: Yeah, let him go, 'cause it's a waterfall.
Marisha: No, I'm holding on to him.
Laura: But Keyleth, there's a waterfall. It's fine.
Matt: It's now its turn. It's going to try and break your grapple.
Matt: Make an athletics check.
Marisha: Against his strength, I guess. Ah, 20.
Matt: 20, okay. You maintain your grip on the umber hulk. It's thrashing in the water trying to get its way to the surface. (snarls) Still slashing about. So it's gonna make its attacks against you.
Matt: That is a 14.
Marisha: Hits.
Matt: 14 hits you?
Marisha: I'm a bear, my armor class is 12 right now.
Matt: Well no, you keep your armor class.
Marisha: I keep my armor class?
Matt: I'm pretty sure.
Liam: Yes, the answer to that is yes.
Travis: Yeah, you do.
Liam: Definitely yes.
Matt: Nah, let's see real fast actually on this one.
Sam: Keep subscribing to Geek & Sundry everybody.
Matt: Exactly.
Sam: We're going for 1200 subscribers tonight, and if we reach that number... good for you. (group laughs)
Matt: Here we go.
Liam: Sam will write a ballad.
Sam: I will.
Matt: You gain the scores--
Sam: By the way, this music is just great.
Matt: It's 12 plus-- it's whatever the 12 is, plus your proficiency modifier, I think is what it is. For now, we'll say it hits. 'Cause I don't wanna hold this up.
Taliesin: There once was a player--
Sam: In Nantucket?
Laura: Don't.
Matt: No, you gain its armor class.
Marisha: I do gain its armor class.
Matt: Yeah, you do.
Marisha: So it hits.
Matt: Yeah, it hits you. All right. Second strike. That's also gonna hit you. All three hit you. You take six points of slashing damage. 11 points of slashing damage. And 6, 11, 17--
Marisha: It's okay guys.
Matt: Total of 26 points of slashing damage.
Marisha: I am no longer a bear.
Matt: So you lose your grip as your form reverts. You are now back to Keyleth's form in the water.
Sam: And you're in the water!
Marisha: Can I cast a concentration spell on myself?
Matt: No, because you used your actions to grapple it.
Marisha: And that's it.
Matt: So you're now just back in the Keyleth form, underwater. You catch your breath and realize you're now underwater in near darkness with an umber hulk right on you.
Marisha: Hey brah. Sup? Fancy meeting you here.
Matt: Vax, you're up.
Liam: Okay, so first thing I do is lean down and pick up the snail off the ground and say, "Hey, um, go fuck yourself." And then I throw him into the waterfall.
Sam: Oh Jesus!
Matt: Over here?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: All right. Go ahead and roll a ranged attack. So just roll, add dexterity.
Liam: Okay.
Laura: Oh gosh, okay okay.
Liam: Great great great. Dexterity you say? 18.
Matt: 18?
Laura: No, it's higher than that, yo!
Orion: No, it's fine if he drowns and dies.
Liam: Oh sorry, yeah, that's 21. 22, 22.
Matt: You throw, it arcs over. Lands in the water. (imitates water sucking) Goes under into the waterfall.
Liam: Toodle-oo shitface.
Sam: Hey wait, he (stutters) he swam away?
Matt: No, he threw the snail over the waterfall.
Sam: Hey! Bye-bye!
Liam: Now, that seems like a bonus action to me, right? (group laughs)
Matt: That's an attack.
Liam: So then that's an attack, okay.
Marisha: (laughs) That's an attack.
Matt: It's the world's easiest grapple throw.
Travis: You threw him forever.
Liam: Then I'm good.
Laura: That's it?
Liam: Well, that's my action, right?
Matt: Correct.
Liam: And I only have one.
Sam: You can move, you can move.
Liam: All right, so then, I'll hop through, through Percy and my sister. And run up behind the shithead who's fucking with Keyleth.
Matt: Make an acrobatics check, try to tumble through them.
Liam: Yeah, that's easy.
Orion: He's in the water, though.
Liam: 16 (mumbles) 29.
Matt: Yeah, you're fine, and where do you wanna go?
Liam: Right up behind shitface there. And do I have anything left? Or do I just get there and stop.
Matt: Well, it was the attack to throw it. You would have your second off-hand.
Liam: Second attack. Well let's stab him in the ass then, right.
Matt: Well, you have disadvantage 'cause it's currently in the water thrashing about, and it's hard to see. Well, that's not very good. 15.
Matt: 15 misses unfortunately. So as you slash down with your dagger into the water, it's just too hard to really make out what that form moving is.
Liam: I still feel pretty good about that round.
Travis: Yeah, it was pretty good.
Matt: Grog, you're up.
Travis: Am I? (grunts) With my frenzied rage renewed, I run towards the water, haunted by nightmares of Sebastian in the Little Mermaid, and I leap into the water and start slashing and slashing.
Matt: Go ahead and make your three attacks, Grog. (Liam sings opening notes to "Under the Sea")
Travis: ♫ Le poisson, le poisson, hee hee hee, fuck you bitch ♫ (Matt laughs)
Travis: 18 plus... that's 26.
Matt: 26 hits.
Travis: Okay, good. Second attack. 26.
Matt: Hits.
Travis: Okay. 25.
Matt: Hits.
Travis: Good.
Matt: Go ahead and roll damage, Grog. As you come charging forward, just (grunts), leaving bits of foam cascading off the side of your mouth. Your eyes just glazed over with white. You bring the axe down into the water, form towards where the splashing is. Keeping mindful that Keyleth might be in there somewhere. But you're very much see the larger form in the field, so.
Travis: It's all about sushi right?
Marisha: Oh, I'm fine.
Matt: Yeah, so damage on the first strike?
Travis: Eight, second one is 16.
Matt: Eight, 16, that's 24.
Travis: And 17, thirty. What's 24 plus 10?
Laura: 34.
Matt: 34.
Matt: Grog. 34 points of damage. As your axe comes down, slam once into the water. You see one of the claws start pulling itself up out of the surface. It's head's still under the water. You slam the axe down. You see the arm actually snaps and begins to drift down the river. As it looks up at you, its eyes open. Before the gaze can meet yours, the axe comes down and plunges itself directly into the forehead of the umber hulk with a shunk sound. As it does, its body goes limp and begins to float down the water. (group cheers and claps)
Laura: Well, that was easy.
Sam: Was it?
Laura: I walk up and try to help Keyleth out of the water.
Matt: Okay. You help Keyleth out of the water. At this point, the snail form, which doesn't have a whole lot of hit points, has taken enough damage to alleviate itself from the polymorph. As the spell fades, as the snail form is destroyed, the other umber hulk begins clawing its way up the side of the mountain, burrows through the actual stonework--
Laura: Ah, balls.
Matt: --(imitates explosion) and bursts out of the ground right behind you, Vax. (imitates explosion)
Liam: Oh, fuck a duck.
Travis: Come on, drop this thing.
Laura: This is why you shouldn't have thrown the snail.
Matt: But that's its turn.
Liam: I thought it would get washed all the way out. Down the toilet, all the way out.
Matt: All right, that brings us to the top of the round. Tiberius.
Marisha: It was at least badass.
Liam: Elegant.
Marisha: It was very elegant.
Taliesin: I'm sure it was a wonderful thought.
Orion: Firebolt.
Matt: Okay, roll for it. Roll for the attacks.
Liam: Just past it, please.
Matt: Yep, any directed spell like that you have to roll and add your spell range modifier.
Orion: Sweet, that does not hit.
Matt: What'd you roll?
Orion: Uh, 11.
Matt: Disadvantage, so. You rolled an 11 total?
Orion: 10.
Matt: Yeah, you miss. So, as you aim your firebolt (imitated fire shooting) You're just averting your gaze, and it jumps over and arcs through the rest of the carvern, lighting it as it goes like a flare.
Orion: Good cavern.
Matt: That leads to Scanlan.
Sam: Scanlan?
Matt: Actually no, Vex is up and then Scanlan, sorry.
Laura: Me?
Matt: You, you.
Liam: Kill it before it kills me. Okay.
Laura: I am gonna keep my gaze averted, but I just heard it, and I'm gonna--
Orion: That rhymed.
Laura: I'm gonna attack it. WIth some arrows.
Matt: Go for it. So two arrows, notched. (imitates arrows firing) Disadvantage on each attack.
Laura: Oh, okay.
Liam: Don't let it eat my head, please.
Laura: Yeah, it's the same. 18. No, lying. 20.
Matt: 20 hits. Go ahead and roll for the second attack.
Laura: 19.
Matt: Both hit.
Laura: Okay, good.
Matt: Go ahead and roll damage on each.
Laura: Is this the one that I Hunter's Marked? No, the other one Hunter's Marked.
Matt: The other one was, yeah.
Laura: Okay, that's fine. 10 plus 13 is 23.
Matt: But you could switch over your hunter's mark.
Laura: And I switched over my Hunter's Mark as my bonus action.
Matt: With your bonus action.
Laura: So I add the-- oh, one.
Matt: So a total of?
Laura: 24.
Matt: 24 points of damage. All right, got you. (imitates arrows flying) The arrows end up piercing part of the armor. Each sink in a good, solid six, seven inches or so. It angrily (wet snarling) at the impact, but it wasn't enough force to send it back at all. But it knows exactly where you are. That brings us to Scanlan.
Sam: Scanlan's gonna move right in front of where-- I believe that's Percy?
Liam: Save the day, Scanny.
Laura: Oh yeah, I should've ran Trinket up there.
Liam: Repeat, just like last week.
Sam: Toss another dice to Percy, he seems to need them.
Taliesin: Thank you.
Sam: And I'm gonna cast lightning bolt at the thing. Who's wet from being in the water, yes? So electricity is gonna be pretty bad on him.
Matt: All right. So, because you're kind of averting your gaze to look away--
Sam: Disadvantage.
Matt: No, because you don't roll to attack. But it gets advantage on its saving throw because of that aspect.
Matt: So, it rolled natural 20 for its saving, so it takes half damage. But go ahead and roll your 8d6, it's the lighting bolt.
Sam: 8d6.
Matt: Arcs out from your fingers. (imitates lightning)
Sam: 8d6, 8d6. 8d6?!
Taliesin: Yeah.
Sam: 8?!
Travis: Yeah.
Liam: Yes.
Sam: Shit! (group laughs) Uh, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12. (group laughs) 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 (mutters softly) 28!
Matt: 28, okay. 14 points of damage to the umber hulk as the bolt of lightning cascades through its body. It lights up for a second as you see the crawling fingers of electricity kind of shoot through its plates.
Sam: I like crawling fingers.
Matt: Indeed.
Orion: That was the name of the one girl, wasn't it?
Sam: Yes.
Marisha: Oh, I loved Crawline, she was so nice.
Matt: As the bolt grounds itself, the rest of the water on its form evaporates from the sheer force of the electricity. You see the umber hulk still standing. Angry, in pain, and standing, although it's still looking a little worse for wear. You don't wanna do that to an umber hulk. (group laughs)
Sam: You're right.
Matt: Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: Taking my shot, I'm averting my eyes, so.
Sam: Use those dice, use those dice.
Marisha: Whoo!
Taliesin: 24 to hit.
Matt: That was the disadvantage?
Taliesin: At the disadvantage.
Matt: Awesome, that hits.
Taliesin: That's 1d8 plus five. That's, ugh, that's terrible. That's six points of damage. I'm taking my second shot.
Matt: All right.
Liam: Shoot it in the mouth. (clapping)
Marisha: Oh wait, but it's disadvantage.
Taliesin: I rolled twice. So I rolled a 19 and a 20, which means--
Marisha: Which are both your critical, right? Which are both my criticals. So a critical at a disadvantage.
Travis: Sick, nasty.
Taliesin: Just point, nyah, nyah!
Liam: Yes Percy. Critical on a disadvantage!
Matt: Well done.
Taliesin: So I'm also gonna spend my die.
Liam: Whatever your last name is again.
Sam: The die is for the attack.
Matt: It's for attacks, skills, and saving throws, not for damage.
Taliesin: That's, uh... five, six, seven, eight, that's 11 points of damage.
Travis: Finish him.
Matt: 11 points of damage from the first one.
Taliesin: 11 points of damage from the second one.
Marisha: But that one's critical. So it doubles, right?
Taliesin: It's just 1d8 becomes 2d8, right?
Matt: Correct, yeah.
Taliesin: Yeah that's-- yeah.
Matt: Okay, it's 11 points damage. Gotcha. So, as you rear back your shot (imitates gun firing) it resounds. It hits the plate, shatters it on the other side of its chest. You can now see this weird purplish goo beginning to spill from its wounds. You see it's holding itself up, and it's having a hard time keeping physical form there. Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: Oh. Um, cool. (Liam laughs)
Orion: Word.
Marisha: Word. I'm still a person. I'm gonna go ahead and also do a call lighting spell. Bam, call lightning right on its head. 'Cause he's wet.
Matt: Call lighting it is.
Matt: So, as you begin to complete your spell, you can see now the upper arch, the 100 foot archway, the ceiling of this area begins to fill with this strange cloudy, thunderous booms, as a raincloud is created and summoned across the rooftop. At which point, Keyleth frees her hand up and pulls down as a single bolt streaks through the air, slamming into the same lightning bolt wound that you left previously on it, where the edges of its armor are still glowing from the heat. Go ahead and roll damage.
Marisha: Got him right in the ass. It just gets straight damage?
Matt: Yeah, it gets a bonus on its saving throw, though. Or advantage. Which it makes.
Marisha: I get 3d10.
Matt: 3d10. All right, go for it.
Marisha: 6, 7--
Matt: It is no longer outdoors-only.
Matt: It gets a bonus for being outdoors.
Marisha: 11 damage.
Matt: 11 damage to the umber hulk. Which is halved. He made a saving throw, to a six.
Marisha: Saving throw, mm.
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: Finish him. Cause you're having to avert your gaze. You're trying to work out this whole thing where you're all basically at a severe disadvantage fighting this thing, unless you want to be completely fucked over. All right.
Sam: Should have created sunglasses for him or something.
Travis: We have two of its eyes.
Matt: It's now its turn.
Laura: Ugh, it's still alive.
Matt: It turns and runs past, to the one who shot it with the angry lightning bolt. (Travis laughs)
Matt: The tiny gnome that now is a delicious morsel in the mandibles of an umber hulk. It comes running forward like a giant armored gorilla. (grunts)
Laura: Oh, no.
Matt: Reaching back with both of its claws, swiping at you Scanlan, that is a 23 to hit.
Sam: Oh, yeah.
Matt: 25 to hit.
Matt: Its mandibles are 24 to hit.
Sam: That hits three times.
Matt: Yep. You take 13--
Laura: Oh, no!
Liam: But you're so little.
Matt: 24.
Sam: Ooh!
Matt: 38 points of slashing damage. This is the sound I make. (high-pitched wail) (group laughs)
Matt: As it just strikes you, all of its form now, you're almost pinned to the ground, blood oozing from your face as gashes, slash wounds are across your entire body. It's looming over you, ready to try and finish you off next round.
Laura: Ugh!
Matt: That brings us to Vax.
Liam: Okay. So, he's now got his back turned to me. I'm just gonna stick both knives into his guts and say, "No one touches the gnome!"
Liam: Right in his guts, that's shit. So, fuck that. And this one is way better. So that's 27.
Matt: 27 hits definitely.
Liam: Okay, this is the flametongue.
Matt: It is considered flanking, because Scanlan is there. Oh yes.
Liam: Four plus two is six. (Sam sings along with dramatic music)
Liam: Two, three, fuck, four, fuck, seven, nine, 18, 24 damage. With the second knife, sneak attack into his ball sack.
Matt: How do you want to do this? (group yells triumphantly)
Liam: I stick it in the back of his his spider nads. And rip it out his bum and out the back of him.
Laura: Gross!
Liam: And just spill it all out the bottom. (all talking at once)
Sam: I'm right next to him, it might spill on me.
Liam: That's all right, that's all right.
Matt: As it's looming over Scanlan who's on his back, it's tearing into him and starting to gut him best it can. He's screaming from beneath. You rush underneath, tumble, bringing your dagger up and slam it right under the bottom of its abdomen.
Laura: Balls.
Matt: As you do it, (snarls), looks down towards you and right before its gaze can meet yours, you yank back with all your might, basically scissoring and jagged drawing the blade up the back of its body. As you do it, (imitates vomiting) leaps forward. It's now-soft torso and belly left open from the armor plates being shot off, spills a number of its warm innards right onto Scanlan's body and form.
Sam: Ugh, no! It went in my mouth! (Travis laughs)
Matt: And then it collapses on top of him..
Sam: Ah! (group laughs)
Matt: You take six points of crushing damage as the umber hulk collapses on top of you.
Travis: I run over and shove the umber hulk off of Scanlan.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Ugh! Ah!
Laura: Oh my gosh.
Sam: What just happened?
Marisha: I go over to Scanlan, and I just, I just lay my hands on him, and I cast Cure Wounds in a level 2 spot.
Liam: Nobody touches my man-wife. (group laughs)
Sam: What's that spell do?
Marisha: You do-- it's 2d8 plus 10 healing.
Sam: You roll, right?
Taliesin: Yep.
Marisha: Do I roll or does he?
Matt: For which spell is this?
Marisha: I'm doing Cure Wounds on him. At level two.
Matt: Cure Wounds, level two? 2d8 plus five.
Marisha: Do I roll?
Matt: You roll.
Marisha: So you heal, 16, 20 points.
Sam: Thank you.
Matt: So, as you heal him, touch him with the spell, you wipe the umber hulk ichor off of your hand.
Orion: I cast prestidigitation and clean everybody up.
Laura: Maybe you should jump in that water, Scanlan.
Travis: You should get in the water and clean yourself off.
Taliesin: We have running water. Use running water.
Sam: I think I wanna keep it on. (group laughs)
Orion: He's clean already.
Travis: As a badge of honor?
Sam: It's a badge of honor.
Liam: Like the walking dead, you're gonna sneak by the rest of 'em?
Sam: I think I'm gonna keep the blood on me, if you don't mind.
Laura: Alright.
Matt: That's, uh... okay.
Travis: Gross.
Sam: Warning to others.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: So, you still hear the rushing of the water down below. You now stand at this portion of the cavern, the dull glow in the distance of some sort of light source in that direction. The rest of the caverns opens up this way.
Laura: Ugh.
Travis: Let's go towards the light.
Sam: Can we take a short rest and heal up?
Travis: No, I run.
Laura: Short rest, short rest.
Travis: No, running.
Liam: Running?! (Sam laughs)
Sam: Why don't you let some people heal?
Matt: Grog goes running. Grog, who's interested.
Travis: I'm frenzy raging.
Sam: Oh God, Grog! Grog, no!
Travis: It's a bright, shiny thing. I'm going there!
Laura: He is frenzying.
Liam: I'm unscathed, so I run after Grog, just to give him backup if he needs.
Marisha: I'll follow after Vax.
Matt: All right, you guys head out. Eventually, you come around the corner to see what looks like a campfire.
Orion: I follow as well.
Travis: Aww.
Matt: It looks like a setup with a small bundle of, what looks like bedding. There's a campfire set up. It's mostly out at this point. Like there's still a little bit of a flame flicker to it, but it's just embers for the most part. Does not appear--
Travis: I start hacking away at the bedding. Just chopping the shit out of it.
Sam: Jesus! (group laughs)
Matt: Grog starts hacking away at the bedding. (Travis grunts)
Liam: I'm just watching and shrugging.
Laura: No, look and search around and see what's in the bedding.
Liam: I try to keep like six or seven foot difference--
Matt: (arrows whooshing)
Sam: Oh, no!
Liam: Fuck!
Matt: Three crossbow bolts come flying out of nowhere--
Liam: You dick!
Matt: --two hitting Grog.
Liam: You dick! (Marisha laughs)
Laura: Why weren't you stealthing?
Liam: I am now.
Travis: Somebody likes their bedding apparently.
Liam: I rolled a 29 of stealth as soon as the first arrow flew.
Marisha: That was a Coleman, alright? (group laughs) That was a very expensive sleeping bag.
Taliesin: Never attack the bedding before you know the thread count.
Travis: It was 3000 count Egyptian.
Taliesin: God.
Matt: Grog, you take seven points of piercing damage, which is halved to four because you're raging.
Travis: Right. (grunts)
Matt: As you can see what looks like three small--
Liam: Duergar.
Laura: No, they're dwarves.
Liam: Yeah, that's duergar. That's dark dwarves.
Laura: Oh!
Liam: I consider myself a nerd.
Matt: And some strange beast you've not seen before seems to be accompanying one of them.
Laura: Is that a brain?
Matt: It looks like an oversized, swollen brain with a set of claws.
Liam: It's hanging brain.
Sam: Krang?
Marisha: Brain?
Matt: It's just like a large brain with a set of arms and legs like a panther.
Laura: What?
Travis: It's the brain bug from Starship Troopers.
Marisha: That can't be good.
Orion: Take that out first.
Matt: Going off the same intiative order. They've gone.
Liam: I rolled a 29 stealth.
Matt: Yes, I know. So you haven't been seen, and you have the first action.
Travis: Are they on the same level as us?
Matt: They are, yes.
Liam: So I can dash and still attack?
Matt: If you'd like to.
Liam: I would love to. I would love to, uh-- where's this thing?
Laura: Go for the brain.
Liam: Yeah, of course go for the brain. I'm gonna hang brain. I'm gonna run over--
Matt: Well if you dash as your action--
Liam: Oh, I can't stealth? So to stay stealth, I need to go normal speed?
Matt: Well you can dash as your action, but dash is your, basically a double move. So you move and use your action to move as well.
Liam: And that's it.
Matt: That's all you'll be able to do.
Liam: Um, I'm gonna-- no. I'll you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna go-- hey, god. I'm gonna move over here, stealthily. And go for ready.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: That's what it's called, right? And wait?
Matt: Just wait.
Liam: And the trigger is when this asshole duergar moves forward, I'm gonna stick him in the back of the neck.
Matt: Okay. All right.
Marisha: Nice.
Matt: Tiberius. You hear Grog go, "Ugh!"
Orion: Oh, it seems like there's trouble over there. (group laughs) What has Grog gotten himself into?
Marisha: I don't know. (Travis moans and strangles)
Orion: I saunter--
Travis: You saunter?
Sam: Saunter.
Orion: Yes.
Matt: You jump off your pillar.
Orion: Oh.
Matt: Saunter over here?
Orion: Yeah, I would go around there to-- That's good, I suppose. What's in between the-- between him and that. Is that a boulder?
Matt: It's a giant raised stalagmite.
Orion: I see, how tall is that?
Matt: It's about 25 feet tall.
Orion: Oh crap, okay.
Matt: All you see is Grog standing with three bolts sticking out of his chest now.
Laura: Oh no! (Travis imitates wood breaking)
Orion: I can't do anything too much.
Liam: Grog, I've got the hiccups.
Matt: Anything else, Tiberius? Gotta keep this moving.
Travis: Yeah.
Liam: The bolts.
Travis: Right.
Orion: I'll just cast stoneskin on myself. Okay, Stoneskin cast on you. That brings us to Vex.
Laura: All right, I can hear them screaming so I'm gonna run over. Call Trinket as I'm doing it.
Travis: Who's screaming?
Laura: You, you screamed.
Travis: No, I'm not screaming.
Matt: Do you want to use your full round to move? Cause that's as far as you can move currently. Actually you can move two more.
Laura: Can I see anything from that point?
Matt: All you see is Grog over there.
Liam: They're covered and he's around the bend, so I'd run in further.
Laura: All right, I'll run in further. Can I run in and stealth or is that it?
Matt: Uh, you can attempt to.
Laura: I'm gonna try to stealth as I'm going in.
Matt: You're at disadvantage on the stealth roll, but go for it.
Laura: Oh, a 20. Aw! 17, okay. Plus my stealth, which is five.
Matt: All right, so we'll say you're pulled off to the side there. The stealth twins over there being all stealthy-like. No one can see what's going on with them. It's like they're related.
Travis: What's all this stealthing? Where's all the killing?
Matt: That's your turn.
Laura: I can't attack anything.
Matt: Scanlan.
Sam: Okay, I'm gonna move right there into the room as far as I can.
Matt: You can go that far.
Sam: Okay. And cast Stinking Cloud right there. (Travis laughs) It's gonna smell like just ass over there. (group laughs)
Matt: Okay. Best you can see, and you haven't really seen where they are, so you're kind of like, oh, you have the idea that perhaps they're over in that vicinity on the bolts around there. So you can cast over in this area, which is the only thing you have view of.
Sam: Oh, oh, because that's a big rock in my view there.
Matt: This is a big rock right there, yeah.
Sam: Okay, so yeah. I'll put it right where you're saying, right there, yeah.
Matt: Okay, that's about where you can go. All right, so (hisses), a giant--
Travis: Ass cloud.
Matt: --green, ass cloud--
Orion: Scanlan, are you doing an ass cloud again?
Matt: --begins to fill this space here. As it does, they all begin to hack and cough. You can hear this now between the rest of you, echoing throughout.
Travis: I'm slightly aroused. (group laughs)
Orion: I was just going to say.
Travis: I'm drawn to the smell.
Sam: (imitates flute) --stinks.
Matt: ♫ Constitution saving throws. Everything in the cloud. ♫
Sam: (imitates flute) --stink.
Matt: ♫ All them are failing. ♫
Orion: Doing stink magic.
Matt: All right. You hear a cacophonous amount of hacking, coughing, as all of them drop their attack stances and begin just retching, nearly vomiting, in the middle of this green cloud of gas.
Travis: Outstanding.
Sam: I'll also take a great heal potion? Is that what they're called? Not moderate.
Matt: Yes, greater.
Sam: Great, greater, okay. I'll do that by myself. You keep going.
Matt: Okay, greater heal potion is 4d4 plus four.
Sam: Thank you.
Matt: All right, that brings us to Percy.
Taliesin: I'm going to start crawling around the-- I have a little thingy. Someone took the thingy. Oh, laser pointer. Thank you.
Liam: Hello, hey.
Travis: It's a black light.
Taliesin: I'm gonna start heading down this direction, and I'm going to actually spend a movement, spend my action and move a little further down, about, yeah, about there, so I can start getting a good look of what's up.
Matt: Okay, good. All right. That brings us to Keyleth.
Marisha: Okay, so I am going to take this and move up to about here, I guess.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Is where I can see. And then I'm gonna take this little block of stone right here, this stalagtite or mite or whatever it is--
Matt: Correct.
Marisha: --and I'm gonna use Wall of Stone. And instead of creating a wall, I'm just gonna take that one and I'm gonna push it (imitates thudding) against that wall and try and crush those guys.
Travis: Whoa!
Matt: Wait, you're gonna use Wall of Stone to try and push that back?
Marisha: I'm gonna take this wall, and I'm gonna go crunch.
Matt: All right.
Sam: Oh my God.
Travis: Can you do that?
Taliesin: That's kinda harsh.
Marisha: I don't know. We'll find out.
Laura: I like that that's the most common quip. "Can, can you do that?"
Sam: You can actually do that?
Orion: It's like earthbending.
Marisha: I'm trying to earthbend this wall.
Sam: Hey Grog. Did you ever write down our underwater spell, potion thingies, whatever those were called?
Travis: We got two of 'em.
Sam: Yeah, did you right it down, though? 'Cause I didn't.
Travis: What they were?
Taliesin: She's got waterbreathing, so.
Matt: So how it works is, Wall of Stone, you can create a wall of stone, but it cannot occupy the space of a creature. So you will not be able to push them back, unfortunately. But you could lock them into an area, if that's what you wanted to do.
Sam: The man telling us what we can and can't do. (group laughs)
Matt: It's the nature of the spell, guys.
Marisha: Yeah, that's a waste of time. Instead, I will-- I still got a Call Lightning going. Fuck it. I'm just gonna lightning bolt some bitches.
Matt: All right. You don't have view of any of them right now, unfortunately.
Marisha: Well, then I move to where I can.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Yeah good. Cop attitude with the DM.
Travis: Yeah, yeah.
Sam: The man in charge of our fates.
Taliesin: That always goes really well.
Matt: That'll be your turn.
Sam: Because of the attitude.
Matt: You moved twice. You had to get a long distance.
Marisha: Did I?
Matt: Yeah, because you were back here.
Laura: Yeah, dude. It was really far away, yo. I've got a decent speed, okay, fine. That's my turn then.
Matt: Sorry.
Liam: Fuck those Wizards of the Coast, man! I do what I wanna do.
Marisha: Fucking Seattle assholes.
Matt: All right, so.
Orion: I love Seattle.
Liam: So do I.
Matt: And what's the DC again of your spell?
Sam: Ah, oh.
Sam: Spell save DC, is that right? 19.
Matt: 19. All right. All three of the-- and you can now get a view of them. They are dwarven, but their skin is ashy and grey. Their eyes are white and pupil-less. And they are all on the verge of vomiting right now. They're both just keeling over. One of them tries to bring a crossbow up, and (imitates vomiting) has to put it back down again. They are unable to act this turn. The weird brain creature, however--
Marisha: That's awesome.
Travis: What, has no nostrils?
Taliesin: There's nowhere for him to retch from.
Matt: It moves out of the cloud, looks over at you Grog.
Sam: Oh, no.
Matt: And just bears down for a second. And you feel this... intrusion in your mind.
Travis: On my professor-torial mind.
Matt: Go ahead and make an intelligence saving throw.
Sam: Oh, those aren't good for you.
Marisha: Oh, no. (Travis laughs)
Taliesin: Well this, this ends poorly.
Travis: Oh good, my modifier's negative 2, so yippee-kye-ay-eh. Six.
Matt: Alright.
Orion: Good roll.
Taliesin: Good roll.
Marisha: That's a good number.
Matt: You suffer nine points of psychic damage as there's a sudden blast of excruciating pain in the center of your brain. It actually shakes you a moment from your rage, which then fills your mind once again.
Travis: Like Kenny G music coming through my brain.
Taliesin: Someone needs a Juggernaut helmet.
Matt: Also, you suffer--
Marisha: He needs a Magneto helmet.
Taliesin: Yeah, he needs the full Magneto.
Matt: --8 points of intelligence damage technically. You immediately fall unconscious. (Laura gasps)
Marisha: What?!
Matt: Your intelligence is brought to zero.
Travis: Ah! But I was at six!
Liam: You gotta kill that thing.
Laura: Oh no!
Travis: I turn into a turnip?
Matt: That brings us to-- (Matt laughs) Tiberius.
Orion: Tiberius, I mean--
Matt: Yes, you're Tiberius.
Orion: I say--
Matt: You just watched Grog just go (groans) and fall to the ground. Almost into the campfire.
Laura: Oh, no.
Travis: It's like when I tried to read 50 Shades of Grey. (groans)
Orion: Okay, I'm gonna--
Taliesin: Around the bear.
Orion: Okay, I'm gonna go right up to where Grog is.
Matt: All right.
Orion: Right there, right in front of him. Now can I see the brain fucker?
Matt: Yes, you can from there.
Marisha: The brain fucker.
Matt: The brain fucker's official name.
Taliesin: Brain lover, brain lover.
Orion: Ooh, you're a nasty one.
Marisha: He's a lover, not a fighter.
Orion: I'm gonna fire a glacial blast at this dude.
Matt: Okay. Single targeted beam.
Taliesin: Lobey.
Marisha: Lobey.
Taliesin: We're gonna name him Lobey.
Marisha: Let's call him Lobey. (Laura laughs)
Matt: Makes its saving throw.
Taliesin: "Lobey, no!"
Matt: What's your DC?
Orion: My DC is 17.
Matt: It just rolled a 17, yeah. It makes the saving throw. So half damage.
Taliesin: Take him everywhere.
Orion: Four, six, and 8d6.
Taliesin: Our little Lobey.
Marisha: Can we call him Jeff, Jeff Lobey?
Sam: Is that campfire still firing?
Taliesin: Jeff Lobey.
Matt: It's embers, yeah. 21, 22, 23. 24, 26, 27, 22. 29 damage.
Matt: 29 damage? (Taliesin laughing)
Matt: As you put your arms out, you focus this blast of just freezing cold arcane energy that slams into the side of this brain creature.
Taliesin: Jeff Lobey, thank you.
Matt: As it does, you see it begins to freeze its entire body. As it reaches up and tries to climb up it solidifies and then shatters into a hundred million pieces. (group cheers)
Sam: Oh, the brain's dead.
Taliesin: You killed Jeff Lobey!
Marisha: You killed Jeff Lobey.
Sam: Lisa Loeb?
Marisha: Lisa Lobey! (group laughs) They just keep going!
Matt: Lisa Loeb and then the nine intelligence damage. All right. So the brain just (imitates shattering) cascades across the ground.
Liam: Lisa Lobey.
Matt: And thank God. Vex, you're now seeing three dwarves retching and coughing over, kind of looking about very nervously.
Laura: Can I move to where I can get a line of site on that one?
Matt: On this one here?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Yeah, you can move to there and get a line of sight.
Laura: Okay cool, then I'm gonna shoot him. Oh wait, no, I can't.
Sam: Why?
Laura: Yeah yeah yeah, I'm gonna do that.
Liam: You still have a little bit of cover.
Laura: I'm gonna do-- it's fine, I got it. I'm really good.
Liam: Just be a badass, okay? That's your job.
Laura: Okay. 27.
Matt: That hits.
Liam: Are you alright, big guy?
Liam: "Muh!"
Laura: Oh, I should've tried to-- it's okay.
Liam: "Muh! Muh!"
Sam: It's weird, Grog weirdly seems smarter now than he was before.
Laura: Hunter's Mark on that guy.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Beep boop.
Matt: Good remembering.
Marisha: Professor Grog's having a hard time.
Laura: 11.
Matt: 11, all right.
Laura: 11, and then I'm gonna hit him again. And that's a 23.
Matt: All right.
Laura: And that is nine damage for that arrow. And then the six for a Hunter's Mark is five.
Matt: So a total of...?
Laura: Oh jeez-louise, 30 plus five is... 35.
Matt: (imitates arrows flying) "Ugh!" The hacking, coughing duergar dwarf is like, (coughs) One in the shoulder, and the other shoulder. And it looks like that you, (inhales sharply) As it inhales a big old whiff of horrible stinking cloud gas, the arrow (imitates arrow flying) through its throat and out the back of its head. Falls flat on its back.
Laura: Yeah. (group cheers)
Matt: The other ones look nervously about.
Marisha: Get him a pillow! What!
Matt: One of them's just coughing out, saying something in Undercommon. (speaks in angry gibberish)
Matt: Anyone here speak Undercommon?
Laura: I do!
Matt: You do?
Sam: You speak Undercommon?
Laura: I do.
Taliesin: Oondercommon.
Laura: I knew we were gonna be going down into some--
Matt: You hear him say, "Quick, there's our exit! Back, back to the master."
Laura: (whispering) Back to the master!
Travis: Who's the master?
Laura: You're unconscious.
Matt: All right. That brings us to Scanlan.
Sam: Ah, shit. I did not understand them, right? So I don't know that they're going to run.
Matt: No.
Travis: Let 'em run back to the master and we'll track 'em.
Sam: I didn't learn that they're running, so. Can I call out that I heard them? Say, "Don't let them run!"
Matt: No, this happening just as you heard them.
Sam: Okay, well. I don't have a good line of sight on them, so I don't even know that they're there really, right? I just hear coughing in the distance.
Matt: Yep. Then I'll just move further into the cavern there. And I don't know that this works, but I'll try to cast Dispel Magic on Grog.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: I don't know if that, if it's magic. I have no idea.
Matt: So you go ahead and you focus, you cast Dispel Magic in Grog's vicinity.
Sam: ♫ Wake up, Grog ♫
Matt: You see the shift of arcane, waving energy.
Travis: ♫ If I only had a brain ♫
Matt: It does not seem to have an effect.
Sam: It doesn't do it! Damn it! Then as my bonus action, can I still give him an inspiration dice to do on like saving...?
Matt: You think at this point, Grog isn't unconscious. Grog is catatonic. Grog has no intelligence. There is nothing home. You see him, on the ground, drooling, eyes glazed over. There is nothing there.
Taliesin: You can't inspire a cantaloupe.
Laura: What are we gonna do?
Taliesin: The cantaloupe, it's not gonna feel better about itself.
Sam: Okay, then I give my dice to Vax.
Taliesin: I've tried insulting a cantaloupe, you just don't get anywhere.
Sam: Vax, I've just inspired you. (imitates flute)
Matt: I think the chat room's catching on for those who know D&D well.
Liam: Okay, I hear a little shithead grey-skinned dwarf--
Sam: Wait, it's not your turn. I just gave you dice. I thought you said Vax. Okay, sorry.
Matt: It's all right. So that ends Scanlan's turn. Percy.
Liam: Damn it.
Taliesin: Laser. I'm going to take my laser.
Matt: Your laser? Point your laser? (Liam imitates ray gun)
Taliesin: All right, I want to crawl forward to the other side of Grog over there, so I can see this little jerk.
Matt: It's a tough call, he has cover. You can still see him.
Taliesin: I ignore cover. It's one of my magical things that I do.
Liam: Three-quarters cover according to the new rules.
Marisha: Yeah, he's got a gun.
Taliesin: Yeah, I ignore half or three-quarters cover.
Matt: Then you can ignore three-quarters cover, which he has. So, yes.
Taliesin: Okay, I ignore it. I'm also going to take a penalty to my attack bonus to attempt to do some damage and to not kill, but injure, if possible.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: I wanna leave one for questioning.
Matt: Okay. So go ahead and roll disadvantage on this attack. Or do you want to just do subdual damage, which is what you're doing?
Taliesin: Yeah. All right, so you're gonna aim in a way that doesn't do lethal damage. Go for it.
Matt: It's a normal attack, there's no penalty to it.
Taliesin: Just my penalty for extra damage.
Matt: Mm hm.
Taliesin: Aha! I crit! So that's fun. Let's roll damage. 9, 10, that's 25 points of damage.
Laura: Yeah!
Matt: 25 points of damage. All right, you run around the corner, pull the gun out, and aim at this like-- (coughs) Where you look now, you see this ghastly looking, evil, female-looking grey-skinned dwarf. Looks over at you and (gasps) reacts and goes for her weapon. As you do, you let loose and fire straight into her shoulder, blasting through most of her shoulder, exposing bone. It's not a deahtblow, but you see she has been incapacitated.
Orion: Nice.
Taliesin: That's my turn.
Laura: I call out, "Let one of them live, so I can question them."
Taliesin: That's-- we got one.
Matt: Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: We got one?
Taliesin: We got one.
Marisha: Well, then.
Matt: That dwarf survived. With one hit point.
Marisha: If we got the guy we need. I will move over a bit. Yeah. And... (imitates energy firing)
Matt: All right, go for it.
Liam: Vines?
Matt: First off, make a constitution save, 'cause you stepped into a stinking cloud. Unless you wanna move back here. There you go.
Marisha: Not having control.
Matt: Laser pointer.
Marisha: I do (mumbles). Okay. So that is... what is that? 22?
Matt: 22 points of damage. All right. So the bolt streaks from the cloud in the sky, slamming into this other duergar. As it sparks into the ground, you see bits of stone get thrown up from the sheer force of the bolt, doing a sincere amount of damage to it. Not enough to finish it, but it looks very, very fucked up. You can see part of its face is charred now, and it's reeling from the blast. Probably blew out its eardrums from the cacophonous blast of the thunder.
Marisha: That's my turn.
Matt: That's your turn. It's now both of their turn. They both failed their saves with a two and a four. They're both still hacking and coughing in the stinking cloud. Uh, go bards. Vax, you're up.
Liam: Okay, and there's a big cloud of poo stink around them, so--
Matt: Correct, so all here.
Orion: "The poo cloud," Keyleth calls it.
Liam: God dammit. All right.
Marisha: Do I? "The poo cloud."
Liam: Fuck it.
Sam: Just go in there, man.
Liam: I'm gonna hold my breath, and I'm gonna go one, two, three, four, five, and grab this guy around the neck and hold my daggers to his neck. And just hunker down and try to hold him hostage.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and make a constitution check.
Travis: A dirty mafia check?
Liam: Is that a, is that a--
Matt: With advantage, because you're holding your breath.
Liam: Okay. 14.
Travis: Just breathe it in.
Sam: Use the dice! Use the dice!
Liam: What did you give me?
Sam: A d8.
Liam: 22.
Sam: No, it's not an eight. A d8. You gotta roll it.
Matt: Roll a d8 to add to it.
Liam: 15. (group laughs)
Liam: It came up a one.
Travis: 22!
Matt: So, as you rush in the cloud, (breathes deeply) you run in, pull your daggers out, and because this isn't a natural cloud, the arcane force puts it in your nostrils and you can't help yourself. (coughs) Your turn immediately ends as you begin feeling your lunch retching up into your stomach.
Travis: Puke on him.
Matt: Okay. That brings us to Grog. You are a--
Travis: Oh, I got it. (blows raspberry)
Matt: You are brain-dead. (group laughs) Tiberius, you're up.
Laura: So sorry, Grog.
Sam: Can we heal him, what is it? What do we need to do?
Marisha: We'll figure that out when we kill this guy, I guess.
Laura: Restoration?
Liam: Can you dispel that shit?
Sam: I tried, I tried.
Marisha: He can't dispel it, It's not magic. But I might be able to cure him afterwards.
Liam: Tiberius, can you dispel that shit?
Orion: It's the same spell.
Laura: It's a restoration spell, it's not a dispel.
Marisha: I might be able to.
Orion: So, the guy knocked down over there is-- let me see that pointer. This guy, that's the one that we knocked out with the arrow?
Taliesin: Yeah, that's the dead one.
Orion: The dead one or the one we knocked out?
Taliesin: He's dead.
Orion: Who do we have incapacitated?
Taliesin: That's the one we shot.
Marisha: That's the one Liam has.
Laura: Let one live.
Orion: And the one right here is...?
Liam: The one by me is weak.
Matt: Both of them are pretty weak right now, actually.
Orion: I think I can step next to Percy without stepping into that cloud.
Matt: So you can step over Grog, get around here, you mean?
Laura: (laughs) Honk.
Travis: That's-- come on.
Orion: Sorry, excuse me, Grog, pardon. I will shoot a firebolt at the butthole across the way.
Matt: There? All right. Go ahead and roll for the attack.
Orion: 14.
Matt: 14. Unfortunately does not hit. You aim, and it manages to just pull out of the way.
Laura: Oh my gosh.
Matt: Vex. You're up.
Laura: Me?
Matt: Yes.
Laura: I step over, and I try to shoot the one that he just-- I stay out of the stink.
Matt: There you go, yeah. Pull back-- (imitates bow shooting arrow)
Laura: All right.
Matt: Roll to attack.
Laura: 23.
Matt: That hits, go ahead and roll damage.
Laura: 8.
Matt: That's enough. As the arrow (imitates arrow flying), careens off, slams into the chest. (groans) It catches itself, steps back, and plummets off the side of the cliff onto the lower floor about 20 feet down. Smack, onto the ground.
Laura: And I ask Scanlan to dispel the stank cloud.
Taliesin: Dispel the stank.
Laura: And I yell-- Can I yell out "surrender" in Undercommon?
Matt: You yell out, (speaks angry gibberish)! (Laura speaks angry gibberish)
Matt: Make an intimidation check.
Travis: That was a very good Klingon translation.
Laura: Klingon. (Liam speaks angry gibberish) Whoa! Okay. Um, eight.
Matt: Eight?
Laura: Eight.
Liam: What is with the dice tonight?
Matt: It rolled a one. (group cheers)
Matt: It looks around and its circumstances being extremely dire. It drops its weapons, falls to its knees. At your mercy. That's where we'll end the game tonight.
Sam: Oh!
Taliesin: Hey!
Travis: What?!
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: You're, you're-- yeah.
Sam: Grog is brain dead.
Marisha: I was gonna say, can I go over and heal Grog before we end?
Travis: I'm Vanilla Sky right now.
Matt: Nope, we're picking up next week.
Laura: Oh no.
Liam: Just five more hours, Matt. Just five more hours.
Matt: We'll say for the circumstance here, you go ahead and spend a healing spell on him. His wounds mend, no effect on his catatonic state. (group groans)
Sam: We have to wait a week.
Matt: Well guys, that's episode two of Critical Role. (laughs)
Marisha: Damn it.
Matt: I hope you enjoyed it. Remember to tell your friends to come watch. We'll be back next week, Thursday at 7:00. I know the schedule said seven to nine. We usually run a little later. Because D&D and why not?
Laura: Oh, is this seven to nine?
Matt: It says seven to nine in the schedule, but we consider seven to ten. But yeah, hope you guys had fun. Thank you so much for watching. Hope we will have our donations up next week. Feel free to check it out. This is Zac, our amazing master of all awesomeness on this Twitch channel. Hey Zac, what's going on?
Zac: Hey, good job, guys.
Matt: Thank you, thank you.
Zac: You got a thousand subscribers. (group cheers)
Zac: Crazy, that's like, two weeks in.
Matt: Yeah, I know. You go, Nyal. We'll get you your stuff.
Marisha: Yeah, you get a Player's Handbook. That's lucky.
Zac: We'll get you your shit! I gotta print that photo so you guys can all sign it.
Matt: Yes yes, let's go do that.
Zac: No, it'll probably be sent to you next Friday, 'cause we'll have you guys sign it next Thursday.
Laura: Sounds good.
Matt: Okay, cool.
Travis: Zac, do you have any renew intelligence potions on you, by chance?
Zac: For you?
Travis: Yeah.
Zac: No.
Travis: Shit.
Matt: Sorry buddy.
Zac: So we're not going offline for the night yet. These guys are gonna head out and Lucas and I are gonna play some Hotline Miami 2. For an hour, hour and a half.
Matt: There you go, rock it out.
Zac: You know, just to close out the night with a subscriber-only chat to say thank you to our thousand subscribers. And tomorrow night we will be back with So You Don't Have to, which is a show where Hector and Becca play the weirdest games they can find online, so you don't have to.
Marisha: Nice. (Matt laughs)
Zac: And then we finish off tomorrow night with Gather Your Party, which is just a big party where we're going to be celebrating getting 1000 subscribers, playing some board games. We have a band coming in to play.
Matt: Awesome.
Zac: It's gonna be a good time. We might even have a DJ spinning some-- I don't know. How do you say it? Spinning?
Travis: Some tunes.
Matt: Spin tunes.
Travis: Dropping some dope beats.
Orion: On the ones and twos. Ones and twos.
Zac: So thank you guys again. Lucas, if you wanna go ahead and roll those videos, and we'll get you guys out of here.
Matt: Thank you guys for watching.
All: Bye!

Our next one will be at 4,250, so, up to every fifty subscribers after that we will be giving away an additional Player's Handbook and photo signed by the cast. Awesome times. (cheering)
Marisha: Awesome times?
Matt: Indeed, very awesome times.
Marisha: Good times, good time together.
Matt: I think so, indeed. Also, as a heads-up to you guys, there will be no Critical Role next week because the San Diego Comic-Con is happening. Down in San Diego.
Marisha: We're doing a panel, aren't we?
Matt: I know, we have a panel, though. We have a panel Thursday, I'll be on the main Geek and Sundry panel with Laura at 1-2 and then we have our actual full Critical Role panel from 4-5. So if you are going to be there, come see us at PetCo Park on Thursday.
Laura: You don't need a badge.
Matt: Nope, you can just come and walk on in.
Marisha: Yeah, it is at PetCo Park, so don't get lost looking around the convention center. Because it won't be there. It's at PetCo Park.
Matt: It's the big sports stadium, which to me is a wonderful irony of us giving a panel about Dungeons & Dragons in the center of a giant sports stadium. That's right! Indoor kids. However, however, they are also filming the panel for those who can't be there. The panel will be on the stream the following day, I believe, so check it out there, after, with the rest of the Comic-Con stream coverage. It'll be fun. Yeah, so that'll be good. The week after that, me and Marisha are going to be out of town in New Zealand, so this means a two-week period without Critical Role main-story stuff, and I apologize, this is all stuff that got planned before the stream even started. We'll be at a convention in New Zealand. For those out there planning to come to Armageddon, please come see us, we'll be down there. It'll be fun for all New Zealand fans. Otherwise, the rest of the Critical Role cast that are available will be here and will play some other sort of game together and generally interact with the chat and have a good time until we return. So.
Marisha: We're working it out.
Matt: Yeah, we're getting the circumstance ironed out.
Marisha: Hi, Liam!
Orion: Hi, Liam!
Matt: We have Liam on Skype over here.
Liam: Hi, guys.
Matt: What's up, buddy?
Liam: Hi!
Matt: Liam, who's finishing up his vacation as well. As far as I understand, we have a--
Marisha: How's New Jersey?
Liam: I am deep in upstate New York on the Canadian border.
Matt: Slowly migrating into expatriotism. Don't go Canadian on us.
Liam: It's frightening to drive here at night. I can't wait to do it at two in the morning.
Laura: Yay.
Matt: Yes.
Ashley: I'm drinking out of your mug.
Matt: She is.
Liam: My mug? Here's mine.
Matt: On river time, there you go.
Marisha: On river time, what?
Matt: That is-- that's a mug.
Marisha: Did you instantly turn into a 64-year-old golfer as soon as you went there?
Liam: I'm on a river. I'm on a river.
Laura: I'm on a boat. I'm on a boat.
Matt: So that's going on. Other things we want to mention. We'll have a special presentation at the break today. We're taking a break from the 826LA charity for another special charity that has been running for the past week known as GameChanger: it's a cancer charity and it's been working in conjunction with SquareEnix this past week. To raise money for cancer research, they've been doing-- if you donate $1 to it they're giving away codes for the first Deus Ex game for PC and a lot of other fun stuff. We'll have more information and a presentation for you at the break. So be aware that's the fun charity we're promoting tonight, so if anyone has the ability to give, please do, they're an awesome charity. We're also waiting on Sam Riegel and Taliesin Jaffe, they're both fighting traffic but will be here shortly. However, let's go ahead and cut to the intro to give us a one-minute break, and then we'll jump right into this crazy, crazy episode. So see you in just a moment. [no audio] Well, while we get that figured out--
Orion: Oh, is this a podcast now?
Matt: Apparently.
Orion: (old-timey voice) Old time radio.
Marisha: Well, I think the intro--
Matt: Intro video's frozen.
Orion: Damn it.
Matt: Also, this is, as opposed to making it a surprise, this'll be our last game for a little while with--
Laura: No, don't say it, don't say it yet.
Matt: Don't say it-- okay.
Travis: If you say it, it makes it true.
Marisha: Makes it too real.
Matt: Okay, you're right.
Orion: Ooh.
Matt: I'll hold off, all right.
Liam: Unfortunately, Travis has to leave the show.
Matt: No, that's not true. Grog's ale still needs to be filled.
Travis: Smash.
Matt: Indeed. So we'll patiently wait, folks, pizza at the ready. Now.
Marisha: What's going on?
Liam: Is there a full table behind this computer?
Laura: Pretty much.
Matt: There is, yes.
Laura: Travis is directly behind you.
Liam: Am I in his chest again?
Laura: Yeah, you might be even in his face at this point.
Orion: It's pretty good, though, I like this better than the iPad.
Marisha: And we can see you more.
Laura: Can you still see Travis?
Marisha: Yeah.
Orion: Yeah.
Laura: Oh.
Matt: It'll be fine.
Orion: How can we not see him?
Marisha: Yeah. (laughs)
Laura: That's true.
Orion: He's a mountain of man.
Travis: I am Rushmore.
Marisha: Travis takes up this side of the frame.
Orion: I'm Rushmore.
Matt: If we're having an issue with the intro video, do you want to just go to the game?
Travis: We can do a live intro video.
All: (intro video music)
Matt: Grog! Goliath Barbarian.
Marisha: (crow sound) (laughter)
Matt: -- and we're done.
Travis: I'd been thinking that this had to happen at some point.
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: Boomf! I was being you, Tiberius.
Marisha: Yeah.
Travis: We could totally do a Brady Bunch.
Marisha: Ah ha!
Laura: Light!
Matt: That was pretty good.
Travis: You guys are on the bottom of the feed, right?
Orion: Right.
Travis: So if you looked up and we looked down, we'd essentially be looking at each other.
Marisha: Oh right, Brady Bunch style!
Laura: (gasps) Oh, no way.
Travis: Oh, hi guys.
Marisha: Hi, Travis.
Orion: Is that how it looks?
Travis: And then everyone looks to the right to look at Mercer.
Laura: No, yeah, everyone looks to the same--
Travis: Oh, we look right, you look left.
Travis: No.
Matt: No.
Matt: They look right. Everyone looks right.
Marisha: Everyone looks right? So if we're looking this way, "Hi, Matt!"
Matt: And I disapprovingly look to my left. There you go.
Ashley: Are we still on?
Marisha: Yeah.
Ashley: Still going?
Matt: Real-time Critical Role.
Marisha: We're still kind of confused.
Laura: I can't tell what happening.
Matt: So I figure if the intro video's not working, let's not worry about it. Let's just jump into the game and get this started. How about that?
Travis: Yeah, why not.
Matt: Cool with that?
Ashley: Wait, can we show someone that's here that's really cool?
Matt: What's up?
Marisha: Go ahead and bring him on?
Matt: Oh, well, we're waiting on the break, unless you want to do it now.
Ashley: Do it on the break.
Orion: So we have video problems?
Marisha: You can come say hi.
Orion: I'm Periscope-ing until we're not having video issues.
Matt: Well, as far as I know we're on camera.
Orion: Oh, we are?
Crew: Yeah.
Matt: Yeah, just the intro video's not working.
Orion: Okay.
Marisha: Oh, we probably could have been going for a while. We've just been like dicking around.
Orion: Bye, guys, we're live.
Matt: Ah, welcome to the chaos of live internet. All right, so let's--
Liam: I don't think we should go any more meta than it has to be.
Matt: Let's jump in, guys. Let's jump in. So a little bit of overview for those of you who are just joining us. At this point in the story, Vox Machina, this intrepid band of adventurers, misfits, whatever you must call them, completed an adventure through the Underdark, a very dangerous, cavernous--
Laura: Oh, Sam's here.
Matt: Oh, we're gonna let Sam in.
Marisha: Sam's here!
Orion: Yeah, he texted.
Matt: All right, so after completing this Underdark challenge, they discovered and managed to extract an evil artifact known as the Horn of Orcus that held great power and seemingly has a partner somewhere in the world that is unknown. But the one they have acquired is indestructible, as far as folks know, and it was decided by the Council of Tal'Dorei and Vox Machina that it should be sealed away and hopefully forgotten for the rest of eternity. The best place to do so came up in the conversation to be the city of Vasselheim, which is on a different continent far to the northwest of Tal'Dorei, the kingdom where most of the story as to this point has taken place, to be sealed in what is referred to as the Platinum Sanctuary, the oldest existing temple to Bahamut, the good platinum dragon deity. So they were given passage on a skyship to cross the Ozmit Sea to Othanzia, the continent that houses the capital city, Vasselheim. So the group gathered together, rode on to the magically elevated skyship, and are traversing the ocean carrying the Horn of Orcus within this holy container. Hello!
Marisha: Hi, Sam.
Matt: Sam has joined us.
Sam: Hi!
Matt: They found themselves over the ocean, suddenly attacked by a band of what seemed to be wyvern- and griffin-riding bandits. The battle took place on the top of the skyship, some of the magic being taken out, a few lives lost, but the party managed to persevere, take a captive, and continue on their journey, the Horn of Orcus and its container kept safe. And that's where we pick up and begin.
Sam: Can you say all of that again for me? (laughter)
Travis: You don't listen, anyway.
Matt: No.
Marisha: (laughs) You don't listen, anyway.
Matt: All righty, so as you guys have settled in, the Horn safe, you've taken a couple more days on this journey, what was told to be about a six-day journey across the ocean, six to seven days. Is there anything you guys wish to accomplish at this moment?
Sam: Are we in the air?
Matt: You are still in the air on the skyship.
Sam: Not much we can do.
Marisha: Well, we just-- so we fought off the wyverns.
Sam: Oh, do we have one? We have one.
Travis: Is the little magician halfling still being polite and brushing her teeth and stuff?
Laura: Oh, that's right, our little halfling that we--
Travis: Who you saved. Wuss.
Matt: Yes.
Sam: She's a mage, right?
Matt: That you saved. She is a mage, and she has also been bound, at the orders of the captain, so as not to cause any issues on the ship while she's there. So as to her future, after your conversation with him, as to whether or not she could work on this ship, based on the fact that their first meeting involved her and her band attacking and trying to murder his entire crew, Captain Damon was not too keen on the idea at the time being and decided to lock her up.
Laura: Oh.
Matt: So. We shall see her fate in the near future.
Travis: She's locked up.
Laura: Okay. She's locked up.
Travis: She's got tricks, though, right?
Matt: She has tricks, but there is an anti-magic brig built into the ship specifically for this purpose.
Sam: Ooh. Fancy.
Travis: That's all I needed to know.
Laura: Oh, that's good to know. I was going to pay you to put the kibosh on her.
Orion: She's negged.
Travis: Cool.
Matt: (laughs) So. I'll say that Percy is continuing to read his book. The next few days pass without incident. Is there anything you want to accomplish? Anything?
Orion: You said the next few days without incident? Cool.
Travis: Could I try to further my beard?
Sam: Oh, yes! Try to grow a beard.
Marisha: Yeah, his beard. Let's go for the beard.
Matt: Go ahead and roll another percentage dice.
Travis: Yeah! It's a d20, right?
Laura: It's a percentage die.
Travis: Oh, that's right, that's right. The two in a row. I remember.
Matt: Two d10s.
Travis: I'm learning. I'm learning.
Marisha: Yep.
Matt: First one and the second one.
Travis: Three. Eight.
Matt: 38. The little bit of peach-fuzz stubble on the chin of your goliath face begins to slowly grow. It's coming out colorless. It's almost translucent with a hint of gray and white.
Sam: Ew.
Laura: Ew.
Travis: I'm a Targaryen, baby. (laughter)
Liam: That's hot.
Laura: It's translucent, like--
Matt: A color is there. It's almost like fishing line is growing out of the bottom of his chin.
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: Ugh.
Ashley: Whoa.
Travis: Don't be jealous.
Ashley: Grog, it's sparkling. It's sparkling!
Laura: It's really creepy, Grog.
Ashley: Hey, I feel it. It's like sandpaper, a little bit.
Travis: Thank you. Thank you.
Matt: Keep in mind, goliaths, predominantly-- especially pureblood goliaths-- do not grow facial hair. The fact that this magical feat is even achieving any modicum of growth is in itself an arcane marvel, and who knows what detrimental effects this may have in the long run, going against your physiology.
Travis: Oh, crap. It's all right. It'll make me look really wise, you guys. Nobody will know.
Marisha: I have some beads. If you want, we can braid it and put beads in there.
Laura: Ooh.
Travis: I'm all about it. Beads and bells and shit?
Marisha: Okay!
Marisha: I braid Grog's beard.
Travis: Give me a staff and I'll be Gandalf.
Matt: All right.
Marisha: And put beads in it. And a few flowers, as well.
Travis: Wait! Ooh, weird.
Marisha: It looks nice.
Travis: All right.
Matt: It takes you a lot of concentration to try and get any sort of braidage through the about an inch to inch and a half facial hair that is growing from his chin.
Marisha: Looks good!
Travis: It's really tight when you braid it like that. It pinches.
Marisha: You'll get used to it.
Laura: Maybe you can cast Grasping Vine on his chin and grow it out.
Matt: What could possibly go wrong? (laughter)
Travis: Do it. Could be great.
Orion: I suggest against this.
Travis: I thought you suggest violence.
Orion: No.
Sam: He encourages violence.
Laura: I encourage violence.
Orion: I'm against this.
Ashley: Is it just violence?
Laura: So we're healed. We're healed, right?
Sam: Oh, days have gone by, right?
Matt: Yeah, you guys have rested. Days have gone by, your spells have returned to you--
Liam: Hey, DM, days have gone by?
Laura: Trinket's feeling good.
Matt: Days have gone by at this time. You've continued traveling over the Ozmit Sea.
Orion: Are we nearing the destination?
Matt: I'll get to that in just a second. Do you have a question, Liam?
Liam: No, not a question, but last night while Grog was sleeping-- I can see right up Grog's nose. While Grog was sleeping, I went and got a bit of rope from the ship and used my disguise kit that I have. I sort of frayed a part of the rope and spent about an hour using spirit gum to glue bits of frayed rope to Grog's chin into a small Gilmore-esque goatee. And he didn't seem to wake up, and I'd like to see how that worked out.
Matt: (laughs) All righty.
Travis: I'm gonna do a sleep check or something, right? I can't let him survive that.
Matt: For this, go ahead and make a perception check with disadvantage.
Travis: With disadvantage?!
Sam: Because you're asleep!
Travis: One. (laughter)
Orion: Get it out now.
Matt: You wake up the following morning and immediately run to the nearest reflective surface to check on yourself, and you have a glorious, dark brown, well-braided, mildly frayed, thick, coarse goatee braid. It goes about a good three to four inches from the bottom of your chin. And you are very proud.
Travis: I knew it! I knew it! I am a special boy. (laughs) (laughter)
Travis: Only this one strand is this color and everything else is white and translucent, whatever--
Orion: I think it looks good on you, Grog.
Travis: Thank you! I wave my head and it whips around.
Ashley: (sings) I whip my beard back and forth.
Travis: (sings) I whip my beard back and forth.
Matt: It stays taut on your chin. All right, so as you reach the middle of the sixth day of travel, the sky, which up to this point had been fairly sunny and clear, begins to slowly cloud over. The weather grows more gray, and the clouds themselves seem to cluster more into-- I wouldn't say a stormfront, but definitely a more gloomy atmosphere.
Marisha: Can I do a nature check to see if this seems to be natural or arcane?
Matt: Certainly.
Orion: Nice.
Laura: (sings) With her big fancy die!
Marisha: Okay, that's a 10 plus-- 20, total.
Matt: All right. Looking at these clouds, it is a slow formation, and they aren't moving at an unnecessary speed or seem to have any ominous press towards you. It just seems like the weather itself towards this northern continent seems to be of a colder variety.
Orion: I'm going to sense the weather, I suppose, because this doesn't look fun.
Matt: Okay. The weather is cold.
Orion: Ooh, it's cold.
Travis: So the weather outside is frightful?
Laura: Good call, Tiberius. Good call. I agree, it is rather cold.
Orion: I don't like this. Scanlan.
Sam: Oi?
Orion: Like we were discussing earlier, would you be interested in the still-standing trade of my Ioun Stone for your circlet-crown thingy?
Sam: Oh, you know what, Tiberius, I have been giving this a lot of thought and consideration. What's for lunch?
Orion: What would you like for lunch? I already ate.
Sam: Oh. No. No, I was done with the conversation.
Travis: Oh, good diss.
Laura: Oh.
Ashley: Oh.
Orion: Well. Keyleth, if you could put a little slate up for me, I'd like to illustrate something for little Scanlan. And perhaps his tiny mind can comprehend it. (clears throat)
Laura: Ooh!
Ashley: Hey, that's rude.
Orion: Would you, perhaps, do this?
Laura: His tiny mind is exactly proportionate for the rest of his body, Tiberius.
Sam: Well, not the entire body.
Orion: I'm going to walk up to the hull and be like--
Marisha: No! Write it right here! I throw up a slate.
Orion: Oh. (clears throat)
Matt: Okay. It's the strangest wall you've constructed, as up in the air on the ship that is mostly constructed out of iron and metal, there is little to no stone available of which you can sprout a Wall of Stone. However, there are weights set up on top, so what you create is less of a smooth Wall of Stone and more of a very thin, brittle shale wall that may function for the time being, but probably won't stand up for more than five to ten minutes.
Orion: I see. Prestidigitation. Some chalk.
Matt: All right.
Orion: You see, Scanlan, you've had this particular piece for over ten, let's say, matches or weeks. You have used it zero times. In over six battles, over the same course, using it zero times. (laughter)
Orion: I, being a sorcerer, have a special ability called sorcerer points, where I can do multiple spells in a single round.
Sam: Yes.
Orion: Which none of you can do. Other than monks, of course.
Laura: That's true. Brag about it, Tiberius. Just keep bragging about it.
Orion: When I can do multiple spells, like two, versus you, who can do one, that means that I can do one more spell than you can per round. (laughter)
Sam: All right.
Orion: And every round after that. One hundred percent. (laughter)
Sam: This is amazing.
Orion: Your utilization of the actual item has been equivalent to nothing. In the interest of the group and the use of items in general, it would be wise to switch it, because you have needed extra spells like Invisibility--
Matt: The shale wall cracks. (laughter)
Orion: Several times.
Marisha: I'm sorry.
Orion: Where my item would be more useful in general to you.
Liam: May I ask, is magical ability inversely proportionate to wisdom?
Orion: Oh, me?
Sam: Who are you asking?
Ashley: Is magical ability inversely proportionate to wisdom?
Orion: Absolutely not. I am one of the strongest casters in all of Draconia, and it only takes the strength of my charisma to do my stuff.
Laura: Oh. Everything makes sense now, Tiberius.
Travis: So are you saying you want what he has back?
Sam: (laughs) I didn't recognize you, Grog. Is that you?
Travis: It is I, Brad Pitt from Legends of the Fall. (laughter)
Travis: My beard of glory.
Orion: That is a movie.
Travis: It's an old bard's tale.
Orion: So, Scanlan. What say you?
Sam: Your mathematical skills have been quite impressive.
Orion: I don't like to show them off.
Sam: No, no. For a man of such low wisdom, you are proving wiser than I ever imagined. (laughter)
Sam: I will gladly make this trade with you. You have convinced me.
Laura: Hey.
Marisha: Aww.
Orion: Oh, wonderful. Thank you.
Sam: Yes. Yes.
Ashley: Hey.
Laura: That's wonderful.
Sam: All right. Hugs, hugs, hugs. (laughter)
Orion: (explosion sound)
Sam: Now, what does this thing do?
Orion: Now you can store up to three level spells. Three of them in there.
Laura: Oh, it's better than the Pearl of Power!
Orion: And you don't have to expend spell slots to do the spells.
Sam: All right. Thank you very much.
Ashley: Hey.
Laura: That's a good trade.
Travis: Oh my god, that was so good.
Ashley: That was amazing.
Orion: You can put three Lightning Bolts in there and it costs nothing.
Ashley: Oh, math!
Sam: All right, all right. I'm man enough to admit that he's convinced me.
Travis: That was so good.
Ashley: That was awesome.
Travis: I don't know what you wrote, but it looked good.
Marisha: Oh, man.
Orion: I'm sorry.
Matt: The Ioun Stone which you had taken, you place by your head and release. It seems to fix itself in the air and slowly rotate above your head.
Orion: It orbits.
Matt: Almost held in its own orbital gravity around your head.
Laura: Ooh.
Sam: Pike.
Ashley: Oh. (laughs) Oh, wow. It's like you have a halo.
Orion: It is fancy.
Sam: It's like a halo. Like your god has smiled on me, maybe, and said, "He's cool. Go for it."
Ashley: Oh, wow. Well, I don't know if that's what it means.
Sam: Well. You know, religion is up to interpretation, so I interpret it that way.
Ashley: It is very cool-looking.
Sam: Thank you, Pike.
Travis: (laughs) So casual, her god. "It's cool. Go for it."
Matt: (laughs) Sarenrae. The she-bro you never had. (laughter)
Sam: Sarenrae's my wingman.
Ashley: We cool, Sarenrae.
Travis: I can't breathe.
Matt: Many a cart hold that bumper sticker. All right, so as this conversation comes to a close, the temperature in the sky has gotten noticeably chillier. And you swear for an instant you start seeing what looks like specks of white snow beginning to drift from the clouds ahead.
Marisha: (gasps) It's snowing.
Laura: It's snow, Keyleth.
Sam: (sings) I'm dreaming of a white whatever-we-celebrate.
Travis: Festivus!
Orion: Festivus.
Marisha: There was something I should probably tell you. In this area of land, in Vasselheim, on this continent, somewhere, I'm not sure where, resides the Fire Ashari. Somewhere in the town of Pyrah.
Laura: What's that?
Ashley: Ooh.
Laura: What are Fire Ashari?
Marisha: Well, they're my sister tribe. They're a part of my sister tribe. I come from the Air Ashari.
Laura: Right.
Travis: Uh-huh.
Marisha: Yeah, from Zephra.
Ashley: (whispers) Fire Ashari?
Laura: So they-- oh.
Marisha: Yeah, so there are Fire Ashari. So the point behind the Ashari-- I'm not sure I have expressed this to you all in the past few months. The point of our tribe is we sought out the weakest points where the elemental planes start to bleed with our plane of existence, and these planes need to be protected, so our people have sought them all out in order to make haven there and be the protectors that we were all born to be. And as part of my Aramente, I have to seek out each of the headmasters and prove myself a worthy leader.
Travis: Ooh.
Marisha: Which makes me really nervous.
Laura: We've got your back, Keyleth.
Ashley: Oh, you'll do it. You'll totally do it.
Travis: Yeah. Yeah, we can burn shit for days.
Marisha: So I just thought, you know, maybe after we handle the Horn, maybe we can pop in. You know, since we're here.
Laura: Totally. You know, if you want to, Keyleth, when we go, we'll all follow your orders and make it seem like you're an extraordinary leader of us.
Travis: Ooh, yeah.
Marisha: Oh. That could be good. Oh, that sounds fun!
Orion: Oh. Good idea, yes. Of course, I will be your mage guard.
Travis: Do they make you burn things as a display of your abilities?
Marisha: Well, they kind of teach me new things.
Laura: Ooh!
Marisha: They kind of instill me with their knowledge.
Laura: So the tornado thing. You could be like a fire tornado?
Marisha: I could. I know!
Travis: Shut up!
Marisha: I'm so excited! But yes. Super nervous, because social skills aren't my strongest suit.
Laura: We've noticed.
Travis: You're a natural. You're great.
Laura: You're great, though.
Marisha: Oh, you guys.
Ashley: But it's very charming.
Travis: We gotta go there. It's fire everywhere!
Orion: (laughs) Oh.
Marisha: Yes. Yes.
Liam: Is everything copacetic between the different tribes?
Travis: Oh, good question.
Marisha: What? What?
Travis: Is it copacetic?
Laura: Are you guys friendly with each other?
Liam: Are they happy?
Orion: The tribes.
Marisha: Well, yes. Yeah, no, we're all happy. I mean, that's kind of the thing, where once a generation someone sets out and goes on the Aramente in order to come back a headmaster, and it's kind of like our once-a-generation check-in, if you will, to make sure everything's okay.
Travis: Exchange students.
Marisha: Unfortunately, the last person to go on the Aramente didn't come back, which happens sometimes. Yeah.
Travis: Like, didn't come back ever?
Marisha: No.
Laura: So, like, you could die?
Orion: Or maybe they got lost to the winds of the road.
Travis: Right, yeah.
Marisha: It was actually my mother.
Orion: Oh, goodness.
Laura: (gasps) What?
Travis: To which tribe?
Marisha: I-- we don't know. She left when I was a little girl, so I don't remember much. So I don't know if she's alive or dead, really, but--
Laura: Keyleth.
Travis: We did not know that.
Marisha: It's okay. It's okay.
Travis: Yeah, no bigs, right?
Laura: Yeah.
Travis: Just your mother.
Marisha: I mean, it's-- I mean. Well. It's fine. It's just. It's weird. I haven't seen her, so I don't know.
Sam: Awkward.
Marisha: I barely remember her.
Travis: Do you think there's a chance of when we visit this place, we might have to defend ourselves?
Marisha: No. No. I wouldn't think so.
Orion: Which means "of course."
Laura: It's not like your family, Grog. They're actually nice.
Marisha: Yeah, we're pretty-- we're cool.
Travis: Look, my family is nice, too. We just share love with fists.
Orion: Understandable.
Laura: That sounds wrong in so many ways.
Travis: It does, actually.
Liam: Keyleth, did your mother have to go alone, or does your tribe permit there to be help for you?
Marisha: I'm assuming it would be okay. We're pretty welcoming.
Laura: That's good.
Travis: Yeah, we should totally be there.
Laura: All right. We will go.
Marisha: Yeah.
Travis: And maybe ask them if they've seen your mom.
Marisha: Yeah. That'd be interesting.
Laura: Yeah.
Marisha: It's weird. There's this part of me in the back of my head that kind of always wonders if I'm going to run into her.
Travis: How old-- when was the last time you saw your mother, or do you even remember?
Marisha: I was five, six maybe, years old when she left.
Travis: Wow.
Marisha: So I'm the next in line.
Laura: (whispers) Wow.
Sam: This is heavy.
Travis: Yeah.
Ashley: This is very heavy.
Marisha: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bring the mood down.
Sam: No, it's fine. It's good to know this.
Marisha: I'm just letting you know that we're going to be in that neck of the woods, so I should probably--
Laura: Stop by.
Ashley: Yes.
Marisha: -- you know, go.
Travis: Absolutely.
Laura: Give a little hello.
Matt: "Land sighted!" A voice breaks out from the side of the ship's bow.
Orion: Ooh.
Matt: You guys glance over quickly to the edge of the skyship, and you see, right over the edge of Deera, what looks to be this ominous continent slowly approaching. Through the mists, the low clouds of this area, you can make out what looks to be a fairly heavily wooded and overgrown landscape. You can see dark forest peppered with a little bit of snowfall across the top.
Laura: My kind of place.
Matt: Occasional mountaintops and peaks breaking through the canopy of the distant forest.
Laura: Look, Trinket! Home.
Matt: Trinket looms up to the side and looks a bit chilly and shakes it off. At which point, Kima comes up and joins the rest of you. Puts her elbows over and looks off wistfully for a second and goes, (sighs) "It's been some time. Welcome to Othanzia, folks. It's an interesting place."
Travis: It is, isn't it?
Laura: We'll follow your lead.
Matt: She points off, says, "This forest here we refer to as the Vesper Timberland, and it goes for miles and miles and miles before bleeding into endless tundra to the north, so let's hopefully not travel that far." (sighs) "This'll be interesting." And she turns around and heads back down into the ship. As you continue--
Laura: Good talk!
Marisha: Why did she say that? (laughs) I know!
Orion: Who was that person?
Marisha: That was so weird, right?
Orion: Everywhere we go. It's everywhere we go. Why can't people be normal?
Travis: She's warming up to me, I can feel it.
Matt: As the ship slowly begins to descend, you can see, in the distance, from one of the various mountain ranges that break past the top, there is one singular mountain spire that tends to protrude from the center of the forest, about 20 to 30 miles off the shoreline of the Ozmit Sea. Around the base of this mountain, you can see, the closer you get to it, what looks like hundreds upon hundreds of stone buildings. You can see little details along the mountainside. Countless staircases are spiraling up this mountain in different directions in a chaotic fashion. There are large structures, fortresses, built into the side of this mountain spire as you progress up the top. And this city proper, which spreads out, I'd say, about a third larger than Emon. Layers of walls and walls and walls. This is probably the most-fortified city you've seen in your existence up to this point. Slowly it begins to bring itself down towards-- and you can see, as you get closer to the city, the walls vary in color and material. Some look recently built. Some look like they'd been constructed in the past 50 to 60 years or so from fine, smooth stone, using modern architectural techniques. Some walls look extremely ancient, partially crumbled and having to be refortified. You also notice the top of these walls are completely covered with what looks like these strange dragon-headed ballistae. These defense ballistae that are along every single row of walls. This is a city that is meant to withstand--
Marisha: A siege.
Matt: -- any sort of a siege or onslaught.
Laura: Does it look like it's suffered a lot of sieges? I mean, is there battle damage to the--
Matt: It's hard to tell from this distance. You're just starting to pick up details as the ship slowly descends into the city of Vasselheim proper. But from what you can tell, there are scars across some of the larger buildings. Some of the walls look like they have sections that have been knocked down and then rebuilt and then knocked down and then rebuilt. This is a very, very old, old city. Slowly, the ship descends towards what looks like a smoothed-out, flattened platform on top of some mill of some kind. It doesn't look like it's built for skyship purposes, more than it's been haphazardly put together to receive a skyship should it come to the city. But it looks like that type of travel doesn't come to this area too often. At this point in time, you can see now, the crew is gathering their ropes, they're getting ready to go ahead and lower it down. Captain Damon is slowly steering and shouting directions back and forth to his deckhands. The Scalebearers and Kima come up to the top of the ship, carrying the box that contains the Horn of Orcus, as well. As the ship slowly makes its way to dock on the top of this mill, Kima, who has all of her materials over her shoulder, says, "All right, so. It's everyone's first time here in the city?"
Sam: Yes.
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: Yeah, well. Keyleth?
Orion: I've never been here.
Marisha: No.
Sam: Okay. Yes.
Matt: "All right."
Orion: And there's enough in the interim for a short rest from us getting from there to the last day to where we're at?
Matt: Yeah, yeah.
Travis: A day's rest? All right.
Orion: Okay, cool. Awesome.
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: Tiberius, you ever been here?
Orion: No. (laughter)
Laura: Is it cold in the city?
Matt: It's pretty chilly as you come down. I mean, you wear furs naturally in cold environments, but this is-- the temperature's to the point where you may have to consider getting a little bit of warmer clothing if you travel too far outside of the city.
Travis: How do goliaths do? Not wearing much.
Laura: I have a lot of winter cloaks already in my--
Sam: We have some fancy cloaks, too, don't we?
Laura: Well, those are fancy clothes.
Sam: Oh.
Laura: But I've got winter coats that I bought for the group a long time ago.
Sam: All right. Pass them out.
Laura: All right.
Matt: So she pulls out the really nice, thick--
Marisha: Oh, that's right. We went shopping.
Laura: Remember?
Marisha: I remember.
Ashley: Oh, we went shopping.
Travis: We have three other fancy robes.
Ashley: We had a girl shop day.
Marisha: Yep.
Sam: A fancy. I want a fancy robe.
Travis: You do? It's huge on you. You want it anyway.
Orion: I'd have to take off my cloak, though, to wear that, right?
Matt: Yeah.
Orion: I won't wear one. I keep my cloak on.
Travis: I give you a colorful one.
Sam: I'll gird it.
Matt: We'll say you could probably put it over. It will just look a little chunky.
Orion: Okay.
Sam: I'm going to take a large fancy robe and try to tie it up-- to gird it so that it looks okay.
Laura: He wants a fancy robe, not a fur.
Travis: Be aware, we only have two left.
Sam: I'm going to gird my loins.
Matt: And you gird them well. You look like the tiniest Turkish wrestler you've ever seen.
Laura: Oh. (laughter)
Matt: It's kind of adorable.
Sam: Also, I'm going to cast Lightning Bolt into the Ioun Stone.
Orion: Yay.
Matt: Okay. So mark that down, you have a third-level Lightning Bolt saved. You still used the spell slot, but after you rest, it'll be safe inside there. Which is an interesting experience, you see him do this arcane finger wiggle in the air, and then he releases what is a burst of electrical energy that immediately funnels itself and vanishes into the stone, which is now humming with this low pulsing glow of greenish-blue light.
Sam: (whispers) Pike, are you watching this?
Ashley: Wow, and you're--
Laura: It's green? It's a green-- wait, is it like a diamond shape?
Sam: I don't know.
Laura: It's like a Sim!
Marisha: Oh, it's like a Sims thing.
Orion: It's like a little--
Laura: As long as it's green, you're happy, Scanlan!
Orion: But I believe it's white, right? It's a white stone?
Matt: It is a white stone, but the energy glowing off it is greenish in color.
Orion: Ah, there you go.
Marisha: He's happy.
Ashley: And you're so well-girded.
Sam: I'm girded and I've got a shiny head.
Matt: Eventually the ship comes to a stop. You feel a little bit of a lurching sensation as the ship suddenly halts its advancing. All the ropes get dropped off the sides. They start bringing what looks to be some sort of a haphazard crane also, in preparation for Trinket to be lowered off the ship. You can see, there's a look of-- I can't describe it better than anxiousness to Kima. She says, "If you have any questions about the city, just speak up and I'll do my best."
Laura: Where do we take the Horn?
Sam: (laughs) That's a good question. (laughter)
Matt: "I believe--" And she looks over the edge of the ship. "I believe our escorts will be happy to guide us."
Laura: Our escorts?
Liam: I'd like to do an insight check before we hustle off.
Matt: On?
Travis: Kima.
Liam: Kima.
Matt: Go for it.
Orion: I would like to look for any places-- oh, sorry.
Liam: I rolled an 18.
Matt: Okay, and what are you trying to glean off of her?
Liam: Why does she seem anxious? Does she seem different? Does her demeanor seem different, or does she just seem in a hurry?
Matt: You can probably take it as a little bit of being in a hurry, but you also get the feeling like-- there's a nervousness to her that stems-- it's hard to really tell where it comes from, but there is a nervousness to her.
Laura: Kima, when was the last time you were with your Order?
Matt: "Proper? That would be eight years."
Laura: Oh.
Orion: That's a long time to be out of Order.
Matt: "Of which-- we are about to meet them."
Orion: Sorry.
Sam: High five.
Laura: Do you get along well with them?
Matt: "Yes. Yes. They're just, well." (laughs) "You'll see." And she leaps over the side of the ship, grabbing the rope, and lowers herself down, as do the rest of the-- the two Scalebearers come down in tandem, clutching the chain on the sides of the box, bringing it down almost like a big Jacob's ladder.
Travis: (quietly) I love you.
Matt: Eventually, you all make your way onto the platform, and they're waiting for you. You see there's a cluster of well-armored men and women, wearing semi-matching gray tabards over patchwork and plated armor. They look like a really rough-and-tumble militia, but they all stand firm and as you guys walk up, they give a nod of respect and understanding. Amongst them, you see one gentleman, an elderly gentleman with no hair, completely bald, thick spectacles on the tip of his nose, wearing the same silver and blue robes as the envoys that met you at the Council of Tal'Dorei, the ones that are carrying the box. As you all approach, Kima steps out ahead and says, "Yonn. It's been a while."
Sam: Yonn.
Matt: The old man steps forward. "It has been, indeed, Kima. It has, indeed. And that's Scalebearer Yonn, if you don't mind--"
Travis: Scalebearer.
Matt: "I would prefer in mixed company the proper niceties of our presentation."
Laura: Oh, we're no proper company. It's all right.
Matt: "Hm. And you are?"
Sam: We are--
Orion: I'm Tiberius Stormwind, and we are Vox Machina. Everybody has names, too.
Laura: Hmm.
Ashley: I'm Pike.
Marisha: Keyleth.
Sam: I'm Ioun Stone-bearer Scanlan. (laughter)
Matt: He cocks his head curiously.
Sam: You can call me Kingslayer. I also did that.
Matt: "Very well." Percy introduces himself, as well.
Travis: I have a beard. (laughter)
Matt: He gives you the most curious look of all, which is hard to follow off of Scanlan over here. "And I'm to understand these are the bearers of the artifact?" Kima gives a nod. "Yes, and I think we should be on our way quickly." "Yes, yes, of course. Please. These are our escorts. Follow suit. We will bring you onward to the Platinum Sanctuary proper to dispose of this thing."
Sam: How far is the Platinum Sanctuary?
Matt: "No more than a 25-minute walk."
Laura: Oh.
Sam: Oh.
Ashley: May I insight-check Yonn?
Matt: You may.
Liam: Yes, please.
Marisha: Oh, so--
Orion: I'm going to look for any temples that might have a sigil inside while we're going through the town.
Matt: All right. Do you want to ask around about that?
Orion: I'll ask the Yonn guy.
Matt: Okay. Well, first off, you finish your insight check. What did you roll?
Ashley: What did you get, Liam?
Liam: 13.
Ashley: Okay. I got 15.
Matt: Okay. He seems stuffy. He seems definitely dedicated to whatever his intent is, but there doesn't seem to be anything deceptive in his speech.
Marisha: So am I correct to assume our plan is that we're going to march this Horn through the town? Until we get to the temple?
Laura: Well, nobody knows what it is.
Orion: Right.
Sam: Well, unless someone--
Laura: So we'll just be aware there's a huge envoy.
Marisha: I mean, we can only assume-- Yonn?
Matt: "Yes?"
Marisha: How many people in this city are aware of this Horn being brought here?
Matt: "Well, up until now, other than myself, you travelers, and the Highbearer Vord himself, no one else."
Orion: Hm.
Marisha: Highbearer Vor-- his name is Vord?
Matt: "Vord. The Highbearer of the Platinum Dragon."
Laura: What kind of man is he?
Matt: You hear when he mentions Vord, Kima twitches a little bit, and you remember Kima's official title is Lady Kima of Vord.
Laura: Hm.
Orion: Hm.
Sam: Her ex?
Travis: Is that her pops? Her pops?
Orion: Vonn. Yonn?
Matt: "Scalebearer Yonn, yes."
Orion: Oh, Scalebearer Yonn, that's a fun name. (clears throat) As we travel through town, if you could point me to any place that would have a sigil of arcane-ness--
Sam: Arcane-iosity is what he's trying to say.
Matt: "There are none."
Orion: Oh.
Matt: "This city, arcane magic for the most part, is not allowed within consistent practice. This is a divine, a holy place."
Orion: Ah.
Matt: "And the arcane tends to, ah. How do you say, when unwatched, corrupt and destroy from the inside. "
Liam: Oh shit, Tiberius.
Orion: No, I'm fine! He's talking about other people.
Travis: You don't have any arcane abilities anyway, right?
Orion: Oh of course I do, I'm a sorcerer.
Laura: No no no, right?
Sam: Ix-nay.
Travis: Wink wink, nudge nudge.
Orion: No, no, I think he-- sure.
Matt: "This here in Vasselheim, the cradle of faith, the Dawn City, of once all civilization and current faith once stemmed from. There is no way in but by foot. It is a pilgrimage, a journey for each to come here, and those that stay, stay of their own will and divine right." And as he refers to the guards, each guard you see now has around their neck a very visibly shown holy symbol of some kind of deity. Most seem to fall--
Marisha: We've basically walked into the Crucible.
Orion: It's fine.
Matt: -- into the realm of Arathis, Avandra, Melora, and a couple with Bahamut. None of--
Ashley: None of Sarenrae.
Matt: None of Sarenrae.
Travis: Or as Liam calls it, Sa-REN-rae.
Laura: The best one?
Ashley: The best, the best one.
Liam: Sa-REN-rae! (laughter)
Ashley: Sarenrae!
Orion: I'm going to take it you don't see very many dragonborn in these parts.
Matt: "No, and frankly you're making me a bit nervous."
Orion: Oh.
Matt: "However, as we ourselves are followers of the Platinum Dragon, we understand that it is dragonkind at the heart of it, the metallics, that bring life and civilization and order to this world."
Orion: Yes.
Matt: "Your color I find off-putting."
Orion: It's--
Laura: I've always noticed a fine metallic sheen coming from your red scales.
Orion: No, I'm of the chromatic nature, I'm a bit of an anomaly in my family, they're all of the metallic brand, I assure you. The Stormwind name runs true and wide throughout Draconia, but--
Matt: "I have heard of the Stormwinds, yes."
Orion: I cast Alter Self real quick and I turn myself into, I believe, gold. Because that's the red-- equivalent of red. On the metallic scale.
Matt: Okay. He gives you a curious look and goes--
Orion: I think that would be better for everyone involved.
Matt: "I would be mindful to not do such things so openly in public in the future."
Orion: Oh, sorry.
Matt: "Ahem." And he kind of adjusts his robe. "This way please, follow me." And Scalebearer Yonn leads you--
Laura: You look very nice, Tiberius.
Ashley: You look really great in gold.
Orion: Thank you, thank you.
Marisha: So wait, hang on, hang on, hang on.
Travis: What?
Marisha: Before we move on-- we're about to leave, I'm assuming?
Matt: You're stepping off the platform onto a staircase that leads off of the top of the mill.
Marisha: Should a few of us kind of like flank around and--
Laura: Definitely, we should all kind of surround the box, sure.
Travis: Like rooftops and shit.
Marisha: Rooftop shit, yeah.
Laura: Oh.
Travis: I like it.
Marisha: I can go eagle form and have aerial support.
Travis: I love it.
Laura: I can stick to the rooftops, I guess, try to follow along.
Travis: Overwatch.
Marisha: Overwatch. What's that? Yeah.
Laura: I'll snick to the rooftops and try to follow along, sniper eye.
Marisha: Okay.
Travis: Yeah, you two up top.
Ashley: I'll just stay right on the path.
Travis: Yep, you and me.
Matt: All right.
Travis: Smash hands.
Matt: All right, so.
Orion: I'll take the six.
Matt: Okay. As you--
Liam: I'm gonna stay with it but try to blend in with the crowd.
Matt: All right, all right. Go ahead and make a stealth check.
Liam: Yes.
Travis: Scanlan?
Liam: 23 for stealth.
Matt: All right, ah, if you wouldn't mind, Vex, making a stealth check as well?
Laura: Oh.
Travis: Overwatch.
Matt: Just to keep your rooftop activity inconspicuous.
Laura: Not disturbing.
Travis: We have a UAV.
Laura: Oh, well I rolled a one. So that's lovely.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Are you flying up above?
Marisha: Yeah, I'm going eagle.
Travis: Don't you have advantage?
Laura: Do I have advantage in-- no.
Orion: And I'm taking up the rear, following behind.
Matt: No. Not in this terrain, unfortunately.
Ashley: But there are forests here.
Laura: But with the forests I'd be amazing.
Liam: I do applaud your honesty, though, sister.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: So as you loudly clomp up and begin rooftop-hopping, a few individuals in the city kind of take notice and they point up, which by the way--
Laura: I wink at them as I'm climbing up.
Matt: Ah, the classic Vex wink. All right, so. Just you guys-- kind of atmosphere, as you step down the staircase and get to the main city street proper, the first thing you notice, the roads themselves are not cobblestone, are not brick, they are mud. They are thick, recently sleeted mud. You hear the clomping of horse hooves as carts are pulled through and each one is a sickly (squelch) sound as each footstep makes it through. The people of this city are a very hardened and rugged folk. Most clothing is swathed in furs and thick leathers, armor is patchwork in itself, most of the men grow coarse facial hair and the women themselves, their hair is wild and their appearance very stoic and grizzled. The landscape of Vasselheim-- oh, thank you kindly. Delivery of our chicken.
Marisha: Chicken through the magic door.
Matt: The people who live here, you gather, quickly walking through-- and Kima gives you a bit of insight as well-- live here not because it's easy to live, not because there's many comforts, it's a very harsh living in the city of Vasselheim. But the city is also currently the oldest known bastion of civilization in the world. As far as it's understood, most human civilization, and a lot of humans believe pre-elf and pre-dwarf, although the dwarves and elves very staunchly disagree, all stemmed from this city, which is believed to be tens of thousands of years old. They have uncovered the single oldest temples to the main deities of good and neutrality within this city, and as such it is considered the holiest place in the modern world, which is why it has been through many, many wars and has seen much warfare and strife and difficulty. And those that live here live here because they feel that they can fight against this, and they actually call it a privilege to exist in this harsh landscape as devotion to their respective deities. Also, because it is such a holy place, this is why the arcane is considered, for the most part, profane in public and very carefully controlled otherwise.
Travis: So we gotta be sneaky with that.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: The buildings look old--
Travis: So I'll put my spells in my back pocket for now.
Matt: The buildings range from old to newer stone, warped wood from just the weather itself. You can see a lot of the wood has a kind of mossy texture to it just from the general overgrowth that tends to take the city. It's not kept for beauty, it's kept for function. There's scars across most of the buildings where you can see warfare has bled into the city, and there are markings and various points of ancient damage and certain structures that have not been rebuilt, that have just been left in ruin where they stand, because they have not yet found somebody or a purpose to be restructured. It's a very different landscape than what you're used to, and the walk itself is a very solemn, quiet walk through the city. The folks that do take notice just kind of give a nod of acknowledgement or a gruff grunt as they pass by. There doesn't seem to be a definite interest in your travel, this isn't a special occasion. It seems like travelers and strange occurrences are not that unnatural in this city.
Marisha: Okay. So it's like New York.
Matt: You could say that, yeah. It's a very ancient New York.
Sam: And we're carrying a large ark, or a box of some sort?
Matt: You are carrying the platinum box that the Horn was kept in.
Sam: How big is it?
Matt: It's approximately like a foot and a half, or two feet by two feet.
Ashley: Oh, Taliesin's here.
Laura: Oh!
Travis: Taliesin's outside.
Sam: And it's platinum? It's just a platinum box?
Matt: Yes, it is made of like solid platinum and silver with a series of very, very intricate scrolling and engravings on it.
Marisha: Is it sticking out like a sore thumb?
Laura: There were some sapphires in there, too, some blue sapphires, I remember.
Matt: Yes, yes.
Marisha: Is it sticking out like a sore thumb?
Matt: Best you can tell, there are people taking notice of it, but none that like stop and gawk, they just kind of, "huh." Keep walking.
Marisha: Damn, maybe we should've thrown a blanket or something over it.
Matt: You could if you want to, now.
Travis: Can we, though?
Marisha: Burlap sack or something? Anybody?
Matt: The guards still flanking you guys, surrounding this ensemble as it presses towards the base of the mountain. You make your way towards the edge of the mountain, or where the mountain begins at the bottom of the floor, and you can see dozens of staircases ascending the outskirts of this giant pointed cragless spire that just sticks up into, actually, the clouds cut off the top of it. It's reminiscent of Gatshadow, the mountain outside of Westruun that you guys traveled to long ago.
Travis: Right.
Matt: But even larger. You continue up this staircase, and the stonework itself is a little lopsided and awkward, and with each step sometimes you have to kinda catch yourself, especially as the wind begins to pick up the higher up the mountain you go, and it takes about 15 to 20 minutes to ascend this staircase. Your legs begin to grow a little sore, until eventually you reach the base of what you can only imagine is the Platinum Sanctuary. You see before you, built into the side of the rock of this mountain, a grand stone fortress that looks older than time in itself. You can see the elements have weathered to the point where even the solid points and how the stonework was meant to be an edge has been rounded and smoothed down. There are a series of silver markings across the outskirts of it, which Tiberius, you recognize as Draconic.
Orion: Look, Percy, it's Draconic.
Taliesin: Oh, so it is. (laughter)
Matt: Certain words in Draconic--
Marisha: Percy, you've been so quiet here lately.
Taliesin: I don't want to talk about it.
Matt: You see phrases emblazoned on the side of this giant temple that say things like "honor, justice." Various, very old base Draconic stuff. The current language is a more refined version. This is a very, very ancient basis of that language.
Orion: See that, Scanlan? That says something like Apollo Justice something.
Sam: It's Phoenix something.
Orion: It's maybe the rise of the justice of the phoenix.
Sam: Nah, I don't know.
Orion: It's a lot of things.
Travis: Dawn of justice--
Matt: On the top of this fortress, you see three constructs that don't match the stone structure. These may have been constructed or built many years later and have been added onto the temple. But three ivory and silver spires, towers that ascend from the top of the fortress itself, almost parallel to the very steep mountainside that this fortress is built into. You come to the front doors of this structure. Two very, very large gray stone doors with almost what looks like white marbling through them, and you can see, mostly worn away but still barely visible, the symbol of a shield with a dragon head emblazoned on the front of it, the symbol of Bahamut. As the Scalebearer-- yes, that there-- as the Scalebearers approach the front, the doors, on their own, and open to the interior, the grinding sound of stone across the marble flooring of the fortress proper. You can see the interior. Did you have a question?
Marisha: Can I see inside the temple? Or are the temples pretty enclosed?
Matt: You can see now as the doors begin to open.
Marisha: Well, I was an eagle flying overhead.
Matt: Oh, yes! You--
Marisha: And I was gonna do a perception check to see if I noticed, like kinda do a loop of the temple.
Matt: Go for it.
Sam: So, I'm an eagle.
Marisha: So I'm an eagle right now, so.
Taliesin: You're such an eagle. Oh my god.
Laura: I very, very poorly fall off of the roof and clamber down.
Marisha: 20 total.
Matt: Best you can tell, there are for the makeshift guards in the city-- which, you've heard them referred to as Bastions, they're all volunteers, and actually from what you gather here, probably a quarter of the populace are Bastions. So they have a very, very heavy civilian-based militia that guards this city.
Sam: Are those the guys who were with us, the envoys?
Matt: Yes. No, no, not the envoys, the envoys' come from the temple of Bahamut, they have the blue and silver robes. You see, they're just wearing makeshift patchwork armor, whatever that could be scavenged or constructed to outfit a militia, essentially.
Sam: Okay.
Matt: You see them going up and down every which staircase, just doing various passes and patrolwork. Some of them have spyglasses and you see them looking off in the distance, and as you're getting higher up the mountain, too, you look out about, and you can see the entire forest around you. Very thick, ominous, and you swear every now and then you can see some trees move suddenly and heavily before coming to rest in the distance.
Marisha: I'm gonna go check that out first.
Matt: The rest of you are entering the temple. Keyleth is not there.
Orion: Is it lit in there?
Matt: The doors close behind you.
Sam: Hope Keyleth is okay.
Laura: Keyleth--
Marisha: (eagle noises)
Liam: I don't think that I was with the group, I think I was back with the crowd--
Laura: No, you--
Sam: Great.
Liam: -- so I see the eagle fly off and I'm just gonna follow after her.
Laura: What?
Matt: The eagle flies out of the city.
Liam: Yeah.
Laura: You're gonna leave the city, brother?
Liam: No.
Orion: You're leaving?
Marisha: Gonna see if I can figure out what's making the trees move.
Liam: Now that I understand the--
Laura: Come on in the temple.
Liam: But do I still get shut in my face? So.
Marisha: I'm flying! I'm fine.
Liam: It's a big solid building, doors are shut, that's it?
Matt: Yeah, I mean, the temple, would you like to enter the temple with the rest of the group?
Laura: Yeah, you would.
Ashley: Yeah, do it.
Matt: All right.
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: So just as the doors are closing, you rush out of your subtle following pattern and, wait, and put your hands up and manage to make your way into the temple right before the doors close, catching up with the rest of the group. Keyleth, make a perception check.
Marisha: I have advantage because I'm an eagle. Ooh, natural 20!
Sam: Nice!
Travis: Nice!
Taliesin: On the shiny die.
Matt: All right.
Orion: It is on the shiny die.
Matt: It's hard to see much of anything because the canopy of this forest is so dense and so thick, and the snowfall itself, which is getting stronger through the air, and is kind of obscuring some of your vision, but you glance down and you see another set of trees shift suddenly about a quarter-mile away from the city's walls. And you can see on the edge of the city wall a number of guards are beginning to swarm up to the ballista and starting to load them and prepare them. You glance down, and all you see are something fast-moving beneath the canopy, something large. Something you can swear you see it looks serpentine-like. But multiple serpentine-like bodies or forms. And then it's gone in a second.
Laura: Hydra! You think it's a hydra?
Orion: I don't want it to be a hydra.
Liam: Stop gasping, I don't see shit, Laura.
Orion: Oh, that's right.
Laura: Shut up!
Matt: You see a couple ballista set loose. The bolts go flying through the air, entering the forest. You can hear a loud screeching sound, and a few dozen forests now begin to shake to the side as the creature makes its way away from the city before going still in the distance.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: You get the sensation that this is a--
Marisha: A common occurrence.
Matt: -- a common occurrence.
Marisha: Okay. Good to know. I'm going to loop back around. Is there like an open window in the temple that I can just fly through--
Orion: Ooh. Is there a super clear one that she could try to go through first?
Marisha: Be like that Windex commercial, back in the day.
Matt: The temple--
Orion: (crashing sounds) Dammit!
Matt: You make your way--
Marisha: I break my neck, I die.
Orion: No.
Matt: There are small-- they are not windows, more than they are slits for arrow defense.
Travis: Right.
Matt: You as Keyleth could squeeze through. It would be one of those things where you have to careen in, transform, and then squeeze through.
Marisha: Okay, I'll do that.
Matt: Which you do, and as you do, you come right into the face of a spear right there--
Laura: (gasps) You should have transformed into a fly.
Matt: -- as another one of the Platinum Dragon guards says, "Who goes there?"
Sam: Oh boy.
Marisha: Hi. Hi.
Matt: Another guard begins to approach from the side.
Marisha: I am with Vox Machina. I'm pretty sure they just came through the front door. It's cool. I was just doing-- just like aerial support. I'm just going to go and reconnect with my group. It's fine.
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Marisha: I'm Keyleth.
Travis: (whispers) Mention the Scalebearer.
Marisha: I'm not good at this shit.
Matt: You're not there, Grog.
Marisha: What am I doing? A persuasion check?
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: Christ.
Orion: You're going to roll a one.
Matt: Sorry, Miss Charisma.
Marisha: Shut up.
Taliesin: Oh, wow.
Marisha: Oh, wait. I don't know why I'm rolling two.
Taliesin: That's real funny.
Marisha: Six?
Laura: Oh no!
Sam: Keyleth's dead.
Orion: (whispers) No, they'll probably just put her in prison.
Matt: The guy holding the spear to you keeps it there. The other guy walks up behind and says, "Let me see your hands."
Laura: (gasps)
Liam: Shit.
Marisha: Why?
Matt: "Let me see your hands." He takes your hands, pulls out a set of shackles--
Laura: (gasps)
Ashley: Oh no.
Matt: -- and locks them on.
Laura: This is the second time you've been arrested!
Marisha: Yeah, it is.
Matt: The guy with spear turns behind you and just holds it to your back as the gentleman who just cuffed you grabs the chain between and starts pulling you towards the main chamber.
Marisha: You know, can we just buzz by the front foyer, and then we'll find my friends, and then we'll all be like, hey, those are my-- It'll be fine.
Orion: I think that's where you're going.
Matt: He leads you down the stairway to an area where it opens up into a small courtyard, takes you to the right of the courtyard into a central chamber, where the rest of Vox Machina is currently being led.
Laura: Keyleth!
Orion: Do I see her?
Matt: Yeah, you guys all see her being led in, in cuffs, essentially.
Orion: Seriously? Again?
Travis: What did you do?
Laura: Again, Keyleth?
Orion: Your Highness, what is your problem?
Ashley: Oh. She's with us. She's with us, she was just outside, we got in before.
Travis: No, we don't know who she is.
Taliesin: Actually, can we have a few minutes to discuss this?
Marisha: Shut up, Grog!
Matt: At this point, Kima turns and says, "She's with me."
Laura: Oh.
Matt: And both the Scalebearers go, "Lady Kima, I am so sorry." And they go ahead and take the cuffs off real fast and pull the spear back and step back.
Ashley: Wow.
Laura: Yeah, you listen to Lady Kima.
Orion: The classic.
Marisha: The classic.
Orion: The classic handcuff wrist twist.
Marisha: Ouch.
Liam: Hardass. (laughter)
Marisha: Yeah, I'm with her.
Matt: They back off and bow deeply and escort themselves off, embarrassed.
Marisha: Did you guys see that?
Ashley: That was cool.
Orion: I nudge Grog.
Travis: That was cool. You were arrested.
Orion: Grog, Grog, I'm nudging you.
Travis: You hadn't done anything.
Taliesin: I knew you had it in you.
Marisha: I'm starting to feel so hardcore.
Orion: I'm just nudging you.
Travis: Oh, okay.
Orion: Because Kima did something super hot.
Taliesin: You need a tattoo.
Marisha: I do need a tattoo.
Travis: I know, I noticed. She doesn't love me, though.
Laura: She does, Grog.
Travis: No, not yet.
Matt: All right. Scalebearer Yonn continues to lead you through this main chamber. And this chamber, like I said, it's the temple. It's strange, because most temples you've seen to Bahamut or many other deities are extravagant or are, you know, built with a modern-day sense of architecture. This is a very plain, simple stone fortress. It's hard to grasp what time it was built, but just the smell itself seems very ancient. There's a scent of dust and age, and functionality to its construct. But there's still a sense of power to it. Especially you, Pike, where you're sensitive to divine energy. This whole place is humming with it. Even though it's not the kind you're used to connecting with. This is-- When they say this is a holy place, you can feel it.
Laura: Is everything okay, Pike?
Ashley: It's just-- there's a lot of holiness here. (laughter)
Orion: I would imagine.
Marisha: Oh.
Sam: On a scale from one to five, five being super holy--
Ashley: Probably six.
Sam: Whoa.
Laura: Whoa.
Marisha: (gasps)
Orion: That's extra holy.
Marisha: This temple goes to six.
Ashley: This temple, I mean this--
Orion: (laughs) This temple goes to six.
Ashley: Just this whole land in particular. I mean there's a lot, there's a lot here, but--
Orion: That is good, though.
Ashley: Yes, good.
Sam: Do you need a moment? Do you need to sit down? Do you need me to hold you?
Ashley: I think I'm okay to keep going.
Laura: All right.
Ashley: But maybe later. We'll see. If I get a little tired.
Matt: At which you feel a nudge at your side and it's an armored elbow from Kima, saying, "If you wouldn't mind holding off on the fraternizing in the temple of Bahamut, I would really appreciate it."
Marisha: Oh, that's right.
Sam: Message understood.
Matt: At which point Scalebearer Yonn is now at the second set of double doors and he presents his holy symbol above his chest, it glows a second, and what was originally just smooth stone doors, you see a divine glow and the symbol of Bahamut you saw at the front of the temple appear for a moment, and then as it vanishes the two doors open on their own into a central worship chamber. This is a much larger domed room. It looks like it goes up about 80 feet to the top of the ceiling, and the dome itself has what looks like an extremely ancient, detailed drawing, like Sistine Chapel-style, the tale of the entirety of creation. You see all the elemental planes represented in the corners, the theoretical corners, where corners would be in a domed room. You can see a crude representation of how all the planes lay over each other, you can see the Astral Plane, you can see where the Nine Hells would exist, and the Abyss itself, and in the center there's the Prime Material Plane, and across it you see a giant image of the great platinum dragon Bahamut drawn in all of his glory, currently snapping down on one of the throats of a multi-headed dragon. This other dragon, with five different heads of five different chromatic colors, and this struggle between what you know to be Bahamut and Tiamat.
Travis: Tiamat?
Matt: Tiamat.
Laura: Is that the bad one?
Matt: You gather.
Liam: That is the baddest one.
Laura: I mean, I know that because I know a lot about dragons.
Matt: Indeed.
Marisha: Whoa. Do I see or learn anything about the elemental planes that I didn't know before?
Matt: Not from the artwork. It's very pretty.
Marisha: Ah, so pretty.
Orion: I take it all in and I'm reminded of one of the museums at home.
Matt: And actually, you've seen this art piece in a book. It's been a long time, but you know that this has been studied before and exists somewhere in Draconia, the tome that talks about this exact temple.
Travis: A book?
Marisha: We just made cave drawings, I don't--
Sam: That's those square things.
Orion: The square things with all the paper leaves in them and squiggles.
Travis: Right.
Laura: Is Tiamat still alive? Is he still around?
Orion: I read a lot of those. Can't put my finger on it.
Matt: At which point both Yonn and Kima and the Scalebearers kind of turn to you with a look of-- kind of understanding that you don't quite know, but also the fear and the knowledge that-- they don't say anything, they just give you a look that says, yes, very much so.
Laura: Oh. I mean. (nervous laugh) Tiamat's still around, huh?
Orion: Unfortunately, yes.
Matt: They continue walking.
Laura: Oh.
Matt: Now, the floor of this chamber, which is a very simple stone, you can see there are small sculptures, each one representing some sort of a humanoid entity dressed in similar robes to the other envoys and members of this temple that you've encountered thus far. Some of them are in full armor, some are wearing just robes, and they're very, very old. Some of them seem a little more recent, and you gather these each have some sort of cultural or religious significance to this temple. However, one of these is not a statue. In the center of this worship chamber, which is strangely, eerily quiet, there is one humanoid that turns to the rest of you. What you see before you is a slender, elven male draped in long, white robes that drag a few feet behind his form across the ground. He has jet-- not jet, stark-white hair that is slicked back against his head, no facial hair, frail but very handsome features. Elves, when they age, they age very gracefully--
Laura: Yeah we do.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: -- and from the look of most elves you've seen, this is a very old elf that has aged very gracefully. He turns to the rest of you and you see across his neck a very, very well-crafted, intricate series of draconic symbols that finishes with a giant emblem of Bahamut himself. His voice rings out and echoes throughout the hallway as you approach, each footstep echoing as you get closer. "Welcome, everyone, to the Platinum Sanctuary. I am called Highbearer Vord."
Laura: Oh, right.
Matt: "Keeper of this most holy of places. I received word from a disciple of mine--" At which Kima has now stepped forward, and bows, kneels before him and says, "Your holiness." At which he looks down with a smile. "Ah, Kima. I am pleased to see you. It has been a long time, my disciple." He looks up to the rest of the group. "I understand you carry something of terrible omen. Let us discuss how to be rid of it. Please. Present the container."
Laura: Right here?
Matt: The Scalebearers step forward and set the container on the ground. They go to reach for it and he goes, "No no no. Do not open it." And he kind of takes a second and holds his symbol to his chest and closes his eyes, and you can see this kind of divine glow pulse off of him for a second.
Marisha: Kima, what's happening?
Matt: She goes, "Shh, shh."
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: The box begins to pulse with the divine light as well, and then suddenly vanishes and he kind of (gasps) catches his breath. "It is as you said. This must be sealed immediately."
Orion: Well, yes.
Marisha: Yeah-huh. We could have just told you that.
Matt: He gives a look to the rest of the group here, and you can see there's a noticeable bead of sweat he kind of wipes off his forehead. "I just needed to confirm that this was not some haphazardly constructed fake or some other artifact mistaken for such a horn, but we indeed have within our presence one of the Horns of Orcus, and this does not bode well."
Laura: (whistles)
Matt: "Thankfully--"
Laura: Are you guys-- oh, sorry.
Matt: "No, please. What do you want to say?"
Laura: I was just wondering. You've had one of these before, yes?
Matt: "No, but we know that these exist. A few of us do; the knowledge itself has been lost to time intentionally. It was brought to my attention, and through discussions with the Council that sent you on this journey, that this would be the safest place to seal such an artifact, and amongst all our other options, as of this time, I see no other choice. So. What's been proposed. Allow me to explain to you the plan. One of our most divine relics of our most beloved protector Bahamut was kept deep beneath this temple, within the mountain we rest against. The Star of Exaltation, a crystal born from the tear Bahamut shed for the sacrifices his first devoted made in the Great War of the Beginnings, the Dawn War. This item was unfortunately lost nearly 300 years ago, giving the last of its power to protect this very Vasselheim. The intervention it brought from our great deity expended and left the artifact destroyed. Since the chamber that held this Star, a blessed and ever-watched nexus beneath the gaze of the Great Platinum Dragon Himself, has gone empty, we've tended to it. We've kept it fairly well-watched and in the state it was originally constructed for. And we think no greater location to seal such a deeply-rooted evil exists within our spheres of influence or any other. Unfortunately, the last time the chamber was cleansed and prepared was some 15 years ago. Our curate tasked one of our own Scalebearers--" And he looks over towards Yonn, who sheepishly backs away. "-- was tasked with preparing it for your arrival, and the artifact's, and it was found that the lower chambers have been infested with some manner of foul subterranean spider creature."
Marisha: Oh, man.
Matt: "Our Scalebearer fled." At which point Yonn leaves the entire conversation and exits the room.
Ashley: (quietly) Excuse me.
Sam: Yonn.
Matt: You hear Kima kind of give a spit in his direction.
Matt: "But not before initiating the vault's defenses." (sighs) "So thus, I ask you to complete your journey into the Hall of the Exalt below, clear out these meager beasts, and guide your reliquary into the vault chamber to seal it for good."
Orion: Will we have to contend with the defense systems as well?
Matt: "Not all of them, but apparently in his haste to escape and defend himself, he set a few of them to aid his escape."
Laura: Great. (shouts) Good job, Yonn!
Marisha: Thanks, Yonn.
Matt: You hear no response other than the pitter-patter of steps.
Sam: Why does he still work here?
Travis: (laughs) Right?
Orion: (laughs) Very good question.
Taliesin: Would you like to speak to his manager?
Sam: Does he have tenure or something? Is it a union thing?
Matt: "He's been with us for many, many years, and he has great heart and devotion. Though addled may be his mind, he does bring much to the temple."
Marisha: He has seniority.
Sam: All right.
Marisha: So wait, you said you lost the Crystal of Exaltation during the War of--
Matt: "It was destroyed during a siege of the city."
Marisha: During the War of what? Beginnings?
Matt: "The War of the Beginnings."
Marisha: The War of the Beginnings.
Taliesin: That was close.
Marisha: And how long ago was this War of the Beginnings?
Matt: "Well that, oh, I'm sorry. It was created in the War of the Beginnings."
Marisha: It was created then?
Matt: "It was lost in a battle, a siege of the city of Vasselheim 300 years ago."
Laura: 300 years?
Marisha: Called what? During what war?
Taliesin: The Siege of the Metal Champions.
Matt: "That had no particular name."
Marisha: Oh.
Laura: Oh.
Marisha: Just a siege.
Laura: It was just a thing?
Matt: "It was one of the sieges and there was--"
Sam: The Battle Where the Thing Was Lost.
Matt: Yes. There it is.
Orion: Right. (laughter)
Liam: Vord. Hi. Question, please. We'll clear out your basement, that's not a problem. I'd like to understand how you plan to protect this horn, how you plan to keep it out of the hands of entities who would use it for ill--
Laura: That big scary creature living out in the woods. Sorry, brother.
Liam: Then how-- that's fine.
Matt: He glances towards you and says, "Oh, that is but one of many."
Laura: Huh.
Matt: "Let it be known that this temple is extremely well-guarded. It is continuously under the gaze of our patron deity and while some of the defenses have been put in place for your arrival, if the entirety of the vault is triggered, there is nothing that will make its way there unannounced."
Travis: Good sell.
Sam: Are we to carry the box down as we journey into the dungeons below, or are we to leave it here while we go clear out the basement?
Matt: "The Scalebearers will bring it with you."
Sam: Okay.
Matt: "Keep them safe."
Sam: Keep them safe? Oh. All right. We've got enough to worry about keeping ourselves safe.
Marisha: So just to get one thing clear, and I mean no (clears throat) disrespect, but how was the crystal lost 300 years ago, if it was in this chamber? So this chamber has been broken into before?
Matt: "We can enter the chamber under very specific circumstances. We, at the time, requested the use of the Star of Exaltation as a divine focus--"
Marisha: Oh.
Matt: "-- a ritual that required the intervention of Bahamut to keep the city safe."
Marisha: Oh, so someone brought it out and then was clumsy and lost it.
Laura: And then it was lost.
Sam: And you know what--
Matt: "It wasn't clumsy and lost. It was used as a focus in the ritual."
Marisha: Oh.
Matt: "It was by the will of Bahamut Himself that the Star no longer was required to exist on this plane."
Orion: She gets it. She gets it.
Matt: "It served its purpose."
Marisha: So it was destroyed.
Laura: Lost, as in--
Orion: Like not around.
Marisha: You should change your verbage here.
Taliesin: Charisma of ten, ladies and gentlemen. Charisma of ten.
Laura: While everybody's been talking, can I have used my Primeval Awareness to see within six miles if there's any dragons around us?
Sam: (sings) Primeval Awareness, yeah.
Matt: So you take a moment and kind of zone out for a second. You do not sense any dragons in the immediate vicinity of the six-mile radius of the city, no.
Laura: Oh, okay. All right. That's all I wanted to know.
Sam: (sings) Primeval Awareness, over.
Travis: Can we drop off this box, or what? I want to go see the fire dancers.
Sam: Yeah, let's go.
Laura: No, we need to go-- we also need to-- are we going to do that now?
Sam: Let's just go.
Laura: Go clear out the basement?
Sam: Yeah, it's the morning, still. Okay? Let's go.
Orion: Are we all potioned up, are we all--
Marisha: Yeah, we're good.
Ashley: We're all healed.
Orion: We're good?
Laura: Let's clear out the basement.
Travis: There's nothing down there, right?
Laura: Yeah? I mean, you want us to do it now, yeah?
Taliesin: I'm not-- I haven't been paying attention.
Matt: "Lest this artifact be left longer in the open, which I would not be comfortable with."
Laura: No, neither would I.
Matt: "I would prefer this be taken care of immediately."
Travis: Yeah, we'll do it now.
Sam: Let's go do it.
Taliesin: We've got a bear.
Laura: I mean, obviously we want the Horn taken care of, but--
Travis: Here we go.
Laura: -- you know, we're taking care of a problem for you, too.
Sam: Oh, here it goes.
Travis: Here it comes.
Sam: Here it goes.
Ashley: Get it, girl.
Travis: Son of a bitch.
Ashley: Get it, girl. Get it.
Liam: The holiest place on the map.
Ashley: Yeah. (laughs)
Laura: The holiest place?
Sam: Haggle with the pope.
Taliesin: Shaking down the pope.
Matt: "You want a monetary reward--"
Laura: I was just wondering.
Matt: "-- for your aid."
Laura: I'm not asking.
Matt: "The temple can provide a sum of three thousand gold pieces."
Laura: Per party member, yes?
Matt: "Entirely. Three thousand gold pieces for your trouble on this journey." At which Kima steps forward and says, "Highbearer, we do not need to take money from--"
Laura: We don't want money, of course not. I mean, I--
Sam: But think of the good we could do with that money, giving alms to the poor back home where we are.
Laura: Yes, spreading the word of Bahamut where we go.
Ashley: Are we going to return for it?
Sam: We do a lot of charity work and it would be well-received back home. (under his breath) In our Keep.
Matt: You make a persuasion roll. You make a deception roll.
Sam: Deception?
Laura: It's not a deception, we really will--
Travis: No, no. Only one of you.
Matt: (laughs) No, he won't.
Taliesin: The ladies of the evening really, really do need the money, apparently.
Marisha: (laughs) No, he won't.
Travis: What did you roll, Sam?
Sam: A 30.
Orion: (laughs)
Laura: Oh. That's really good because I rolled a 19. Wait!
Marisha: A 30?
Ashley: No, you didn't.
Laura: Yeah, I did.
Liam: Three-zero?
Sam: Three-zero! I have a +13 for deception. (laughs)
Travis: Really? (laughter)
Taliesin: That explains so much.
Travis: We've got to get you deceiving more.
Marisha: (laughs) We've got to get you deceiving more.
Travis: Oh my god.
Marisha: You should lie more. It's good.
Taliesin: Lie to me, Pinocchio. Lie to me.
Matt: "Three thousand gold, at your disposal, to bring about and to share in the prosperity of your people back home."
Sam: Amen. (laughter)
Matt: "Once the artifact is delivered and sealed."
Sam: From one holy man to another, I think we've struck a deal. Let's go.
Orion: Burt Reynolds, you've done it again.
Travis: Amen. (laughter)
Matt: As you all turn, Kima goes, "I'll show you to the vault room."
Laura: Are you going to come with us, Kima?
Matt: "Yes, I'm coming with you."
Laura: Oh, good.
Matt: She glances over at you. (sarcastically) "Shall we, holy man?" (laughter)
Sam: Why yes, my sister, lead the way.
Marisha: Sister. (laughter)
Matt: As you guys are walking out of the chamber, the doors close behind, she turns to you and says, "Is that why you were blessed with such a temporarily swollen appendage before?"
Sam: I don't know how the lord works, it's mysterious. (laughter)
Matt: "Let us be on our way." She kind of walks off, flustered and frustrated. You guys are led down two layers. This actual temple recedes further and further into the mountain, until you're led into what seems to almost be a storage basement. It's a very musty smell. It's old earth--
Orion: It's dank down here.
Matt: Yeah, it kind of has that moldy scent to it. There are five guards stationed in this storage vicinity, and as you approach, they all stand up. They're all still wearing ceremonial armor, two of which you can see are really well-armed, one with a greatsword and one with a longsword at the side. They look pretty prestigious to be assigned to a basement this terrible.
Laura: At ease, soldiers.
Matt: "Of course, of course."
Matt: And they step aside. Kima steps forward and takes her holy symbol and removes it from around her neck. She looks at the wall for a second, then places it into what you didn't see before was some sort of a slight recess in the wood. It flashes with divine energy, and suddenly the wood illusion is dispelled and what you see before you is a stone doorway that begins to slowly shift to the side and open up into a staircase.
Laura: Are we going to find any of these defenses right away, or what?
Matt: Kima kind of gives you a look, shrugs, and, "To be perfectly honest, I have not been within the vault."
Taliesin: Well.
Ashley: Okay.
Marisha: Huh. Is there a blueprint somewhere?
Travis: Liam, you're up. I mean, (clears throat) Vax.
Sam: I thought he was Vex.
Liam: Sorry, my communication earring was a little low there. What was said?
Laura: Check for some traps, brother.
Liam: You got it. You got it. I'm glad to get out of upstairs, I mutter to my sister, because the decor up there was shit.
Marisha: (laughs)
Liam: That is... high. That was a 26.
Matt: 26 for?
Laura: Traps in the stairway.
Liam: Just traps.
Matt: Perception for traps? All right. As you slowly begin to descend the stairway, you keep an eye out across the staircase itself and any of the surrounding walls. The stonework here is also extremely ancient, marking probably a similarity to the most ancient of buildings you've seen in this city. This subterranean structure is probably one of the older parts of this temple. You don't see anything trap-wise. The stairway eventually comes to an end into a chamber about 50 feet by 50 feet. It's very, very low light. There appear to be--
Orion: Oh! Light!
Matt: Okay. The brief moment of light, before your eyes can really focus in, there's a flash of light at the end of Tiberius's staff, and the room actually gets harder to see. You see there is a thick white mist that just kind of hangs in the air throughout the entirety of this room.
Orion: Oh! (fssh)
Marisha: It's like having your high-beams on when it's foggy.
Orion: I de-cast Light.
Matt: Okay. You dispel the Light.
Orion: What is all of this poppycock?
Matt: Your eyes adjust a little bit, and you can see what looks like-- this room, for the most part, doesn't have any sort of details. There are a couple of sconces with low, flickering light that are embedded in the side of the walls of this 50 foot by 50 foot room. It's about 20 feet high.
Marisha: I go ahead and I do a little Wind Gust and I go, (blows air).
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Down the hall, to clear out the fog.
Matt: Which spell is this?
Marisha: Gust of Wind.
Matt: Okay, so you cast Gust of Wind. The mist that was filling this room blows out the other side and you can see, the room is a little more visible now.
Orion: Oh, very good. Light!
Matt: There's still a light mist on the sides, but the center of the walkway is clear for a second. You see now in the center of the room what were initially just dark spots in the mist, there are two pillars that are attached from ceiling to floor, roughly about 20 feet apart from each other, kind of in the center of each side of the room. Each pillar is solid gray stone with what looks like intricately carved small dragons almost curling and wrapping around the statues. Each one of their heads kind of turned, mouth opened kind of angrily in different directions.
Laura: Can I check for traps or see if there's anything--
Travis: You should re-cast that.
Matt: You guys, both of you guys make perception checks.
Laura: Yeah.
Liam: That's a 19.
Laura: Oh, he already rolled. Look at him.
Liam: Yeah.
Laura: Perception?
Matt: Mm-hm.
Laura: 25.
Matt: So looking about, Liam-- Sorry, Vax. You notice the base of each one of these pillars is not flush with the floor. There is a slight gap, meaning there is some sort of a rotation or a pivot to these pillars.
Laura: Hm.
Matt: You notice that these mouths of the dragons seem to be what's creating this white mist, and as time progresses, the mist begins to refill up the room rather quickly.
Laura: All right. Do I notice any-- does it seem-- Well, without touching it. Any kind of poisonous in nature, anything like that?
Matt: Looks like mist.
Ashley: Should we run through?
Orion: While we're standing around, I'd like to reassign the earrings to Vax, Grog, and Scanlan.
Laura: I don't get one anymore? You're taking it off of me right now?
Travis: Yeah, he's giving it to me. (laughs)
Orion: Because we're always together, we're always kind of in the back together, and they're always kind of like up in the fray, so--
Travis: That's true, I do wander off easily.
Sam: Oh, is that you, Grog?
Travis: (laughs) Hi. I know.
Orion: She's always kind of like in the middle. She's the wild card. He's always in the back with us also because we're the ranged dudes.
Laura: All right.
Marisha: Wait, do I still have one?
Taliesin: I'm putting down my mask, just in case this is awful.
Matt: Okay. You guys are still at the stairway. The mist has now filled the room again in front of you.
Laura: Ugh. Should we try breathing it and see what happens?
Sam: Yeah, sure.
Marisha: My Gust of Wind--
Laura: I just reach my arm into the mist and just see--
Marisha: My Gust of Wind lasts up to one minute, by the way, so I can keep--
Laura: Oh, maybe we should just not touch the mist and go straight through the room.
Marisha: I'm just airbending.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: You've been wanting to say that.
Laura: So you can blow it and we just walk through?
Matt: As this conversation has continued-- let's say about 30 or 40 seconds has gone by in transferring the earrings and the discussion, so there's still a little bit of-- there is a clear pathway in the center there.
Marisha: Not much time.
Sam: Let's go.
Laura: Should we go?
Sam: Let's go through.
Laura: Let's go before it gets back.
Travis: Yeah.
Ashley: I start running.
Taliesin: Yes, go, run.
Liam: Hustle, hustle.
Laura: Go, go, go.
Matt: Okay. You all start running through. You're running through with them and keeping concentration on your spell.
Orion: Vax, check for traps!
Sam: Vorak, Desona, come!
Laura: I perception-checked the room. It didn't seem like there was anything.
Orion: Oh, are we good? Okay.
Liam: I'm running ten feet ahead of everybody. I rolled a big old one. (laughter)
Sam: He tripped.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Wow.
Matt: You continue forward, and as you're rushing through the group, not paying attention, you gently hit the edge of the mist barrier with your shoulder, as you're rushing to the side instinctually to stealth along the wall. As your shoulder breaks the mist--
Liam: Bring it.
Matt: All of the dragon mouths burst into bright fiery flame and begin spinning rapidly in the room. The people that are in the center running through right now, which include Keyleth, Scanlan, Tiberius, and Pike, all of you guys make dexterity saving throws.
Ashley: What?!
Sam: Whoa!
Marisha: Son of a bitch.
Laura: Vax!
Sam: Way to go, Vax.
Taliesin: Teacher, teacher, did I have time to finish my book?
Matt: You have.
Taliesin: Yes!
Ashley: Dexterity check?
Liam: You said dex save? Dex save?
Matt: Dex save, yes.
Orion: 18.
Marisha: It's all right.
Matt: 18?
Orion: Mm-hm.
Matt: All right. Hmm. Scanlan?
Sam: Oh! 13.
Matt: 13.
Ashley: Three.
Matt: All right.
Liam: 26.
Matt: All right.
Marisha: Also 13.
Ashley: But I'm short! I'm so short. They would--
Laura: Super duper short.
Travis: Just going to hit you in the face.
Ashley: They would just flow right over me.
Matt: Okay. As the flames just burst out throughout the room, tearing into the air with this reddish-white flame, both Vax and Tiberius manage to try and dodge out of the way as best they can, only receiving, each of them--
Laura: Well, all Vax has to do is roll, because he's already on the freaking ground.
Matt: 12 points of fire damage to each of you.
Marisha: To who?
Liam: Well, rogue with Uncanny Dodge, for a successful save gets zero damage.
Matt: You take none.
Orion: And I take half.
Matt: So you take zero damage, you take 12.
Orion: So I take half. Is it 24 total?
Matt: No, 24 total. You take half.
Orion: Oh.
Marisha: The rest of us?
Matt: Scanlan, Keyleth, and Pike all take 24 points of fire damage.
Sam: Ugh.
Ashley: I got 24 points.
Marisha: Ouch.
Orion: Oh! My robe.
Sam: Ow. Are we still moving?
Liam: Tuck and roll.
Orion: Are you getting used to your new foot, Vax?
Liam: I'm back!
Matt: You guys move through-- that's the four of you guys. Percy, Grog, and Vex and Trinket are all behind, as they watch the flames burst out and they all kind of stop their inertia, and now the mist slowly fills up the room.
Travis: Whoa.
Matt: About the time that your spell wears off for the first minute.
Marisha: Okay. (weak chuckle) Let's move?
Travis: It fills up the room?
Laura: We're still in the room.
Sam: The three of us, you're still back.
Matt: You guys are split right now, with the bearers, the Scalebearers.
Laura: Oh, they're coming with us, they're like coming with us through the whole thing?
Matt: They're with you, yeah.
Marisha: Wait, hang on.
Laura: Keyleth, blow the smoke again. Blow the mist away. If you can.
Marisha: Burning another spell slot. All right, here we go.
Matt: Oh, no.
Ashley: We run through it.
Laura: And now we run.
Marisha: Oh, no. He doesn't care.
Travis: He doesn't care.
Taliesin: No, we walk gently through.
Matt: Burning the second spell slot. (wind noise) The mist clears itself. Now that you're aware of what it does, you're very careful to direct it towards the center and leave an open path. The rest of you rush through, including the Scalebearers, in the minute you have. The wind is blowing in your face from Keyleth's position. It's kind of like stepping into the force of a hurricane. You have to put your hand in front of you to see--
Laura: (shouts) Your breath smells pretty good, though, Keyleth.
Marisha: Thanks, I tried to get a little of a sage thing.
Ashley: Sagey rosemary?
Travis: Very minty.
Marisha: A little orange blossom. It's nice.
Orion: I'm going to Prestidigitate a tiny air shield in front of me.
Liam: When I bite into a York Peppermint Patty--
Marisha: It's also pure oxygen, so we could get a little buzz.
Matt: It's a very, very tiny shield. It protects this much of your face.
Orion: That's what I'm doing.
Matt: Your eyes are fine. The rest of your robes are still (windblown cloth sounds).
Orion: Yeah.
Matt: You guys all make your way across the room. You then finish your spell and the mist immediately fills up and completely obfuscates that room behind you once more.
Sam: One down!
Marisha: We made it!
Sam: 20 rooms to go.
Matt: You're now in what is a ten-foot-wide chamber for an additional-- a tunnel or hallway-- for another 20 feet before it opens up into another room, but there is no light source in there whatsoever. You, with Light on your staff again, you kind of step ahead to--
Laura: Do you want to shoot an arrow in?
Orion: Oh, would you like to see?
Laura: Yeah, let's do it.
Orion: Yeah, very good. Light.
Matt: All right, so as Vex releases her arrow, light bursts forth from the wooden shaft as it arcs across the room. As it does, you can see the room. As compared to the previous one that was square in shape, this one is circular. It is almost a cylinder in its design. Go ahead and make a perception check.
Laura: 16.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: 29.
Laura: He's better.
Matt: Okay. You notice that across this floor of the circular room, there are these circles marked across the entirety of the surface here.
Laura: Great. Those are probably traps.
Travis: I bet those are fun.
Laura: Pressure plates, maybe?
Orion: Okay, or sigils or-- maybe we have to activate them or not activate them?
Travis: I have darkvision, now with a range of 60 feet.
Sam: Can we see to the other side of the room?
Matt: Hm?
Sam: Can we see all the way to the other side of the room?
Matt: Opposite side, there is actually a much larger opening and what looks to be another staircase that descends. This one is 20 feet wide. It's a very wide staircase from what you're used to seeing, especially in these structures.
Sam: And I'm hoping there's no door.
Matt: No doorway. It's open. It just descends down below. And the only way you can tell is that the arrow arcs across--
Liam: Everybody stand back. I'm going to click my Boots of Haste--
Laura: What? Shouldn't we throw something onto one of the pressure plates first and see what it does?
Liam: Yeah, me. I'm going to click my Boots of Haste, I'm going to run, I'm going to do a sort of a running roll, land on the closest circle and wait for half a tick and then roll off of it.
Laura: Are you kidding me?!
Orion: What are you doing?
Travis: No, no, let him do it! Let him do it.
Matt: So as you guys are about to go, "Wait!", Vax is already off. Clicks the boots. The arcane magic of the Boots of Haste kick into his body. He leaps forward. Make an acrobatics check.
Liam: Okay. 22.
Travis: I hope you get your eyebrows burned off.
Matt: All right. You leap forward. Your hand touches the first circle in the room. As it does, there's suddenly a large shift in the room. All of a sudden, the hand which you had purchase on slides out from underneath you. You catch yourself on your feet, but now suddenly there's a loud grinding sound and the entire room seems to be shifting, moving, spinning in its own right, and you instinctually feel something moving towards you very quickly. Make a dexterity saving throw, Liam.
Sam: Oh, boy.
Laura: Vax!
Orion: I click my earring. You're an idiot, Vax.
Liam: I'm going to use Luck because that blew. And that's a natural 20.
Sam: Oh!
Marisha: Oh!
Ashley: Oh snap.
Orion: Yeah, 20!
Ashley: Yeah, 20.
Marisha: Yeah!
Matt: So. You barely manage to move out of the way before that circular portion of the ground skyrockets up like a pillar-- one very similar to the one that you created for your spell-- slams into the ceiling with a heavy thud, retracts, and continues again. In fact, looking around you, all of them in the room are now, at different levels, pistoning into the ceiling. (repeated crashing rock noises) This entire room is slowly rotating and there's just a series of pillars mashing into the ceiling.
Marisha: Oh, it's like a mini-game.
Matt: You have to make an acrobatics check to try and get through this now because you have very little space to move.
Liam: Okay. (laughter)
Liam: I'm going to use Luck again.
Matt: (laughs)
Liam: That is 18.
Matt: 18. You manage to make your way halfway across the room, dodging out of the way as these pillars are slamming and retracting. Kind of use the pattern of when they're pulling down from the ceiling, but they're moving very fast. One of them manages to catch you underneath your ankle. Go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw again.
Liam: That is 15.
Matt: 15. All right.
Travis: Uh-oh.
Ashley: You're going to hurt your foot again, Vax.
Matt: It catches you, takes you off of your balance, and it rockets you towards the ceiling. You manage to pull most of your body out of the way in time, but it still catches the back of your shoulder blade. You take 40 points of crushing damage.
Travis: Yes! (cackles)
Sam: Ohhh!
Marisha: Holy shit.
Matt: As you are slammed into the ceiling. And as the pillar retracts, you roll off with a heavy wheeze of pain. (groan) Catching onto your feet again. Make one more acrobatics check.
Marisha: Oh my god. If you get crushed to death--
Travis: (laughs) On Skype.
Liam: That's a 23.
Matt: What was that?
Travis: 23.
Matt: 23.
Liam: I'm like an acrobatic cheetah. 23.
Matt: 23. You manage to-- in the severe pain you're feeling, you can tell there's probably some serious bruising in there and you probably broke a couple of ribs, but you manage to just barely dodge and leap out of the way, making your way across the room to where the staircase descends, out of the immediate danger.
Sam: Ah.
Laura: Jeez.
Matt: The rest of you now are standing on the opposite side of this room, which is currently a rotating grinding mill.
Travis: That was great.
Liam: I'd like to check if there's any kind of device or anything on this side--
Orion: Okay, hold on a second, Vax, just chill out for a minute. We all just took a little damage this last time.
Liam: I'm just trying a perception check.
Sam: He's checking. He's checking.
Matt: All right, make a perception check.
Marisha: For a lever or something.
Travis: For a switch.
Liam: 25.
Sam: 25.
Matt: 25. You can see, in the ceiling, in the very, very center of the room, precariously placed right where one of the pillars in the center slams into the ceiling, there appears to be a small quarter-sized hole, gold piece-sized hole in the ceiling.
Ashley: Yeah, come on, Vex.
Taliesin: Race you for it.
Matt: It's in the middle of the room. In the ceiling, where--
Liam: Is there a clear shot of it or is there (bang bang bang) going on?
Matt: Oh, no, it's still going. The pillars are still slamming into the roof. And that one hole you see is right where one of the pillars slams into the roof. You only see it intermittently when the pillar retracts.
Marisha: Go, sharpshooters, go.
Taliesin: You first, or me?
Laura: Well, let's try this first because you might just break it down completely.
Taliesin: Oh, very well.
Laura: You are much more powerful than I am, Percy.
Travis: Yeah, ladies first, perhaps.
Taliesin: Ladies first.
Laura: All right, can I try to shoot an arrow into the little hole?
Matt: You can. This is a hard shot because it's at an angle now. We're talking, this is Robin Hood-level split-the-arrow. Because you have to hit it and then ricochet upward to see if it'll have any effect.
Laura: Oh, jeez Louise.
Travis: Well, get up there.
Marisha: I place my hands on her shoulders--
Travis: Can you inspire?
Sam: I can inspire her.
Marisha: And I give her Enhance Ability.
Sam: Ooh, Enhance Ability.
Laura: Okay, what does that mean?
Marisha: You have advantage on-- oh, ability checks. It's just ability checks.
Matt: Ability checks. It's not going to help for an attack.
Laura: This is, what, an attack?
Marisha: Never mind.
Matt: This would be an attack.
Travis: I would like to offer my beard for a rub of good luck.
Laura: Thanks, Grog.
Matt: As you offer the beard, it tears off.
Travis: What?
Ashley: Oh, no!
Travis: What did you do?!
Laura: You know what, I'm going to tie this to the arrow. It's going to give it really good luck.
Sam: That seems like it's aerodynamically--
Laura: I'm not actually going to tie it to the arrow.
Taliesin: Okay!
Laura: I'm just going to tuck it--
Matt: Mark in your inventory, you now have Fake Grog Rope Beard.
Travis: Is that a -1 to my confidence now?
Matt: (laughs) It will come into play.
Travis: (cries)
Orion: So the goal is to shoot an arrow into this-- like the Death Star?
Matt: Essentially, yeah.
Laura: Yeah.
Orion: Okay, cool. As I see her ready, I'm going to hold up my hand with my ring and point it right at that hole.
Matt: To do--
Laura: So you can deflect it if I--
Orion: I got your back.
Laura: All right, thanks, Tiberius.
Orion: Get it, Vex.
Matt: All right, and you're going to--
Sam: I'm going to inspire her. With inspiration. I'll sing, (sings) Ooh ooh, shut up and shoot that hole! Your arrow is my destiny, yeah I said,
All: (sings) Ooh ooh, shut up and shoot that hole! (laughs)
Matt: And with that, you feel your focus, you wait, you breathe in, you breathe out, you breathe in, you breathe out in pattern with the slamming of the piston against the ceiling.
Laura: Oh, I'm so nervous.
Ashley: Get it, get it, get it, you're going to do it.
Matt: You let out all your breath and you hold, hold, hold, waiting between heartbeats, and then (twwt), release. Go ahead and make your attack roll.
Laura: I'm going to roll the fancy one we got last week.
Liam: Get it, girl. Get it.
Laura: All right. (laughs) Oh, no. Okay. I add my attack bonus?
Matt: Yes, you do.
Sam: Plus an inspiration.
Laura: Plus an inspiration dice?
Matt: Plus a d10.
Orion: Oh, shit.
Marisha: (whispering) It's so quiet.
Orion: I know.
Laura: Oh, that's awesome! Okay. 35. (yelling)
Travis: Good inspiration.
Matt: As you release the arrow, you see the pillars slamming. The pillar comes down just as the arrow crests over it, past another pillar that just barely manages to miss it by a segment.
Orion: I cast Telekinesis to swoop it up. (whoosh)
Sam: Oh, god.
Orion: Just to help and guide it.
Ashley: No, but it's already gone in.
Travis: We don't need it! We don't need it!
Laura: Oh, let me just see if I got it first!
Liam: She rolled a 35, we don't need shit.
Orion: It's going in there, anyway. I don't even have to roll.
Matt: So. As the pillar pulls down, the arrow goes cascading forward. Go ahead and make a d20 roll with the +5 modifier.
Orion: Sweet. That's 17.
Matt: 17? Okay. So as the arrow makes its way, it ricochets off the bottom edge of the actual hole and immediately bends itself upward, the shaft bending. As it begins to start heading up the hole, there's a sudden force of arcane energy that slams it even harder up into the top of this tiny little slit.
Travis: Yeah, good.
Matt: As it goes up there, you hear what sounds like a splintering of wood and metal. Then you hear metal grinding. You start seeing bits and chunks of grinding metal begin to pour out of the hole and the pillars begin to (scraping stone).
Laura: Hey.
Ashley: Yeah.
Travis: Nice shot!
Ashley: Yeah, Vex!
Matt: Eventually coming to a halt.
Marisha: A wrench in the machine.
Taliesin: I could have done it.
Laura: You totally could have done that.
Taliesin: I could have made that shot.
Sam: Next room's yours.
Taliesin: Yes, next room, next room's all mine.
Orion: That was one of those impossible things, right?
Matt: Pretty damn close to impossible.
Orion: I knew it.
Laura: Nice.
Marisha: (laughs) Pretty damn close to impossible.
Sam: All right, let's go across and heal our rogue.
Travis: Yeah, we walk across.
Laura: Yeah, all right.
Liam: As they come to the other side, I clutch my broken rib and injuredly hold a hand up and give a half-assed high-five to my sister. (grunts)
Laura: Good job getting slammed into the roof like that.
Liam: Yeah, you're welcome.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: All right.
Marisha: So can we take a short rest to heal up and then also a short rest to take a short rest in real life?
Matt: You can. We're going to go ahead and stop here. You're now taking a short rest.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: You guys take a moment. If you want to go ahead and heal up using any of your hit dice, you're able to, Vax.
Marisha: I'm going to do that.
Sam: Me, too.
Matt: And on that note, we're going to go ahead and take our five-minute break here, guys.
Travis: Cool.
Sam: Five.
Matt: While the party takes a short rest, we're taking a five-minute rest. We've got to be done by ten tonight with the stream, so.
Sam: Let's do it.
Laura: Woo.
Matt: So we're going to take a five-minute break.
Sam: True five. True five.
Matt: Orion, if you want to go ahead and come over, we're going to go ahead and give you guys-- yes, sir?
Zac: Bring them on up.
Matt: Okay, yeah, so we're going to go ahead and introduce our guests and give them an overview of the charity that we have currently on the stream tonight.
Travis: That was great work, though.
Laura: Yes.
Marisha: Oh my god, I rolled two eights in a row.
Taliesin: Nice!
Marisha: That's awesome.
Matt: I'm going to pass this over to Orion.
Orion: Okay.
Matt: Come on over. Gonna enjoy my chickens.
Sam: Don't forget to go to Teespring and buy our T-shirts.
Laura: Oh, let-- no! We haven't even talked about it at all!
Matt: Yes! By the way, our T-shirts are on Teespring. We'll have six more days.
Sam: Six more days.
Marisha: They also just went up on our website, on critrole.com. So you can go to our website and find the link.
Matt: All right, guys, we'll see you in a little bit. Meanwhile, take it away.
Sam: I'm going to tweet the Teespring link right now.
Zac: Lucas, go fullscreen.
Marisha: Sam is tweeting it.
Orion: Give me that chair.
Zac: Cool. Are you good, man?
Orion: Yeah.
Zac: Sweet.
Orion: We had points. We had points. Are we standing for this?
Taylor: Yeah.
Orion: Tell me that for the chat thing. Hi, everybody! Orion Acaba here and Taylor Carol. This is our special guest. And he's with GameChanger, and he has a couple of things to say for this particular awesome charity that we are working with today with SquareEnix and the Deus Ex anniversary.
Taylor: Yeah.
Marisha: Taylor!
Taylor: Well, first of all, on behalf of GameChanger, I just want to say what a blast it is to be with you guys. Personally, I've never watched D&D before. You guys have made me a huge fan.
Orion: Yes.
Taylor: And, yeah. So a little bit of backstory about GameChanger. About nine years ago, I was diagnosed terminal form of cancer. I was given about two weeks left to live, but thankfully it's been a long two weeks. I'm totally healthy now. (cheers)
Taylor: Thank you. But when I was sick, the most incredible thing that I saw was the impact that video games had on the people and on the children that were fighting cancer and other rare diseases. And witnessing the incredible good of the game community of video games. My dad and I resolved to make an organization that used and capitalized on that incredible good of the video games, of the gaming community, to help those suffering from rare diseases. And so one year later, GameChanger charity was born, and we started out just collecting games from the incredible gaming community, giving them back to kids suffering from rare diseases. And seven years later it evolved into what we have now. Now we're sponsored with some incredible gaming organizations like Square. A huge thanks to them for partnering with us for this awesome campaign. But yeah, today we go into hospitals and do things called GameChanger days where we go and we bring food for the staff, for the families, for the kids suffering from rare diseases. We bring them gaming packages so they can bond together. We provide college scholarships, and we really just try and provide hope and inspiration-- the same hope and inspiration that games really provided me when I was sick.
Orion: Yeah. That's awesome. And we here at--
Taylor: Oh, thank you. No, thank you guys.
Orion: And we here at Critical Role really love organizations like yours, which is why when we started talking, it was such a nice partnership for you to come on and tell us about this organization. Tell everybody where they can find to help, if they wanted to send to GameChanger.
Taylor: Yeah, GameChanger. Yeah.
Orion: Yeah, where would they go for that, to check it out?
Taylor: To support GameChanger, to learn more about what we do, you can visit www.gamechangercharity.org, and if you go to our website, you can see our campaign with Deus Ex. You can go online and if you donate anything more than a dollar, you get a free copy, a director's cut--
Orion: Oh! Well, awesome. That's cool. I'll probably do that too. It sounds like it's pretty sweet. And I want to thank you, the rest, with all of us. I'm doing this because I'm currently fighting cancer. I have-- I don't have that bad of a trek to go through, but it is very inconvenient and painful, but hearing stories like you. I mean, you're 20. He has a beautiful singing voice. He's a singer. And you're going to Harvard, is that what's going on?
Taylor: I am, yeah, I'm a rising junior.
Orion: Stupid doctors, they don't know shit. But people like you inspire me, because up until a few months ago, I didn't need any of that kind of inspiration. So it's great, and your organization's great, so we just wanted to thank you for coming on and speaking with everybody and letting everybody know, and we'll be working together in the future, too, and we'll be doing lots of fun stuff, so yeah. Check these guys out, please.
Laura: Donate, donate.
Ashley: What are you studying at Harvard?
Taylor: I am an English concentrator.
Orion: Whoa.
Marisha: Nice.
Taylor: Yeah, yeah.
Laura: I don't even know what that means.
Orion: Hold on a second. Do you mean like you concentrate on English?
Taylor: (English accent) English primarily.
Orion: Oh, very good. Okay, cool. That's like my second language.
Taylor: You guys have to teach me better accents. I love all of your accents.
Orion: (laughs) Any other questions for our guest, guys?
Zac: I'd like to let everybody know, the mods all have access to the GameChanger command in the chatroom, so if you guys are watching and are not in the chat, just join the chat really quick and you guys will be able to get that link for the donation link to get Deus Ex and anything over a dollar and you get a copy of the game. We're going to go ahead and let that run all the way throughout the rebroadcast and throughout the weekend, so mods, just keep spamming that throughout the chat.
Laura: So donations tonight are going to GameChanger, yeah?
Orion: Yeah.
Zac: It's up to you guys whether or not you want 826LA to go to GameChanger because the link right now just goes to Critical Role, so it's up to you guys for where it goes from there.
Orion: So we can do that.
Laura: Awesome. I think donations tonight will definitely go to GameChanger, yeah.
Orion: Yeah, so that's what we'll do. Awesome!
Taylor: Thank you all.
Orion: Right now. That's the decision.
Taylor: Go team.
Marisha: Tell them it's the last day.
Orion: And this is our last day. Is that right?
Taylor: Yes, so this is the last day to get your copy--
Orion: For the Deus Ex thing.
Zac: Okay, then I will not let it run over the weekend.
Orion: Yeah. But again, dude, thank you for coming on.
Taylor: Hey, thank you.
Orion: And we'll break because I have to pee really bad. But thank you so much.
Taylor: Thank you.
Zac: So guys, just to be clear, all of your donations tonight will go towards GameChanger, but if you want a copy of the game, just go and donate a dollar on the link that we have access to in the chatroom. And just so you guys know, there will not be time for them to read messages tonight after the show. Lucas and I both have to catch a flight, so sorry. We'll get to them next time.
Taylor: Anything more than a dollar.
Zac: Anything more than a dollar, to be clear. Anything more than a dollar.
Ashley: Go donate. Just do it!
Zac: Listen to Ashley. We're also really close to another giveaway, guys. If you guys subscribe, I think we're only like ten away from another giveaway, a large giveaway, which is a signed Player's Handbook and a signed photo of the cast. And every 50 we'll do a giveaway until the show's over tonight. We will not be going late, so just keep in mind, guys, don't send Geek & Sundry messages upset that your message wasn't read. We'll get to it next time. We appreciate you guys donating and Lucas, go ahead and go to drop cam. Yeah, go drop cam. [break]
Matt: Welcome back.
Zac: I had a really quick announcement before we get back into the game. The winner is Paula Konito, so congratulations--
Marisha: Paula Konito!
Matt: Paula Konito, congrats!
Marisha: Paula Konito!
Zac: -- and I understand that we crashed their website for donations--
Matt: (laughs)
Ashley: What?
Zac: So congratulations, guys, for crashing the website, but what is not crashed is our donation link, so if you scroll down and click on the 826LA link, all of the donations that are made tonight they've said will go to GameChanger
Laura: Yeah, the portion of the donations that would normally go to 826LA tonight are going to go to GameChanger.
Zac: So just scroll down on the channel page, click on 826LA or the donate link that's being spammed in the chat room, and all of those donations will go to GameChanger. And they let us know before they left, they just got 10,000 more Deus Ex keys, so we will let that run throughout the weekend.
Travis: That's amazing.
Laura: Oh, awesome.
Orion: Nice!
Zac: So the mods will keep spamming that throughout the weekend and you guys can donate throughout the rebroadcast and things like that for a one-dollar Deus Ex code.
Laura: Anything over a dollar.
Zac: Anything over a dollar, yeah.
Matt: That's so awesome.
Zac: One-oh-one! Enjoy Deus Ex.
Matt: Yeah! Thank you guys so much.
Laura: It would be good if you donated more than one dollar, if you want.
Taliesin: It's still needed.
Matt: The Critters are strong. The Critters are legion.
Travis: It is. They are.
Matt: It's amazing the things we can do.
Orion: It is on. YES.
Taliesin: There are Critters in the walls.
Marisha: They're in the god--
Marisha: -- damn walls!
Taliesin: -- damn walls!
Taliesin: Thank you for being there with me on that.
Matt: All righty, so! Back into the fray.
Laura: Oh, god, okay.
Matt: You guys, after finishing your short rest, healing up various wounds in that circumstance--
Sam: (plays note on flute) (laughter)
Matt: You make your way, playing a fancy little ditty on the flute. You make your way down this long, long staircase. You continue down for, I'd say, probably a good hundred feet or so before you start encountering, I'll say, a mild change in the scenery, at least. What was normally just a musty hallway is becoming thicker and thicker coated with large spiderwebs.
Laura: Ugh.
Travis: Awesome.
Orion: Everything's so sticky.
Ashley: Spiders!
Matt: You manage to push through and cut through, but it gets to the point where it's just so matted you guys are having to bushwhack your way through as if you had a machete.
Taliesin: I'm not taking off my mask.
Travis: Can I turn to one of those (clears throat) Scalebearers and ask if they've ever dealt with any umber-hulks in this region.
Matt: Scalebearer Vorak gives kind of a curious look to your question. Scalebearer Desona looks to you and says, "No, I don't believe they exist in this region. Nor this close to the surface, as far as I know."
Travis: Right. That's important, isn't it.
Orion: Are the spiderwebs-- are they becoming more as we traverse--
Matt: Yes, they're getting thicker and thicker.
Orion: Okay, so I'm going to make my way towards the front of the group because I'm noticing this and I'm going to do a Fire Breath, and I'm going to instantly cast Control Flame and catch as much as I can of it, and start spinning it, burning the webs as we go.
Matt: Okay. Very cool. So, Tiberius steps forward and breathes a heating breath of dragon fire out of his mouth. As it cascades forward, burning through the nearby webs, he casts a secondary spell and captures it and begins to shape it, almost like it's a fiery clay in the middle of the air. And he utilizes it in a very similar way to how he uses Telekinesis and begins to use that rolling fire to burn through the webbing as you guys continue down the stairway.
Laura: Nice.
Taliesin: That's convenient.
Marisha: At least it'll be disinfected.
Orion: Mm-hm-hm. Fire cleans all.
Matt: It also leaves a terrible stench. Burning web has this awful kind of--
Travis: Burnt hair?
Matt: It's similar. Burnt hair with burnt plastic, if you can think of it-- it's awful.
Laura: What's plastic?
Matt: This is more for your own player knowledge, sensory knowledge. (laughter)
Matt: The sound of crackling of the nearby webbing that's slowly retracting and burning and melting is immediately joined by the sound of a low clicking. (groaning)
Laura: I stealth immediately.
Marisha: Oh, that frickin' sound. Do we-- I can try to cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us, if we want to sneak through here.
Laura: Oh, yeah, that would be good!
Marisha: Do you want to try to sneak through?
Travis: Yeah, do it.
Marisha: I cast Pass Without a Trace.
Travis: Now let's vogue. This changes every time!
Orion: Sweet!
Matt: All right, so Pass Without a Trace is cast, while you two both make stealth rolls.
Laura: So, with the Pass Without a Trace?
Matt: With the Pass Without a Trace, yes.
Laura: 31.
Orion: (quietly, to Marisha) Is my magic on stealth, too?
Liam: 24.
Matt: With the plus ten?
Liam: Plus ten from what? Say again?
Laura: Pass Without a Trace.
Matt: Keyleth cast Pass Without a Trace.
Liam: Oh, 34.
Matt: All right. You guys dart off to the side, kind of using the remnants of the web to block your physical forms. The boiling fire that has been placed ahead of you is starting to reflect small little points of reflected light throughout the shadows in the distance that are moving towards you as you see giant hairy arachnid legs.
Orion: I back up! I have my cloak on. And I'm going to go ahead and cast Stoneskin. That's what I do right now.
Matt: You cast Stoneskin? I'm going to go ahead and ask--
Marisha: I'm also going to cast Stoneskin.
Laura: Can I cast, while they're coming-- where did I write it down?
Sam: I'm going to go invisible.
Laura: Never mind, I can't find my spell.
Sam: This is exciting, guys. There's a board of some sort.
Laura: I cast Entangle on the ground.
Matt: In front?
Laura: Yeah.
Sam: You have-- you can cast things?
Laura: (quickly) Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Orion: (quietly) Yeah, she's a ranger, she can cast stuff.
Travis: Apparently.
Taliesin: As long as it's at range.
Sam: Grog, you've got a beard spell.
Travis: I do.
Taliesin: That was my terrible joke and I wish I hadn't. Now I'm embarrassed.
Travis: I can also cast Flatulence.
Sam: And you have Frenzied Rage.
Matt: All right. You can now see skittering off to the side what appear to be a series of large arachnid-like creatures. As you cast Entanglement, you can--
Laura: I'm reading it now.
Matt: Go ahead and read the spell.
Orion: Did I manage to catch with the Control Flame my entire Fire Breath when I did that? And I'm controlling it still?
Matt: Currently you are.
Laura: Oh, that's not what it was. That's the wrong spell. Sorry, sorry, it's Spike Growth, is the spell.
Sam: Spikes growth?
Laura: I cast Spike Growth.
Matt: Spike Growth, okay, that is different.
Laura: Yes, which is-- the ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range twists and sprouts hard spikes and thorns. It's difficult terrain for the duration, but anybody that can see me casting it doesn't take damage to it, it's only the people that don't see me casting it.
Marisha: Dope.
Sam: Really?
Matt: All right.
Laura: Yeah. Any creature that can't see the area at the time the spell is cast must make a wisdom check.
Orion: Cool.
Sam: All right, but can they see the area?
Matt: They can see the area.
Laura: Oh. Well, that's not quite the same thing, then, what I saw. (yells) Forget it, my spell is stupid!
Sam: No, no!
Orion: It's fine, just not in a hallway with stairs.
Laura: I know!
Sam: It's fine, just stick to arrows, really.
Ashley: She can do so much more than just arrows!
Orion: As I see this, can I release my Control Flame and let the Fire Breath just happen, and not control it anymore?
Matt: Looking into your spell now. Oh, Control Flames is a cantrip. You are able to control just enough fire to burn away the things. It wouldn't actually do any damage if released. Control Fire kind of like captures an element of it.
Orion: Okay. So that's what I was using, the element of what I did.
Matt: Yeah.
Orion: So I used it so I could have the fire.
Matt: Exactly.
Orion: Got it.
Matt: You set it as a catalyst to it.
Laura: They can see the ground.
Matt: They can.
Laura: Then no, don't cast it.
Travis: Doesn't it mess up the ground if we try to walk through it?
Laura: Not you guys, but they--
Marisha: But they're spiders. They're probably not that wise.
Orion: Can I cast something else?
Matt: No. Right now everyone rolls initiative.
Orion: Damn it!
Ashley: Ugh.
Matt: There are only so many things you can do here, Tiberius.
Orion: I know, but I like doing lots of things.
Matt: I know you do.
Marisha: That's not bad! I'll take that.
Sam: I lost my dice.
Laura: That's my punishment.
Travis: Fuck, yeah.
Taliesin: I love my new stats.
Laura: I don't think that should count.
Taliesin: I rolled terribly this time but my stats are good.
Sam: Every time, every time.
Orion: What?
Sam: I've never rolled a double digit initiative roll, ever.
Matt: Oh, Scanlan, but you roll when it counts.
Travis: Just Wil Wheaton roll every time you do initiative.
Taliesin: Is that what we're calling it? Wheatoning?
Travis: Yeah, Wheatoning.
Laura: Wheatoning? Yeah.
Taliesin: All right.
Travis: Wheatoning.
Sam: (announcer voice) Wha-Wha-Wheaton.
Matt: All right, so. 25-20.
Ashley: Natural 20. (yelling)
Ashley: I don't think that ever happens when it's like damage or something.
Matt: That's okay.
Laura: 23.
Ashley: I'm gonna go with it.
Matt: Okay, so 23. Grog, what have you got?
Travis: 21.
Matt: Okay, so we've got Vex, Grog, and Pike, what's your dex? What's your initiative bonus?
Ashley: Nothing.
Matt: Nothing, so 20. All right. 20 to 15?
Marisha: 17.
Matt: 17, Keyleth.
Orion: 15.
Taliesin: 16.
Matt: All right, Percy. Tiberius. Vax?
Laura: He's gone.
Matt: Has left the screen.
Travis: Oh, really?
Sam: Great.
Ashley: Last.
Matt: I'm going to consider that a low initiative.
Marisha: Oh-ho-ho-ho.
Orion: He just went to go poop.
Sam: Seven!
Matt: Seven for Scanlan.
Orion: Or deal with--
Matt: All right, we'll get to his turn when we get to it.
Ashley: (yells) Vax!
Matt: It's okay. All right, Vex.
Marisha: Wait, there he is.
Sam: He's holding a cat.
Orion: He has a cat.
Sam: It's Trinket! It's Trinket!
Matt: What did you roll for initiative?
Liam: That is a 16.
Matt: 16?
Orion: Okay.
Travis: Get your head out of your ass.
Sam: He's Dr. Evil. (laughter)
Matt: All right, Vex.
Laura: Me?
Matt: Yes.
Laura: Oh! I'm going to cast Conjure Barrage at all of the spiders coming at us.
Matt: All righty.
Laura: I'm going to Hunter's Mark whatever one looks the biggest.
Matt: Okay, from this position you will also hit Tiberius to hit all the spiders.
Laura: Oh, where am I?
Matt: You're right here.
Laura: Oh.
Travis: You gotta do what you gotta do. (laughs) Sorry.
Matt: I mean, you could--
Laura: I'm going to move to where I'm in the middle of them. I'm still kind of stuck.
Matt: Right there?
Marisha: Get it!
Laura: Yeah, and then I'll Conjure Barrage from there.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: (quietly) Don't encourage it.
Laura: I cast Hunter's Mark on the biggest one I see.
Matt: Okay, this one here is one of the larger ones.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: So I'm going to go ahead and mark that one. So go ahead and-- Conjure Barrage does what damage?
Travis: (quietly) Hate it.
Laura: It does 3d8 on all creatures.
Matt: Do they get a saving throw?
Laura: They get-- yes, they do. They get half-damage if they save.
Matt: Mmkay. What's the DC on your spells?
Laura: (in a funny gruff voice) My DC is 14.
Orion: (laughs)
Matt: All righty.
Orion: (mimicking Laura's gruff voice) MemememememeME.
Marisha: What's your DC, girl?
Laura: Okay.
Marisha: What's yo digits? Gimme those stats.
Matt: Okay, all you need--
Laura: Do I need to roll for attack?
Matt: Only this one makes it.
Laura: Oh, sweet!
Matt: No, the barrage just happens. They're all caught in it.
Laura: Okay, cool.
Matt: So all of them take full damage, except for this one takes half damage, so go ahead and roll the damage on that.
Laura: Okay. 3d8. 15, and then 20 for the big one with the Hunter's Mark.
Matt: All righty. So. So you moved, did that. Do you want to move Trinket as well?
Laura: Can I have Trinket attack?
Matt: Trinket--
Laura: Oh, that's a lot of them.
Matt: Well, that, and the spell you cast was an action. Trinket can attack as part of your attack round.
Laura: Okay, so I get a second attack?
Matt: Well, no, your spell was an action. So that's your turn. You do Conjure Barrage instead of your attack.
Laura: Cool, I'm going to step back against the wall.
Matt: All right, so you step back there. Do you want to move Trinket anywhere in particular?
Laura: Nah, he can't really get anywhere, it's fine.
Matt: All right, Trinket is there and-- (bear noises)
Laura: It's good times, guys.
Matt: Angrily, a growl in the distance. Grog, you're up.
Travis: I'd like to hold my turn.
Sam: What?
Orion: Ooh, yeah!
Matt: All right, Grog holds initiative.
Orion: Strategy.
Marisha: Must be something good.
Matt: Pike, you're up.
Ashley: Okay, how far can I move up to use a Spiritual Weapon? I can't tell where I'm at. I'm sorry, I didn't wear my glasses.
Matt: I mean, you can move through your allies without an issue. You can shift through your own guys without a problem.
Ashley: Okay, so I would like to cast a golden spiderweb of thorns.
Sam: Ooh.
Laura: (gasps) What?
Marisha: Ooh.
Orion: (laughs) Nice!
Taliesin: Fancy.
Matt: All right. Okay.
Ashley: And encase the spiders.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: That's cool.
Matt: Okay. (laughter)
Ashley: Like a thorny net.
Matt: This would be considered a net, if we are considering a weapon that you are conjuring for this.
Ashley: I'm just making it look really pretty.
Matt: Right.
Ashley: Basically.
Travis: (quietly) It looks so pretty.
Matt: So the effect of this-- I'm letting you hit multiple guys with this. It would not do any damage.
Ashley: It wouldn't do any damage, it would just contain them?
Matt: It would possibly have an effect on their ability--
Ashley: Even if they're thorny? Even like holy thorns? Oh.
Matt: It would be very itchy for them.
Ashley: All right, you know what?
Orion: Oh. Well, I mean, that's not out of--
Laura: I think you should stick with it, it's awesome.
Sam: Yeah, man, commit.
Ashley: Okay. Contain them.
Orion: Yeah, it's thematic.
Ashley: Contain them and then somebody could just--
Laura: Fireball.
Ashley: Throw fire, a fireball at them.
Matt: All right, go ahead and roll a d20 and then add five to it.
Ashley: Okay. 12.
Matt: 12? Okay. These four in the immediate front, right there, as you bring back your mace in the air, you kind of hang onto the side with the leather strap around your wrist. You reach up and grab your holy symbol. As you release the holy symbol to hold your hand up, divine energy streaks out from your fingertips and forms into this kind of gold and silver net. As your arm is doing this kind of throwing animation in the air like that, the net shoots out from the front and spreads down onto the spiders and contracts around. You can see it catches them and they start scrambling inside. These front four are considered grappled. (cheering)
Ashley: All right, all right!
Matt: The one in the back managed to avoid it.
Orion: Cool.
Laura: Nice!
Marisha: Nice!
Matt: That's it? That brings it to Keyleth.
Marisha: Okay, with that new development--
Orion: Wait. Can you do lightning?
Marisha: I can. I'm going to do Poison Spray, though. Where am I right now?
Matt: You're right here. Behind Pike as she threw her giant golden net.
Marisha: I'm going to be like, 'scuse me, 'scuse me, Pike, 'scuse me. Sorry, sorry.
Ashley: Yes? Oh, go through, go through, go go go!
Marisha: Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Ashley: Tag you in! Tag you in!
Marisha: (whoosh) Poison Spray! It's a ten-foot cone.
Matt: Ten-foot cone. If you want to get right up in here you could get these three there.
Marisha: I'll do that.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: (whoosh) So, it's a constitution saving throw.
Matt: Okay. This one succeeds, this one fails, this one fails.
Sam: (singing along with the battle music) It's the music that means we're having a fight.
Matt: All right. So, this one succeeds, so no damage, but these two take damage. Go ahead and roll it.
Marisha: Okay, so they take 2d12. Six. Ugh. Seven damage.
Matt: Seven damage to each.
Marisha: It's not great. I think he takes half damage, though, even though he fails.
Matt: Does he? I think Poison Mist--
Marisha: Poison Spray.
Matt: Oh, Poison Spray. It's a cantrip. I think it's damage or nothing.
Marisha: Oh, yeah, I guess so.
Matt: All right. It's your move, do you want to keep moving or do you want to stay where you are?
Marisha: Can I get out of everyone's way?
Matt: You're currently-- actually, down from where you cast it, you would be able to move out, yeah.
Marisha: Can I back up a little bit? Yeah.
Matt: You can, they're still grappled.
Marisha: I just kind of want to-- yeah.
Matt: To there. All right.
Marisha: Your turn!
Matt: That ends your turn. Vax, Percy.
Taliesin: Please, be my guest.
Liam: Did you say Vax, Percy?
Matt: Yes.
Travis: Yep.
Liam: I'm doing my best seeing from where I can see here. Keyleth is right in front of me?
Matt: She was. She just pulled behind you.
Marisha: I moved behind.
Laura: Now you're in front of the spiders.
Marisha: You're good, you're in front.
Liam: Okay, there's a little bit of distance, so I'm just going to start hucking daggers at them. I'm going to start with dagger of life stealing.
Marisha: You're only two squares away.
Liam: That is a 16 to hit.
Matt: 16 to hit? Hits.
Liam: Okay, so that is four, six, is ten of damage.
Matt: All right.
Liam: Then the keen dagger follows. That is a 27.
Matt: That hits.
Liam: That hits for ten damage, and then--
Laura: You're killing them!
Liam: And then the flametongue dagger.
Matt: You're not Hasted anymore, by the way.
Liam: You're right, forget it, yeah, forget that last. That's right, two.
Matt: So as you're off to the side hiding among the slowly burning webbing, you move around, huck both daggers. One strikes a spider right in the center of where its eyes are and it screeches for a second before it curls up, its legs kind of pulling into its torso. The other one begins to pull out of the net that Pike set, and as it does you throw the secondary dagger. It strikes it in its abdomen, and the blade retracts and returns to your belt, and as it does, it leaves this streak of greenish liquid. And you have a better view of these spiders now. Go ahead and make a nature check, both Keyleth and Vex.
Marisha: Dope.
Orion: By the way, I'm here, but I'm also there.
Marisha: Natural 20. (yelling)
Matt: You're also there?
Orion: Cloak of Displacement.
Laura: Good, because I rolled an eight.
Matt: Oh.
Orion: There's like two of me.
Matt: All right. So, Keyleth
Sam: (whistles with the battle music)
Matt: You notice as most spider-like creatures go, you're used to like the darker, furry, wolf-spider types. These have a different color. Their physical bodies are more white and blue. Their coloration is mostly white but with a kind of bluish hue to it and their eyes are almost pink-white in color.
Laura: Ugh.
Ashley: Because they live underground. There's no sunlight.
Matt: They're a very strange, different kind of spider.
Liam: I don't like this.
Marisha: Is that all I know, with my natural 20?
Matt: You haven't encountered too many types of arachnids, but there's something about them that seems loosely themed in the ethereal.
Laura: Oh.
Marisha: Hm.
Matt: You in your experience, you've heard of certain spiders that can travel through the planes rapidly.
Orion: Now damn plane spiders?
Travis: Maybe we don't have to kill it, maybe they just (pfft).
Marisha: Gotcha. Hey, guys, I think these are like magical bamf-ing spiders.
Orion: Oh.
Taliesin: Okay.
Sam: Cool, bro, let's kill them.
Marisha: Yeah, let's kill them.
Taliesin: There's one spider that's not caught?
Laura: There's what, there's three spiders left?
Matt: Yes, one back here.
Taliesin: All right, I'm going to take a couple of shots at it with my Sharpshooter, so let's start with 24 to hit?
Matt: What was it?
Taliesin: 24 to hit?
Matt: That hits.
Taliesin: And let's do this. My first shot--
Sam: Ka-pew!
Taliesin: That's depressing. Well, I get the bonus, so that's 18 points of damage.
Matt: 18 points of damage? All righty.
Marisha: That's not too depressing.
Ashley: That's not depressing at all.
Travis: That's not depressing.
Taliesin: That's not too depressing. It's because I'm taking a negative five to hit.
Laura: Oh.
Taliesin: And that's-- oh, that's not bad. I have new numbers. 16 to hit.
Matt: 16 does also hit, yeah.
Taliesin: Aha!
Matt: Same target?
Taliesin: Same target, with an added fire bonus. Three fire damage and 17 as well.
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: 17 plus three fire damage.
Ashley: That bonus is awesome.
Laura: He is so dead.
Matt: (gunshot noise) That spider gets splattered. You see there's a burst of flame and a (explosion noise) as its body is knocked in the air, torn asunder, and then consumed by the flame burst at the same time. You see what looks like a scattering of ash across the ground and the steps beneath it.
Marisha: It looks like flash paper?
Matt: Essentially, yeah.
Taliesin: And I duck back behind Grog. (laughter)
Travis: Where are you going?
Matt: All right. These two spiders that are currently caught in the net both (whoosh) vanish and the net falls flat.
Laura: Oh, bamf-ing spiders.
Matt: (teleportation noise)
Taliesin: Oh, shit.
Matt: One is striking at you.
Laura: Me?
Matt: That is a 21 to hit.
Laura: It hits me.
Matt: And against Percy, that is a 25.
Taliesin: Oh my god, that hits.
Matt: All right. You both take 13 points of piercing damage
Taliesin: Ow!
Matt: And I need you both to make a constitution saving throw. (groaning)
Taliesin: Oh, bugger.
Marisha: That can't be good.
Taliesin: 13 points of piercing damage?
Matt: Mm-hm.
Marisha: They poofed. Poofers.
Laura: 17? Oh, wait. 19.
Matt: 19 constitution saving throw.
Taliesin: Constitution saving throw. (blows raspberry)
Marisha: Oh, no, Percy!
Taliesin: Rolled a one.
Matt: So as all of a sudden, the strange (teleportation noise) sound streaks behind you, you turn over your shoulder just in time to see the spiders pop out of seemingly nowhere and strike into you. The fangs sink into your side and you knock them off with your elbow.
Laura: (grunts in pain)
Matt: You feel the venom extract itself from the fangs, but just as you pull it out of the side, so it actually does not envenom your body. Percy, you're not so lucky. The venom pulses into the side of your shoulder.
Taliesin: (groans in pain)
Matt: And you feel this burning sensation ripple through your entire upper right torso. You take 21 points of poison damage.
Marisha: Oh, shit!
Liam: What was that number, again?
All: 21.
Sam: He's fine, he's fine.
Marisha: Is that all it does, just poison him?
Matt: Yep.
Taliesin: I am poisoned, though.
Matt: You are not considered poisoned. It's the damage that's poison.
Laura: Oh, it's straight-up damage.
Marisha: Okay, that's not too bad.
Taliesin: It could be worse.
Matt: That ends their turn. Tiberius? You're still holding your turn, Grog?
Travis: Mm-hm.
Marisha: I did take Protection From Poison.
Laura: I should cast that on us.
Marisha: If that's necessary.
Matt: All right, Tiberius?
Orion: So we're in a hallway, a stairwell?
Matt: Yes, it's a stairway heading down, essentially, right here, and then it evens out at the bottom point there.
Marisha: Fighting on the stairs.
Orion: Is it like a big--
Matt: It's about 15 feet up to the ceiling. Ten, 15.
Orion: Oh. Very well. How many are left, two?
Matt: Two.
Laura: Yeah.
Orion: Obelisk of Stone.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Squishy spiders.
Orion: Yeah, these squishy spiders.
Matt: So as both the spiders are knocked off both Percy and Vex, you guys kind of rear back, ready to defend yourselves. Suddenly the stairwell shakes for a second and pillars of stone go (stone crushing noises) from underneath. Similar to the trap room you encountered earlier.
Orion: That's it. 21.
Matt: 21? And what's the DC on your spell?
Orion: 17.
Matt: 17? Both spiders get mashed pretty horribly into the ceiling. You see where the pillars are slammed into the ceiling permanently. You can see the legs kind of dangling out for a second and then slowly curl in towards where the edge of the stone pillars are at the ceiling.
Laura: Eat it.
Marisha: Are there any corpses that are more accessible than the one that got torched and the ones that are squished?
Travis: Yeah, are there any spider fangs we can put in the bag?
Marisha: Yeah, because I have that book that helps me do that now.
Taliesin: There's the one I shot.
Matt: You can, actually, there are-- there's one that you shot. No, actually, the one that you killed is the one that burst into flame.
Taliesin: Yes, the one that burst into flame.
Matt: That one's not going to be salvageable. There's a few that you and Vex killed. Vex and Vax both just kind of wiped out a few of the spiders. Go ahead and make an herbalism roll.
Laura: Ooh, I bet we can get some of that poison. Dip the arrows in it.
Marisha: What did the book do again, gave me a plus or an advantage? Did it give me an advantage on rolls or like a plus something?
Matt: I asked you to write that down. I will say advantage.
Marisha: Oh, wait, you did ask me to write it down and I think I did.
Matt: Advantage or a bonus, which of the two is it?
Marisha: Oh, no, I didn't write it down, I just wrote that I have the books.
Matt: Ah. I don't remember what I did for that. I will say advantage. That's the easiest to remember.
Marisha: That's better. 24.
Matt: 24. You managed to extract two poison glands from one of the spiders. The other ones were too damaged beyond repair.
Laura: Ooh.
Orion: Sweet.
Marisha: Two poison glands.
Matt: Two small venom glands.
Orion: Nice.
Marisha: I give them to the twins.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Oh, we can just use them?
Matt: You don't know.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: She hands you two nasty-looking glands that are still wet with spider ichor.
Marisha: I got this for you guys.
Laura: Oh, thank you, Keyleth.
Travis: Do you want me to hold onto them?
Liam: That's very... that's sweet. I love it.
Laura: Tiberius, would you happen to have a little glass vial or something I could put this in?
Orion: I think I have two left.
Laura: Oh!
Orion: I need to get more.
Travis: I have them.
Orion: Oh, here we go. (pop)
Laura: Thank you.
Taliesin: (laughs) Well.
Travis: I'm like a Wal-Mart over here. You could have asked me, but that's cool.
Marisha: Your book helps.
Sam: I'm ready to make my attack turn.
Matt: All right. There is nothing there. (laughter)
Sam: I sheath my sword.
Matt: There you go. (laughter)
Taliesin: A little help here, please? Would be nice.
Ashley: Yes.
Laura: Oh. Oh, wait, I thought you weren't poisoned-- oh, you need healing because you are--
Ashley: What are you at?
Taliesin: I'm at 47.
Laura: Okay.
Ashley: Okay.
Sam: Eh, you're fine. Suck it up.
Ashley: I guess we all need some-- what's everybody else at?
Liam: Ah, that's what I was at after I healed myself with a handful of hit dice after getting crushed into the ceiling.
Laura: Yeah, but we took a short break and we're not doing that now.
Sam: Use your hit dice, you'll be fine.
Taliesin: I could just use my-- oh.
Ashley: Um, hold on.
Matt: Are you guys taking a short rest, is that what you're doing?
Laura: No.
Travis: No, no.
Marisha: No, we're good.
Ashley: Let me heal you up, Percy, hold on.
Laura: Can I ask a question while she's healing Percy?
Orion: We've taken a short rest already, right?
Marisha: Yeah.
Laura: The grappling arrow I used on the little halfling, I can get that back, right?
Matt: Yeah, you retrieved it.
Laura: Just making sure.
Sam: I'll continue on down the hallway.
Travis: I join him.
Matt: Keyleth, are you still using Pass Without a Trace?
Marisha: No.
Laura: No?
Sam: She had to break it to use Stoneskin.
Matt: It's a concentration spell, isn't it?
Marisha: Yeah, but I cast Stoneskin on myself.
Matt: You did. All right. So go ahead and make a stealth roll.
Marisha: Sorry.
Sam: Not good. Nine.
Travis: I'm with you.
Matt: Nine. All right.
Sam: (nasal voice) Nine.
Ashley: Nine, Percy.
Liam: I would like to continue to stealth ahead of the group and also continue checking for traps.
Sam: We already went.
Travis: Scanlan's already ahead of you.
Laura: Sam already said it.
Liam: Oh, he is?
Matt: As you stealthily move along the side of the wall, Scanlan comes pattering down the stonework.
Sam: Skipping.
Ashley: Percy, 18.
Taliesin: 18? Thank you.
Laura: Scanlan, no. (groans)
Matt: Into what is a large central chamber. You can see webbing scattered throughout the entirety of the stone room. It's about 60 feet up. There is very low light from the flickering sconces that are on the walls of this towards the base of the actual room. The building in the center, it looks almost like an ancient mausoleum structure, how it's placed in the center of the room. Closed stone doors. But what catches your eye is that the entirety of the structure seems to be crafted of the same platinum-like material as the container that you guys are carrying the horn in.
Laura: Oh, wow.
Sam: Oh, we made it.
Laura: Are there sapphires all over the walls in here, then?
Matt: Not the walls of the actual chamber itself, just this central building right there.
Orion: We're not stealing from this place.
Matt: Go ahead and make a perception check, anyone who wishes to look for traps.
Sam: While we're out there, I'm going to check--
Laura: (gasps) Oh no, that was my big fancy one.
Orion: Nice. I'm going to check for any arcane stuff and I got--
Liam: 14.
Matt: 14 perception.
Liam: Yeah, 14.
Orion: I'm going to check for 25.
Taliesin: 21.
Matt: Perception?
Taliesin: Perception, 21.
Matt: Okay. 25 for arcane?
Orion: Yeah.
Matt: Best you can gather, as far as the presence of any arcane in this room, the scrolling on the structure in front of you, there are elements of the scrolling that you can see are based in the arcane runes that are used for ritual inscribing, but there's nothing of any magic that you've ever been familiar with that is utilized in this structure. What did you roll?
Laura: Really, really high. Eight.
Matt: All right. So, who is moving in? Who wants to--
Sam: I moved in with Grog.
Travis: I move in as well.
Liam: I'm moving in.
Laura: Can I try to stealth and move alongside just kind of keep to the edge?
Ashley: Going in.
Travis: We're all going in.
Liam: Ditto, kiddo.
Matt: All right, you move off to the side, kind of pushing through some of the webs and there's still webs on the side of the room.
Orion: I'll keep close to the guards and the box.
Ashley: Yeah, I'll go in.
Laura: Okay, I rolled 18 on the stealth.
Matt: All righty.
Ashley: I'll go in close to Grog.
Matt: All righty.
Travis: Yeah.
Liam: I'm going to tail my sister, actually.
Matt: All right. (whoosh) You move around over here with your sister.
Laura: And Trinket's going to stay next to Keyleth.
Matt: All righty.
Marisha: Come here, Trinket.
Matt: So they'll go back to this point.
Sam: I'm going to go invisible.
Taliesin: Wait. I'm furry, but I'm not Trinket. Jesus Christ.
Marisha: (laughs)
Matt: All right, you are currently marked as invisible, Scanlan.
Laura: Can we see a spider in here, like a big spider?
Matt: You don't.
Marisha: There's always a big mama spider.
Laura: Okay, can I-- it's dark?
Matt: It's very low light.
Sam: No one's cast Light yet.
Orion: I know.
Laura: I'm going to use my Primeval Awareness and see if I can sense any spiders in the area.
Matt: Okay. You take a moment to concentrate and you sense-- while not in visible range, on the opposite side of this room, a whole bunch of tiny little life sources and one rather large one.
Laura: Good to know.
Travis: Shit.
Ashley: Ugh.
Laura: (whispers) Lots of spiders. Lots. I'm going to cast Protection From Poison on myself.
Matt: All right.
Travis: I cast Terminix.
Taliesin: (laughs)
Liam: I'm drinking a healing potion right now.
Matt: All righty.
Ashley: I'm going to do the same thing.
Marisha: Also, I'll go ahead and-- nah, nah, it's fine.
Taliesin: What does a level two healing potion do, again?
Marisha: I'm going to keep my Stoneskin up.
Ashley: Yeah, what's the level two?
Matt: Level two healing potion does 4d4 + 4.
Orion: I'm going to go use Greater Invisibility, as well.
Matt: Okay. All right. You are also considered invisible.
Sam: Why greater?
Orion: Because I can cast and still stay invisible.
Matt: All right, Kima pushes ahead through the group while you guys are doing this, walks up to the front of the chamber, and you see she takes the holy symbol around from her neck, the symbol of Bahamut, and much like she did to the doorway at the bottom of the temple earlier to find this initial passageway, she feels around in the scrolling and eventually finds a section of it and rotates what looks like a circular part of it that shifts and then pulls out. When she pulls it out, you can see there is a kind of engraving, there is a recessed engraving of the same shape as her holy symbol.
Laura: Before she touches anything, can I let her know that there's a whole lot of spiders on the other side of the room.
Matt: You may do that.
Sam: Wait, what? You didn't tell any of us that.
Travis: Can I shift to her right flank, just at the corner of the mausoleum structure? Right there.
Laura: Just so everybody's aware, those things we just fought? There's a ton more of them on the other side of this little chamber.
Sam: Oh, thanks for telling us.
Laura: No problem.
Matt: Grog, make a stealth check.
Marisha: (whispers) Be very quiet.
Travis: Oh, shit. Natural 20. (cheering)
Taliesin: Spiderman.
Laura: Good thing you took that beard off because it had bells and shit in it.
Travis: Oh, the beard is still there.
Sam: No, no, it fell off.
Travis: Its most majestic part fell off.
Sam: Oh.
Matt: Yeah. There's still some goliath peach fuzz there.
Travis: Substantial Viking-ness happening.
Matt: Grog, for a moment there, you recess into your old hunter training when you were traveling with your barbarian tribe and you take in the darkness around you and walk, fleet of foot, to the edge of it, not making a single sound. You're damn proud of yourself.
Travis: I am.
Taliesin: (whispers) Quietly.
Matt: So as you tell this to Kima, she goes, (whispers) "What? Spiders?"
Laura: (whispers) Lots and lots of spiders. Is that going to make noise?
Matt: (whispers) "I don't know. I haven't been in this chamber before."
Laura: Perhaps we should deal with the spiders before we make noise, or maybe just be prepared. In fact, you know what? I'm going to cast Spike Growth on the ground in between where they're going to have to walk through.
Marisha: Ooh, good. Smarty-pants.
Laura: Because they can't freaking see it right now, can they?
Matt: Which way?
Laura: Yeah, there, yeah.
Ashley: Both sides?
Matt: You said Spike Growth. How much does it affect?
Laura: It affects-- damn it-- I didn't put it in my thingy because I'm dumb. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Matt: That's okay.
Orion: You're not dumb. You're a strong, smart person.
Ashley: While she's looking, could I--
Laura: Spike Growth!
Ashley: You found it.
Taliesin: Way more than arrows.
Laura: It is a 20-foot radius. That's not that much.
Matt: Okay, cool. So you can do this whole area right here is all spiky growth.
Laura: And it's hard spikes. Hard spikes and thorns.
Matt: Good to know.
Taliesin: Briar.
Sam: All right, well, I'm going to follow suit and go to the other side and cast Stinking Cloud. No, over--
Matt: Over here?
Sam: Over there, yeah.
Travis: Our side's the best! (laughter)
Matt: Go ahead and make another stealth check.
Sam: Okay. 15. 17!
Matt: 17.
Sam: That's the best stealth I've ever done.
Ashley: Well done.
Travis: Yeah, buddy.
Matt: You quietly come by and mutter under your breath your arcane ritual and all of a sudden (quiet whoosh). And what was the size of the cloud on that one?
Sam: 30 feet, I think? I think it's 30 feet. Hold on, hold on, hold on. 90 feet! Oh, that's the range.
Matt: What's the radius?
Sam: It's a 20-foot radius.
Orion: Oh, your cards are cool!
Matt: 20-foot radius, which would be-- Actually, a 20-foot radius for this would be...
Orion: Nice, they have little bard thingies.
Marisha: Oh, they're purple. Mine has like a--
Orion: Nice color diversity!
Matt: This whole area here--
Laura: Oh, nice!
Orion: (laughs) Oh, I did see this.
Matt: This whole area here is done.
Marisha: I've got like a scythe.
Taliesin: A sickle.
Matt: And you also now make a very nasty cloud in this vicinity as well. This whole area is completely marked off on both sides now.
Orion: I'd like to walk up as I see this going on. I'm going to take out my deck of illusions. I'm going to toss two cards both ways, two cards on each side. So I'm going to do this, real quick.
Laura: Question. That chamber in the center of the room, does it go all the way to the ceiling, or is it--
Matt: No, there is a gap.
Orion: Deck of illusions, everyone.
Laura: So there's a huge-- so technically, the spiders could crawl up the ceiling and drop down on us?
Travis: Yes.
Matt: In theory?
Taliesin: Why would you give him ideas like that? Just feed him irony!
Travis: Let's go.
Orion: Ten of Hearts, Yes! Joker, Queen of Hearts, and another Joker! What?!
Sam: What does that mean?
Matt: Wait, you threw--
Orion: I put two on each side.
Matt: Oh, two on each side.
Orion: Yeah. So, like, two over in the spot before all that mess over there and two are in the other mess.
Ashley: Do you want to go one up top, just in case?
Laura: Yeah.
Travis: Yeah.
Orion: So the Jokers--
Matt: Are you.
Orion: And a female version of me.
Laura: Ooh, that's awesome.
Matt: All right, so a secondary Tiberius appears right there.
Orion: (falsetto) Hello, everyone.
Marisha: You know, you make a good woman.
Orion: (falsetto) Tiberiosa.
Matt: Female Tiberius appears over on that side.
Marisha: Tiberiosa.
Orion: And then whichever side you decide, a Queen of Hearts and Ten of Hearts.
Matt: Queen of Hearts-- oh, interesting.
Travis: (falsetto) Levi-O-sa, not levio-SA.
Matt: A succubus appears over here. Winged.
Marisha: Well, that's fun.
Matt: Sorry, what was the other one that you said?
Orion: Queen of Hearts and a Ten of Hearts.
Matt: Ten of Hearts. A cloud giant on this side of the room.
Laura: What?
Orion: (explosion noise)
Ashley: Rad.
Matt: We'll use that mini for now, it's fine. All of a sudden appear, kind of translucent, their image flickering. It's not a great illusion, but it's enough where it catches some attention.
Orion: And they're positioned right before the messes of each side.
Matt: Like right there.
Orion: Yeah.
Matt: All righty. Kima's now sitting there like, (whispers) "Put the key in now?"
Sam: No, no, do it.
Taliesin: Yes, yes, go.
Marisha: Okay, you're good. Go for it, yeah.
Matt: She puts her symbol into the recess. As it does, the stone doors shift and there's a dull kind of creaking of the stone as it slides not open, but into the walls, revealing an interior that is, as the light filters in, the entirety of the wall, floor, and ceiling of this room is of the same scrolling, the same platinum/sapphire material as the outside of the building and the box that's there, except for the design seems to all filter in towards the center, like the center of a spiderweb. All the design coalesces to the center point.
Laura: Had to be a spiderweb.
Matt: It's not an actual spiderweb. There's a raised dais up in the center there, about four feet wide, about a half-foot thick. Kima kind of takes her symbol and puts it back around her neck and kind of motions like this. The two Scalebearers begin to move down, carrying the case, looking about the rest of you like--
Orion: I invisibly follow right behind the box, still keeping my illusions in check.
Matt: All right.
Ashley: Same, same, same.
Matt: Everyone holds in place?
Marisha: Yeah, I'm not going to move far away.
Ashley: Following.
Travis: As you will.
Marisha: No, no, no, no.
Matt: You're staying right there?
Marisha: Yeah, yeah, if I held-- let me shift one over, just so I'm not in Trinket's way. The other way. Yeah.
Matt: There you go. All right, so. As they enter the chamber, Kima enters as well, you guys filing in behind them, I need you all to make stealth checks.
Travis: Everybody?
Laura: Everybody?
Matt: No, Tiberius, with advantage, because you're invisible.
Liam: What kind of check?
Sam: Stealth!
Travis: Not you.
Matt: Not you, don't worry about it.
Ashley: I don't?
Matt: You do.
Orion: 17.
Ashley: Three. (laughter)
Sam: Clang, clang, clang.
Matt: So you step into the chamber, losing your footing for a moment on the smooth, kind of platinum-like ridges across the ground, and you kind of catch yourself, your plate hitting the ground with a loud (ting) sound, at which point the two Scalebearers kind of look at you--
Ashley: (whispers) Sorry! Sorry!
Matt: With a heavy sigh, and Kima goes, "Go, go, go!" They both step forward and take and place the box into the center of the room on top of the dais. As they both release the chains, the box seems to levitate on its own to the center of the room, much like how the Horn itself ascended and was kept aloft in the center of the box. The box lifts up and slowly begins to rotate on its own. As it does, you can see the sapphire bits that are ingrained on this box flash with a bright blue light and all of a sudden the blue energy spreads into the ceiling and the floor of this room and all of the blue and silver veins that are carved into this begin to glow with a similar blue light.
Sam: Cool.
Marisha: Cool.
Orion: I love light.
Matt: At which point, the doors begin to--
Sam: Which doors?
Matt: The doors you guys entered this room through begin to close.
Sam: Ah, we should leave.
Orion: I'm going to scootch.
Matt: Yeah, you guys immediately scootch out of the way. Kima darts off. Both of them turn around and start running back.
Sam: (whispers) They're going to die.
Matt: They both make it out.
Ashley: Oh! That's good.
Matt: They both manage to just squeeze through real fast as the doors slam behind.
Marisha: That would be terrifying.
Matt: At which point, you see a series of spiders beginning to try to cut around-- these here, what's the DC on your--
Sam: My spell?
Matt: Your spell, yeah.
Sam: 17, because I didn't do it through the hand cone.
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: (whispers) Why?
Marisha: Should we run?
Matt: Both of these spiders get disoriented and try to find their way through the Stinking Cloud, kind of like (choking, clicking noises).
Marisha: Yeah, who's going to be back down here, theoretically.
Orion: The guards could come back.
Matt: None of them make their way through. The rest of these begin coming forward-- what's the roll they have to make for the Spiky Growth?
Laura: 14.
Taliesin: To repair the room that we broke, anyway.
Matt: 14. Both missed their save. What's the damage on that?
Laura: That's 2d4 for every five feet crossed.
Matt: They would probably be skittering around here halfway through before they changed trajectory, so-- 1d4, 2d4?
Laura: 2d4 for every five feet.
Matt: So 10d4 each.
Marisha: Nice!
Matt: They come charging around the corner rapidly (skittering noises).
Marisha: 10d4? That's cool.
Orion: Oh, nice, what?
Marisha: For her thorns.
Orion: (whispers) Sweet, thorns.
Marisha: My little sister once fell into a rose bush.
Sam: Good story.
Marisha: It was very painful.
Orion: Good story? (laughs) I once fell into a fire ant hill.
Marisha: That sucks, too.
Orion: It was very painful. I was riding my bike. It sucked.
Laura: 22.
Matt: 22. Both of these spiders stop in place, looking severely messed up and damaged and just kind of hold their ground, looking very confused. You see, crawling up over the top of this structure, one large white and bluish spider that leaps up. As this is happening, you guys are noticing that blue energy is cracking through the floor and now following the pattern across the entirety of the structure. It crawls up the walls--
Marisha: Oh.
Matt: -- and that blue energy reaches to the ceiling and illuminates it. And what you missed when you entered the room is you can see, recessed into the ceiling of this room, four large humanoid entities that are just currently held aloft, buried in the ceiling, of platinum armor.
Orion: Go.
Travis: We've got to go. We've got to go.
Matt: One of them suddenly flashes, dislodges, and (whoosh, thud), squashing the spider in the process. (yelling)
Marisha: What is that?
Matt: Just (spider screech, croak) screeching sound, the spider slowly tries to curl in place, the giant platinum golem now slamming on top and squishing on top. You see as it slowly comes to stand, each hand holding these giant platinum cleavers. You suddenly hear a voice ringing through your heads collectively: "Get out."
Laura: (whispers) We should get out!
Orion: You heard the man! You heard him! You heard him! The earrings, everybody heard him.
Sam: Wait, can we just leave the thing here with the golem?
Laura: Golems are meant to protect.
Orion: It's going to kill everything there.
Sam: Oh, then let's go.
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: All right, so all of you guys start bolting out. I want everyone to go ahead and make a dexterity check.
Marisha: Okay. Yeah, sure.
Orion: 13.
Matt: All right, anyone lower than a ten?
Travis: What about on a ten?
Marisha: No.
Matt: Lower than a ten?
Orion: (quietly) We all got above ten?
Matt: Anyone? All right. You as well?
Ashley: 14.
Matt: Awesome. (laughter)
Orion: Even Pike!
Matt: You guys all come darting out of the room, except for Kima, who rolls a one. So all of you guys come running out of the room--
Sam: Kima's dead.
Marisha: Kima?
Matt: The rest of the Scalebearers come rushing out, they're no longer encumbered by the box. Kima's kind of helping everyone get by, trying to keep everyone at bay, being the hero. As she turns around, the first one comes leaping off of the structure, runs towards her and gives one giant sweep with one of its blades. Ooh, yeah, that'll hit. You see the blade streak across the front of her silver armor. She takes 24 points of slashing damage. It sends her flying back ten feet with the sheer force of it, but she manages to roll out of it, yeah! With an acrobatics check, catching herself to her feet and just keeps bolting behind the rest of you guys.
Laura: Can I see?
Matt: You now see behind two more (crash, crash) dislodging from the ceiling as the one that's charging after you is coming up the stairway. Through this, we're now going into a skill challenge as you guys are rushing out.
Laura: Oh, god.
Travis: Must go faster. Must go faster.
Sam: Skill challenge.
Marisha: Skill challenge!
Ashley: Ah, go, go!
Orion: Yeah, all right. Run for your life.
Marisha: We haven't done this in a while.
Matt: Now, as you're running to get through, there's still bits of webbing still in the way. I need everyone to go ahead and make another dexterity check.
Sam: All right, doing good.
Orion: Yes!
Taliesin: Yeah!
Marisha: Oh, okay, yeah, yeah, sure.
Orion: 21!
Laura: 25.
Taliesin: 22.
Travis: 21.
Liam: 26.
Ashley: 17?
Marisha: 11?
Taliesin: 22.
Matt: All right.
Sam: 19.
Matt: All right, as you guys are all charging up, kind of helping each other but also clamoring to get through, Kima is rushing up and you can see where one of the Scalebearers has now tripped and fallen on the stairs.
Sam: Oh, no!
Matt: She runs past, leans back to reach her hand out as the golem comes up behind--
Marisha: No!
Matt: -- with two hands, swings down with both blades.
Sam: Against Kima again?
Matt: No, this is against one of the Scalebearers.
Sam: Oh, okay.
Taliesin: Oh no.
Laura: Should I be rolling for Trinket?
Matt: I'm considering Trinket with you, so no.
Marisha: Too late, just leave them.
Laura: Okay, thank you.
Matt: We'll do that next round because I forgot. There's a lot of things to consider. One of them hits the stone and just streaks off, sparks flying through the air, illuminating the space secondarily. However, the other Scalebearer takes 28 points of slashing damage from the blow. As it reaches up again for a second blow, Kima reaches down and grabs Desona's arm and lifts her up off her feet and they both go charging forward. You guys make your way up the stairway as you see now the golem pushing its way through.
Orion: I'm going to dissipate my card illusion and I'm going to cast Fly on myself, so I'm hovering.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: How much of a gap is there between the last trailing-behind Scalebearer and the golem?
Matt: Well, now that Kima's got them, they're rushing up and there's about a ten-foot, 15-foot gap now.
Laura: Okay.
Marisha: I'm going to turn around and do Wall of Stone. Boof!
Matt: Okay. As they rush past, a wall of stone slams up as the golem goes smashing into it--
Orion: I'll do support. I'll do Obelisk right behind it, too.
Matt: All right. So as you guys come rushing up to the top of this, you guys are just doing the stone wall, obelisk, obelisk, obelisk. We'll say you cast it twice to go ahead and reinforce.
Marisha: Boof!
Matt: All right, you hear the impact from behind. You hear stone crack and break and you see two of the pillars that you put up impact, dust and bits of rock shoot out, but it settles. Apparently it's holding strong and you start hearing slamming of some sort of heavy weight behind it.
Marisha: Right, run.
Matt: As well as the following of additional giant heavy footsteps. It's now got its reinforcements caught up to it. You guys charge into the room with the broken trap, which now has partially raised platforms. You're rushing around and trying to find your way through. You get to the other side of the room. There's now an entirety-- a room filled with mist in front of you.
Laura: (gasps) Oh no.
Marisha: I still have it. I can Gust of Wind. That's my last 3rd-level spell.
Matt: Okay. All right, Gust of Wind. I'm going to ask all of you guys to make a wisdom check as you rush through.
Marisha: Including me?
Matt: Everyone.
Sam: Wisdom check or saving throw?
Matt: This is a wisdom check.
Marisha: Just adding your wisdom?
Ashley: Natural 20!
Laura: What what!
Matt: Nice!
Ashley: 24.
Marisha: Saving throw or just your ability modifier?
Orion: 12.
Matt: Ability modifier.
Taliesin: Oh.
Marisha: Okay, 16.
Orion: I thought it was negative three.
Sam: Ten. Ten for me.
Taliesin: 14.
Laura: 13.
Liam: Nine.
Travis: Two.
Sam: Nine, wow.
Matt: All of you guys are pushing through. So, as you guys come rushing in you're like, go go! You see Keyleth's focusing and getting the wind to escape, Keyleth rushes up, Kima comes through with the two Scalebearers, everyone comes through, Grog's bringing up the back. You can see now, in the back behind him, a giant blade-wielding fist as the golem comes smashing through the wall. The rest of you guys, ushering Grog along, Grog comes running, hears the sound, looks over his shoulder and in the chaos of it, his trajectory is off and he ends up brushing into the side of the mist.
Laura: Oh, no!
Matt: Grog, go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw.
Travis: 12.
Matt: You end up taking 24 points of fire damage as the pillars spin, unleashing a torrent of flame.
Travis: No, bad car wash, bad car wash!
Marisha: (laughs) Bad car wash.
Laura: Oh, no, Grog, your beard has been singed.
Orion: Oh!
Travis: What? (laughter)
Matt: You reach up instinctively, you feel it's as smooth as a baby goliath's face. (laughter)
Orion: All that work!
Matt: As you guys charge up the rest of the staircase--
Orion: Is Grog behind us now, like the furthest away?
Matt: He's just caught up to you guys as you're rushing up the staircase. You get to the final door. You exit. As Kima rushes everyone through, she brings out her holy symbol real fast, and as she pulls it off her neck, you see the first golem reach the bottom of the staircase. It begins looming up--
Orion: We're leaving! What are you doing?!
Marisha: Yeah, go home! Go home! Bad golem.
Taliesin: I take a--
Matt: Kima takes out her holy symbol and holds it aloft in front of her and says under her breath (murmurs), at which point it begins to glow with this extremely vibrant glow. As it does, you see a symbol emblazoned on the front of the golem and it flashes with light as it stops and just kind of holds its place-- and waits. And Kima looks at the symbol like "I wasn't sure that was going to work." She takes--
Orion: Tell it to go kill the spider.
Matt: She takes the symbol and puts it back in the side of the stone door that originally was closed. The doors slowly seal shut once again. She pulls the symbol out-- and she falls to her knees, breathing heavily.
Sam: Oh, Kima.
Marisha: We did it!
Travis: Next time, lead with that.
Orion: I agree, Grog. Very well said.
Matt: "It kind of happened very quickly, I'm sorry."
Ashley: All right, do some people need to be healed?
Taliesin: Oh, dear.
Laura: Yeah.
Sam: Kima, for sure.
Orion: I'm actually okay.
Marisha: I'm all right. I'm all right.
Taliesin: I'm fine.
Sam: Oh, Grog's got a burnt face.
Travis: No, I want to wear this pain as a remembrance of my beard.
Laura: You can grow it back, Grog.
Orion: It's okay, big fella.
Matt: You make your way back up to the main chamber, where High Bearer Vord is currently waiting for you.
Sam: Oh, this guy.
Matt: He turns to you as you enter. "So I am to assume that your journey was a success?"
Orion: Yes, surprisingly so. It went off without a hitch. Well, no.
Laura: You've got some good security down there.
Marisha: Very good.
Matt: "I told you. Once it's instilled, it will be safe."
Laura: A little warning next time would be great.
Ashley: 25 points of healing.
Matt: There you go.
Orion: You're really a girl on fire now.
Marisha: That really heals me up, then.
Taliesin: That will top me off very nicely.
Marisha: I'll take that.
Orion: Well done, everyone, by the way.
Laura: Yeah.
Taliesin: That could've gone worse.
Marisha: It could have gone worse.
Matt: At which point, the High Bearer Vord kind of raises his hand. "Yonn, if you do not mind." And Yonn kind of shuffles forward.
Sam: Yonn.
Orion: Such a bore.
Marisha: Yawn.
Matt: "Excuse me, I'm right here."
Orion: It was a play on words. Your name also means something that you do when you're tired.
Marisha: Yeah!
Matt: "I don't like you." (laughter)
Matt: He reaches out and puts a big old sack of coins in your hands.
Laura: Oh! I'll hold onto that.
Orion: Of course.
Taliesin: We should mention, you may have to have one of the rooms repaired.
Orion: I take a couple out.
Taliesin: The spinning column--
Sam: Circle of death.
Laura: Yeah.
Taliesin: May have gotten--
Laura: A little broken. We thought were maybe just disarming it but I think we probably broke it.
Taliesin: We put an arrow into it.
Travis: (tearfully) If you find the remnants of a glorious beard, preserve it.
Laura: Oh, Grog, actually--
Travis: What?
Laura: I've got some remnants of a lovely beard. And I try to smush it onto his chin.
Travis: It is not the same.
Matt: It is not the same.
Laura: It looks pretty good.
Matt: It is not the same.
Laura: Dang it.
Matt: At which point, the High Bearer turns to you, Pike. "Mighty cleric, I see this meeting, though it escaped my vision before, that you bear the holy sigil of the Dawnflower, the Lady of Redemption Herself. While we may walk under different stars, I offer these words that caught my ear naught but a week ago. In an excavation beneath the toppled tower of Syrac, the long-cursed ruin that sat like a blemish upon this city for hundreds of years, it was revealed that perhaps the five holy paths that began here at Vasselheim, there may indeed now be a sixth."
Sam: What?
Matt: "A forgotten temple to Sarenrae has been uncovered. Crumbled, lost, and without light, it sat, forever and a day, and few are around in this city of her guiding flame to recover and restore its glory. Perhaps you should look into it."
Ashley: I will gladly look into it.
Matt: "The ruin lies to the west of here, at the base of the city's mountain. Look for the dark stone ruin. Nevertheless, I thank you for your time. Kima, if you wouldn't mind, we have some things to discuss as well."
Marisha: Oh, quick, Vorg--
Matt: "Vord. High Bearer Vord."
Marisha: Vord.
Taliesin: Vord.
Laura: Highbearer Vord.
Matt: "Was that so hard? Yes?"
Marisha: Vord? You wouldn't have happened to hear of maybe a druid tribe called the Fire Ashari? They call their little hometown Pyrah. Do you happen to know, maybe?
Matt: He gives you a keen look and says, "There has been talk of a rogue band of druids, not more than two day's travel, in the-- let's see, where did I put the maps here?" He thinks to himself for a moment, considering it. "Towards the Sunder Peak Mountain Range. Dangerous territory, fraught with volcanic activity. Yet these folks seem to call it home."
Marisha: Is Sunder Peak like west or east to where we--
Matt: "Southwest of the city. It's hard to miss."
Marisha: Southwest.
Matt: "Look for the plumes of sulfurous smoke."
Laura: Is the temple to Sarenrae on the way to the--
Matt: "The temple to Sarenrae is on the same mountain that this temple is built on."
Laura: Oh.
Matt: "To the west of here. Follow the mountain base."
Marisha: Oh. So we can stop there first?
Orion: Yes, it's close, it seems.
Laura: All of us can--
Orion: Before we part, you seem to be quite learned about many things that I am not. Have you ever heard of anything called the God's Hammer or the Pale Stone? Or any particular artifact, Ropes of Mercy, perhaps?
Matt: "I can't say I have, unfortunately."
Orion: Of course.
Matt: "But I shall keep this in mind, should the information come my way."
Orion: Thank you. I bow.
Matt: He gives you a look, a quick glance, and notes: "For the record, while your color is not what it was when you first entered, know that the great Platinum Dragon sees through this guise to the heart beneath."
Orion: Yes, thank you for noticing. I agree with the same sentiment. And I bow in the Draconic fashion.
Matt: "Well, Kima. Business. Thank you all very much." And he kind of lends his hands out. As he extends his hand, the doors on the opposite side of the room open up.
Laura: Magic. Thought it was banned.
Matt: For the sake of brevity, because we have people who have to leave on this, very soon, it doesn't take you long to find your way across the city. You find some of the city's Bastions standing guard on the outskirts of this crumpled tower ruin. It's like, black and soot-covered stone that looks like a plot of land that has been left untouched. Like, once it fell, no one wanted anything to do with it. You speak with the Bastions and they eventually let you through, especially given the aid of those you've walked with since arrival. You come to the ruin and you can see there's about a 40-foot gap in this pile of stone that is a recess in the ground, almost like a small sinkhole. It looks like there is some sort of excavation that has been set here. Very haphazard. There is very simple wood boards that have been placed into the side of this small sinkhole to allow relatively comfortable, though a bit rickety, descent into the structure. As you make your way down, your eyes adjust to the little bit of daylight that spills into this dark subterranean cavern. There before you, you see a surprisingly glorious sight: a simple structure of brass and polished limestone, ancient as the day is long. One of the walls has partially collapsed, and you see what looks like three figures rummaging through the debris. An older human woman, who is being helped by two others: a young man of blond hair and simple clothes and an older gnome that's carrying a crutch under his arm. They're all in the process of collecting and setting aside and cleaning up various things that have been recovered from this temple. You immediately see against the brass structure the very simplified symbol of the wings of Sarenrae, multiple times across the structure in various incarnations. This is very much indeed a lost temple of Sarenrae.
Laura: (whispers) Wow, Pike.
Ashley: (whispers) Wow.
Sam: So, when you've fully excavated it, you can come back and check it out.
Ashley: Yes...
Orion: Or you can stay here and restore it.
Matt: At which point, the older woman sees you guys walk down and says, "Please! There's nothing to take. Nothing but history and rock, I guarantee you. Bandits are not welcome here."
Ashley: No no no! I take out my symbol and I say, no no no, I'm here to help.
Matt: You can hear an audible gasp from her. She says, "My eyes don't deceive. Oh my, I am sorry. My name is Gesyra, a simple painter, but one of, as far as I know, the three devoted to the Lady of the Everlight here in Vasselheim. And now a fourth. I don't know where you came from, but would you stay with us for a bit and help us rebuild? Bring her name into the light amongst the others here in Vasselheim? Restore it to its glory?"
Ashley: (tearfully) Yes. Oh, man, I don't want to leave you guys.
Matt: "It shouldn't take long, especially with your help. And we can bring the light into the heart of others." And you can see the two other kind of joined her at the side and they all look at you with this look of hope that you can probably tell from the crinkles in their face they haven't had in quite some time. And they look up to you in their simple clothes as the first true strong bastion for Sarenrae that they've seen in a long time. With that, Pike, you get to turn to the rest of the group.
Ashley: Well, I think this is a pilgrimage I have to take. So, Vox Machina, keep your eyes out. I will contact you every once in a while if I can, and we will meet up once this is completed. All in.
Travis: Right.
Ashley: Vox Machina on three. One, two, three.
All: Vox Machina.
Orion: (tearfully) You will be missed very much, Pike.
Ashley: I'm going to miss you guys very much.
Matt: And on that note, we have to close because people are in a rush. Yeah, Ashley will be leaving us for a time. She's going to New York for a few months to shoot a web-- a television series. (laughter)
Sam: A little web series.
Matt: A wonderful television series she has recurring. We're really happy and proud of her-- we're just a jumble of emotions under the circumstances.
Ashley: You guys have been so amazing and have made this experience even better for us, and thank you so much for going with us on our journey. It will keep going, but I will be back when I can.
Orion: You will be back.
Laura: You'll be back.
Taliesin: You'll be back.
Orion: She will be back.
Ashley: But it might be a long time.
Matt: Yeah, she'll pop in and out if she can, and there will eventually be a return of Pike, but for the time being she feels the calling to stay and help rebuild this temple of Sarenrae.
Marisha: We're going to miss you, Pike.
Ashley: I'm going to miss you guys.
Marisha: But we understand personal journeys.
Ashley: Personal journey.
Travis: You have a good time.
Ashley: I will.
Sam: Pike, I, Scanlan, will not physically wait for you, but emotionally-- (laughter)
Sam: Emotionally I will wait for you, and I will not stray emotionally. I will always be there for you emotionally.
Ashley: Okay, Scanlan.
Sam: But physically, I mean, come on, it's going to be months.
Matt: Thank you so much, Ash. We're going to miss you but we'll tabs and we'll have you back soon.
Ashley: Okay.
Matt: All right. Thank you all so much for watching. Everyone give Ashley love on the Twitter, on the internet.
Travis: Good going, Ashley!
Matt: And we'll see you guys at Comic-Con next week. Those that'll be at Anime Expo, I'll be there tomorrow for a couple of panels.
Zac: Buy those shirts!
Sam: Oh, yeah, buy the shirts.
Matt: Six more days for the Critical Role shirts before they go away.
Laura: Hey, it's still got Pike on it, you gotta get it now.
All: Yeah.
Sam: Collector's edition.
Ashley: Definitely limited edition.
Matt: All right, guys, thank you and have a wonderful evening, we've got to let these guys go. We'll see you-- me and Marisha will see you in three weeks.
Orion: See us at Comic-Con.
Marisha: We'll see you at Comic-Con.
Matt: The others will see you in two. All right. Have a wonderful night, guys.

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around playing Dungeons and Dragons and say inappropriate things before the camera starts.
Travis: Every time!
Matt: Anyway, we have back in person our illustrious rogue, Vax'ildan.
Travis: Welcome back, baby!
Matt: Happy to have you back. Let's get through our announcements quickly so we can hop into the game, because we have a lot to discuss. A lot of things to see. A lot of places to go. First and foremost, if we can give an awesome shout-out to our sponsor Loot Crate. Once again been awesome to the show. Once again, they have their theme this month. Sam, did you want to say a thing or two?
Sam: The theme this month is Sam. (laughter)
Sam: It's an odd theme. It's all shirts that I've worn. No, the theme this month for Loot Crate is the anti-hero. That's part of the Loot Crate theme and the Loot Wear theme. Not just the box, but the bag as well. But you know what I love?
All: What do you love, Sam?
Sam: I love toys. I love socks. I love shirts. I love posters. I love collectibles. I love pins. I love boxes. And I love deals. And you can get all of those things in combination if you get a subscription to Loot Crate. If you use lootcrate.com/-- that's a forward slash-- CriticalRole, you will be instantly shown a showcase of all the Loot Crate offerings. And you'll get three, not one, not two, a little less than four, but $3 off a monthly subscription.
Laura: It's just the first month. It's just $3 off the very first month.
Sam: Well, that's not as good. (laughter)
Sam: But let's be real, it's still pretty good.
Travis: Where'd you get that great t-shirt you're wearing?
Sam: I am the best at advertising. (laughter)
Taliesin: Why did you have those notes with you?
Sam: (clears throat) Goodbye, Loot Crate. (laughter)
Sam: $3 off the first month is great, though. It's still great. It's still a good intro. It's essentially like getting-- I don't know, I'm done.
Laura: It's $3 just for writing a word.
Liam: It gets you in, and when you're in, you don't want to get out.
Travis: And they got really good stuff. You got your t-shirt from Loot Crate, Voltron.
Sam: Oh! I'm wearing a Loot Crate t-shirt right now. It fits. It makes me look strong and handsome.
Matt: It's true. It's true. If that $3 can buy you a six-inch sandwich at an undisclosed location where sandwiches can be constructed, purchased by artisans.
Travis: Yes!
Matt: Thank you so much, Sam.
Sam: Sure, I did really good.
Matt: You did great, Sam. That was wonderful. Taliesin, you're handling it next week.
Taliesin: (groans) Okay. (laughter)
Matt: All right, next announcements. Two weeks from now, the first Thursday of September, I myself, Marisha, and Taliesin will be out of town. We'll be in the middle of the desert. However, the rest of the crew here will be playing a one-shot game, dungeon mastered by our wonderful, recently proven skilled dungeon master here, Liam O'Brien.
Liam: I'm all growed up.
Matt: Somehow in the canon world of Exandria. So we'll see how that plays out for you guys. I'm really excited to see what you pull together, man.
Liam: I have something very delightful planned.
Matt: So that'll be fun. So look forward to that in a couple of weeks. We'll be thinking of you guys while we're not here, but watch this guy be evil. It's going to be great. Anything else anyone wants to discuss?
Liam: I would like to announce that I am so goddamn happy to be back in this room.
Travis: Yeah! Back in the pilot chair.
Sam: Wait a second, pilot chair?
Marisha: Just don't think about it too much.
Matt: Can I also point out today that the official World of Warcraft Twitter made a Critical Role joke?
Taliesin: Is that true?
Matt: Someone sent them a piece of fanart that had a Jaina and an Illidan talking, and the Critical Role, or the response to me from World of Warcraft, was: the Legion is coming towards you. How do you want to do this? That made me happy. So let's dive in to tonight's episode of chaos and heroic whim.
Liam: What's going to happen?
Matt: Out here, we dive into tonight's episode of Critical Role. [dramatic music]
Matt: Welcome back. Last we left off, Vox Machina, in their search for the Vestiges of Divergence to gain artifacts powerful enough to rival, hopefully, the power of the Chroma Conclave, a group of chromatic dragons that have been terrorizing the countryside of Tal'Dorei. The party has just finished their journey through the Feywild, a strange, magically overgrown realm of fey creatures, illusion, and apparently, corrupt tree-bros. After a fight with this long-mentally disturbed fey, heartbroken and driven to vengeance and soiling the land around him, you defeated him and took from him the bow, Fenthras, which you've been seeking. Your Vestige, Vex.
Laura: That's right. That's right.
Matt: You then gathered hands and through the magical capabilities of Keyleth, the druid of the Air Ashari, you managed to Plane Shift the rest of the party back to Whitestone itself. Speaking of which--
Laura: Already? Already?
Marisha: How long have we been gone?
Matt: All right, and I also need Scanlan, Percy, and Grog to roll wisdom saving throws.
Sam: What did we do to deserve that?
Taliesin: We all deserve it. We know we do. That was terrible. I have a thing called Resolve and I have one usage of it left. May I use it?
Matt: You get to reroll a saving throw? Yeah, you may.
Taliesin: Okay.
Sam: Would this be magic, Matt?
Taliesin: That's double.
Marisha: Goddamn it.
Matt: It's a magical effect.
Travis: We're in trouble.
Sam: If it's not magic, then I have an 11.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Guys, drama needs conflict.
Taliesin: Eight.
Travis: Six.
Laura: Oh my god!
Liam: Hot damn!
Taliesin: I'm so excited.
Matt: No. As the portal shifts closed behind you, you all step out into the center of the Whitestone city square. You can see behind you the Sun Tree where you guys left originally. It is midday. Clouds are high in the sky. Little breaks where you can see beams of sunlight coming through. Looks like there's a darker rainstorm coming, probably in the next half-day or so, off in the distant northwest, and there are now townspeople looking about at the group of you guys. Keyleth, Scanlan, Vex, and Vax: returning, your mind feels a little fuzzy, but overall nothing seems to have affected you. You're glad to be back. Percy and Grog, you are very confused how you got here and not quite sure why nothing has happened since you gathered here as friends. Yes?
Taliesin: So do we have a straight piece of missing time? Are we still waiting to go to the Feywild?
Matt: As far as you guys know right now, you guys are still waiting.
Marisha: That's horrible for Percy. You've wanted to go your whole fucking life!
Travis: All right, I'm ready to go!
Taliesin: How long does this spell take?
Travis: Yeah, do we have to wait long, because I have the pee. You know? Where you're like hide-and-go-seek pee?
Taliesin: I did, but I feel fine now.
Laura: Ready to go to the actual castle?
Travis: Feywild.
Liam: Keyleth just brought us back. We're back.
Laura: We're back from the Feywild.
Taliesin: You're a terrible liar. (laughs)
Liam: That's true, but it's irrelevant. What the fuck are you talking about?
Taliesin: What are you talking about?
Marisha: Does the name Garmelie ring a bell?
Laura: If he doesn't remember we went, does that mean I lose my title?
Liam: Maybe you can work it out?
Marisha: You titled Vex'ahlia.
Taliesin: I did what?
Laura: Oh no!
Sam: You gave Vex'ahlia a title in your Whitestone kingdom. She was the Duchess of some hut.
Taliesin: Can someone who can't successfully lie to me please explain to me what's going on?
Laura: Baroness. Lady Vex'ahlia, Baroness of the Third House of Whitestone, Grand Mistress of the Grey Hunt.
Taliesin: How do you know about the Grey Hunt?
Laura: I don't know anything about the Grey Hunt, but it's written down on a piece of paper you gave me, Percy.
Taliesin: Is it written on a piece of paper?
Marisha: It is written on a piece of paper.
Laura: That I actually threw out because I fixed up my notes. So I don't have the piece of paper in this world binder.
Travis: What a dicklord. You did not throw out the paper.
Marisha: Someone wrote it down, right?
Travis: You piece of shit. Why did you throw it away? What a fucking--
Taliesin: This is how I know you're lying, because if I had written that down, you wouldn't have thrown it away. That's ridiculous.
Laura: No, no, it's definitely right here.
Liam: Are you certain you're not trying to do comedy right now?
Taliesin: I feel funny. I don't know-- for the sake of actual sanity, does she actually have the piece of paper that he wrote down?
Sam: Did he write something down?
Taliesin: I did, I wrote it down for her and handed to her.
Laura: He did, and it's just, it's in my-- so I don't have it.
Matt: You would've had it with you. You would've definitely had it with you. And yeah, she does.
Laura: I would still have it. It's just not in this particular not-in-that-world binder.
Liam: It's not in this realm.
Sam: The binder that Vex carries is much, much better.
Taliesin: It's got like fur. And some like--
Laura: Keeps it under her arm the whole time.
Liam: There are more worlds than these.
Laura: It's got a happy kitten on it that says "hang in there."
Liam: It says life-- (laughter)
Laura: Life needs things to live?
Taliesin: I don't know what's so funny about that either. I don't remember any of that.
Liam: It grows on you so quickly, though.
Laura: Grog.
Travis: What?
Marisha: Show him the paper, Vex.
Laura: Oh, here. It's right here. Right here. That's your handwriting, don't you see it?
Marisha: We were committing.
Taliesin: It's fine. I'm happy to commit to this. Why? What hap--? What?
Laura: Oh god.
Marisha: We were in Syngorn.
Sam: Wait, I think I can help. I'm going to cast Modify Memory on Percy.
Laura: And Grog's just content sitting over here completely blank.
Liam: Eating chicken that he found on the road.
Taliesin: This is so exciting.
Marisha: Little gamey?
Taliesin: I've never seen him laugh like that before.
Matt: This is-- this is a way to do it. All right. All right.
Sam: I can help you remember, Percy. Just look into my eyes.
Taliesin: I don't want to.
Sam: Look into my eyes. (laughter)
Taliesin: Well, that's getting giffed. Okay, yeah.
Laura: But wait, are you just going to make up what he remembers? No!
Matt: Percy, I need you to make a wisdom saving throw.
Taliesin: Oh, and I'm out of Resolve.
Matt: What is your spell DC? Is this with the cone? Scanlan, is this with the cone?
Sam: With the cone. I want this to work.
Marisha: You're going to pull-- screaming in his face.
Taliesin: Wow, eight.
Marisha: What the fuck?
Matt: Scanlan, how do you modify his memory? Because at this level you can alter the memories of an event that took up to seven days ago.
Travis: What level are you doing?
Sam: Level seven.
Matt: But you can only modify ten minutes of it.
Liam: Speaking as Liam, remember that this is a man who gave an evil sword-- he gave crystal meth to Grog.
Taliesin: The best crystal meth! The finest crystal meth in Christendom.
Sam: I can change any memory. Ah, what was it called?
Taliesin: Ten minutes.
Sam: What was your title called? There's nothing on this piece of paper! (laughter)
Travis: Inception.
Laura: Lady Vex'ahlia. Baroness of the Third House of Whitestone and the Grand Mistress of the Grey Hunt.
Sam: Jesus Christ. Baroness of what?
Laura: Of the Third House of Whitestone.
Taliesin: And Grand Mistress of the Grey Hunt.
Liam: I have no patience for any of this shit.
Sam: Whitestone and Grand Mistress of the Grey Hunt.
Laura: Of all the ten minutes to have him remember, maybe that's not the one to focus on.
Taliesin: It's not remembering. He's going to be making it up. I'm not actually going to remember it, he's going to lie.
Laura: Make up something wonderful for him. He's wanted to go there his entire life. Make something magical.
Taliesin: You don't have time to have this conversation. This is happening right now.
Matt: Yeah, go for it.
Taliesin: This isn't happening. Fuck with me. I'm so excited.
Matt: Scanlan.
Sam: Oh my god. When did we leave? How many days has it been?
Matt: It's been close to a week in the Feywild total, all the nights you've rested.
Sam: I can only modify ten minutes of time.
Matt: Correct.
Sam: So I can't build the whole story up.
Matt: No, he'll remember ten minutes that you plug in right now.
Taliesin: And by remember meaning whatever you explain.
Sam: All right.
Matt: And remember, as truth, whatever ten minutes he hands out. This spell is one of my favorite spells in the game.
Travis: This is amazing.
Sam: All right, I don't know. I'm going to make him remember that we landed in the Feywild together as a group. It was a beautiful field filled with naked nymphs and fey creatures that all came to him and gave him a wonderful full-body massage.
Taliesin: Very uncomfortable, all right. But no, that was tension. Okay, yes.
Sam: Vex saw him and he did not want anyone to know about this moment that he had. So in a fit of panic, he gave her something, anything, a title. A title to make her keep her confidence. The title was Lady Vex'ahlia, the Baroness of the Third House of Whitestone and Grand Mistress of the Gray Hut. (laughter)
Laura: Oh no.
Sam: She agreed to keep his secret and he had a wonderful time before his memory fades.
Taliesin: Oh my. Wait, that was-- we were-- but there was-- you shouldn't, no! Yes! I did do this. Yes.
Laura: You remember?
Taliesin: I do, and we will never discuss why again, but yes, I did do this, and I'm so glad I wrote it down correctly because that was very embarrassing. I'll have this approved.
Laura: Approved?
Taliesin: Yes, well, I'm going to make sure I have to-- of course inform-- Yes.
Travis: Who's yes?
Matt: It seems the awkward curse of the Feywild has set into a couple of your allies.
Taliesin: I, apparently, am missing an awful lot of time. But this did happen. Yes, okay.
Liam: Well, Percival, look at this. Show him the bow.
Taliesin: Oh, that kind of bow.
Travis: Whoa!
Laura: Oh, Grog, it's really badass. You killed the guy that was holding it. You.
Travis: Me? So it's mine?
Marisha: I pull out the piece of the petrified crocodile. We killed this, too. This is all that's left of him.
Travis: What? Those are like amazing things.
Laura: Wait, is this normal? Would we have known that this is normal for people to lose their memory when they come out of the fucking Feywild?
Matt: No, you would have no idea.
Laura: We wouldn't have learned any of that in our studies. No?
Matt: Your studies aren't extensive on the Feywild, and the people that may know, partially, are suffering from the circumstance.
Travis: There's a petrified crocodile. What else did you see while we were in this magical place?
Sam: To be honest, my memory is foggy as well.
Matt: No, a little bit. But you guys weren't heavy studiers. You weren't the most studious children.
Laura: (whispers) I was a studious child.
Matt: For certain things.
Laura: I was a very studious child. He cheated off my tests all the time. I was incredibly studious.
Marisha: Percy, I am so sorry. I know how badly you wanted to go there. But here's the good news. Now that I've been there, we can go back at any time.
Taliesin: Really? You promise?
Laura: Grog, did this happen last time you went to the Feywild?
Travis: What?
Laura: When you-- do you remember-- okay.
Liam: I really don't think we need to worry about Grog so much. I think he's fine.
Travis: Thank you.
Laura: You killed so many things, Grog. You fought so many people.
Taliesin: Oh god! Did we get alcohol? Did someone give us alcohol?
Laura: No.
Taliesin: Damn.
Liam: But that can happen today.
Taliesin: Yeah, but it won't be fairy alcohol, but I know.
Marisha: Yeah, we've been, naturally, without alcohol.
Laura: We need to find Pike. Pike came to help us.
Taliesin: How long have we been gone for?
Sam: Pike was there.
Laura: Five days?
Sam: I don't know, it's a bit foggy, but a few days.
Liam: Guys, let's just go find a wizard and some alcohol, in whichever order.
Taliesin: I'm going to go file this and I'll meet you in a moment.
Laura: There's Gilmore, we could talk to him. Allura? Maybe she can help.
Taliesin: Here. I'm going to make sure that that's finalized with the correct spelling.
Liam: Jabba the Hutt. Not that grand to me. I start walking off towards the castle.
Sam: We're in Whitestone?
Matt: You're in Whitestone, currently, yes.
Liam: Come on!
Sam: All right, let's go.
Travis: We just left there.
Liam: Just eat your pigeon and come along, Grog.
Taliesin: Strange. Suddenly, I am hungry. Are you suddenly hungry?
Travis: Yeah.
Taliesin: We should eat something.
Laura: I make sure Trinket's out of the necklace.
Marisha: Yes, I could use a glass of wine.
Taliesin: I could use a carafe of wine.
Matt: Trinket licks the side of your face. Nuzzles you as you walk towards the castle.
Travis: Wait, if you got a bow, and there were pixies, and you gave her something, did I get anything? Did I pick up any diseases?
Laura: Lots of diseases.
Sam: You fought bravely. And often. You wielded your weapon strongly and proudly, and had many definite physical encounters, and were never frozen. And showed your power and defended us to the best of your ability.
Liam: You waded through blood, Grog.
Travis: Can I insight check Scanlan?
Matt: (laughs) You can. Scanlan, make a deception check.
Travis: Six!
Sam: Okay, good. 17. (laughter)
Taliesin: Holy Jesus.
Matt: Seems legit, and a part of you is disappointed that you can't recall this memory. But even just them speaking of it is almost half of the fun, so.
Travis: That's pretty great. I like all those things you said.
Sam: You were great.
Travis: Did I get any new weapons? I won't be able to pull it out of the bag of holding unless I know what's in there.
Sam: That's true.
Taliesin: I'm going to check my pockets for anything interesting.
Travis: I don't have pockets.
Laura: Percy, your sketchbook.
Taliesin: My sketchbook, yes, what about it?
Laura: You made sketches the entire time.
Taliesin: Oh my god! I did!
Matt: And you look through the pages and there are sketches you don't remember drawing.
Travis: Oh fuck! I mean, oh fuck!
Taliesin: This is so weird.
Marisha: You had a lovely time.
Taliesin: This'll do.
Marisha: We can go back. We'll take a lovely vacation.
Taliesin: No, no, this and liquor will do.
Laura: You used your lightning javelin. You--
Matt: As you guys approach--
Laura: Yes! You have a little statue. You have a little statue, Grog.
Sam: Oh, that's right. A little statue of a dog that might be magical.
Travis: A little statue of a dog.
Sam: An onyx statue of a dog.
Travis: Can I reach into the bag of holding for an onyx statue of a dog?
Matt: Make an intelligence check.
Sam: I've seen it, I can reach in there.
Matt: One of you guys can reach in there and get it if you want to. I just want to see if he can.
Travis: 11.
Matt: Unfortunately, your lack of imagination is finding it difficult based on the words you were given to formulate enough of a solid creative thought.
Laura: It's black. Onyx means black.
Taliesin: Honest statue of a hog. It's an honest statue of a hog.
Sam: Doesn't know what onyx is. He's picturing--
Matt: He barely knows what a dog is at this point.
Travis: If you want to reach in here and reach in my bag. Oh.
Liam: Sam, you can do this to me too.
Matt: And there you have it. The onyx mastiff is there before you.
Laura: It's an onyx mastiff. It's an onyx statuette of mastiff. If you use an action to speak the command word--
Liam: Which we don't know--
Laura: I know. And throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of you it becomes a living mastiff for up to six hours.
Liam: I thought the guy told us we'd have to figure it out. Did he whisper anything to you?
Laura: It was etched on the bottom and I totally understand it.
Liam: Oh, you read Elvish?
Laura: I do.
Liam: You're partially elvish.
Laura: It's right there.
Sam: So wait, it's insta-dog?
Laura: It's insta-dog.
Sam: And then what does it do? Can it fight?
Laura: It fights. It has sight and hearing checks. It bites and it claws just like-- oh, no. It just bites.
Sam: And what happens if it gets killed?
Laura: I'm looking, I'm looking.
Travis: It has an intelligence of eight.
Sam: What's your intelligence?
Travis: Six.
Sam: Oh my goodness.
Laura: The creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to zero hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can't be used again for, ugh, seven days.
Travis: Get to the bottom part, come on.
Laura: Mastiff has an intelligence of eight (laughs) and can speak Common. It's smarter than you.
Sam: Oh, it's a talking dog?
Laura: Yeah.
Marisha: I wonder if it has a name.
Matt: It can also see invisibility.
Sam: It can see invisibility?
Matt: That's why it's a good guard dog if you--
Laura: And objects within that range.
Sam: I like this dog.
Liam: The only important thing on that paper.
Marisha: And how long does he last? He just lives until he's done?
Taliesin: Six hours.
Laura: Sorry, I didn't mean to read all that and make it not interesting.
Travis: If you set camp though, good sentry.
Sam: But we need to know the magic word.
Laura: We know it. It's good doggie.
Sam: Oh, we know the word already?
Matt: It's part of the enchantment, yeah.
Marisha: Good doggie.
Sam: Can you teach us how to say that in Elvish?
Taliesin: Don't teach him how to say it in Elvish.
Laura: You can say it in Common. He understands Common.
Taliesin: He understands Common, that's fair.
Liam: Vel'ena. Vo'el'ena.
Sam: Vo'el'el'ena?
Laura: Yeah, that's it.
Sam: Vo'el'la'la'la.
Travis: All right, we start walking back to Whitestone.
Laura: Grog, I'm sorry.
Sam: Let's get the dog out here.
Taliesin: Let's hold off on the dog.
Matt: As you guys make your way towards the castle, there's a small group of figures. You see three armored Whitestone soldiers with one figure following them. Different outfit, looks to be simple dark blues and grays. Dark skin, short dark hair, carrying his crossbow at his side. As you make eyes, you immediately recognize this as Jarett.
Marisha: Jarett!
Matt: Jarett is coming down and he sees. "Aye, friends, it has been a while. I'm so happy to see that you survived. It's been a while. Is everyone okay?"
Liam: How long?
Matt: "Aye, most better part of a week."
Marisha: So it is like Saturday here, right? Time runs the same?
Matt: "Yes?"
Marisha: So it wasn't yesterday?
Sam: Why did you taste the wind?
Matt: "I don't know why. It's a strange question." (laughter)
Taliesin: It tastes like Saturday, certainly.
Matt: "More confused by the question, but it's fine. All right."
Laura: How are things here?
Matt: "Well, (sighs) let's just say better for the time being." And as you look up, what you didn't notice before when you saw the clouds is there's this slight light blue hue to the entire sky.
Taliesin: Excellent.
Matt: There's this very faint shimmer to it. And he goes, "Ah, the barrier is now up, which is good. As soon as they finished that, Allura, Drake and Kima all left to find information on the green dragon."
Liam: Where?
Matt: "I did not inquire as to the location, but they said they should be back in the next few days."
Laura: Cassandra might know.
Taliesin: She will.
Marisha: When did they leave?
Matt: "It's three days ago? They were hoping to get insight on Thordak's current situation while we amass as many armored folks here as possible and continue to reach out for allies. I think that is the main goal right now, is to find as many allies as we can. It was interesting to put a stake into this fight."
Laura: So you're leading an army?
Matt: "Well, we're building whoever we can in this vicinity. There's not many. At the very least, defend, in case this ends up falling."
Laura: And what's your role in it?
Matt: Welcome back. Slight little technical issue there. We're going to roll back in. Little bit of information, step into the moment. As Jarett has walked down the steps of Whitestone and began a conversation with Vox Machina about the current situation here, he says how, "Currently, Allura, Kima, and Drake are off trying to find information on the green dragon, Raishan, and trying to discover what best can be done regarding the attack on Thordak in Emon. Here, I am doing the best I can to build what armed forces we have at our disposal, and we're trying to reach out to bring whatever allies are willing to put their stakes into this battle. But yes, this is a monumental task based on my own experience, and I'm doing the best I can. But bear with me, it's--"
Laura: We have faith in you, Jarett.
Matt: "Thank you, I'm glad somebody does. Asum actually just arrived here. About two or three hours ago."
Laura: Yes. We were wondering what happened to him.
Marisha: Haven't seen him in a while.
Matt: "As were we. Last we heard from Gilmore that he disappeared with Tofor within Emon after the attack."
Liam: Shaun's still in the city?
Matt: "Shaun is still in the city. I believe he's actually up meeting with Asum and Cassandra right now in the castle."
Taliesin: Let's clean up and head in that direction, I'd imagine.
Matt: "Certainly. Well, if you need me, I'll be around. Just--"
Marisha: Jarett?
Matt: "Yes?"
Marisha: Has there been any eyes on the green dragon here recently?
Matt: "None of us have seen the dragon. None of us know its whereabouts, and attempts to scry have been balked. I do not know."
Marisha: Okay, thank you.
Matt: "It's all right. I believe there is information on the whereabouts of the white."
Marisha: Do we know where?
Matt: "I do not know. That is more for what they hold at the castle."
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: "Yell loudly if you need me."
Marisha: Thank you.
Matt: "It warms my heart to see you all safe."
Marisha: Same.
Matt: He gives a little salute and a smile, and continues with the other guards back towards the center of the city. As you guys ascend the steps to Castle Whitestone, you enter the large gates that slowly creak open as you come to the familiar interior. You can hear the voices echoing in the distance from the nearby-- what was once the guest dining area of the castle has now been converted into a war room. As you approach the outside of the doors, they're partially ajar; on the inside you can see your sister, Cassandra, sitting at a table. Gilmore is leaned back, arms crossed, tugging on the end of his chin goatee, and you see Seeker Asum currently facing towards Cassandra. They're in mid-conversation right now. As soon as you enter the room: "It is good to know that you all survive, as they've told me."
Marisha: Same to you, Asum.
Matt: As he turns and looks towards you, you can see the side of his face that has all the heavy tattoos now bears heavy acid scars that have blended the tattoos into the scarring. It's not a very pretty sight, but he seems to at least be in one piece right now. He still has his thick, hooded cloak around his shoulders, and where normally he has a shaved head, some of the hair is growing in in areas that can grow hair based on the damage to this side of his face.
Sam: What happened to you?
Matt: "What happened to me is I made out a lot better than many of the people there that day. This-- I'll take this."
Marisha: I'm so sorry.
Matt: "It's fine. I've had worse. Trust me. Come, sit." Cassandra sits up. "My brother." She comes up and gives you a big hug and holds you for a second.
Laura: Pardon our appearance. And stench.
Taliesin: Yes.
Travis: Do we smell?
Laura: We're covered in that black messiness, I assume.
Taliesin: I hadn't even noticed, actually.
Matt: You do. And it is. Its scent has faded a bit, but you all still are not in the most presentable means. However, the conversation's dire tone seems to be enough where no one pays much mind to it.
Taliesin: We were successful. I will let the others fill you in with some details, although I do-- and I'm going to double check, and I'm going to find the brief letter explaining what I've set up with Vex, although it will not have any of the reason why, but it will have at least the nature of what's been done. And we have acquired, well, Vex. Vex'ahlia, if you would.
Laura: Another Vestige.
Matt: As you pull it out, they all step back. Gilmore leans forward. "Very good."
Laura: I would love for you to take a look at it, Shaun.
Matt: "I would love to have a look at it." He takes it. As you hand it to him, it actually curls around the back of his hands and whips back into a strong, tensile stance, and he-- "That's weird." He takes it and starts looking over it as Cassandra looks back. "I'm glad you're all safe, and apparently named. Welcome to Whitestone, Lady Vex'ahlia."
Laura: Thank you.
Matt: She takes it, folds it. "I'll have this put in the books immediately."
Taliesin: I appreciate your kind generosity.
Matt: "I will request more information soon."
Taliesin: We'll see, yes. That might be complicated, but yes.
Matt: "Anyway, have a seat. Asum, please, inform them of what you've been telling us." As you all find a seat, he sits there quietly, his eyes darting around in his head, ruminating over the thoughts and trying to formulate his presentation. He crosses his fingers in front of his face. "Things are a bit of a mess within the city. None are allowed to leave. Living under the watch of the wyvern guard, hundreds of lizardmen worshipers of Thordak have been watching the city from above. Some have tried to flee beyond the walls, but ultimately end up being returned at the end of a set of talons and not seen again. Thordak calls a gathering every dusk of the surviving populace. Tens of thousands forced to come and gather at the center of the remnants of the Cloudtop District. He gloats, instills fear in all that behold this, and offers forgiveness to those who offer fealty to him. All are to cheer his name, applaud his statements, and thank him for his mercy. Those that fail to do so are pulled from the crowd by his lizardmen and devoured by the beast himself, lined up to the slaughter as a show. And there is laughter from the beast that pushed them into his maw. Most of the wealth of the city is now amassed in the ashes of the district, forming a massive wall of shiny chunk and coin, like a nest around the fucking beast. He's enslaved a number of the greatest sculptors of the city to begin making his likeness in the surrounding stone. They chisel away at the tall, proud walls of the interior, showing his terrible face where it does not belong. A vain fucker. He's crazy, that one. What's more dangerous than an intelligent dragon than one who's crazy? I've been keeping an eye as best as I can. Thordak gives direct orders to his wyvern guard often, some off to communicate, I presume, with the other members of the Conclave; I know not. I've been stuck within the city. Most survivors stay indoors. I've been working with the Clasp, believe it or not, to shepherd over a thousand people below the city streets for protection. The lesser of two evils, to be sure, but at the very least, at the moment they have nothing to gain by working against us at this juncture. Naught but six hours ago, the Cinder King was roaring in anger, his cries echoing through the streets. The people fell to their knees, thinking this was the end. Stepped up from his volcanic throne, and sent the majority of his army eastward. I used this distraction to slip into the now-unguarded Lyceum, find a port scroll and a sigil for Whitestone before they returned. Came here to see all of you alive, so that's the best news I've had in weeks. That's the best I have to bring you about the current state of the city."
Marisha: That's our home.
Matt: "That's our home."
Taliesin: What is eastward?
Matt: "Kymal. Westruun. Technically, here."
Laura: Did you bring any other survivors with you?
Matt: "I was the only one who could make it into the Lyceum unseen. Tofor is still back there, fighting the good fight. She's working with Shenn. They're trying to get as many below ground as possible, and out of harm's way."
Liam: And Greyskull Keep?
Matt: "I haven't seen it. I've been within the city walls."
Laura: Did you say Thordak's wife? Did I mishear you?
Sam: Wyvern guard.
Marisha: Wyvern. I heard wife.
Laura: Wife and guards is what I heard, and I was so fucking confused.
Matt: Sorry.
Marisha: Wait, his wyvern guard is often...?
Matt: He sent a majority.
Marisha: Oh, that's still me manufacturing shit. Okay.
Taliesin: We don't know where they've been sent. We don't know why.
Sam: Eastward.
Matt: "That's all I've seen."
Taliesin: We need to find out where they're going.
Matt: "I had to use that time to get to the Lyceum. Usually it's too heavily guarded."
Taliesin: No, of course. Just making a list.
Laura: You've done so much.
Matt: "I've done so little. There's more to be done. But the more time that passes, whatever it is they're planning, I'm sure is getting closer to fruition."
Marisha: Do we have any known whereabouts on the white or the green dragon?
Matt: He looks over and Gilmore steps forward, sets the bow down, and says, "First and foremost, this is a glorious piece. I could only hope to eventually create something of its majesty." He hands it over. "A bit creepy in ways, but I think you'll make good use of it. Once we complete the barrier and put quite a bit of concentration each day into maintaining it, of which Pike has been of great aid to me, between the arcane and divine magics, I think we found a fine balance. Hopefully. But anyway, I've been putting the rest of my energies towards trying to procure this information. The green, Raishan, as I believe you've told me, eludes my watch, my gaze. There is a lot of protection around that one. I get the sense that of those in the Conclave, she is probably the most trained in my arts."
Laura: She's the one that released Thordak, so that wouldn't surprise me.
Marisha: She's on my shit list.
Matt: "I think she's on a lot of people's shit lists. Mine as well. The white, however. I know not its name, but I was able to look towards it. I was able to find it sitting amongst a large pile of rock and rubble. Looks like a fallen city, crumbled and destroyed. From what I saw, there were smoldering ruins, toppled landscapes of buildings and temples, arcane crystals crashed and cracked, deep inside a ravine. There, the white dragon perched, setting up this slow-rolling winter amongst a shivering horde of dragonborn."
Travis: Oh, shit.
Marisha: What did he just say? What?
Liam: Shivering horde of dragonborn.
Travis: Amongst a horde of dragonborn.
Laura: Draconia?
Matt: "What remains of it."
Liam: Fuck.
Matt: "That was days ago."
Taliesin: That's a card we no longer have.
Matt: "I need to be careful when doing this."
Liam: The city was razed?
Matt: "From what I could see, yes."
Travis: Did you see any motion? Any slaves?
Matt: "Oh, yes. There were many survivors, but they were not in the best of states."
Travis: This white dragon, does he bring weather, or any sort of change? It's all ice and snow, yeah?
Matt: "The very essence of each ancient wyrm, if you will, carries with it its own element. It slowly transforms the landscape around where it takes up its new den. If it seems to sit atop the remains of the once-proud Draconia, then it now falls under the icy grasp of the beast."
Liam: And the will of the people there?
Matt: "I could not look that deep. My apologies."
Marisha: Is this just with a simple Scrying spell? Okay.
Taliesin: We must be careful. We cannot let Whitestone be discovered.
Marisha: Yes, and as we've learned before, Scrying can alert your position.
Matt: At this point in time, you guys hear heavy footsteps heading up from the lower floor of the castle. You hear two voices shout out, "Lady Cassandra! Lady Cassandra!" They enter the room real fast. You see one man, probably in his mid-20s or so, sweat pouring down his face, his eyes wide. "My lady." At that point you hear, echoing outside of the castle, this loud, piercing, shrieking roar.
Marisha: Oh my god.
Matt: (roar)
Laura: Shit balls motherfucker.
Matt: It's distant, but even at that distance, it is loud.
Laura: Gilmore, does the screen keep us hidden?
Matt: You look back, and even in his most damaged state, Gilmore had an essence of confidence, and this is a moment where you've never really seen him so pale. "We're about to find out, aren't we?"
Travis: I'm going outside.
Laura: I'm going outside, too.
Liam: I walk up to Shaun and slap my hand on his forearm and say, what about the bow? Is there anything you can tell us about the bow?
Matt: "In due time. Keep it at the ready."
Marisha: I turn to Cassandra. We need to get all of the citizens underground, immediately.
Taliesin: We can't fit everybody.
Matt: "We can certainly try." She turns to the guard. "Gather everyone we can. Gather--" And there's another roar from outside, this time louder still. "Go! Now!" Everyone starts rushing down the stairs to the outside of Whitestone Castle.
Marisha: I go out and I do a Skywrite in the sky again.
Laura: Wait! Skywrite?
Marisha: They already know we're here!
Laura: No, they don't! They don't necessarily.
Marisha: Making pictures in the clouds right above the city. It's fine.
Sam: Maybe not.
Laura: I wouldn't Skywrite anything right now, Keyleth. That screen could keep us hidden. He could be searching for us right now.
Marisha: And what about the citizens?
Sam: We'll find another way to alert them. Send out the dog. I don't know.
Matt: Are you guys exiting the castle now?
Laura: Yes.
Marisha: Do it by hand? We might not have that much time.
Matt: As you step out into the front open patio area, just outside of the castle's main gates, you look up and that faint blue shimmer that encases-- and you can now see it as a dome, and it comes down around, just directly around the city, closing at the very outskirts of the castle. You look in the distance as you see a few dark shapes growing larger and larger.
Marisha: They're coming this way!
Taliesin: Hold.
Matt: I need you to make a perception check, all of you.
Marisha: Fuck!
Travis: 17.
Sam: Nine.
Marisha: 26.
Taliesin: 23.
Liam: 26.
Laura: 16.
Matt: All right. Vax, Keyleth, and Percy. You guys glance off and you can see there are a number of shapes. It looks to be probably two, three dozen large winged entities flapping. You can't make out too much of the detail of their form, but you can definitely see some sort of aerial transport with large wings. At the forefront of them, you see one far larger than the rest. While you can't make out the details at this distance, the one thing you do catch is the bits of sunlight that peek through the clouds, hitting the side of its hide. A bright, piercing white color.
Travis: Fucking fucked.
Matt: You see it coasting at an angle around the outside of the city, making its way very quickly towards the outskirts of the town.
Marisha: It's Thordak's army. Asum said himself we're eastward. We're directly in its path.
Taliesin: Hold.
Marisha: Dragons have truesight. They already know we're here.
Sam: Maybe they can't get through this.
Marisha: Any second we wait longer, more people could die!
Laura: Send out the guards.
Matt: The guards are already running down, by the way, based on Cassandra's orders, and are making their way towards the city. You can already see people coming out of the streets and looking up, covering their ears. Some people are falling to their knees and crying.
Marisha: Percy.
Taliesin: Pick them up. Keep running until the moment they can't.
Liam: They know we're here. This is not a coincidence. They're not flying by. They know we're here. They know.
Matt: (whoosh) You now see the dragon and the flying horde have just come within a mile of the southern portion of the city.
Marisha: Percy!
Taliesin: Wait!
Liam: Do it.
Laura: No. Don't do it!
Liam: They're coming for us!
Taliesin: This is my home. Wait.
Travis: This is his home.
Marisha: Percy.
Taliesin: Keep moving.
Marisha: You have five seconds to come up with a better fucking plan, or I am doing it.
Taliesin: Spread out. Keep moving. Find a position.
Matt: Okay. What order are you guys rushing down in?
Liam: What are we looking at from our vantage point?
Matt: You guys are looking down at the wide, 60-foot earth path that leads down from the base of Castle Whitestone into the city itself.
Taliesin: If I'm towards the front, I'm moving everyone towards the house where we made the tunnel that goes underneath the Sun Tree.
Matt: All right, so we have Percy at the front.
Travis: I'll be right behind him.
Matt: Okay, Grog's right behind Percy.
Laura: I'll follow behind Grog.
Liam: We're up above, though? Or are we on ground level at this point?
Matt: You guys are now on ground level. You're above on the grade that leads down into the city itself.
Laura: I pull out the broom and I get on the broom.
Matt: Okay, so you're on the broom.
Marisha: It's clear they're not deviating the path.
Laura: It's not clear. We could just be in their way.
Travis: He said they're curving.
Matt: They're now curving around the outside of the western side of the valley.
Taliesin: What are you going to write? What are you going to write?
Marisha: I would throw up the De Rolo crest, just like before. It's a good alert sign.
Laura: People would just come out screaming. They won't know where to go.
Marisha: Then come up with a better damn plan.
Matt: (roar) Echoing through the valley. You watch as the entire crowd of these entities flies around the west side of the city, curves past. The shadow of the light of the sky, you can see the dark, heavy shadow of the dragon and the wyverns pass over the western side of the city. You can hear distant screams as people begin to freak out at this. It passes over the western side of the city, flying right towards the castle.
Marisha: Percy.
Matt: Arcs past the castle, over the forest, and the entire cluster slowly flaps down and lands at the southernmost beginning peak of the Alabaster Sierras, just north of the city. The dragon (crash noise) lands.
Taliesin: Alert everyone you see.
Marisha: They're scouting us.
Taliesin: Tell them to get underground. Tell them to be silent.
Laura: They don't see us, but they know we're nearby.
Travis: What direction are they looking?
Matt: Right now, they're looking in all directions, actually.
Laura: We need to get everybody underground while we can.
Liam: We have time. We have time.
Taliesin: Thank you. Find everyone. Tell them, silence. We still have the cavern we built underground. Start making it larger.
Marisha: Okay.
Travis: Shall we scatter? Spread the word?
Laura: Spread the word. Tell everyone to get underground.
Taliesin: Under the tree.
Marisha: I go to the cavern under the Sun Tree and I start casting Move Earth and I start clearing it as fast as I can.
Matt: Okay. It's going to take you a while, but you begin building this cavern.
Marisha: As fast as I can.
Taliesin: More people.
Sam: Where are we telling people to go?
Travis: We're scattering.
Taliesin: There's the inn that was broken. It's got an entrance. They either go there or they go underneath the castle.
Sam: That can hold 30, 40 people?
Taliesin: She's making it bigger.
Laura: Can we send people under the castle as well?
Sam: Okay, under the castle, yeah.
Matt: You guys all begin scattering, grabbing everyone you can. The guards are starting to gather people, and as you get the word out, people begin to quiet, holding their mouths. The guards are holding people silently. People begin ushering en masse up towards this giant exodus from the city, pouring like a funnel up this walkway to the base of Castle Whitestone. Keyleth, as you're down there, you're pressing. The dirt itself is slowly molding its way into this large cavern, pressing downward further and further and opening, further down and opening.
Marisha: Fallout cavern style. Big, lower, bigger, lower.
Matt: You get about three platforms down before the earth stops responding.
Marisha: What do you mean?
Travis: Fucking ziggurat!
Marisha: The fucking ziggurat!
Taliesin: Other way, other way!
Marisha: I go the other way!
Laura: Don't empty out the earth too much, or it won't support the city.
Marisha: Fallout style. Little pods.
Matt: All right. You start creating all these various things, and people start ushering in. It's getting to the point now where there's so many people. You hear crying children, families pressed in, you're feeling claustrophobic and the room's getting hotter and hotter the more bodies that are in there. You keep concentrating and pushing the earth out. You can feel the sweat beads pouring down your face, concentrating, concentrating. You hear the crying and sobbing, and people trying to comfort those that are freaking out. Every now and then you hear a distant echoing cry, a scream of a dragon in the distance, and everyone in the room tenses, and the sobbing gets even louder, then hushed again with whispering silence. You keep pushing and keep pushing, opening. You guys all begin to gather the rest as you watch, with that final cry, the dragon and the wyverns pick up (whoosh) and swoop towards the center of the valley, arcing to the west, and do a wide sweep of the mountain range. (flapping wings)
Laura: Where's Gilmore?
Matt: Gilmore has been bringing people en masse down to the castle. You haven't seen him for a number of-- probably 15, 20 minutes or so. The dragons coast around, and begin to disappear in the southeastern distance where they came from. You do, at this point, catch Gilmore, who has moved to the top of the castle and is currently, arms out, concentrating, pouring all the energy he can into that barrier.
Travis: Looks like the spell worked.
Liam: Good work. Good work.
Laura: Gilmore. Good job.
Matt: He eventually comes down from the top of the castle. He is-- eye sockets are sunken. You can see he's pouring with sweat. "I'm going to need a spa day. Because I'm done."
Laura: Where's Pike?
Matt: You guys find Pike. She, during this whole period, was over by the temple of Pelor that she was helping right and construct. Going over and finding out where she's been placed, you guys see that she's shepherded in a good 200 people into that temple, and has been keeping them divinely protected the whole time. As soon as you approach the outside, the people begin to slowly disperse back into the city. Pike walks out, looking out to the sky and locks eyes with you. "You're back!" Runs up and gives you a big hug. Jumps into your arms at this point. You catch her, and realize how heavy she is with the armor on, put her back down.
Laura: I drop her, because I'm fucking weak.
Matt: "Guys! Hi!"
Laura: You did an amazing job with that.
Matt: "That was mostly him. I've never done something like that before. That was-- everything okay in the Feywild? I'm sorry, I lost my connection. We had to finish this ritual."
Laura: No, it was fine.
Marisha: Hi, Pike. Sorry.
Matt: "Don't be. I'm glad you're all okay."
Sam: Do you remember the Feywild?
Matt: "Yeah. We were--"
Sam: Okay. Just making sure.
Laura: He doesn't remember, Pike.
Matt: "You don't remember?"
Travis: Yeah. Apparently, we went to the Feywild, and everybody remembers it but me and Percy.
Matt: "Why is that?"
Laura: I don't know.
Taliesin: It's funnier that way.
Marisha: Maybe you can look at his head later.
Laura: Maybe there's a way to cure it.
Travis: I'm just too smart.
Matt: She walks up and takes a look at you, walks up to Grog. Has a good look at the side of your head, knocks you in the temple a few times.
Travis: What do you see?
Matt: "There's nothing... physical. I'll try a restoration." She would have, let's see here.
Sam: Pike stats!
Taliesin: I was about to say, you have an Ashley app. That's so adorable.
Travis: Don't make me any dumber.
Laura: Grog, that's not possible.
Matt: Yeah, she's going to try Greater Restoration. Let me check something here real fast.
Sam: That was not fun.
Laura: No.
Marisha: Percy, are you sure it's okay for me to let these people out?
Taliesin: Of course it's not, but yes, definitely let them out. We'll have to make it more secure and safer.
Laura: I think it's gotten quite a bit away from us.
Matt: So Pike reaches up. The gauntlets begin to glow, and as she touches each side of your temples, your eyes close. As some of you watch this, Grog's eyes flash open, and where his pupils and the whites of his eyes were, you now see a flash of divine golden orange light. As it fades, you are slammed with a series of memories that were previously taken from you, and you recall every moment in the Feywild.
Travis: (surprised noises)
Sam: I'm sorry! I'm sorry, you didn't get to kill anything. I'm sorry.
Laura: No, he did! He still killed the big bad guy!
Sam: Oh, you did! You did, you killed the one thing. Okay, good.
Travis: I got petrified!
Laura: Yeah, well, stoned.
Travis: I tried diplomacy! Never again.
Sam: Lesson learned.
Travis: Holy shit.
Laura: Can you only do that one time a day?
Matt: "No, I can do it once more."
Sam: Maybe... well...
Travis: No, it's okay, yeah! Percy will remember the nude massage.
Matt: She walks up to Percy.
Liam: Think of what he's losing, though.
Taliesin: I'm not losing it.
Laura: Potentially.
Taliesin: No, because it doesn't matter. It's there anyway.
Sam: Actually, I don't know. I don't know.
Matt: Yeah, you have overlapping memories. So she reaches up and you bend down. She takes your glasses off. Hands them to Vex. Reaches up and touches the sides of your temple. "Now, concentrate." Close your eyes, and there's a burst of warmth towards the front of your lobe, almost like someone's dipping your head into hot water. And with that, there's a smattering of memories that are rushing into your mind. It takes you a moment. Your head swims, and you have to almost sit down. You almost stumble off your back foot as your brain now has to reorganize those lost moments. Seven days now immediately restored.
Taliesin: Seven days, ten minutes.
Sam: Greater Restoration kills Modify Memory.
Taliesin: Oh! But do I remember having the fake memory? Or do I not remember having a fake memory?
Matt: You would remember the spell being cast. You remember the fake memory, but you're aware that it's fake.
Sam: And that I did it?
Taliesin: Yes.
Matt: Oh yeah.
Sam: Fuck.
Liam: Just say thank you, Percival.
Matt: "Did it work?"
Taliesin: I give her a big hug. I'm so tired. I'm sorry. I'm going to sit down.
Laura: What?
Matt: "Glasses?"
Laura: Oh, but they're so fun to look through! All right.
Taliesin: They'll give you a headache.
Matt: She takes the glasses, and as you're resting, she takes your hand away from your head and puts them back on.
Marisha: I start slowly releasing people from the pods.
Taliesin: Thank you.
Matt: People begin to emerge, and where once there was this air of tension, fear, and desolate acceptance of the end, there's laughter. There's smiles, and even more tears as people begin to realize they have another day to live.
Laura: Can we tell the people as they come out, I know you'll want to celebrate, but please keep it as quiet as possible tonight. We don't know when it could be back.
Matt: There's a stillness and a slow understanding and nodding. While everyone takes in the information, one young woman, smeared dirt on her chin, dried tears on her cheek, steps forward and goes, "Thank you. Thank you." And everyone else starts saying, "Thank you. Thank you. Thank you." This sea of thank-yous begins to spread through the crowd immediately in your vicinity.
Sam: Don't thank us. Thank Shaun Gilmore.
Laura: Gilmore and Pike. Allura.
Matt: They all quietly go back to their silence and begin to slowly disperse themselves throughout the city where they were before this incursion happened.
Marisha: I go up to Percy.
Travis: I forgot that Shaun was Gilmore's first name.
Laura: He was like, who's Shaun?
Sam: Intelligence of six.
Liam: So fucking method. Method, man.
Matt: Keyleth.
Marisha: I hope you know that I would never--
Taliesin: Shut up. Thank you.
Sam: I hope you know that I was only trying to improve your life with a wonderful happy memory, and it was mostly true.
Taliesin: I know where you sleep. People work for me.
Matt: Asum has caught up to you now as you guys are walking back to the city. You can see him. He's still, eyes to the sky, not truly trusting this quiet. He goes, "It seems we don't have any time to lose. What resources do you have to fight back? What have you learned? Please tell me you have better news than I have."
Travis: Well, we've got a few of these Vestiges, so we're a little powered up. But we're not quite sure what their full abilities are. It's significant, but we think they do more, we're just not sure how much.
Matt: "What more do you need?"
Laura: Can I fly up in the air while this conversation's going on?
Matt: Sure.
Sam: Don't go too high.
Laura: Not too high.
Sam: We don't know where the thing is.
Laura: No, I know, I want to go to the very top where I see the shimmer.
Matt: Yeah and it's a squat shimmer, not a full dome and it's like a very extended type dome.
Laura: Okay. But it's high enough, that I mean it's higher than the castle.
Matt: It's high enough where you can get about 80 feet up and you start to see enough detail in the shimmer where you're like, "Okay, I'm getting close."
Laura: Okay. The direction that the dragons went. Is this stupid? Can I shoot my Oracle Arrow in that direction?
Sam: No. Absolutely not.
Laura: Why?
Sam: (high-pitched) Why would you bring attention to us?!
Laura: It's an arrow!
Liam: They're long gone.
Matt: They are gone. The time has passed. They're miles and miles and miles and miles and miles at the speed they were travelling. You're a good shot, but I don't know if you could arc an arrow that far.
Laura: Oh well, I guess that's true. I thought it was a ten-minute, because it's Fenthras I thought it was a long-ass arrow.
Travis: Can't you tell what direction the dragons were heading?
Laura: Oh! Wait, okay, so the Oracle Arrow, is it like you fire it, and then it shoots somewhere and it sticks there and I can see through it for ten minutes?
Matt: Correct. Or see through it as it's fired, the minute it leaves the bow you can project your sight through the arrow for up to 10 minutes.
Sam: It can't fly for infinity?
Matt: No. It still arcs like a regular arrow.
Laura: That makes sense. I foresaw it just going, because I thought it was like a special kind of arrow.
Liam: It's really good for people without flying brooms.
Laura: Right. Cool. Then I'm not going to use it. Because now I understand how it works. I've learned something.
Taliesin: What direction were the wyverns travelling, were they travelling back? Or were they travelling along--
Matt: They were heading southeast.
Travis: So not back, they came from the west, right?
Matt: They swooped in from the west, from that side.
Taliesin: But they originated in the west, and they are currently travelling southeast?
Matt: Correct. However, it was Vorugal, it was the white dragon, which from what Gilmore is saying has been roosting over at the top of the ruins of Draconia.
Taliesin: Which is to the east.
Sam: So this was not the group that had set off from Emon.
Travis: To the west.
Taliesin: No it's-- Draconia is to the southeast. Why do I know that?
Sam: Here, here's the map. We're up here. This is the group that was coming from Emon. These guys came from somewhere over here? Where's Draconia?
Laura: Can I cast Primeval Awareness and see if it's within six miles of us right now, still? Or if it's farther away from that.
Marisha: I thought that Draconia's on a whole another continent.
Taliesin: Yeah, it is. It's over here.
Matt: It's over on Wildemount.
Laura: I want to see if they're just camping out around us or if they're going away.
Taliesin: Are they going back?
Matt: Using for dragons, I assume, right?
Laura: Yes. It's my favored enemy.
Matt: Yeah. I would say as part of your Primeval Awareness--
Sam: If this is the United States, we're in Maine. Emon is LA.
Matt: Yeah. Sensing at this point, with the day of travel and everything, you have no sense of dragons in that direction or anything.
Laura: Okay. They're further than six miles away.
Matt: Yeah, there are minor essences in the northern area, but nothing beyond what you've already sensed in the Alabaster Sierras. Nothing on the level of strength that the draw of an ancient dragon would bring on your radar.
Laura: Okay.
Travis: To answer your previous question, there are four Vestiges left.
Taliesin: That we know of.
Liam: There's a dagger, there's a cloak. Armor. There's a staff.
Sam: Wait, there's other objects that we haven't--
Matt: "All right."
Marisha: Four left. Because we have Whisper, right?
Laura: No, no, we don't have Whisper.
Marisha: So there's five.
Matt: "Do we have any other allies, friends, people who are sworn to aid us and--?"
Travis: Ooh! Yeah, yeah! Your parents.
Marisha: Yeah.
Taliesin: That's right.
Laura: Technically, the elves of Syngorn are building an army. However, who knows if they'll actually come through.
Taliesin: The werewolves could be called upon.
Matt: "I think they would understand it would do them well to help what is a threat to all of us."
Taliesin: You would think.
Sam: One werewolf has vowed allegiance to us.
Laura: In the Feywild.
Travis: In another plane of existence, which I don't know if that's a problem.
Matt: "Not going to count on that one."
Taliesin: It's not as ridiculous as you think.
Sam: Yes. Your former pals.
Taliesin: Whatever remnants of Draconia perhaps?
Matt: "Wait. So the last time we saw the main portion, the bulk of Emon's army from Fort Daxio was sent to Syngorn before this attack happened?"
Marisha: Yes.
Matt: "Do we have any knowledge on their whereabouts?"
Marisha: A lot are there.
Matt: "They're there?"
Marisha: A lot of-- at least all of our guards from Emon are in Syngorn, right?
Laura: No. Our guards aren't in Syngorn.
Marisha: Not our personal guards, but Emon's guards.
Laura: No.
Matt: You did see quite a few soldiers from Emon there.
Laura: Oh we did?
Sam: Yes.
Laura: I was distracted.
Matt: That's okay. You did have a lot to think about with your dad.
Taliesin: They would not answer our call but if someone has relations with the Clasp, they are always an option for manpower.
Matt: "Well, I have been dealing with them and definitely-- they're not much of an army, but they're definitely good at acquiring information and I currently have a few of them trying to find out as much as they can about Thordak."
Marisha: There's also the Ashari druids, who will definitely want to help our cause.
Taliesin: This is very true.
Matt: "That is good to know. Well, any more that come your way or any possibilities you have to bring more to our cause, please, do so."
Sam: There's a candle-maker who might help out. I would put him in the strong maybe category as well.
Taliesin: Don't mention that Vex flies.
Matt: "Good, well keep tabs on those you've found and any possibilities of others, especially those who have... I don't know, more of these Vestiges that you speak of, or armies at their disposal. Big weapons, anything. I'll take anything at this point really."
Taliesin: There are options but we need to discuss what happened today. This changes some things.
Travis: Yeah, we need more offence, less defense. I don't know if that will work a second time.
Taliesin: You're mad. We need defense. This is not a site of a victory, this is a site of our end. We need bunkers.
Laura: Yeah. We need to move everybody underground the same way we did in Emon.
Marisha: I can spend more time fleshing out and reinforcing the bunkers to make them--
Taliesin: I'll discuss a warning system to get people underground.
Sam: But when the dragon came here just now, they saw nothing, correct?
Taliesin: We hope.
Sam: Is there a way that we can spread false rumors that the city of Whitestone has been magically moved to another plane or something?
Laura: That's wonderful. That's smart.
Sam: Some way of getting that word to Draconia or I don't--
Taliesin: Putting the word out that we're other places than we are. Putting the sound--
Matt: Asum thinks to himself and goes--
Liam: Can't we drop it into the Clasp's pipeline?
Matt: "I can do that. Definitely. We can find a way to get that information. There are a number who have sworn allegiance to Thordak and, you know. Some folks who don't see honor but the necessity to stay alive override any sort of previous friendships."
Travis: Best not to mention our name. I don't think we're cool with the Clasp after our last meeting.
Laura: Yeah, they don't like us.
Matt: "Good to know. I'll look about planting that information. I'll do the best I can in that regard. I've been told that you've already felled another of the Conclave, is that correct?"
Travis: Yes.
Laura: That's true. Umbrasyl. Dead and gone.
Matt: "That will certainly stir some attention from them."
Laura: Yeah, and if not that, then the message left in there.
Taliesin: They know we did it.
Travis: Strange that he had all those wyverns with him, though. Umbrasyl had none. He was by himself.
Liam: They don't like each other, though, this is some sort of loose partnership.
Travis: Yeah, but didn't they say the white one was more savage. More emotional?
Laura: The white one was more vain.
Marisha: Yeah, the black one, Umbrasyl is the one that's--
Sam: Oh you're right, the white one is a hunter, it's primal. Hates others. You're right.
Taliesin: Maybe the army's going to head to-- no, we could be so lucky if it was on its way to attack it.
Marisha: Black ones like torture, right?
Laura: Yeah, they like to make people suffer.
Taliesin: I feel like there should be trading cards.
Sam: So the white one's like Predator?
Laura: Shut up! There's notes somewhere in here!
Matt: "Just be warned  fell one dragon, that might make them nervous. Fell another and that's almost certain to bring retaliation."
Taliesin: We were hoping to distract them.
Matt: "Well, the next wyrm you decide to fell will probably be the start of this war."
Travis: Can we ask, why would it bring retaliation? How would they know it was us?
Taliesin: We did sign the card.
Marisha: We left our names.
Laura: Maybe the next one we can sign as somebody else.
Travis: What if we don't sign it?
Liam: Even if we don't, they probably are going to get much more vindictive overall.
Marisha: And just as much as we can scry on them, they can scry on us. I'm sure they've been watching us.
Taliesin: I don't think they know where we are. I think they know when we travel, I just don't think they know where we are.
Matt: "Have any of the living ones seen you?"
Laura: Have any what?
Matt: "Have any of the living ones seen you and know you for who you are?"
Travis: When we killed the first one, there were a bunch of jewels in the wall and we saw a bunch of eyeballs.
Taliesin: He did not know our name, but he has seen us.
Laura: Raishan saw us, the white one saw us, all of them saw us.
Matt: "Then it is very possible."
Sam: Wait a second, you just said no one knew we were here, none of them knew we were here.
Taliesin: Here.
Sam: They just attacked here. And we just got back here.
Laura: Gilmore was scrying on them. It took three days for him to get here. That's how he knew.
Sam: Because Gilmore was scrying on them. Got it. Not because we have a leak.
Taliesin: We probably do. We should assume we have a leak.
Sam: I'm going to blame Shaun.
Taliesin: Is he Shaun now?
Matt: "You're more than welcome to."
Sam: Sorry! (chuckles)
Matt: He's sitting down, wiping his brow with this really fine scarf.
Marisha: Judging based on what happened in Emon, we know that they have an insider, we just don't know who yet.
Sam: They do? We know this?
Taliesin: I would assume that there's nothing we say that they don't know at this point.
Laura: They struck during a political--
Marisha: During a council meeting.
Laura: Somebody has to be telling them things.
Marisha: Someone probably very high up.
Laura: It could be Raishan taking the form of a human again, for all we know.
Sam: Who was there and lived? Besides us?
Matt: Jarett catches up, by the way. (panting) "Is everyone all right?"
Laura: Yes. How are the citizens? Did you get everyone in there?
Matt: "Everyone seems to be safe and accounted for. There was a lot of fear, of course, but elation, whatever you did." And he looks at you and looks at Shaun. "Whatever you did, keep doing it, please."
Travis: I insight check Jarett.
Matt: Make an insight check.
Travis: Seven.
Matt: It's hard to read that fella. Slippery.
Liam: Can I do an insight check on Asum?
Matt: You may.
Laura: What are you doing?
Sam: Ooh, that was a Luck.
Liam: First one was good anyway.
Laura: Oh, you're just hoping? First one was really good.
Liam: Damn. I can choose whichever one I want. 21.
Matt: 21.
Laura: About Jarett?! You're insighting Jarett?
Sam: Seeker Asum.
Taliesin: Perhaps we should not have... assumed.
Marisha: Hey, Travis! How is it you're on this side of the table?
Travis: Well I was looking for a Loot Crate. Have you guys seen any Loot Crates?
Sam: Oh! Well I've got some of the great swag that you can get in a Loot Crate. Why this shirt came in one last week.
Travis: That's incredible! How do I get one of those?
Sam: You go to LootCrate.com/CriticalRole to see your selection and then if you sign up, you get three dollars off the first month, which is a really good deal!
Taliesin: Ironically when we played the game at home this is exactly what we'd do.
Matt: Totally.
Liam: Sam who are you talking to? You're facing a potted plant.
Sam: I'm talking to Seeker Asum! He's a big fanboy.
Matt: Gilmore stands up and catches the edge of Vax's shoulder.
Liam: Hey.
Matt: "All right, so, what's your plan? What's the next order of business?"
Laura: Get you a drink, I think.
Matt: "A drink would be great."
Taliesin: I think we talk and drink.
Laura: Yes. We need to talk about barricading underground. Making it more secure.
Matt: "Come. I can definitely use that right now." You guys are led into the nearest open-- it looks to be an unused tavern, but there are drinks, ale and things that are at the ready. There isn't much commerce currently happening in the city, since right now everything's in survival mode, so there's no exchange of money, you guys are presented with drinks. The lanterns are lit on the inside from other villagers that are just happy to help. And the central table is set where you all sit around and quietly have a few sips.
Liam: While everyone's sitting, can I just pull him over to a corner for a second?
Matt: Yeah.
Liam: How are you doing, personally?
Matt: "Me?"
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: "Wondrous! I'm doing great! (chuckles) I'm exhausted."
Liam: Shaun, I--
Matt: "I'll be fine."
Liam: You sure?
Matt: "Yes, I'm fine."
Liam: All right.
Matt: "It's been a long time since I put my energy and talents towards anything beyond making shiny things. Feels nice to be helping others."
Liam: Well, I feel we're seeing your true talents.
Matt: "I'm at my wits' end with these. Do you want to see true talents? You should ask Allura to show you what she's capable of when she gets back."
Liam: She is pretty nifty.
Matt: (sighs heavily)
Liam: Well, come on, come and have a drink.
Matt: And he like leans on you a bit and you both make it back to the table. The rest of you--
Sam: This booze is okay, but Grog, I could really use the finest wine I've ever had.
Travis: Oh shit, hold on.
Laura: We've got some fancy-ass bottles.
Travis: I reach into the bag of holding and I grab five expensive-ass bottles of wine.
Liam: Holla!
Marisha: Scanlan and I will share one.
Sam: Good idea.
Laura: Just one bottle between the two of you?
Sam: We don't weigh very much.
Marisha: No.
Taliesin: I'm involved in this. This is exciting.
Matt: You guys scatter the wine amongst your glasses. Drinks are had as you begin to discuss the plan.
Taliesin: Pour one for the landlord as well. He's letting us drink our wine in his room.
Matt: Asum leans in. "All right. So. Vestiges. Defenses. Allies, what's the next plan? What's the next--"
Travis: Well, I've a question. If I were to call somewhere a City of Brass, where would you think that would be?
Matt: Asum goes, "There are cities that use brass in parts of construction in Wildemount, that's as far--" Gilmore leans forward and goes, "No, that's in the Elemental Plane of Fire. That's a dangerous, terrible place that you should never go."
Travis: We were already there once, actually.
Taliesin: Terrible dangerous places you should never go are practically our middle name.
Laura: We saw Thordak there, actually.
Matt: "Oh! Even more of a reason not to go!"
Marisha: Well, he's here now, so Fire Plane's probably safer!
Taliesin: She's got a very fair point.
Laura: Why do you ask, Grog?
Travis: Well, look, the Plate of the Dawnmartyr is in a City of Brass, but I don't know where that is.
Laura: I bet that sounds something Pike would like.
Travis: Draconia is in Wildemount?
Matt: "Draconia is in Wildemount, yes."
Travis: Right. And so is the big white fuck, right?
Taliesin: Yes. Are any of the Vestiges in Wildemount?
Travis: The City of Brass?
Matt: "Whereabouts are the Vestiges?"
Liam: One at the bottom of the sea.
Laura: One is in Marquet?
Marisha: The City of Brass is in the Plane of Fire. We've covered that.
Sam: It's not in Draconia? It's in the Plane of Fire?
Marisha: The city is in the Plane of Fire.
Sam: Correct. Where's Ank'Harel?
Marisha: Ank'Harel is on the continent of-- what's it's called?
Matt: Gilmore chuckles to himself, "Ank'Harel. It's been awhile." And looks at--
Marisha: What's the continent? I suddenly blanked on it. You just said it.
Matt: Marquet.
Marisha: Marquet. It's on the continent of Marquet.
Matt: Ank'Harel is also where Jarett is from, which is where you first heard. Gilmore smiles. "It's where I grew up, or nearabouts, at least."
Sam: Where you grew up, Gilmore?
Matt: "Well, not in the city, a little ways out a bit."
Sam: You're Marquatian?
Matt: "Originally, yes, but I've been living here most of my life. Soon as I had the opportunity to leave-- It's a free plane here in Tal'Dorei and all the shops I can muster... until they all got destroyed."
Laura: Good times.
Matt: "It's fine. I'd made the bottom floors too small anyway. More space. Next time."
Liam: You ever want to revisit home?
Matt: "Maybe. Nah. I need to stay here and maintain this."
Laura: Yes you do. If you don't mind.
Sam: What about the endless maze of the Abyss? That's another place that we're supposed to go.
Marisha: Also another plane of existence.
Matt: "I don't know much about the Abyss, but I know that it's probably the worst place ever."
Laura: Abyssal. That's where demons come from.
Travis: Worse than the Fire Plane?
Matt: "That's correct."
Laura: That's the thing that killed Pike.
Travis: Wait, isn't that where the rakshasa's going to be?
Marisha: That's in the Nine Hells.
Liam: He's a devil.
Taliesin: Ironically is somewhere else entirely.
Liam: And I think we can table Meowmix for a little bit. Somebody told us it takes a while.
Laura: Months and months.
Marisha: Months but we also don't want to wait until--
Liam: Not forever.
Travis: Who's got a map?
Sam: I've got a map.
Travis: Where's the Ozmit Sea?
Taliesin: Before we even think of this, we should see what we're-- I don't think we're going to collect all of the Vestiges. We should see what other Vestiges we think are going to be helpful.
Sam: It's like the Pacific Ocean.
Travis: Which direction is it? Towards Draconia?
Sam: No. Draconia's across the Atlantic Ocean in France.
Marisha: But the Ozmit Sea is where the Water Ashari reside. And I have to go there anyway. It's also where Pike is very familiar. I'm pretty sure that's the sea that she sailed?
Liam: And the Vestige there is the staff?
Laura: Whisper, right?
Sam: Whisper, the blade.
Marisha: Whisper, the blade.
Travis: Well, look, hey, so I have an idea, right. Someone mentioned that the white dragon is very vain and very savage. He's got like all those wyverns around him. That's a little bit of a bitch for us. We're usually good one dragon on all of us. You got a whole gang, worse for us. So what about if we played to his vanity, and maybe sent him knocking on one of his Conclave brother's doors. Maybe start a little beef that maybe's not there.
Sam: How do we do that?
Travis: I don't know, the idea just popped up. I'm looking for your help and shit.
Liam: He's a big picture man. Here's the detail fellow.
Travis: You know how tired I am right now?
Laura: We're so tired.
Taliesin: I think that we've been thinking about this the wrong way. I think that we've been treating this as a battle. And we have to start treating this like a war, which is a very different creature.
Sam: Are we guerrillas?
Taliesin: We are absolutely not.
Liam: Beret.
Travis: Wolverines!
Taliesin: We need to reinforce this city not as a final stand, but as a place where there might be survivors. Because if they come here, there's no battle to be fought. It's just a loss.
Laura: We need to take it--
Marisha: Elsewhere.
Matt: At this point Jarett steps out from back of the room and says, "The more time that goes by, the more chance there is that the battle, the war, will be fought here. On our turf. The faster we move, the better chance we have of bringing it to theirs, so let us not dilly-dally."
Marisha: You mentioned about having our own mole at one point. Our own inside man.
Travis: Yeah. Scanlan.
Sam: I'm not going to volunteer myself as a slave to the dragon.
Travis: Keep thinking about it.
Liam: You are a sexy dinosaur.
Sam: I'm considering it.
Travis: You'll be the Hercules Mulligan of Vox Machina.
All: Hercules Mulligan!
Taliesin: I would like to talk to some of the magic users about installing some sort of-- or perhaps helping me install a non-magical dragon raid signal so that the population knows to be quiet, and knows to quietly go underground. In the event of the next fly-by.
Matt: They all look at each other and Gilmore nods. "That's actually, I wouldn't say rudimentary, but it's definitely within my skill set."
Taliesin: Would triggering it possibly alert them to our existence? Does it make holding up the shield--
Matt: "Not if I can maintain it underneath the barrier."
Sam: Does the barrier block sound and visuals?
Matt: "It should."
Sam: And is there any way that we can help you make this barrier more permanent and stronger?
Matt: "I don't know. This was crafted for this reason. This isn't a long standing existing incantation. This was crafted through the minds of Drake Thunderbrand and Allura and myself and Pike's aid. This is a new magic, it's experimental, and to be perfectly honest, I'm very glad it succeeded because I was--"
Laura: Just guessing?
Matt: "Essentially."
Liam: Also, Gilmore, as a sidebar, what about that black ball beneath the city? Has anything been learned of it?
Matt: "We've been a bit distracted."
Liam: That's what I thought.
Taliesin: I would like to put it to use.
Laura: Wait, what?
Taliesin: We're at war.
Laura: We can't move it.
Taliesin: We're not going to move it.
Sam: We're going inside it.
Taliesin: I want to put the private council table in the room with it.
Sam: In the room where it happens?
Laura: So they can't scry into the room, it cancels all magic.
Taliesin: So no glamor will survive, no magic will survive, no trick can be allowed.
Matt: "I love your mind, Percy. Have I told you that? I love your mind. I love it."
Taliesin: That's probably a bad sign, but thank you.
Matt: "We'll do that immediately. It sounds like a grand plan." Asum says, "Not a worry. We'll do that immediately."
Sam: We'll just have to Seeker Asum that it happened? (laughter)
Taliesin: We should move quickly. We should pick a couple of Vestiges and move quickly, collect them. Start finding more allies, move quickly. But we should not dally too long.
Marisha: And I agree, we might not be able to wait to get them all before we start taking on dragons. We might want to do both.
Matt: Jarett says, "If you're looking to go to the Ozmit Sea, you'll probably need a ship of some kind. It's quite a far travel and that distance as well and the docks on the west coast right now are, well they're locked down at Emon."
Taliesin: Could Cabal's Ruin--
Laura: How long is the travel to Marquet?
Matt: "Travel by boat, across the Ozmit, maybe about a week, a week and a half. Skyship, maybe half as long."
Sam: Airship. Airship. Airship?!
Matt: Gilmore actually steps in and is like, "Technically, I have a teleportation sigil outside the city. I could probably just get you there."
Sam: Wait, to go to where? Marquet?
Liam: Walking is really good for the health though.
Marisha: And first level characters, which we are not.
Sam: Hold on. Before we decide that Marquet is the thing.
Taliesin: It's Cabal's Ruin, correct? We're going to search for Cabal's Ruin.
Travis: Are we at all just forgetting the fact that Draconia is lying in ruins?
Taliesin: We don't have time.
Laura: No, it's not about time. The dragon is sitting on top of Draconia.
Sam: So we know where to find him to kill him.
Laura: Unless we know how to take on that dragon, we can't save anyone.
Sam: wE've killed dragons before.
Taliesin: I will feel better with one or two more Vestiges in our pocket.
Liam: By the skin of our teeth, Scanlan. By the skin of its gut.
Taliesin: We got lucky.
Sam: I like Grog's idea. Is there a way to explore that any further?
Marisha: Pitting the dragons against each other?
Sam: Yes!
Taliesin: I think it's a great idea worth exploring.
Liam: Seeker Asum is on it. He said that he was going to--
Sam: Seeker Asum is great, but we're the best in the business. I wouldn't leave our plan A to someone not us.
Laura: Seeker Asum is telling people that this city has been magicked away.
Matt: Asum is also still at the table.
Marisha: Yeah, he's right there.
Taliesin: We're drunk, we will talk about you in third person as much as we want.
Laura: We're just reiterating the things that you told us you were going to say.
Matt: "That's all right."
Taliesin: We figured you would speak up if you had issue.
Laura: Plus it's really fun to say your name.
Matt: "Never heard it before, I assure you."
Travis: How far away is Draconia from here? Travel wise?
Matt: "Well, my usual travel to Wildemount is across the northern channel here. I'd say you're looking at about two weeks of travel by ship across the Lucidian Ocean."
Marisha: Or we can always teleport. I can Tree Stride. I can always Tree Stride.
Sam: Have you been to Draconia?
Marisha: I can scry and look at a tree.
Matt: Tree Stride is a short distance. You mean Transport via Plants.
Marisha: Whatever. They all sound the same. I can scry, look at a tree, and then we go through that tree.
Sam: If there's any trees left.
Laura: There's definitely at least--
Marisha: I'm hoping there's a tree on that continent.
Liam: Are we talking though about how scrying is a little dangerous right now?
Marisha: When you're scrying on dragon.
Laura: When you're scrying on a tree.
Marisha: Yeah, the tree doesn't know it's being spied on.
Travis: Doesn't Draconia have an army there? If there are any survivors, anyone we can bring back to Whitestone, shouldn't we be accumulating those people?
Taliesin: I think if there's a dragon sitting on top of them, removing people from him is--
Travis: We're sneaky, we're so sneaky!
Laura: Are we sneaky?
Travis: Yeah! Pike's not even here.
Laura: You have your memories of the Feywild, do you remember sloshing around in that black sludge? Very loudly?
Marisha: Do you remember us walking into the town center to kill Kevdak? That wasn't sneaky.
Travis: No, no that was personal.
Taliesin: Grog, I think you're thinking of a battle we can win, as opposed to a war we're losing.
Travis: Yeah, no, look I'm not trying to pick a fight with a dragon, I'm just going to make sure that dragonborn are there and we can help them.
Taliesin: We can help them by killing the dragon.
Liam: Yes.
Travis: Wow.
Taliesin: Vax is agreeing with me.
Matt: "Actually that's pretty sound. If you manage to defeat the dragon there, you'll probably gather the survivors and have them join the cause against Emon. If you have means of transporting them. Remember, once a dragon is down, it's--"
Laura: It's on.
Matt: "It's on."
Sam: Grog is the best thinker.
Marisha: Yeah. We pull the trigger on one, we pull the trigger on all of them.
Laura: I can't believe if we fight one that means we have to fight--
Travis: Well, listen. Again, I'm not trying to kill the white dragon.
Taliesin: What is the white dragon going to do--
Travis: I want him to go pick a fight with the other dragons.
Laura: How are we going to do that, though?
Liam: We're working on that as a side venture. What are we going to do there to make that happen?
Marisha: We can't really stroll up to it and be like--
Travis: You guys don't know how to pick a fight? You honestly can't brainstorm one way to pick a fight?
Marisha: We are very good at picking fights. It's getting the dragons to pick fights on others.
Sam: We can probably plan a ruse.
Laura: Oh, and how would you do it, Grog?
Travis: I would talk mad shit to the white dragon on behalf of the green dragon. I would rep the green dragon.
Laura: Oh my god, Grog, he will never see through that! That's brilliant.
Liam: You are really strong. That's the end of it, I have nothing else to say.
Travis: I'm just saying, I feel like an opportunity's being wasted here.
Taliesin: I think an opportunity's being tabled briefly.
Marisha: We've got to think about it.
Taliesin: I don't think this is nearly as time sensitive.
Travis: Fine. Someone else do the thinking.
Marisha: Breeding hostility between the two is something that could take weeks, which we don't have.
Taliesin: Well, we could start it. It's also something other people can do while we do other things.
Liam: Yes. Delegate.
Marisha: But how? It literally involves going to one dragon and saying: Hey, did you hear what that other dragon said about you? That's all I got.
Taliesin: Well, there are other ways to do it. In traditional warfare, you can do things like cause damage to the property of one dragon and leave scant evidence that the other dragon, or one of the dragon's people, was somehow responsible. Have a raiding, somehow get wyverns to raid near--
Marisha: Wait, hang on. That first thing you said.
Taliesin: Yes. It's the easiest level.
Marisha: I think I might have an idea. Okay, we know the white dragon is vain.
Laura: Right? We know that?
Matt: All dragons to an extent are vain. It's part of the nature of the chromatics.
Sam: White dragon loves the thrill of the hunt.
Matt: The white dragon is the most comparably primal. They're all in various stages of hyperintelligence. The white dragon is the one that's the most... beastlike.
Taliesin: If the white dragon is a hunter, the easiest way to incite damage is to sneak into the city and start mauling and killing Draconians that are left over, and just leaving bodies everywhere that he wasn't responsible for.
Marisha: What?!
Taliesin: That is the sort of decisions we're going to start having to make.
Laura: What if somebody can Polymorph into a little green dragon or something?
Marisha: Yeah, you went to 11 there on let's start continuing the genocide.
Laura: Fuck shit up as a dragon and leave evidence behind as a green dragon.
Sam: I've seen the green dragon. Raishan?
Matt: You have seen the dragon.
Sam: How big?
Matt: Gargantuan. And you cannot Polymorph into dragons. You can only transform into beasts.
Sam: I understand.
Matt: Fairly large, yeah. I'd say probably-- Raishan is the smallest of the dragons you saw, but even at the smallest of them, is still a good 30 feet to the shoulder.
Sam: I could do that.
Liam: Gather all the papier-mâché you have in the city.
Sam: I could do something pretty close to that.
Travis: I bet you could do a lot of incredible things.
Sam: Are you Tony Robbins? (laughter)
Taliesin: I think this is a conversation that can continue through Marquet. I don't think we're going to come up with the best idea tonight.
Marisha: But we need to get something started. Here's what we learned.
Sam: At dawn.
Marisha: At dawn we drink some more. We learned that Thordak is enslaving sculptors to build his image all around Emon. What we have learned is it seems that each of the dragons have picked a city, a domain. Maybe this domain was part of the bargain to join Thordak's cause. Help me, you get your own city.
Taliesin: A reasonable and astute observation, yes.
Marisha: So I bet the white dragon would be real pissed off if statues of Thordak started popping up around Draconia.
Laura: Or the green dragon.
Marisha: Or the green dragon.
Travis: Or maybe even statues where Umbrasyl's nest was.
Taliesin: Let's pick a dragon.
Laura: Vorugal is the white dragon?
Sam: Raishan is the green. Here's the problem with goading Vorugal the white to find and kill Raishan the green. No one knows where Raishan the green is, including Vorugal.
Laura: How do you know Vorugal doesn't know?
Sam: Because Raishan's the shapeshifter, and no one knows where she is, including Gilmore, who's been scrying for a week to try to find her.
Laura: Yeah, but the white dragon might have some way to communicate.
Travis: Do we know how they communicate?
Liam: Yes, we do. There were some baubles in a wall in Krieg's secret cave.
Laura: They have other balls, right?
Travis: Gilmore, Asum, do either of you have a theory on how they communicate?
Matt: Gilmore looks to Asum. "I have not been to any of their bases. Asum, you've been watching Thordak." He looks back. "Within his domain in the Cloudtop, he has... apparently an overhead airplane."
Laura: It's very loud.
Matt: Trust me, it was strange. "He has a number of various spies that are sworn to him that act as his network of information to and from the Cloudtop and his throne of black glass and molten rock. He does have singular pillars placed around that contain four orbs that he would speak into on occasion."
Marisha: And didn't we see something similar in Umbrasyl's and when we killed the blue?
Laura: We saw orbs in Umbrasyl's?
Marisha: Yeah, remember, it cracked and it was like, I'm coming for you! And we were like, we don't know what that means! And we ignored it.
Laura: That was in Brimscythe's.
Liam: Did we see that in the black?
Travis: They were broken already.
Matt: Yeah. They were already shattered.
Laura: He shattered them. Fuck.
Sam: Why did he shatter them?
Laura: So that we wouldn't be able to scry on anyone else. Or he was pissed!
Sam: He was pissed at the other dragons, maybe.
Liam: But it's not safe to assume-- Asum, sorry-- that they're not in communication. We have to assume that they are. I'm so sorry.
Matt: "It's all right. It's not like my childhood friend Purvon." (laughter)
Taliesin: There is a thought. This is a very good idea. You've got a very good idea.
Sam: What's the idea?
Marisha: I said we start planting statues of Thordak or Raishan in other dragons' territories. Ultimately, though, what we need is we need someone who knows the dragons' weaknesses. We need to know what pushes their buttons.
Sam: We know what pushes their buttons.
Taliesin: We need to know what pushes the reset button. Why am I speaking in video game metaphor?
Liam: What?
Taliesin: Nothing. Drink.
Sam: We can throw up some statues and cause some havoc, but if they have these orbs that communicate with each other, then the white can call Thordak and say: Hey, what's up with these statues? And Thordak can say: No, it's not me.
Taliesin: Not statues. Idols. Small images of the white dragon for worship.
Liam: You're gambling on jealousy.
Taliesin: Start hiding them in places. If we start seeding them, especially in Emon, as if he is trying to get people to worship him in other cities as well, silently, quietly underneath--
Sam: We'll make t-shirts that say Team Vorugal.
Taliesin: We just have to make sure that we don't use the stone from here.
Marisha: Well, because we know that Thordak is definitely vain.
Taliesin: And this will piss him off. And if he says what are you doing, I don't know anything about this.
Laura: Yeah, he would deny it. Of course he would deny it.
Marisha: And we're assuming-- sorry-- that they'll ask instead of jumping to conclusions.
Taliesin: I like it.
Laura: Even if he jumps to conclusions, he would be pissed.
Sam: But we know that Thordak is a total asshole-- Sorry. (laughter)
Sam: So we know he'll be pissed off, more or less.
Matt: His scarred eye twitches for a moment.
Marisha: And we wonder why people hate us.
Matt: Asum leans into the conversation and goes, "We have many crafters and artisans that are within the grasp of the Clasp as well, within Emon. We can begin to have these made and scattered throughout the various offerings brought to the center of the city."
Taliesin: Little shrines, hidden in ruins.
Matt: "I like this."
Marisha: Hashtag Team Vorugal.
Matt: "We can make this happen." You can make that happen. Hashtag Team Vorugal.
Taliesin: I still will admit that Cabal's Ruin is one of the Vestiges I feel would be-- and not just because I would like to use it.
Marisha: Is Ank'harel and the Ozmit Sea in the same area? Can we hit one on our way to the other?
Matt: The Ozmit Sea is in between Tal'Dorei and-- from your perspective, it's Tal'Dorei and Marquet, and the Ozmit Sea is what's in between.
Taliesin: So we could do a triple.
Marisha: We could do a triple. Because I have to get to the Water Ashari at some point.
Taliesin: And that's very important, because we need them on our side.
Sam: Between what and what?
Taliesin: Ozmit Sea, so it's over here.
Sam: It's between what and who?
Matt: The Ozmit Sea is between Marquet and Tal'Dorei.
Sam: Is this Tal'Dorei?
Marisha: We're on Tal'Dorei.
Sam: So Marquet is Japan.
Matt: More Australia.
Sam: Got it. Is this world round? Can we go the other way?
Taliesin: Actually, this world is shaped like a d20, so we're on the flat part at the five.
Sam: Can't go the other way?
Matt: You could eventually get there. It is round.
Laura: Would I know how fast dragons can actually fly? If it's a two-week trip to get to Draconia from where we are--
Matt: Two weeks via ship. Ocean ship.
Laura: Okay. If they were flying, how fast could they get there, potentially?
Travis: I'm only saying, maybe it's empty, right?
Marisha: What is?
Travis: Draconia.
Matt: I'm going to make some mathematics here, if you'll excuse me.
Travis: I'm only saying, if they were just here--
Sam: But we could bamf there right now.
Laura: Check it out and get out before they get back.
Travis: Get people out, do recon, whatever.
Sam: Plant some seeds.
Marisha: Plant some seeds.
Laura: They've probably left a good amount of army there to keep people under control. We'd have to get in and out in a couple of hours.
Sam: And what would our mission be?
Liam: Dump a couple of statues.
Laura: We don't have them.
Taliesin: Let other people do that.
Sam: Wait. What about, instead of dumping statues, we find these orbs? We find his lair, we find his orbs, and we call Thordak and we do a voice like: Yo, Thordak! You're a dickhead! I'm going to come kill you! Or we just smash them.
Taliesin: I don't know why everyone's so excited about the notion of pissing off the dragons to the point at which they all come here, but it is a way to go.
Sam: They don't know we're here.
Taliesin: They know we're here.
Travis: I'm just pointing out an opportunity where there is one.
Sam: That's true.
Matt: A few days.
Laura: It would take them a few days to get there?
Travis: A few days? We would have a whole fucking day!
Marisha: What time is it?
Matt: At this point in time, it's mid-afternoon, evening.
Sam: We have to rest.
Liam: Percival, even just for intelligence, even if it was brief, even to see what is going on there.
Taliesin: We have to make sure that we can get out immediately, and we also have to agree that if things start looking too iffy, we run.
Marisha: I have an idea.
Sam: You have the best ideas.
Marisha: Thank you.
Sam: Lay it on me.
Marisha: Can you Seeming us to all look like lizard army members?
Sam: Tomorrow. And we'll look like us, except vaguely like lizard people.
Travis: Why not wyverns?
Sam: First of all, the lizard army, is that different from wyverns? So they're just scaly creepers. I can do that.
Laura: Have you seen the lizard people?
Sam: No, but I'll see them when we get there.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: You've come across a few of the lizardfolk. They attacked you in Emon. They were on the wyverns. They're humanoid. They're a little larger than one of your half-elf companions or Percy.
Marisha: We fought them on the airship, too, right?
Matt: No, those were bandits. You fought wyverns.
Sam: We could be lizard people, for sure.
Laura: Wait, what?
Taliesin: We could look like lizard people, and it would trick anybody who wasn't a dragon. And if the dragon came, we would be fucked. That would be the end. That would be game over.
Sam: (singing) We could be lizard people!
Taliesin: I'm going to go on record as saying I do not think this is the right move.
Liam: What do you think is the right move?
Sam: He wants to go to Marquet to find some cloak that may or may not help us in a week.
Taliesin: Will help us. Getting three more Vestiges, two more Vestiges, just a little bit more power before starting to play chess again.
Laura: Really the only point of going there would be reconnaissance. That's it. No fighting.
Travis: When else are we going to know for sure?
Taliesin: There's an ancient dwarven saying, and I'm trying to remember where I heard it, but it goes somewhere along the lines of, it's never a three-hour tour. That's my fear.
Travis: Yeah, I know an ancient dwarven one that says no risk...
Sam: That's it.
Taliesin: Your mind is a grandfather clock, you know that.
Travis: Thank you.
Taliesin: It's correct twice a day, easily.
Sam: If we go, what is our mission?
Taliesin: Thank you.
Marisha: To get as many innocents out as we can.
Laura: No. That sounds wonderful, but if we get people out, they're going to know something happened.
Marisha: I figured if we find good fighters once again, and do our tree, our teleport thing--
Sam: We can get 13 people out. That's it.
Marisha: But it could be the 13 people that could change the tide.
Taliesin: This is not going to be a fight of 13 people.
Sam: We had a group of 50 goliaths, and they were all killed instantly.
Marisha: That's what I'm saying.
Laura: Plus, if we're lizard people, the survivors aren't going to be wanting--
Taliesin: They're going to be wondering who we are, first off.
Laura: They're going to be afraid of us.
Sam: I would only want to go there if we had a distinct plan to disrupt or trick or steal.
Travis: Disrupting communications is a great tactic.
Taliesin: We're not going to be able to disrupt communication.
Travis: You don't think we're going to make it to the jewels and smashy-smash?
Taliesin: No.
Marisha: I don't think that's a good idea.
Sam: And I slice the dragon's throat! And I say, I am victorious!
Liam: That sounds like a plan. Let's go.
Matt: So what are you guys doing?
Taliesin: Tightening up. We're going to go. What are we going for?
Sam: Smash the orbs.
Marisha: Well, here's something else I want to put into perspective. If I scry and teleport us to the black dragon's lair, I can do one more scry, and then I would burn my seventh level spell to get us there again, and then I'd be tapped out.
Laura: So we wouldn't be able to bamf out.
Marisha: We wouldn't be able to bamf out that day. We'd be staying the night.
Sam: But I can get us a safe place to stay for the night, no matter where we are.
Taliesin: But it means this is not a one-day, this is a three-day mission.
Marisha: I could not teleport us. It depends on how many times. I've got two teleports, so I can teleport us there and teleport us out, but we'd be doing it from here.
Taliesin: We teleport to the black dragon's lair, we sleep overnight, teleport in, teleport out. And then sleep overnight, teleport either to Whitestone or to Marquet.
Sam: Can you teleport today? Or are you done?
Matt: You can only use that once per day, though, right?
Marisha: I used Plane Shift. I didn't use Transport Via Plants. Yes. Wait. No. I Moved Earth. I can't do it today. It has to be tomorrow. And if that's the case, it's tomorrow, then we lose that two-day grace period. Unless we go right now and sleep overnight in Draconia and start first thing in the morning.
Taliesin: And risk a very reasonable reason that they would know where we are.
Matt: As far as I know, Plane Shift can't teleport you on the same plane. It brings you specifically to another plane of existence.
Marisha: Yeah. I'm saying I cast Plane Shift from the Feywild to here. That's all I'm saying. But I used that, and that's a seventh level spell.
Sam: So if we go to Draconia tonight, if we want to sleep in the mansion, we can't, because I changed his memory.
Laura: Oh fuck.
Sam: So we would have to sleep out in the open as lizard people.
Laura: Nope.
Liam: Too many negatives now.
Laura: This is danger zone.
Marisha: We're getting a lot of cons. There's not so many pros.
Taliesin: We need to sleep anyway, because we're exhausted.
Travis: Oh man. I can find all sorts of problems with a situation if I look hard enough.
Taliesin: That is so astute. It's 12 00. My god, he had a thought.
Travis: Opportunity. Honestly. There's a dragon's perch, and he is vacated, and it will probably never happen again as far as we know.
Taliesin: I disagree. I think the next time they come to attack and kill us, it will be vacated.
Travis: Cool. While they're killing Whitestone because we didn't take advantage of this moment, then we'll go to Draconia.
Taliesin: I agree. I legitimately agree.
Laura: We can sleep and wake up in the morning and teleport there.
Taliesin: We do have to sleep, regardless. There's no getting around sleep.
Laura: We can't fucking go there when we haven't slept, Grog. We'll all die.
Taliesin: We can't actually get there right now.
Marisha: There's also no guarantee that they're going straight back there. Maybe they're heading somewhere else. They were heading with an army to somewhere. It's probably not a city they've already conquered.
Taliesin: They were heading southeast.
Matt: Southeast is what you saw, yes.
Sam: That's where they live.
Taliesin: So they're probably heading back home.
Marisha: Balls. Then where did they come from? What were they doing?
Liam: They were fishing.
Taliesin: They thought that we might be here, and they took a quick look around, which is why I don't want to make any more noise around here.
Sam: Let's sleep.
Taliesin: I'm going to go to the barkeep.
Matt: There is no barkeep here. This tavern has been opened just for you guys to be served. There is no current owner here. Most everyone who helped you open this are yourselves and a couple of civilians that were just there.
Taliesin: Is there a civilian waitress?
Matt: There is no waitress. There are a couple civilians outside, but as soon as you guys started talking, all the civilians left the room.
Laura: They're so nice.
Taliesin: There's no barmaid at all?
Liam: Your nobility is showing, Percival.
Sam: I need a young boy. (laughter)
Liam: These white gloves are sullied. I need a new set of white gloves, please.
Taliesin: They're shooting mittens, and you're so uncouth.
Sam: I have an Unseen Servant. Do you need a servant? I make an Unseen Servant for him.
Matt: There's a wisp of air.
Sam: Command him as you see fit.
Taliesin: Never mind. This is what I get for trying to be nice to anybody. I've learned my lesson.
Sam: I tip the Unseen Servant.
Matt: You toss the coin and it (clinks) to the ground.
Travis: I pounce on it.
Matt: You (soft impact) into this weird cluster of air. It's pushing your beard hair back, and your mouth is full of all that air pushing into it as you reach into the Unseen Servant, grab the coin, and pull it out.
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: Well done. You got a gold.
Taliesin: We'll sleep for now. We'll wake up in the morning, and we'll either go in one direction or the other.
Laura: Good plan, guys. Good plan.
Marisha: We came up with nothing.
Taliesin: That's so not true. We came up with a lot. We just have to sleep and then make a decision based on what the world looks like in the morning.
Liam: Dream about a cloak, Percival. Maybe we can get you a cloak.
Taliesin: That cloak sounds useful.
Marisha: All right, let's sleep. Let's go to the castle.
Matt: You guys find your way to the castle.
Taliesin: As a side, I want to grab Vex for a quick walk on the way to the castle. I want to go by the cemetery. Has it been worked on, by the way? I suppose I'll find out.
Liam: You did say Vex, right?
Taliesin: Vax.
Liam: You said Vex.
Taliesin: Vax. I've been drinking. I've not even been drinking, I've been pretend drinking.
Matt: All right. You grab him.
Taliesin: I have something to show you.
Liam: What is it?
Taliesin: You'll like it. Well, I don't know if you'll like it. I don't know what you like. I'm going to take him to the cemetery, to the crypt. The title I gave your sister doesn't come with much, but it does come with one, at the moment, tiny plot of land, on which a crypt sits. This was the resting place of the father and grandfather and assorted family members of the man you killed the first night we came here.
Liam: You want my sister to live in a mausoleum?
Taliesin: No. I want something else to live in a mausoleum. This is actually for you. Open it. I go and I light the two little torches on the side. This is very traditional, and it should open. Do you trust me?
Liam: Uh...
Taliesin: Good answer. I'll go in first.
Matt: Percy enters the building.
Liam: I follow.
Matt: Okay. As you enter the mausoleum, the gentle flickering of torchlight that was lit by Percy shows the interior, though it is low-lit partially, and your darkvision does catch you. What was once a relatively decent mausoleum seems to have been gutted, retrofit, and now you see standing before you, is a mostly constructed shrine to the Raven Queen.
Taliesin: I figured it would be a good idea. I've had my fill of gods, but I'm not so foolish to think that we do not need them still. This is here when you need it.
Liam: I am having trouble.
Taliesin: Me, too. I do not want to die who I am. I would like to live long enough to be someone else. I think you understand that.
Liam: I've been really angry at you.
Taliesin: I've been encouraging it.
Liam: I don't know if it's entirely fair, but I can't shake it. I don't know that I'm willing to let go of it yet.
Taliesin: Good. I certainly do not deserve it yet. I don't know if I ever will. But I can't think of anything else to do with my time on earth right now, other than... this. I am finished with gods. They will not help me. Maybe you will.
Liam: Percy.
Taliesin: Yes?
Liam: I've always liked you. From the beginning, I've always liked you.
Taliesin: I've always liked you, too.
Liam: You are intelligent and charming.
Taliesin: Thank you.
Liam: And good in a tight spot.
Taliesin: It's the open spaces where I suffer. The tight spots, I feel very good about. It's the open spaces. This is a very tight spot.
Liam: I would like to be friends with you again. I just have a condition.
Taliesin: Yes?
Liam: My penchant for forgiveness with my sister's welfare is razor thin.
Taliesin: I know.
Liam: If you can respect that, then we don't have a problem.
Taliesin: Do you know why I titled your sister?
Liam: I have some idea.
Taliesin: She thought she was missing something that-- and I use this term loosely-- ordinary people... We have a magic we use, to convince people that we deserve the things we get, those of us who were born this way. It was treating her unfairly and limiting her ability to see her world for what it was worth, and it was a simple and easy fix. She is going to wake up one morning-- not yet, but soon-- and realize that money will not make her happy, and that trying to please that awful father will not make her happy. The first step in that is realizing that he's weak, and there's no better way to do that than being better titled than your parents.
Liam: I don't agree with that line of thinking.
Taliesin: I know. But you are not her. And I'm not saying it's the truth, but it is what I believe is in her heart. I think perhaps that might lift. I will never hurt her. I will never hurt anybody intentionally, especially not you, any more than I already have. In return, I ask: never take your eyes off me. Never trust me. And that is the best friend that you can be.
Liam: I will recommit to that same promise I made.
Taliesin: You can like me. I would love that. And in fact, I hope that I can earn your like.
Liam: I do like you.
Taliesin: I just never want to earn your trust.
Liam: Well, then it's your lucky day.
Taliesin: A gentle title will suit your sister well. I'm leaving.
Matt: Percy walks out. You're left alone in the silence and darkness, looking at the small shrine before you.
Liam: I'm on board. You have me. Whatever you will. I have something I need to take care of, which you know, and I hope you will help me with it. But I do not take your gift lightly. You have me. I close the door again and head back to town.
Matt: Back into town. You guys quietly keep your distance in your walk, find your way back to the castle to your respective rooms, and an evening's rest takes you all.
Marisha: Do I hear Vax go to his room?
Matt: Are you waiting to hear Vax go to his room?
Marisha: I'm waiting to hear Vax go to his room.
Matt: Actually, knowing Vax, you wouldn't hear anything. (laughter)
Liam: 30.
Matt: You wait for a long time, and no sound comes to your ears.
Marisha: I go to sleep.
Matt: All right. And with that, as you guys rest for the night, we're going to take a quick bathroom break. We'll be back here in a few minutes. We had a friend come and deliver a gift to Laura, which you can see presented on the table now. It is a replica that someone, Kiki Day, made this awesome prop replica of Fenthras.
Laura: I wish you guys could see it up close. Obviously, we're going to send a picture on Twitter so you guys can see it, but it lights up different colors!
Matt: Design based on David Rodriguez's concept art for Fenthras.
Laura: It's got Elvish for "protector" and "growth."
Matt: That's so badass.
Laura: Did I say it right? Protector, not protection? Protector is right!
Marisha: Protector and growth.
Laura: Say what?!
Matt: That is awesome.
Laura: Thank you so much!
Matt: Thank you, Kiki!
Laura: You're unbelievable.
Travis: Should we put it down?
Matt: All right. There we go.
Laura: Lean it up against the table.
Matt: So. As you guys come to consciousness the next morning, the storm has come in now--
Laura: By the way, I got terrible sleep. I replayed everything Saundor said in my head a hundred times.
Matt: Make a general wisdom saving throw.
Liam: You're paralyzed from fear.
Laura: I am terrible! Wisdom saving throw? 12.
Matt: 12? Okay. Your evening is hard-pressed. You do manage to get a full night's sleep; you do not suffer any exhaustion. You do manage to get rest, though the nightmares do come in memory of your last encounter at the Feywild, and Saundor's words still swimming around in your head, finding cracks in your sense of self. But you still are stalwart against the choice you made and the friends that were at your back. And as you all come to consciousness, the sound of rain outside of the castle against the exterior stone greets you with the morning. You can smell the fresh rain in the air, and eventually come down to find breakfast prepared, a meal earned.
Taliesin: Not chicken.
Matt: Not chicken, no. This is eggs, fruits. A classic Whitestone breakfast. Chicken is available, but strangely untouched.
Laura: Baked beans. Tell me there's baked beans!
Taliesin: The thick, single-slab bacon.
Liam: Blood pudding.
Marisha: Basically an Irish breakfast.
Matt: There are a few farms here, most are in the surrounding fields south of the city. It's good. It's fresh.
Taliesin: The rain is good. It will mean that they'll have an easier time figuring out the water level while they're digging out beneath the Sun Tree and making sure that it's secure. I love this weather.
Sam: Well? To Marquet or to Draconia? What's it going to be? Should we vote?
Taliesin: An attempt at an object of power or an attempt at friends in power?
Sam: Which is which?
Taliesin: Draconia has friends in power.
Marisha: Speaking of friends, we should probably check up on ours.
Taliesin: (long sigh) That is true. We haven't heard anything, but that is true.
Marisha: We haven't heard anything about him.
Laura: It's terrifying.
Marisha: I know.
Sam: He's probably okay.
Travis: Who are we talking about? (laughter)
Sam: Jarett.
Travis: Oh.
Sam: Our only friend in Draconia.
Taliesin: I personally would assume that Tiberius would either be on his way to one of the two cities, if he were so inclined. And if he had survived. And if he wasn't working in the city itself to keep it functioning.
Marisha: He's hard-headed enough. So all of those things are very true.
Taliesin: And again, we're at war. This is not a battle. We do not win by going to Draconia. We do not win by going to Marquet. We win months from now.
Marisha: You're starting to make less and less sense, Percy.
Taliesin: No! I'm making perfect sense.
Liam: Part of the traditional Whitestone breakfast is--
Laura: A rambling de Rolo.
Taliesin: Breakfast needs things to live. (laughter)
Liam: I think you got that backwards?
Sam: Whitestone continental breakfast. Two eggs, rambling tirade. (laughter)
Laura: Vote, then?
Liam: Vote.
Taliesin: I'm all right with a vote.
Sam: All right, all in favor of going to Marquet to find a Vestige that will maybe give us some more power that we need to kill a dragon, say aye!
Taliesin: Aye.
Liam: Aye.
Sam: All in favor of going to Draconia, where we don't really have a great plan but I think we're going to go try to fuck up a dragon's lair and maybe rescue five people and probably die as lizard people, say aye.
Laura: Aye.
Travis: Aye.
Sam: Aye.
Marisha: Aye.
Laura: I've changed my mind. I want to go to Marquet now.
Sam: Three to three.
Laura: Sorry. Oh shit! I didn't mean to fuck that up. Trinket, what's your vote?
Taliesin: Hold on, let's see if Ashley texts in the next ten minutes.
Matt: Three versus three. Are you going leave it up to the dice, being a game of DND?
Sam: Let's do it.
Marisha: Where's that coin we have?
Taliesin: I have it. I have it right here. Yeah.
Liam: You could also do one to ten and 11 to 20.
Taliesin: One or 20. Ready?
Sam: Wait, we're just doing one flip?
Laura: Yeah!
Sam: No. What?!
Taliesin: Yes. It's flipped!
Laura: What is what?
Marisha: Okay! 20 is Marquet and a one is Draconia.
Sam: What about all the other numbers?
Taliesin: There's only two! It's a coin!
Matt: 20, Marquet. One is Draconia.
Taliesin: And any other number, we stay home.
Laura: What is it?
Taliesin: We're going to Draconia, and we're going to see if we could find Tiberius.
Sam: Oh god!
Laura: Let it be known, I don't think we should go as lizard people anymore.
Travis: Why?
Laura: I think we should go as ravaged Draconians.
Taliesin: I think we should go as Draconians.
Marisha: We can make ourselves look like dragonborn with Seeming?
Taliesin: I think that's a better plan.
Laura: At least that way, they'll trust us.
Taliesin: We don't have to teleport to the middle of nowhere. Well, we do need to get farther away from here. Is there any way to get farther away from where we are right now before we--
Liam: Can we get back to Umbrasyl's lair? I thought that was a good idea.
Sam: We could go there and there and back.
Taliesin: Well, as long as we commit to 24 hours in Draconia no matter what.
Marisha: We can go to Umbrasyl's lair, but it'll take an extra day, because I can only teleport us so many times.
Taliesin: I think 72 hours is a perfectly reasonable amount of time to dedicate to this prospect.
Laura: Pop in, scry, pop into Draconia, look around and next day, pop out. Can we do that?
Sam: Yep.
Liam: If we stop at Umbrasyl's lair, is there anything we can do to run Grog out like a labrador? I'm worried about him not getting enough playtime in.
Sam: In Draconia?
Liam: No, in the mansion. Can you bamf up anything for him in the mansion?
Sam: You're talking about tonight?
Liam: No. We're going to go camp somewhere for a day, right?
Laura: No, we're going to Draconia.
Liam: Right now?
Sam: Go to the black dragon lair, then go to Draconia, then spend a night there.
Liam: I've been travelling with these fuckers for years, and I still don't understand magic.
Marisha: Hold on a second. We have two choices if we're going to Draconia: we can either go to Umbrasyl's lair to scry from there, then teleport there, which means we will be staying the night in Draconia.
Sam: In Draconia?
Taliesin: In Draconia.
Marisha: In Draconia.
Marisha: Or we go to Draconia right now, blindly, and then I'd still have a spell to get us out.
Sam: But they could track us back here.
Laura: How can we go there blindly if you don't know where a tree is?
Marisha: Well, I'd scry.
Sam: And then they'd know where we are.
Marisha: They could theoretically, if we get caught.
Laura: We would only scry on a tree. We wouldn't scry on a dragon.
Taliesin: I have a compromise.
Sam: Actually, can I just throw this out? The only thing that would detect us scrying is currently flying over the ocean. We can scry right now.
Taliesin: Let's scry from the giant's cave outside the city.
Laura: It'll still take a couple of hours to get there, though?
Taliesin: Couple of hours to get there. It's fine. It's nine. It's seven--
Laura: It's 5 00 in the morning!
Taliesin: It's 3am! Why are we awake?
Matt: You're still drunk somehow.
Taliesin: We get far enough outside of the city so at the very least--
Sam: To the giant's lair! To scry!
Matt: North of the city, up into the beginning stages of the Alabaster Sierras, you find the abandoned fortress that is there, embedded on the side of the mountain wall. Keyleth, you are attempting a scrying spell? What are you scrying on?
Marisha: Okay. I have the map of Draconia, let me just see if I can scry--
Sam: You know what you know in Draconia? Do you know what you know in Draconia? You know Tiberius and you know his armor, and you know his objects and personal effects?
Marisha: No, we don't know if he's in Draconia.
Taliesin: We may end up somewhere random.
Sam: That's true. but what do you know what is in Draconia?
Marisha: I know of the things that Tiberius has told us.
Sam: Do you know any of his friends or his family? Have we met his family?
Matt: You have not met his family. You've never been there.
Marisha: I don't need to have a known location, right? I can just scry in a general area, yeah?
Matt: You need generally a creature of some kind.
Sam: What about his little pet?
Laura: Are you not scrying on a tree?
Liam: Lockheed.
Marisha: Lockheed has a higher chance of being dead than Tiberius.
Taliesin: I think that's underestimating, or overestimating-- I don't know.
Liam: It's a coin flip.
Taliesin: It's a coin flip, really. He's small.
Marisha: Well, this could answer our question. If I can't find anybody, then we might be going to Marquet.
Sam: That's true.
Taliesin: Go for it, then. See what happens.
Marisha: I guess it's Tiberius, then? He's all I got. It's got to be someone that I know? It can't be something I've heard about?
Matt: It can be something you've heard about. A person or a creature.
Taliesin: A person or a creature, not a place?
Matt: Not necessarily, no.
Taliesin: Can it be a magic object?
Matt: It would be a creature of some kind.
Travis: We know about Tiberius. We know about Kruvanis Stormwind.
Sam: We know of Lockheed.
Liam: The Mending Wheel. A creature only? Oh shit. Fucking magic!
Laura: That's what he just said!
Marisha: Are we gambling on Tiberius being there?
Sam: You're going to gamble on Tiberius?
Marisha: I am gambling on whoever we scry to, because they could all be dead.
Sam: How many times can you scry?
Marisha: Theoretically, four times.
Laura: I've also got a Scrying Stone.
Taliesin: Start with the stone.
Marisha: That's right, you've got that goddamn thing. Give me the stone.
Laura: Here.
Marisha: Thank you!
Taliesin: I think we should call it rock. The Rock.
Marisha: It doesn't go away, right?
Laura: No. it's a Scrying Eye. You can use it once a day.
Marisha: Yeah. Let's do this!
Sam: Start with Tiberius.
Taliesin: Start with Tiberius. We'll work our way down.
Marisha: Start with Tiberius.
Laura: I was going to bring it out!
Taliesin: No, you did wonderfully.
Laura: It was just sitting there.
Matt: You take the object. You close your eyes, focusing on the memory and the life essence of Tiberius Stormwind. You project your thoughts into the ether. The nature energies carry you into the darkness, and there is no response.
Sam: No response?
Matt: No response. The scrying spell finds no target.
Taliesin: That can mean a lot of things.
Liam: Yes, does that stretch across the planes?
Sam: Does it?
Matt: Generally, it's on the same plane of existence.
Sam: Okay. What about his father?
Taliesin: Or Lockheed?
Sam: Well, Lockheed would be with--
Taliesin: Not necessarily. How many times have we found stray cats?
Laura: It's true. Maybe scry on Lockheed.
Marisha: Can I try it? Will it expend another spell?
Matt: This one will expend a spell.
Marisha: It lasts for ten minutes? Oh, per spell.
Sam: So you're burning your own spell slot.
Marisha: Yeah, I'm burning my own spells.
Laura: At least you got one for free.
Sam: Thanks, Vex.
Marisha: It makes me very nervous.
Sam: We should do his dad.
Taliesin: That would be who I would kill if I were taking over the city.
Sam: You just want to kill everybody.
Taliesin: I do.
Marisha: I'm going to try Lockheed. His dad could be in a place where he's being watched.
Matt: Okay. So this time, you give the object back to Vex and you sit down and create the ritual space before you. You sit down in the center of the stone floor of the fortress and you close your eyes. This time, you send out your consciousness once more. The druidic energies carry you an extended distance in but a few moments, and your vision clicks in and you see, perched against a snow-covered rock in the inside of a ravine, a shivering, small, green dragonling. Alone, and is partially asleep against the stone. You can see just past over this large, gaping ravine that is the center of this portion of Wildemount, you can see scattered rubble covered in ice and snow and small distant things you can't quite make out with your vision here occasionally moving through it.
Sam: Can you see any trees?
Marisha: Do I find any trees?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Marisha: 19.
Matt: 19. There's no visible trees in the ravine. Anything that would be living down there has been-- from your vision here-- obscured by rock, rubble, ruined floating island, and snowfall. You do see growing out of the side of the rock, not far from where Lockheed is perched is one leafless, small branch of a tree that extends out. And as you glance up, there is a very thick tree that is currently jutting out the side of the mountain.
Marisha: Does it appear to be natural?
Matt: It does.
Marisha: And large enough to fit Grog?
Matt: Maybe.
Laura: Jutting out the side of--
Matt: Yeah. It's not sitting on ground, but is currently over the ravine.
Marisha: Yeah, one of those. Any other trees? Is this the biggest or closest one?
Matt: That's all you can make out from this perspective.
Marisha: How big is the ravine? How deep is it?
Matt: From where you can tell right now, from the perspective you can see, looking at Lockheed, it's probably a good 50-foot fall before you hit a scattering of broken rock, and eventually it comes into a grade to the bottom of the ravine.
Travis: Not great.
Marisha: Not a good option.
Matt: You guys have fallen 50 feet and been fine.
Sam: Someone has Feather Fall, right? No?
Marisha: Did it look like a natural cavern or a man-made cavern that Lockheed was in?
Matt: From what you can tell, it looks natural.
Marisha: Like he found a little cave and is hiding?
Matt: It's less of a cave and more he's perched on this little alcove, this little outcropping of rock on the side of the ravine wall.
Marisha: Oh, he's on the side of the ravine.
Matt: On the side of the ravine.
Laura: Okay, I have an idea. What if we tie a rope on something on this side and we all go out of the rope really fast and drop down?
Taliesin: Grog first.
Sam: Should you scry one more time, for the dad? Because best-case scenario, we're in a weird, snowy ravine with no civilization around.
Taliesin: We don't want to be around any civilization. And also, that's one more spell gone.
Matt: You did see, distant, blurred from your perspective, since the focus of the scry was on Lockheed, you did see movement and very small distant objects within the snow at the base of the ravine.
Laura: They could potentially see us as soon as we come out of the tree.
Sam: Yeah, we'll be far away.
Marisha: They could be citizens, they could be creatures? I just saw movement of figures, I didn't see any details?
Sam: Seems like a good plan.
Laura: This is risky.
Marisha: This is ridiculous.
Taliesin: It's true. There's only risk at this point. Is this the risk we make or is this not the risk we make. Grog?
Travis: Oh, are we asking for Grog's opinion now?
Taliesin: Only so that we can ignore it.
Laura: You're the one that was most adamant about us going there.
Taliesin: With the new data, how do you feel?
Travis: I think we should take the hint and not go.
Sam: But you said--
Travis: Yeah, but I was picturing meandering out of a nice, beautiful tree in a forest.
Sam: It's a little jolt. It's a little fall. It's fine.
Liam: That's it. He created this idea and he's backing out.
Sam: You told us your famous phrase  all risk! That's what this is.
Travis: I do hate to have my own words used against me.
Sam: All risk. That's what this is! We are doing all risk!
Travis: I'm down to party. I'm just saying it was a little different in my head.
Sam: I've never known you to be a coward, Grog.
Taliesin: No! Why would you do that?!
Laura: Why, Scanlan?!
Travis: I'll go first. You hold my hand, and I'll go first.
Liam: He can play the fiddle very well.
Travis: I'll go. Let's do it. I'm ready.
Laura: Okay, before we go through, I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace on us so we can stealth through the tree. Like that's going to work.
Taliesin: No, that's a good idea.
Laura: I'm going to look for something very solid. Are there trees around us that we can go through right now?
Matt: A short walk, you could get down to the base of the forest.
Laura: All right. I'm going to tie the rope off onto a very sturdy thing next to a tree that we're going to go through.
Taliesin: We're going to rappel.
Laura: Yes.
Travis: Does the portal only close after a couple seconds?
Taliesin: Yes. Six seconds. We're all going to hold on to the rope and we all go.
Matt: Six seconds for all of you to--
Laura: Jump out!
Marisha: Bungee-jumping out of a tree!
Liam: We are fucking idiots!
Marisha: This is the stupidest--
Taliesin: This is a terrible plan. I want to go on record for saying I was against this plan--
Sam: We can just leave really quick! She's got another teleport, yeah. We're going to climb up to the tree--
Marisha: I didn't see Draconia. I saw the ravine, and it was snowy, so we can assume it's nearby. But I didn't see Draconia, did I?
Matt: You've never seen Draconia before.
Marisha: But did I see a city in my scry?
Matt: You saw no city.
Laura: You saw rubble.
Marisha: Once again, Lockheed could have flown miles away.
Taliesin: He could have.
Sam: At the worst, this is a quick recon mission. We jump back in the tree, we come back. 15 minutes.
Laura: But there's things that were crawling around amongst the dead.
Sam: They were far off in the distance!
Taliesin: They weren't that far off. But to be fair, this is what a plan is, is everything going wrong. So I'm all right with doing this, if we're doing this.
Travis: All right, sweet. I am, too.
Marisha: All right, fuck it! Let's do it.
Matt: All right. So you've affixed the rope at the base of the strongest tree you can find.
Marisha: Are we going to tie ourselves to each other again, like before?
Laura: No! Because that's dumb. We're going to break our backs. I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace on everyone right now because why the fuck not?
Sam: You got a fucking broom. I'm hopping on the broom.
Laura: Oh yeah, I'm on the broom. And he's on the broom.
Taliesin: Vex, we're going to have the greatest I-told-you-so if we survive this.
Matt: All right. We have Vex and Scanlan on the broom.
Travis: Should you make me some something teensy?
Marisha: Oh, this is such a stupid idea...
Taliesin: No, we're going to need every spell we need in there. No, you're the weight that's going to hold the rope down, you're going first.
Matt: Any of your spell prep?
Liam: I'm going to pop my wings out and hook my arms under Kiki's armpits.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: I'm holding on the rope, because I'm an idiot.
Matt: All right. Grog and Percy holding onto the rope.
Marisha: This is stupid. This is so stupid!
Taliesin: I hate you all.
Marisha: We've done so many fucking stupid things. But this is really stupid.
Matt: Vex casts Pass Without a Trace. The shadows reach around and embrace your forms. You become more obscured the further the light is from your body. Keyleth, what are you doing?
Marisha: I cast Transport Via Plants on that big, fatty tree!
Matt: Keyleth touches the edge of the tree, the rope which is affixed to above. The trunk (portal opens).
Marisha: Everyone ready?
Taliesin: Go!
Marisha: Go!
Laura: I fly through stealthily.
Matt: You fly through stealthily.
Laura: I'm trying to get down to the ground quickly and hide behind something.
Matt: Right. I would like all of you guys to make stealth checks at disadvantage.
Travis: Yes! That's awesome.
Marisha: Oh, that's not too bad.
Travis: 17!
Sam: Pass Without a Trace?
Travis: Oh. 27.
Taliesin: 20.
Sam: 20.
Marisha: 22.
Liam: 35.
Laura: 33.
Travis: 27.
Matt: All right. As Vex and Scanlan scoot first through the opening, you coast down, and there is a cluster of rocks, but there's a light snowdust, and you find a snowbank that you guys coast down to quickly. You can decide to float above the snowbank. What do you want to do?
Laura: We get down on the ground and go under.
Matt: Okay, so you disappear under the snowbank. It is freezing cold, the wet immediately falling snow against your form begins to seep in. But you are below eye-level. Vax and Keyleth? You guys just dart through, you holding her.
Liam: Fly through, and then once I see them hit the ground, I'm going to dive-bomb us, and I'm going to wrap us in a little wing bubble and roll into the snow.
Matt: All right. As you guys come falling out the side of the tree, you see nearby as a small, green tiny dragon gets startled and flies off. You guys go coasting, the wings expand for a second. It picks up and as you hit, whipping past the 15 feet of jagged rocks that were gathered at the base of the ravine, you scoot over it, the wings fold in around you, and you guys tumble into the snow. Make an acrobatics check with disadvantage because you're grabbing onto her and are covered in wings.
Laura: And you're covered in wings.
Liam: I rolled a 15 and a 20. That would be a 30.
Matt: You don't feel the pain. And the wings do cause a significant barrier of impact, as well as the snow. As soon as you land, you go into a classic shoulder roll and use the inertia to not arise above the water. You both essentially coast sideways, stopping within the snowbank. From an overhead perspective, you can see a large swath has been carved through. But from visual eye range, at equal level, you guys still appear to be hidden within the snow. The two of you jump through and start rappelling down, Grog at the bottom end. Bringing the rope, bringing the rope down, bringing the rope down. It slams shuts, the rope cuts at the other end as the portal closes. Percy, you just make it out as the rope gives way. It is now Grog and Percy plummeting toward the ground.
Marisha: I cast a Grasping Vine to grab Grog.
Matt: You don't have the opportunity, because this all happens in a period of six seconds and you guys just landed and coasted in the snow.
Travis: Am I right under Percy?
Matt: He's about five feet ahead of you, yeah.
Travis: (laughs)
Taliesin: I'm going to let that happen.
Matt: You're cushioning his fall?
Travis: Yep.
Matt: All right. Make an acrobatics check, just for the hell of it.
Liam: I love this game.
Travis: 13.
Matt: 13. As soon as you look over your shoulder and see the ground coming, you try and swing your legs underneath to catch you, to slide across. And you begin to. Your feet catch the rock and you feel the muscles tense. Your back gets jammed a little bit. And you catch Percy in your arms, but the momentum of Percy hitting you sends you back over, and you both tumble into the snow. You do prevent Percy from taking any damage, but you do suffer five points of fall damage.
Liam: Stubbed your toe, big guy?
Travis: I got a booby.
Sam: Is Lockheed within range still? Can we see him?
Matt: You guys make a perception check.
Marisha: Can I look, too?
Matt: You're just now getting up out of the ball of wings.
Laura: 25.
Sam: Six.
Laura: 25.
Matt: 25. You do see Lockheed is about 50, 60 feet up on the rock right now.
Sam: Where's Lockheed?
Laura: Can I whisper in Draconic? Lockheed! And whatever the word is for "Come to me."
Matt: Seems too far to really be within earshot of a whisper.
Sam: I see her doing this. I point to him, and I cast Message, and I say: Lockheed! We're down here! Come down! It's us, your friends!
Matt: Lockheed (wingbeats) and then glides against the rock. And glides lower to the rock. Glides lower to the rock, and flies up-- still keeping a cautious distance from you above the snow.
Liam: Tibs. We're friends with Tibs. Tiberius. You remember us?
Matt: You can see Lockheed a little closer now. You remember him being fairly sick when he was initially purchased. While the illness has passed, he looks greatly malnourished and thin--
Laura: I pull out some of my food that I give to Trinket and try to feed it...
Matt: As soon as you pull out the food, Lockheed's demeanor changes immediately. Darts up and almost latches onto your hand and causes you to jump--
Laura: I cast Speak With Animals. Is he an animal?
Matt: Nope.
Sam: I have Speak With Small Beasts...
Matt: Not a beast.
Sam: Fuck you! (laughter)
Liam: He's a little small monster.
Laura: I would have known, as a dragon expert, that he's not a fucking animal, then. Whatever.
Sam: What is a monster?
Taliesin: Hit your head in the fall.
Laura: I didn't fall, I flew.
Travis: Pike's a small monster.
Sam: Just grab him and put him in the bag of holding!
Matt: At this point now, the temperature's really set into you. You've heard stories. You're familiar with the sound. The words you've heard of Wildemount, being largely a colder continent, especially to the north where the actual civilizations of man exist. Draconia's a little further to the south, but also based on the information you have, this being taken recently as the den of Vorugal, there is an almost perpetual small snowstorm that is existing about this ravine, and the wind itself is beginning to cut through. Thankfully, you're mostly armored up. For the time being, you're fine. But you can see where this is a difficult weather pattern to perpetually live in. Lockheed finishes eating vigorously and seems to be waiting across your hand.
Laura: Perch him on my shoulder and get out some more of the little boar meat we have in the bag of colding and feeding him.
Matt: He eats some, happily.
Laura: Can I speak Draconic to him, see if he understands any of that?
Matt: What do you say?
Liam: Tiberius was teaching him Draconic.
Laura: Yeah, I know. I say "Where is Tiberius?" in Draconic.
Liam: Where is home?
Laura: Where is home?
Matt: (croaking)
Liam: Unless Tibs got further along with him, it was one word--
Sam: He was teaching him "sit" and "play dead" and stuff.
Liam: One word at a time.
Laura: All right. Stay.
Matt: And stays and digs in the talons at the top of your leather armor shoulder, folds thed wings in and just waits there, huddled up against your shoulder for warmth.
Taliesin: I'm going to look around and see if there's a direction in which it seems there's civilization or any signs of battle or otherwise.
Matt: Make a perception check.
Taliesin: 16.
Matt: 16. You bring your head above the snowline and you can see surrounding you-- and you are in the center of this giant ravine that opens up to the sky. Not quite Grand Canyon size, but it's about half the width. It's a wide gulf. And you guys are on one side of where the ravine slowly begins to coalesce, and there's various steps in which the ravine casts down. You were already towards the bottom when you landed. This could have been a lot worse were it higher up. Looking up, you see, just from this vantage point, dozens of large stacks of broken rock and stone. You see pillars that are jutting out of portions of this. You see partially and mostly collapsed buildings that themselves have been destroyed from serious impact. You recall, during the initial attack of the Conclave, that one of the things that was seen through a vision was the fall of Draconia, which were islands of stone that were held aloft through arcane means within this ravine. What you now look upon are all the fallen remains of each of these arcane islands now plummeted, crushed, and fell into the ravine and have been sundered and destroyed. You do see figures moving quickly and crawling over elements of it, and you see a cluster of them fighting over something and then disperse.
Liam: How far off?
Matt: They're probably a good 300 feet off.
Laura: Could we tell what kind of creatures they are?
Matt: They appear to be humanoid, somewhat reptilian.
Sam: Should I make us lizard people?
Marisha: Can I do a nature check to see if I can see the origin, the epicenter of the storm? Like the eye of the storm? Where it's coming from?
Taliesin: Clever.
Marisha: 16.
Matt: 16. Best that you can view, the storm seems to be slowly spiraling, and a large heavy portion of the snowfall and sleet is hitting about a mile or so towards the right side of the ravine that you guys are looking at. From the wall you're at, you have the right and the left sides of this current ravine structure, seems to be that direction, about a mile.
Marisha: I think the dragon's lair is that way.
Sam: Can you look around for more trees that aren't so hard to get to in case we need to make a fast getaway?
Taliesin: We could just keep our eyes open.
Sam: All right.
Marisha: You said it was a mile. Can we traverse through the bottom of the ravine to get there in that direction?
Sam: Or is it all water?
Matt: No, you can.
Travis: We're going to crack out the good old Dust of Tracelessness since there's knee-high snow?
Taliesin: Let's not be fleshy.
Sam: You want me to make us Draconians or lizard people?
Taliesin: If we're lizard people, Draconians will not trust us.
Liam: Yeah. We can at least pretend to cower and be afraid of lizard men if we see them.
Sam: I don't think Grog can cower.
Travis: What is the definition of this word?
Sam: Be a wussy.
Taliesin: Shaky dance. (laughter)
Liam: You know when you bang your balls on a rock or something? It's like that, you go, (groans).
Taliesin: Is there anything you're not good at? Don't think that hard. Never mind.
Sam: Draconians?
Taliesin: Draconians.
Sam: I will cast Seeming on the party and make us all Draconians.
Matt: What kind of Draconians? There are many types of colors, there are those with and without tails--
Sam: Wasn't Tiberius a strange one?
Laura: Don't do red!
Sam: He was a strange one, right?
Marisha: He was the odd man out.
Liam: They didn't take kindly to him.
Sam: Metallic, yeah?
Liam: Bronze?
Sam: Like gray, silver?
Laura: Maybe it's good to make us silvers and whiteish!
Sam: Bronze, silver, and gold then, I guess.
Liam: That's chromatic. Metallic! Bronze, silver, gold.
Sam: Yeah, we'll do the Olympics.
Matt: With or without tail? Because you've met both.
Taliesin: They won't actually be tails. That might actually get us in trouble.
Sam: Which one was Tiberius?
Matt: Tiberius had a tail.
Sam: Do most of them have a tail?
Laura: Gern didn't have a tail and he was less than-- I don't think Draconians will like us without a tail.
Sam: We all have tails. Mine's a little longer than the rest. (laughter)
Matt: Keeping your normal attire, just on the top of the Draconian form?
Sam: No! What do Draconians wear?
Laura: Rags! Put us in rags, like we've been living in rubble.
Sam: Raw silk and tattered clothes, just rags, terrible gray things.
Laura: Make us look like we've been beat up.
Sam: Sure. We all have a single bruise. (laughter)
Sam: In a different place on our face. Everyone's got one face bruise in a different place.
Matt: All of your forms shift into that of various metallic dragonborn, with tails, adorned in rags, dirty. What do you do?
Laura: Oh shit, who all speaks Draconic here?
Sam: You speak Draconic! (laughter)
Sam: We're all mutes. We're lepers and mutes, and you are our doctor?
Liam: Everybody else does fearful anime reacts the whole time. (gasping)
Travis: (speaking in Japanese)
Laura: Don't actually speak Japanese, Grog.
Taliesin: We're moving towards the epicenter.
Matt: You guys step up out of the snow and begin walking?
Marisha: Stealthily.
Laura: Okay, I'm stealthily leading us. That direction, towards where the lair is?
Travis: Keeping an eye out for trees.
Laura: And for any of the lizard creatures coming towards us.
Matt: Right now, no.
Laura: Then let's quietly make our way that direction.
Liam: Remember, like you've been hit in the balls.
Travis: Oh.
Matt: You guys cluster up and begin stepping above the snow, which is still about waist, knee-high for some of you. Making your way to the right of your current location, towards the center of the storm that Keyleth discovered. As you guys begin to walk, a nearby pile of rock and rubble, there was that one cluster of four, five of these moving lizard-like entities. Suddenly, one of them looks at your group, looks back at the rest, and they all stand up and look over in your direction.
Sam: You're our leader, friend. Do we continue?
Matt: They're just watching you. They're not doing anything.
Laura: Let's injuredly keep walking.
Matt: They go back to rummaging through. You guys continue to walk. The ravine curves to the right, or at least begins to open up further to the right and you're met with the next large structure of rubble. What you saw was the edge of an extremely large, once-floating island, now crushed and sundered across the ground. There are sheets of ice across parts of it. You can see the better part of a large palace or library that is now caved in partially. You can see frozen books scattered across portions of the stone and rock on the ground before you. You can see a series of huts have been constructed on top of this rubble, and there are some small fires lit, little plumes of smoke and probably two dozen dragonborn figures that are currently combing through the rubble.
Laura: Do we see any books that seem interesting as we're walking through them?
Matt: They're underneath ice. You can try and chisel some out, if you like.
Liam: Don't have time!
Matt: A lot of it's covered in snow. There's some bits you can peek through and see sheets of ice and frozen books--
Travis: Are there any frozen bodies?
Matt: As you begin to have a closer book as you walk by, there are many frozen bodies. You see many people, all dragonborn, some atop the rubble, some partially crushed, some partially locked in ice, some destroyed by some sort of an acidic substance. Some of them are covered in boils, and their face is locked in some sort of horrible coughing fit. This was a very terrifying battle scene that has transpired here.
Laura: That means Raishan was here.
Marisha: That means Thordak was here.
Liam: Umbrasyl was here. Acid.
Marisha: They attacked the cities as a horde.
Matt: There are no signs of anyone burned.
Marisha: I thought you said ash.
Laura: The people that are scouring through the rubble, are those dragonborn or just the lizard people?
Matt: Best that you can tell right now, it appears to be dragonborn.
Laura: Can we look at their behavior and see what it looks like they're doing?
Matt: Make an insight check.
Taliesin: I would like to join that insight check.
Sam: I would not like to.
Taliesin: Nine.
Liam: Nine.
Sam: I will join that insight check.
Marisha: I'll join in, too.
Matt: You've already said no.
Laura: 13. This isn't having to do with dragons? So it's 13.
Marisha: I don't do insight checks too often, I'm sorry. 22.
Matt: Did you roll or not?
Travis: Oh, I rolled a ten.
Matt: Best you can tell, they're surviving. They're scouring through the ruins, trying to find anything of worth. Some of it's finding wood and throwing it onto these little flame pyres that are scattered around the ruins. You begin to look and see that actually the sides of the ravine, there are hundreds of small caverns are carved into the rock. Not quite like a dense honeycomb style, but it looks like there is an entire cave city that lives within this ravine.
Liam: And they're not frozen over?
Matt: Some of them are covered in snow.
Liam: But snow, not blasted with ice?
Taliesin: They look like they're in use?
Matt: Some of these dragonborn, they're coming out of their huts. Some of them are still looking up at the sky nervously. They look over and see you guys approaching and a voice calls out, "Who goes there?"
Laura: Friends. Friends of Stormwinds.
Matt: "Friends of Stormwind, you say? We have friends of Stormwind. Approach."
Laura: I walk up injuredly.
Liam: I'm hobbling up behind.
Taliesin: I'm cowering.
Matt: You guys cower and approach. Keyleth, Vax, and Vex, you notice as you approach that a number of the people that have all stopped and are paying attention are beginning to move around and encircle you.
Laura: Pardon my friends, their tongues have been cut out by our captors. I'm all that's left.
Matt: As you walk forward you can see the figure that's talking to you, a very tall, burly, bronze-scaled dragonborn, long horns that protrude down the back in a slow curvature. No tail. In fact, you now notice that every single one of the dragonborn you've noticed here have no tail.
Sam: We had a 50-50 chance!
Matt: "Friends of Stormwind. That would make you Sky-walkers. I see your tails. You survive the onslaught and step into the den of those you persecuted. Well, what are your last words?"
Sam: This was a great plan.
Liam: Drop it.
Sam: I don't know what's going on.
Marisha: Is this all being said in Draconic?
Sam: It's Draconian! I don't know what's happening.
Laura: You know what, I don't know what to tell you. Everyone with a tail's an asshole. We got what was coming to us.
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Taliesin: Wow!
Laura: 19?
Matt: He turns his head to the side a bit. (spits) "What skills do you have?"
Laura: I can shoot.
Matt: "Is that all?"
Laura: He makes boots.
Matt: "That's a skill."
Laura: She's really good at stonecraft.
Matt: All the other dragonborn that come behind you are now holding spears, some of them rudimentary-looking pikes that are just held up and pointed in your direction. You guys are now enclosed by about two dozen dragonborn. "Here are your choices: You die here like the scum you are--"
Laura: Choice B.
Matt: "Then slavery it is." (laughter)
Matt: "You will join the rest of your ilk, and you will seek food for us. You will know what it's like to be bent beneath the knee of those who do not deserve it. Put them in chains!"
Laura: Oh, they're going to know, as soon as we're in chains.
Liam: Well, we're going to have a fight here.
Laura: Oh, shall we drop Seeming? Perhaps we should drop Seeming?
Sam: What? Is it going well?
Laura: Wait.
Matt: They approach, and stop for a second. A few of the folks who came over and went to grab for chains have stopped and are holding them in their hand.
Laura: I have to tell you something. We're not actually Draconian.
Matt: He leans in and gives you this very keen look now, and takes a few steps closer. He's about five feet from you now. "From where I stand, you look pretty fucking Draconian to me."
Laura: Well, we have some really good magic users with us. Look, forgive us for making tails. We don't know anything about your culture. We're idiots! We came here because we know you're under attack, and we're trying to help.
Matt: "And you just wander into the caves of the Ravenites, dressed in the face of those that broke our backs?"
Laura: Yep, because we're stupid!
Matt: Make a persuasion check with disadvantage.
Sam: Disadvantage. Not good.
Laura: 14?
Matt: 14? "Bring the chains. You have ten seconds to prove--"
Laura: Drop Seeming, just drop it.
Sam: Really? It's one of my better spells.
Laura: I know, I'm sorry!
Sam: All right, poof. We're back to normal.
Matt: All of your images fade. Everyone takes a step back. The spears come up even further, and there's a little pause.
Marisha: My tail's gone! Bummer.
Laura: No, believe me, you don't want the tail.
Marisha: But I enjoyed it.
Liam: Does this make things better or worse for us?
Laura: I repeat him.
Matt: Yeah, the reactions you get from them, you gather most of these don't speak Common and none of them seem to understand what you're saying.
Laura: Here's the thing. You're being attacked by a white dragon.
Matt: "The white dragon came, and he tore down the Sky-walkers."
Laura: So you're happy with it?
Matt: "Well, it's put us in a better position."
Laura: Right. But now that the Sky-walkers have already been torn down, do you want to keep the dragon in charge?
Matt: "We owe the dragon for the freedom that he gave us."
Laura: So you serve one.
Matt: "For the time."
Laura: And he doesn't punish you at all? He's a good master?
Matt: "Those who deserve punishment get it. But we hunt with it. It brings us power. It promises expansion of the Ravenites, and we will no longer live under the boot of those in this countryside and this continent."
Liam: How's it going?
Laura: Really bad.
Matt: "We have children to feed. We have families of our own."
Laura: How can we help?
Matt: "How can you help?"
Laura: That's what we're here for.
Matt: "Bring us food, bring us warmth, chop some firewood. Bring some trees. Work."
Laura: Gladly. But not in chains. We do this freely.
Matt: "Give us your weapons, and you can walk freely."
Sam: Let's kill them all.
Laura: I'm sorry, that's not happening.
Matt: "Then leave."
Laura: That we will.
Matt: "What is your business here, she who wanders in the faces of others?"
Marisha: That's a cool title.
Laura: Yeah, add that to the list. Our entire landscape is under attack. Now, Vorugal has helped you, but they've made many others suffer, not just Draconians. Entire cities brought down, for nothing. We're here to right the wrong and help in any way we can.
Matt: "You should talk to Tooma."
Laura: Tooma.
Marisha: Tooma. It is not a tumor.
Laura: We knew that was going to happen.
Liam: Took about 1.5 seconds to fuck with Matt's name.
Taliesin: I think he assumed.
Matt: All you're doing is putting fuel on the fire. (groaning)
Sam: Is it Tooma?
Matt: Tooma. T-O-O-M-A.
Liam: That's totally different.
Laura: Who is Tooma?
Matt: "Tooma is our chieftain. I'm not to make this decision. Come. No chains, for now." They all stay with their spears still out in front, but they nudge you forward.
Laura: I explain everything that's happening in Common as we walk. Is everyone still cool with this? We're going to the chieftain.
Sam: Just tell us when it's time to kill everybody.
Liam: We improvise. It's what we do.
Taliesin: I think this is actually going far better than I had hoped.
Sam: Just remember Vex, ticking time bomb here. We've got to get in, get out. We've got one day here.
Travis: Are there any trees that we can see as we're walking?
Laura: They actually said they wanted us to chop firewood, so if we can get sent on that mission, we're set.
Matt: Make a perception check.
Travis: Hey, 19!
Laura: Are we in the mountains? No. Are we?
Liam: 29.
Matt: You're in a ravine. Perception check was just for Grog, as he's the only one that asked to look for trees. But you rolled a 19?
Travis: I did!
Matt: Looking around, occasionally poking out of the rubble, you'll see a tree. Most of them seem to have not fared so well with the cold weather and have been snapped or broken in the process of the falling rubble. You do make out, towards the edge on the other side of the ravine, beyond this giant one, you can see this one island, one larger island of the cluster that made up Draconia, fell in the center here and is broken apart. On the far end, you can see there's a small cluster of trees, the hint of green still to them, some of them varying thickness.
Marisha: I could work with that.
Travis: Might be a long way, though.
Liam: We've been here, what, ten minutes?
Matt: I'd say about 20.
Sam: So we're going to go see Tooma, or we're going to chop down some fucking trees?
Laura: We have to go. They're walking us to the chieftain. Can't just walk away now.
Matt: You guys are prodded along, over the rubble, and as you come around you can start to see, where the outside of the island is broken rock, the center of it is broken structures. Buildings, homes, giant great marble halls, everything is mostly fallen in. You still see some structures standing, but at odd angles. There are sections of buildings that still show the outer outline of what once stood, but it is all a complete ruin. You do see every now and then a few large spikes of ice that are jutting out of portions, and you see bodies that are jabbed onto the spikes and left to freeze.
Laura: Do they have tails?
Matt: They do. You move over the bulk of this giant pile of rubble and begin to descend the other side, and you can see now there is an active village here that is half-frozen entirely. Half of it seems to be abandoned; the other half of it is completely coated in solid ice. The crowd leads you past that abandoned village to a series of tunnels against the wall, maybe 300 or 400 feet past that cluster of trees that you saw. Leads you into this tunnel, and on the inside, there are small glow stones set in portions of the stone. Not naturally forming, but essentially small natural bits of torchlight just pressed into the stonework to give some sort of a light source. You're led in for about five or so minutes. and you see other offshoot tunnels. It's like a giant anthill weaved throughout this, and you can see rudimentary furniture made of wood and stone, with limestone rock, whatever's available within the actual ravine here.
Marisha: Can I get a sense on when this was carved? If this was carved recently or if this has been here a while?
Matt: Make a nature check.
Marisha: Ooh, 27.
Matt: Best you can tell from looking at the rock and knowing the amount of erosion versus the curvature of it, these tunnels have been here for a very long time. This portion opens up and you can see now there is a much more refined, village-type structure inside, maybe 30-plus small homes carved from rock and stone. Built much better than the makeshift huts that you saw outside. You also see a giant pile of broken chains to the left side of the entryway. Many of them are manacles and neck vices that are just thrown and discarded in this large pile.
Marisha: Tiberius never mentioned this side of Draconia.
Matt: As you are brought into the center of this larger chamber you see two dozen Draconians that are out and about just currently gathering materials, talking and walking, and stop and see as you enter and just watch as you pass by. Colors range from metallic to chromatic, all spectrum; it's a mish-mash of all walks and sizes.
Liam: And the chromatic-- the red, the blue, the green-- are we seeing tails on them?
Matt: Nope.
Marisha: No tails.
Laura: Nobody has tails down here.
Sam: I could make us all Draconian again without tails.
Laura: That would probably work at this point, right?
Matt: You're led past a couple of these stone structures and there is a central, open circular plot between a lot of these. There's a fountain that seems to spring a very clean source of water within the center of this chamber. Beyond that, there is a larger temple-like square structure that has a slight trapezoidal appearance to it. The entranceway is an open arch, and you can see a large fire burning on the inside of it. You are led around the fountain and led to the inside. There, sitting on a large stone seat made of haphazard bits of rock and stone, it looks relatively uncomfortable, a large stone throne, there is a female dragonborn. She wears long, drab, gray robes, tattered at the edges, a hood loosely pulled back and a large scarf or wrap around her neck and shoulders. She just sits there with her hands over the side, draped, and as you walk in and your eyes adjust you can see that she looks very old. As you're brought in, the rest of your crew still pushes you in with the spears. She leans forward. "Are these prisoners of ours?" The dragonborn who brought you in goes, "They are, for the time being. They say they come here because the Frigid Doom and other dragons who came are killing their people, as well. They have come to fight the dragon, or so they claim. They walked in under guise of our enemy. It is your wisdom to make these choices." And the larger dragonborn bows his head and steps away, the spears pull back and they step, blocking the exits that you walked through; the entire archway now is shoulder to shoulder dragonborn with spears at the ready.
Laura: Tooma. We apologize for coming in the guise of your enemies. Unfortunately, we don't know much about your culture, and no one ever informed us of what you have suffered, and we apologize.
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Laura: 23?
Matt: You're saying this in Draconic, I assume? She leans in a bit, and the firelight crackles under her chin, and you can see the teeth on one side pull out beyond the lip, and it gives her this lopsided look. The tongue wipes across the front, and she leans in toward you. "You come here to fight the Frigid Doom, you say?"
Laura: Yes.
Matt: "I would be lying if I said it did not bring a chance for freedom to all of us Ravenites."
Laura: Much deserved.
Matt: "But as time progresses, I fear we shake one bond to step into another. The dragon presented itself as our savior, but has since required an ever-growing fealty."
Laura: They do that.
Matt: "Without the Draconians, without the Sky-walkers, and without the Doom, we would be free. Rebuild our culture."
Laura: I want nothing more for you than that. Let us help you.
Matt: Now, the rest of you hear this  "Do your friends speak Common?"
Taliesin: Oh, that's lovely.
Marisha: Hi!
Sam: Hi, yes.
Laura: Much relieved. Yes, they do.
Sam: Grog doesn't, but we do.
Travis: (moans) (laughter)
Matt: "If we are to let you go, do you promise to slay this creature?"
Laura: We will do everything in our power to watch it die.
Liam: It is our only purpose.
Matt: "It has been gone for days."
Laura: It should be back very soon.
Matt: "Took most of its army with it."
Sam: Grog was right! He's always right!
Taliesin: That was our hope, that we would be able to come here when it was at its weakest and get a sense of it.
Sam: Do you know where its lair is?
Matt: "I do."
Sam: Is it far?
Matt: "It is not far, but one hour walk."
Laura: Can I roll an insight check on her?
Matt: You may.
Laura: 19.
Matt: 19?
Sam: (gasps) Oh boy.
Taliesin: Do you know what I like as much as whispers? Loot Crate.
Sam: What? Taliesin. You've got to do better than that. Try something like this: You know, Matt's an asshole, but you know who's not? The good people at Loot Crate.
Taliesin: Loot Crate doesn't decide to just tell one person about what's going on. They let everyone know, not just Vex.
Sam: Hey, you never told us what he whispered to you before.
Matt: No, he didn't.
Liam: We're good.
Sam: Oh boy.
Liam: I'm a vampire. Just deal with it.
Matt: "If you come here to kill this dragon, I assume you have the means and a plan."
Sam: We definitely have plans.
Marisha: Totally have a plan.
Matt: "Then let us set an ambush."
Sam: Ambush? Sorry?
Marisha: Come again?
Laura: Well, we tried to do that one other time. While it did pay off, and its brother is dead, a lot of people died in the process. A lot. Very large, strong people.
Matt: "So what do you insist? We not have an ambush, we just wait for it to land and attack head-on?"
Sam: We were going to use this opportunity to find our way into its lair and find its weaknesses, and plan.
Marisha: Sabotage, from the inside.
Taliesin: There's more than one dragon, and they are supporting each other.
Marisha: We kill this one, it'll set off a chain reaction that we might not be able to recover from if we're not fully prepared.
Taliesin: We want to make the means to make sure that when the time comes, we can destroy them all in one fell swoop.
Laura: The risk here is that by destroying Vorugal--
Sam: The Frigid Doom.
Laura: We'll bring the wrath of the others upon you.
Taliesin: He is not the strongest.
Laura: Thordak is much larger, and I don't think he's been here.
Matt: "You speak with accents I do not understand. Where do you come from?"
Taliesin: Everywhere.
Marisha: We're a motley crew.
Laura: Lots of different places.
Travis: Do not answer that question.
Taliesin: We can answer the continent.
Laura: As you can see, we're half-elves.
Matt: "We are to walk to the den. We are to learn your information. Then what?"
Taliesin: Set up a situation where we can monitor you and possibly contact you when it's time, and even let you know if we think the dragon's about to leave, so that you can prepare.
Matt: "I have lived to see this day by not being deceived or tricked. You speak words that are not direct. They wind. They spin. They circle. What guarantee do I have that you will not just flee?"
Marisha: To be fair, what guarantee do we have that you won't kill us, and the ambush was meant for us? I believe there is untrust on both sides.
Matt: At which point, she steps off of the throne, steps on both of her feet, and when she's off the throne, her imposing form becomes far less imposing. You can see now there's a very heavy hunch to her back, and as she scuffles forward, she's an almost pitiful-looking sight, physically. As she pulls forward to walk straight to you, Keyleth, you see the somewhat clouded, cataract-ridden eyes of the dragonborn female Tooma. She comes up to you and goes, "We are a proud people, even when pressed into the dirt for as many years as we have been. We reclaim our honor. We reclaim our place in this world. We wish to do this as peacefully as possible, but we have been forced to scrounge and survive through this freedom. We wish you no folly. We wish you no ill will. But we also have learned that trust needs to be earned; it cannot be spoken and given so freely. Both ways. You are right to mistrust, as are we of you. But that is the impasse. One must have faith, in one way or another, if there is to be a compromise."
Marisha: I think faith and trust are not mutually exclusive. I can not trust you and still have faith, and you should not feel lack of pride for living in the dirt, or surviving. There's nothing wrong with that. But I understand your urge to want to rebuild, become the great culture that I know you all are. So you should at least trust that we have similar interests in the end.
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Marisha: Ooh! 19!
Sam: Was that opal?
Taliesin: Yes, it was.
Marisha: Opal's back! 25.
Matt: 25. She reaches forward and extends a finger that gently scrapes the bottom of the chin, not too much to hurt, but to go across the skin and pull your chin upward into the light of the fire a little bit. "There is much wisdom in there for so young a face. All right. There are not many options we have, either. Come. We will walk. And at the very least, if you decide to flee, never return."
Marisha: We can give you that word.
Laura: Tooma. Are the Frigid Doom's armies around? Will they see us?
Matt: "There are a handful of dregs that stayed behind, but you tell me you wear many faces."
Laura: We certainly don't want them to see ours.
Sam: What should we disguise ourselves as?
Matt: She points past, over your head, and goes, "Tiny gnome, the faces of those that lead you here."
Sam: Okay, tiny is uncalled for, but I understand. The faces of your tribe, of your clan. All right.
Matt: "Be glad you walk with one as wise."
Marisha: Is she talking about me? That's awesome!
Matt: She begins to shuffle over, and you watch as two of the dragonborn walk over and scoop her up shoulder to shoulder, and she shrugs them off and pushes them away. "I can walk myself." She begins shuffling, and they separate and open. She walks partway out as you guys stand there, and turns around and beckons. "Well, come."
Travis: We follow.
Laura: Can you cast Seeming again?
Sam: I can do Seeming one more time. All right.
Laura: Wait, if you cast Seeming, will we still be able to get into the--
Sam: We've still got the mansion. Handicaps me a bit, but I will cast Seeming again on the party and do the same thing, except slightly different colors and slightly less tail. (laughter)
Matt: The larger dragonborn that let you in--
Sam: My tail nub is slightly larger than the rest. It's a cube. It's a tail cube.
Matt: As the rest of the guards circle around and begin to walk, a little bit of trepidation, but going along with Tooma, the large one who let you in goes, "Tooma. Are you certain?" She turns around and goes, "Skork, there are few things that are certain in this world. I am not long for it, but if we are not to seize the opportunity of kinship, we miss the opportunity for survival. Is it a risk? Yes. Sometimes it's a risk worth taking." And she keeps walking. The rest of them gather behind, and the now-named Skork gives a nod and continues walking along.
Sam: Have we heard of Skork?
Marisha: Is that his name?
Laura: He was the guy that we talked to right when we got here.
Matt: Yeah. You guys are led out of the tunnel, back into the freezing air. The wind has picked up a bit, and you can now hear this low hum as it hits certain portions of the cavern and causes low vibrational whistles in the distance. The snow has begun to fall a little heavier now, and as you walk out, you can hear the crunch of your footsteps as you're stepping through heavier and heavier blankets of snow.
Laura: Can I tell Tooma, as we walk out  P.S., if that dragon comes back, we need to bolt.
Matt: She nods. "If that dragon comes back, we never saw you, you never saw us."
Laura: Thank you.
Matt: She's very slow, by the way. Your passage of travel is about half speed as she leads the charge, but everyone respectfully keeps in pace with her.
Sam: Tooma, have you ever heard of a dragonborn named Gern Blanston?
Matt: She thinks for a second. "That name has not come to my mind, no."
Sam: Us neither.
Matt: Pushing on, it's gotten a little lighter in the sky. You figure, based on your arrival, you may have just come in at the cusp of dawn, and the sun has now gotten higher in the sky. You're on the entire opposite side of the planet now, so the cycle has changed based on the location you're currently in. Well, you had rested, actually. You left in the morning. You would've gotten here-- actually, opposite of that. It's actually now getting to dusk. Even though it's only been a couple of hours of daylight that you've seen since you woke up this morning, it's already beginning to set, and the sky is getting darker.
Laura: We lost a day, but the dragon will still take the same amount of time.
Liam: Ugh. I'm so tree-lagged, though.
Marisha: I know. Always sucks going west to east.
Matt: You're led over a portion of the ravine, ever so slowly, that lifts up, and then as you get to the crest, it bends down into a far deeper and wider portion of the ravine. This is now the center part of this entire giant physical anomaly that is this giant crack in the ground, and you can see the bulk of the fallen city is in the center of this area.
Laura: Do we see any big trees around here?
Matt: You see a couple of larger trees that sprout out from the rubble. There's ones that managed to survive the impact of certain areas of stone, though it looks like a lot of the bark has been stripped, and they might not be alive that you can see from this distance. There are smaller trees towards the edge, and a few still protruding from portions of the walls.
Sam: Note every tree as we walk by.
Marisha: Yeah, I'm paying attention to the trees. That's the biggest tree that's now closest to us. Now that's the biggest tree that's now closest to us. Now that one.
Matt: As you're led down into the ravine, you reach this central structure, and you can already see from this distance, as the snow falls, hitting and covering the rocks, there are dozens and dozens of those spikes of ice jutting out of the rock, each with one or two various frozen corpses impaled on them and left. At the top of this, you can see a large cluster of ice that is in a somewhat round gathering, and you can see-- actually, no, you don't see that. Sorry. A note that will come into play in the future.
Travis: Can I ask a question? The bodies on the spikes. None of them look familiar, right?
Matt: You can keep watch as you go. You push towards the center of the ravine, and upon the large island of rubble, you begin to move, and it takes a good 40, 50 minutes, an hour, to traverse, a lot further than you would've expected in that time period. Sorry, a lot less than you figured you would traverse in that time, being weighed down by Tooma's gait. However, the rubble begins to subside, and you begin to see steps of ice. Not perfect, carved steps, but elements of encapsulated broken platforms of ice that act as stairs. Vax, Vex, and Keyleth, as you guys begin to move up the steps, and you especially, Vex, you can see, with what little bit of light is beginning to shine down through the ice, you can see mounds and mounds of coins and jewel boxes and many expensive knick-knacks and collections, all below feet of solid ice, all clustered towards the apex of this collapsed, ruined island.
Laura: Tooma, is Vorugal having you collect all of this?
Matt: "Vorugal sends us to pay the debt we owe for being freed, yes. We scavenge. We spend our days searching for food, for the means to survive, and finding what we can from the ruins of the broken Draconia."
Laura: And when you can't find anything? What then?
Matt: "These are the thoughts that consume me. It is the reason you are still alive." Everyone make a perception check.
Sam: Yeah, dog! 14!
Marisha: 28.
Taliesin: Natural 20.
Sam: That wasn't the golden snitch?
Taliesin: No, I put the golden snitch away for the evening.
Laura: I got a natural 20 when I dropped it. Giving up on it.
Matt: As you guys begin to approach, you can see now the ice that encases the golden coins begins to ripple upward, and it's getting harder and harder to climb. You can see now, it comes to an apex in this bowl-like formation, and as you get to a point where it's harder to ascend, you can see Tooma stops and sees that she can't go much further, and she points up and goes, "That is where it sleeps. That is where we come to give what we find. And that is where it should fall."
Laura: What is its nature? Is it vain? Does it want you to bow before it?
Matt: "It does not ask for kneeling. It asks for fear and respect. It asks us to bring the most powerful creatures in the land for it to chase."
Laura: Can I roll an insight check on her again? Jesus. This is creepy. 27.
Matt: 27.
Liam: So the box is full of loot?
Sam: No, it's a crate, Liam.
Liam: The crate is full of boxes?
Sam: Yes. A crate full of boxes. Box Crate, our best sponsor. Inside the boxes are tinier boxes.
Liam: When do you get to the loot, though?
Sam: No, it's a Russian nesting doll of boxes and crates.
Liam: Box-box.
Sam: Box-box, and then inside is a box-crate, and inside that is tiny-bag-crate.
Laura: What are you guys talking about?
Sam: Liam! Do you want all those boxes?
Liam: I need boxes.
Sam: You get $3 off the first box of boxes. Crate-crate.
Matt: All right. So. "This is its home. This is its shrine."
Laura: Check for fucking traps before we go in there.
Sam: Is it up? Is it down? Is it through?
Matt: The top comes into this giant bowl, this platform of ice, and it's almost like a nest where it sits.
Travis: A big icy dog bed.
Sam: By the way, we've been in dragons' lairs before, and the lairs themselves do things, right?
Liam: Yes, with the dragon in them.
Sam: But when the dragon's not in them they don't do anything?
Liam: My sister and I are going to have a look around. I have a question for you, though. If we make a stand here today, in theory, is it worth it to you to stand with us?
Matt: "If you feel confident. Otherwise, we walk to our death prematurely."
Laura: Yeah, let's not do that today. This is reconnaissance.
Taliesin: If all goes well, we will have one more conversation.
Liam: All right. I'm going to start searching the ground for traps.
Taliesin: I do have one other question  The bodies on the spikes. How did that happen? What was that?
Matt: "When the islands fell, there was a great fight of those that survived against the dragon. We did not join in, out of fear, and out of not knowing which side would come out. Vorugal stayed behind as the other two flew. The dragon asked us why we do not fight. We said, 'Because it is not 'our place.' The dragon said, 'Well, your place is now that of free kin.' The dragon summoned forth these spikes, and drove it through the hearts of many of the Sky-walkers. Many of us cheered, for it was a symbol that many had wished to see for a long time, but at the same time, the older ones of us... It was not what we wanted. It was not how we wished to be freed. But we had no way of stopping him. As time went on, and with each surviving Sky-walker that was found, there were no more cheers. Just the dread of knowing that maybe in time, when all the spikes are filled, it may be us on them next."
Taliesin: Thank you.
Liam: 29. Looking for any traps.
Matt: Okay. You spend the next 15 minutes or so, 20 minutes, skirting around the outside of this large frozen bowl, looking for some semblance of a set trap. You don't recognize anything as any sort of mechanism placed that would set off your warning defense systems as a rogue.
Laura: Can I stand on the top and look out from the platform and see what is visible from the platform and what areas seem hidden in the landscape?
Taliesin: I'm going to join you on that.
Matt: Both of you guys roll perception checks.
Sam: I have an idea.
Taliesin: Natural 20.
Marisha: Natural fucking 20.
Laura: I don't even need to look. Good.
Taliesin: You both saw that, right? That just fucking happened. This is not my normal die. This is something I bought at Comic Con.
Matt: Oh, it's not the dice anymore. We know that you've somehow gained the favor of some Aztec deity that's trying to reclaim its foothold in the current-day pantheon through you.
Taliesin: Sumerian, you asshole.
Matt: It would be Sumerian.
Taliesin: I'm bringing a shrine to Burning Man, by the way.
Laura: Oh, this is pertaining to dragons!
Matt: No, this is more of an icy terrain. Nevertheless, between the two of you keeping an eye out, through this Marduk Enki-loving fool over here--
Taliesin: Bless you for knowing a Sumerian deity.
Matt: You look off and see that most of it, and its design here is to be a sentry point. The reason it's built over the structure is it has a view of the entirety of this central open valley in the ravine. There are nooks and crannies. There are elements of ice that can be carved away. There are small alcoves that could be out of sight, lower beyond the ice steps and such, but there is no extremely visible pockets or things that are completely out of the visual sight from that perch. It was designed specifically to be a place to survey everything.
Taliesin: Are there other perches?
Matt: From what you can see here? There are outcroppings of stone and elements that jut out naturally from the valley wall, but it's a wide berth from each side.
Taliesin: Does this seem like the only thing, or would there be other sentry points, as well?
Matt: If flown to and held in, yeah. There are a couple of other rock areas where the dragon would be able to hold himself, but this is definitively--
Liam: Is this the highest?
Matt: Which one?
Liam: The highest.
Travis: The highest point.
Taliesin: So we have a really good vantage right now.
Matt: From here, yeah. This is the highest point in the ravine.
Taliesin: Do we see the orb? Do we see an orb?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Sam: Can I help?
Laura: We're all looking.
Taliesin: There we go. See? That wasn't great.
Sam: 28.
Taliesin: 11.
Liam: 17.
Laura: 16.
Travis: Nine!
Matt: You guys take a while glancing about. Nothing. Scanlan, you dart down and begin peering up against the ice walls that surround it. Going down into the actual scooping bowl of this dragon nest, and looking down, you can see a little glimmer of light that refracts at a different angle than the rest of the ice. A spherical surface is visible about two and a half feet below.
Sam: Okay. Do we smash it? Do we use it to make a crank call? What do we do with it? Steal it?
Laura: They'll be able to scry on us for sure if we steal it. They see us. The minute we looked into Brimscythe's.
Sam: I could do a Vorugal voice and say  Thordak, you're a cock!
Taliesin: We don't actually know his voice.
Sam: I could say  Thordak, I'm in desperate need of pay!
Laura: Do you speak dragon?
Sam: I guess you'll have to do that. What do we do? Do we break it so he can't communicate with the outside? That way when we kill him, he can't call for help.
Travis: If we do, then we violate what we said we were going to do.
Sam: What did we say we would to do? I have a great idea for how to kill this fucker.
Laura: You have a great idea of how to kill it?
Sam: Well, I have an idea. Tooma told us that they bring animals to hunt. We could be one of those animals and draw it to a certain spot.
Taliesin: And draw it to a certain spot?
Sam: Where we kill it.
Taliesin: With our...
Sam: With our army of fucking Draconians and our ice thing that we've shaped into some sort of a trap.
Taliesin: I get a distinct impression that it is not impressed by ice.
Sam: Fire trap. Rock trap.
Matt: And you're saying this out loud amongst the crew, right?
Sam: Just us.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Oh shit.
Marisha: The ears have walls.
Laura: And also, you're right in front of the scrying circle.
Liam: It's buried by ice.
Marisha: It's buried by ice, but that doesn't mean it doesn't work.
Matt: As soon as you called them Draconians, there were a few hisses from the nearby crew.
Marisha: The Ravenites.
Taliesin: Do they speak Common?
Liam: Some of them do. We spoke to them in Common.
Laura: We spoke to Tooma in Common.
Taliesin: Let's make a plan.
Sam: I just did. I made a plan. It's an ambush plan.
Taliesin: Okay, and then we go home and the dragons are at war. Then what?
Sam: What do you mean, the dragons are at war? There's only two more dragons at that point. We killed three-fifths of them.
Laura: If we attack one dragon, we start the war. That is something we've been told over and over.
Sam: What does that even mean? We've already attacked two dragons. There's been no war.
Laura: Once one more is dead, they'll probably all attack.
Sam: Attack what?
Liam: They'll stop playing nice. They'll start destroying.
Sam: We have to kill them at some point.
Taliesin: Yes, and now is not that point.
Laura: The greatest plan we have is what Grog came up with, which is pitting them against each other.
Sam: All right, so how do we use this orb to do that right now?
Marisha: Do we have to use the orb?
Sam: That's why we came here!
Laura: We came here to find out what its lair looked like.
Taliesin: What we are going to need is we need to sneak you in there, and we need you to take a movement.
Sam: What does that mean?
Liam: A poo, Scanlan.
Sam: I can't do it anymore.
Laura: What?!
Liam: What?!
Sam: I used my last magic poo to look at my daughter.
Liam: What a sentence! What a sentence.
Laura: In every aspect, Scanlan, disgusting.
Matt: That's the next t-shirt.
Travis: That's amazing. I used my last magic poo to look at my daughter!
Sam: I need to know where she is. I need to know she's okay. Gilmore can maybe make me some more potion, but I haven't wanted to bother him about it because he's busy keeping a shield around Whitestone.
Laura: Don't!
Sam: Shit.
Laura: You didn't say that out loud. You did not just say that out loud.
Sam: I said it in an accent.
Matt: That was out loud.
Marisha: All right. Hang on. Let's think about this for a minute.
Laura: Can we just step away from the orb while we talk?
Marisha: Yeah, let's do that.
Taliesin: We're not near the orb. We're near the Draconians, aren't we?
Travis: Ravenites.
Marisha: Ravenites.
Matt: They're still all gathered around the base. They walked you here and they're basically watching you set up for this ambush preparation or gathering. They're not going to leave you to your own devices. They're still not quite sure of everything.
Laura: Can we sketch what it looks like? I think you should sketch, Percy.
Sam: We need to use this opportunity. We're never going to be in this dragon's lair again! This is it. Crack the thing. Set a trap. Burn it down.
Travis: I have a suggestion.
Sam: Yes, Grog, you're the best.
Travis: The white dragon is primal, right? He likes to hunt creatures. We've got to go now. We leave. We leave them alone. That way we're not in danger, they're not in danger. We promise to come back, not only with forces to help remove the white dragon, but also with something for it to hunt. That way we're not fighting it in its fucking lair.
Taliesin: We know a lot already.
Sam: I can pretend to be a beast.
Taliesin: Scanlan, why would you bother to pretend to be a beast? If he just finds you, he'll hunt you and kill you.
Travis: We know that there are people that will work with us. We know what the terrain looks like. We know what his lair looks like, which we don't want to be in when we fight him. And we know how to get him out of it, possibly. It's a pretty successful trip.
Liam: One possibility is we could come back with Galdric, and he and I could play bait.
Sam: Galdric is the wolf, right?
Liam: He's a big fucking wolf.
Taliesin: We've made allies. We've got a look at everything. We know the terrain, and we know the political terrain.
Laura: Maybe Urukat would want to come and fight a dragon.
Marisha: He might.
Taliesin: I will also add that we can leave them with something.
Marisha: That's what I was thinking. Maybe this isn't about destroying something. Maybe it's about planting something. If we destroy anything, the dragon's going to immediately blame the locals.
Laura: What would we leave? I don't want them able to scry on us.
Travis: How about a little wine?
Taliesin: How about a small grove of trees?
Marisha: I could leave trees.
Travis: They did want trees.
Laura: I could leave trees, too.
Marisha: We also have this Scrying Eye. Can I use this remotely?
Matt: No, you have to have it in your hands to utilize it.
Taliesin: It's all right.
Travis: I like the tree idea.
Laura: Tooma, just in case something happens and a big red dragon comes to pick a fight, everyone hide. Get out of the way.
Matt: "I appreciate the advice. I can guarantee you there would be no other course of action."
Sam: Can we carve in the lair "Thordak was here" or something?
Liam: They'll know it was you.
Laura: I think we got the information--
Travis: Tooma. Forgive me, I'm not the best speaker, but we have learned from fighting these dragons that if we fight them in their lair, we are at a severe disadvantage.
Matt: "Then get it from its lair."
Travis: We are of a mind on that.
Laura: What kind of creatures do you offer to it for hunt?
Matt: "It is growing bored with dire beasts. We've even brought it to the ocean, where there were some great terrors beneath the sea, but it tore them asunder. There are, northward, large segmented insect-like creatures they call the remorhaz. That was a scuffle, but I fear the dragon grows bored."
Sam: Got to go find us a beast and bring it here.
Taliesin: No, I've got a better idea.
Liam: Spit it out.
Taliesin: Once we've gathered some resources, when we return, we prepare to attack post-hunt. Once it has exhausted itself on something large and angry, that is when we strike the dragon.
Laura: How will we be able to communicate with them, for them to let us know?
Sam: We'll be here the whole time.
Taliesin: When we come back, we stay until it's time. When we come back, it is to end this.
Liam: For now, we leave a back-door entrance.
Taliesin: With the trees, we will know how to return quickly with a force.
Marisha: This might be something we go to the Slayer's Take for. They always have a roster of big beasts.
Taliesin: With a little bit of information, we could even keep them informed of things for it to kill that they may find around here, with the Slayer's Take's help. We can keep you in supply of things to amuse it.
Matt: "I trust you know what you say. These words mean nothing to me."
Taliesin: We are sorry that this cannot end as quickly as would be agreeable. We can do our best to help make you comfortable, and if you need some proof of the power that we wield, we can offer a token. I have a thought. But if you wish, a token of our power.
Matt: "How about this. I trust you to return. Let's set a time, so we know where the limits are. Eight days."
Marisha: Wow. That's soon.
Taliesin: We can send a beast before, perhaps, but our travel is long. We may need more time. We have two more continents.
Matt: "How much time do you need?"
Laura: Two weeks.
Taliesin: Two weeks.
Matt: "Two weeks?"
Taliesin: Continents. Further than you have walked in your life. We move quickly, but there is only so much that can be done.
Matt: "Two weeks. 14 sun cycles past. If we do not hear from you, the Frigid Doom is known to this Whitestone you speak."
Laura: Fucking shit balls, Scanlan.
Liam: They're extorting us.
Matt: "Not extorting. Making sure you are of your word, because otherwise you leave us here to die on promises that are fake and false."
Liam: To-may-to, to-mah-to.
Laura: We don't do that.
Matt: "Good. Then we'll see you before two weeks is out."
Laura: Yep.
Marisha: I will leave you with a parting gift. I will leave you with a grove of trees that should be ever-growing and present.
Laura: If you do that, he'll know something is different.
Marisha: He will.
Taliesin: No. We plant one tree.
Marisha: One?
Taliesin: No, we have to plant some trees. Find a place that is secret.
Marisha: I can plant these trees anywhere. Just need solid ground.
Travis: If you can get away from the city--
Marisha: I can possibly do it subterranean.
Matt: "There is solid ground here. Up there, above the ravine, wherever else you need it to be."
Marisha: Where does the dragon not tread? Where do you know he will not see the trees?
Matt: "Probably out of the ravine. He stalks inside quite extensively."
Taliesin: Let's find a place. This will be where we leave, anyway.
Sam: Tooma. I have one more question about Gern Blanston. I raise the hand cone, and I cast Modify Memory on her.
Travis: Oh no. Oh jeez. Oh man, I love it.
Liam: Look at Matt's face.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: We're about to get attacked.
Taliesin: No, we're about to run.
Liam: Can I roll my initiative in advance?
Matt: There we go. All right, what's the DC?
Sam: 21.
Matt: What are you trying to do?
Sam: I'm trying to change the moment that I said "Whitestone" into "Emon."
Matt: You watch as she leans in, and she shakes her head for a minute and goes, "What was your question? I do not know these words you speak."
Sam: Candles. Have you ever met a candle-maker?
Matt: "I know not of a candle-maker."
Taliesin: I do have a request on our way out.
Matt: "What is your request?"
Taliesin: Would the dragon notice if any of these bodies were disturbed?
Matt: "Many, yes. But small amounts... why? If you wish to take what they have, they mean nothing to us. One or two turned over will make no difference to the dragon."
Taliesin: Pull that one down, then.
Matt: "Right." She points to it. Some of the Ravenites come over and haul one of the corpses off of the spike. It breaks off and snaps, and they bring it and throw it to the ground and step back.
Taliesin: Thank you. (sighs) It is exactly what I expect, I would assume.
Matt: The robes are familiar. The scale color is familiar.
Taliesin: I look it over. I check.
Matt: There, locked in the moments of valiant defense of his city, frozen and lost, the remains of Tiberius Stormwind, left a hero defending his people, defaced by Vorugal the Frigid Doom.
Taliesin: Let's bring him inside, at least.
Travis: Yeah. I go and I gather the remains.
Matt: They are stiff and frozen, but light enough for you to carry.
Liam: Where are we taking him?
Taliesin: I don't know. The remnants of the library, perhaps. The ground's too hard to bury.
Marisha: We can't even pretend like he was our friend.
Taliesin: No. We absolutely cannot.
Travis: I have a horrible thought. If we move him, will the dragon know we were here?
Sam: Was he on one of those stakes?
Taliesin: He was. No, I checked. Unless he's very clever and very keen, and I don't think they are. I think that if they knew, he would be in a more exalted position of defacement. I think this is just slaughter. Things vanish. I'm all right with making this vanish. That's as much of a calling card as I feel we need to leave.
Travis: Where should we bring him?
Sam: His home doesn't really exist anymore.
Marisha: His home was with us.
Laura: Back to Emon.
Taliesin: I have a thought.
Liam: To our keep. It was very important to him.
Sam: This is his place.
Taliesin: We're not bringing him to us. We're leaving him here, but we're putting him somewhere appropriate.
Liam: We'd take him away. Can you melt ice and snow, and we'll lay him here?
Taliesin: Put him with the books.
Laura: He always loved them.
Sam: For now, anyway. And then when we free this place, we can find a proper tomb for him.
Travis: We take him back to where the frozen books lay.
Matt: You find the remnants of the library. As you find a section of the stone rubble that's loose enough, you pull it open, and there beneath, you can see there are hundreds and hundreds of books, many still pristine, if a little soggy from the melted snow. You gather a lot of time was spent in this library in his youth, and it's probably as good a place as any to leave his memory for the time.
Laura: Are any of the Ravenites around us, or are we alone?
Matt: They're keeping their distance, but they're watching. You get the sense that they understand what's going on, but they're not taking any offense to it.
Taliesin: This will do.
Liam: I start pulling books out.
Marisha: I start melting ice.
Laura: Is Lockheed still on my shoulder?
Matt: Lockheed is still on your shoulder.
Laura: I bring him down so he can say goodbye.
Matt: As the ice melts, color comes to the body. You can see the tattered robes that show a fierce battle was fought. Regardless of this condition of finding him, knowing him as well as you did, he still probably left a hero. As you lay him down on the books, mostly thawed now, Lockheed finds a moment of recognition and immediately flutters onto his chest and curls up, mews a bit, nibbles at the chin.
Liam: I'm going to sit three or four feet away from him, facing him, and start privately thanking the Raven Queen for ushering him on.
Travis: I'm going to take a chalice out of the bag of holding, and I begin to fill it with ale, and then remember he preferred water, and I take the alchemy jug and I pour fresh water into the chalice and lay it with him.
Marisha: I take and I rip off a piece of his robes. Tuck it away.
Taliesin: Can you seal it?
Matt: As you guys step back, the nearby stone clatters to life.
Laura: I get Lockheed out of there. I don't want him to stay in. Do you want to come?
Matt: Lockheed resists and resists and doesn't want to leave.
Laura: In Draconic I say  It's all right.
Matt: Lockheed curls up onto his face and nibbles a bit on the forehead, then turns back and flutters up onto your shoulder. The stonework clatters closed over the top of the rubble of the library.
Marisha: Keyleth drops to her knees and starts crying.
Matt: Vax. In this moment of sadness, there is a bit of warmth, as you sense, though remote as it is through the Divine Gate, the Raven Queen's assurance that his spirit has made it to the other side.
Laura: I put my hand on Keyleth's shoulder. He loved you well, princess.
Marisha: He was so stupid.
Liam: He meant well.
Taliesin: I'm going to find Tooma. Is she behind us?
Marisha: He should have never left our side.
Taliesin: Hopefully, this war will go on schedule. But there's our promise. That's the best you're going to get. I head out.
Marisha: I follow Percy.
Sam: I turn around and say  Goodbye, old friend. We'll come back and we'll fix this. Because this is... poppycock.
Matt: As you gather yourselves up, here amongst the ruins of Draconia, the last of the sky's light, the sun has faded and the night has taken its form. You hear the distant caws of the evening birds as they begin to take to the skies above the ravine. Tooma and the rest of the Ravenites give a nod as you join hands. Keyleth?
Marisha: Let's go home.
Taliesin: Yes, let's. There's much to do.
Marisha: Back to Whitestone.
Laura: Were you going to leave a tree?
Marisha: Yeah.
Taliesin: We let them know where the grove would be found, before we left them.
Marisha: I do Plant Growth. Make a big old tree.
Matt: All righty. Where do you create the tree?
Marisha: Wherever we decided it was best to create the tree.
Laura: Outside of the ravine.
Taliesin: At the top. A little grove of trees.
Matt: Which, with a simple use of the broom or wild shape, you can make your way up there, find a small patch of bushes, create a single tree that didn't exist there previously, a small sapling now grown to full height. The bastion of a promise to be kept. Keyleth returns. You take hands. You step through the nearest tree as the portal opens, and find yourself emerging from the other side of the Sun Tree, back in Whitestone.
Marisha: I give the Sun Tree a little pat.
Matt: The morning sun begins to rise.
Taliesin: We'll report what we've seen. We'll try to gain our bearings again, get sleep tonight. We'll report what we've seen in the new room. No one else. And we will never utter this city's name outside these walls again.
Sam: Totally. Dick move.
Matt: You find yourselves to rest, keeping memories fresh untill sleep takes you.
Marisha: Knock on Vax's door.
Sam: Oh god.
Matt: All right. As everyone else is going to rest, Keyleth, you find your way to Vax's door.
Marisha: Can I stay with you tonight?
Liam: I don't fuck anything up with words, and I open the door.
Sam: What?
Liam: I'm not going to fuck it up by saying anything. I open the door.
Marisha: I just go in.
Matt: Whether or not you are taking the time to sleep or ruminate on the events, as it's only been half a day since last you woke up, you take some time with Lockheed. He eats a little more food and leaps to the window of your room, and then takes off over the rest of Whitestone. You process this time, this moment, this memory, and realize how much has been lost through this journey, but yet how much is worth saving. How much is worth fighting for. And then, as much as you bunch of fuck-up misfits that came together as friends years ago have come to a point of understanding your true worth and what the importance is of really standing up for the things that you believe in in this world, and the people that need protecting, and know that the next step of your journey should come soon. Whether you stand or fall, this is the fight that needs to be fought. And with luck be at your side, that terrible fucking dragon will meet its end soon enough. And with that we'll pick up next week on Thursday.
Taliesin: Glad we decided to take a light-hearted game.
Sam: It's a fun romp after the Feywild, a fun romp.
Liam: Bar hop! Bar crawl!
Marisha: I need a stiff drink.
Matt: I was simultaneously looking forward to and not looking forward to the return to Draconia for that reason.
Laura: Man.
Matt: We'll pick it up next week, guys.
Marisha: Yay.
Matt: I'm sorry. Sorry, guys. Sorry to you.
Laura: Thanks, Loot Crate.
Sam: $3 discount.
Travis: Pour one out for Tibs. We will be.
Matt: Not all narrative is bright, but it has its purpose.
Sam: We're next. (laughter)
Matt: We love you guys. Thank you for sticking through us for an emotionally draining evening. We'll be back next Thursday to see the next length of Vox Machina's journey. Is it Thursday yet? Good night.

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons and Dragons at the same table. Thank you so much for your patience. As mentioned last week, we're adjusting and changing and updating things and taking your feedback and our feedback, and everyone's been working really hard to make this set progressively better and better to make it a better experience. This is our first time all at the same table since the home game. (cheering)
Matt: But no, seriously, don't do that. That's okay.
Marisha: Still in front of a green screen.
Matt: Still in front of a green screen. Totally. Thank you guys so much for being patient. We are up now, and let's dive into the announcements for the evening. We don't have a whole lot this week, but we have, let's see. Any updates as far as the merch is concerned?
Laura: The merchandises? Well, you know, we do have that amazing David Mack poster.
Sam: But I thought that was only a limited-release item, Laura.
Laura: It is, actually, but it's available for three more weeks. The signed version is available for two more weeks. And since it is a limited-time release thing, if you know anybody that watches the show but is maybe way behind and they're not watching live, it would probably be nice to let them know about it, because I still get some messages about the Joe Mad poster that people can't get anymore. So it will be gone after this, so it's nice if they can get it, too. And we have the Scanlan tee, and we have our amazing Slayer's Take aprons. Slayer's Cake aprons.
Sam: Let's talk about the Scanlan t-shirt a little more.
Laura: We have the amazing Scanlan concert tee.
Travis: That asshole? No, we're good.
Laura: And, you know, a bunch of other t-shirts as well, and a whole bunch of other things. Go check out the shop on geekandsundry.com and you'll see all of the merchandise that's available.
Matt: All right, cool. Also, a reminder, guys, the Tal'Dorei campaign guide's coming out at GenCon in August. Pre-orders go up, I believe, mid-July, and I think if you pre-order it, I think it's like five extra bucks or something like that, you get the PDF download immediately. All the information is on Green Ronin's website, so go check it out if you have any questions there, because they can answer them better than I can. I'm steeped in art approvals and everything right now.
Marisha: The art is looking so good!
Matt: It's looking awesome. We've pulled in some-- we've got a lot of community artists that we pushed over towards Green Ronin, so they've been pulling people from the community, which makes me happy, because I want to get as many of you guys involved as possible in this.
Laura: As many of us as possible?
Liam: I can't draw for shit.
Sam: I can do some art.
Matt: I was referring to the community, not you guys.
Travis: Sam's art is really rare.
Matt: Yeah, I've seen it, and it's pretty... yeah. They all wind up looking like genitals. It's crazy. We have the podcast, which is now up. (cheering)
Matt: Audio podcast, for people who want to save their data and listen on long drives.
Laura: Who don't want to look at our faces.
Matt: I don't blame you.
Travis: For no other reason than for those Sam Riegel advertisements at the beginning.
Matt: So we got that. And we have Wednesday Club.
Taliesin: Yeah, Wednesday Club next week. I don't actually know what we're doing, because I haven't looked at the 30-plus messages in that text thread, because I've been working on a thing that I can't talk about yet that's going to be really, really great.
Sam: Taliesin, I feel like most of the time you don't know what you're going to be talking about.
Taliesin: That's true.
Sam: So maybe you should just have a go-to. Like, it's going to be Daredevil again. Or something. Just something.
Taliesin: What are we going to-- yeah, we need a go-to. What was going to be our blanket go-to? I'm not sure.
Travis: Punisher.
Marisha: Great Lakes Avengers
Taliesin: Great Lakes Avengers is actually pretty spectacular. It's hard to say it. Great Lakes Avengers.
Matt: Make a big effort to bring back the What the--?! comics.
Liam: What about the scientology graphic novels?
Taliesin: I haven't read those. Do they have those?
Liam: Well, I'm up to level six. (laughter)
Taliesin: Do you want to be a guest on the show?
Matt: You've almost learned invisibility! Anyway. Apologies to all our scientology fans.
Sam: Yeah, we just lost half the audience.
Matt: All right, so.
Liam: Sea Org uniforms, watching a giant-screen TV of Critical Role. (laughter)
Matt: Exactly. And Signal Boost?
Marisha: Jeff Lewis. We announced it on Tuesday on Talks. Yeah, Jeff Lewis, still Jeff.
Matt: All right, cool. Then, unless we have anything else to announce, let's get into tonight's episode of Critical Role. [dramatic music]
Matt: Welcome back. So, getting us up to speed as to what happened last time. Vox Machina had recently been visited by an old ally, Scanlan Shorthalt, who had spent the past year or so--
Laura: An old ally.
Matt: Yeah. Hey. Building a reputation and a criminal ring in Ank'harel as a forging master in various types of furniture and accoutrements. And upon realizing through the aid of one his hired help, Lionel, or Chud. Chad? Chod. Whatever the various pronunciations were that came through. Discovered that there was a second sphere, apparently on some sort of pyramid-like ziggurat structure not far from Ank'harel. Upon you returning as Scanlan to notify the party, you all made your way to Ank'harel, briefly met with Kaylie, and saw a little bit of the setup that they've been building for the past year or so, and then made your way towards the Smouldercrown Mountains to the southeast of Ank'harel, where apparently this structure resides and this cult, that is apparently sacrificing objects of magical power towards this black sphere. So you made your way to the outskirts of this mountain, discovered that the entrance that was previously there had been collapsed, and discovered a new, carved entrance into the mountain, were beset by a few traps, made your way into a far corner, set up a mansion, and after dealing rather briskly with a cluster of undead that had built up on the outside of your entryway to your magnificent mansion, you made your way to the final chamber where the structure was residing. A number of cultists there were in the process of quickly, hastily throwing these objects to the top and then noticed that you had come as interlopers into this space. At which point you realized the head of cult, at least this group here at the top of the pyramid, was none other, seemingly, than Lady Delilah Briarwood.
All: No, no, no!
Matt: Who then protected herself and two of her cult members beneath the veil of a Prismatic Wall in the shape of a sphere, and you did battle with a number of undead and other cultists and followers of the Whispered One that involved largely just throwing a bunch of them into the ceiling, including yourselves, thanks to a well-placed Reverse Gravity. Scanlan had darted past the Prismatic Wall with a clever use of Dimension Door.
Sam: Should've died.
Matt: Actually, no. Looking at the rules, too. It was a good call to bring it back, in my opinion. But nevertheless, they escaped seemingly into the sphere, Delilah and two of these cultists, after turning it from this glowing white back into its black magic-absorbing self, leaving you all there. Managed to cleanse Pike of her Feeblemind spell, and after acquiring a few of these magical artifacts that were left unbroken, and some cult robes, and apparently symbols of this cult of the Whispered One, you now stand in the middle of this cavern on the outside of where this second Ziggurat exists, deciding what to do next, and what the next step of this journey means for you. So, Vox Machina, what would you like to do?
Laura: What should we do next? What does the next step on this journey mean for us?
Liam: I'm getting wicked deja-vu, brah.
Marisha: That was so existential of you, Vex. Wow.
Laura: No, but really. What should we fucking do? Should we go through it?
Marisha: That was a really meaty spell she had. I've never seen that before.
Ashley: Thank you, Keyleth, for bringing me back.
Sam: I don't know how much time has passed since the fight, but can Taryon cast Revivify on Doty still?
Matt: No, that much time has passed, unfortunately.
Laura: Doty's gone again?
Travis: Did you lose a second one?
Sam: I came back to get him!
Travis: He's like iPhones, they just come out every so often.
Taliesin: The Doty 6 is going to have a much better camera. It's going to have better voice recognition. You're really going to be happy with it.
Matt: You could use the same funds to bring that Doty back, it would just take you the week in reconstruction anyway. But you're not losing that Doty. The other one, you unfortunately lost in the City of Dis, but this can be brought back at the same cost of a new one. So you're not having to reconstruct an entirely new Doty.
Marisha: Recycling.
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: But I have to get his body somewhere.
Matt: Yes, you do.
Sam: Great.
Taliesin: I kind of want to collapse this cave.
Travis: With us in it?
Taliesin: No, not with us in it. I don't think we can destroy the ziggurat, but I think we can at least make it extremely difficult to find and get to, and make it very uncomfortable for anything that tries to come through.
Laura: That's true. That would be smart.
Sam: But then we can't come through.
Laura: We have another entrance. We have the one in Whitestone.
Liam: Also, though, this is an exit. Do you want the only exit to be in your basement? The only one? Or are there more of these places?
Sam: Also, does each portal go to the same place, or do they go to different parts?
Taliesin: We saw the spire in both images, correct?
Matt: With the brief glance through the-- Well, the arrow was in the one beneath Whitestone. Through your connecting with Sarenrae, the vision that you received through that portal seemed to be very similar to what Vex described seeing through her arrow.
Laura: It could be the same portal or they could both be within view of the tower.
Taliesin: I'm imagining a circle of spheres.
Marisha: And both seem to suck magic in, correct?
Laura: Yeah, they do the same thing.
Taliesin: I think we'll have an easier time keeping track of what is coming in and out if we just have one to deal with as opposed to two.
Laura: That's assuming there's only two.
Travis: Is it a stupid idea to shoot another Oracle Arrow through this one and see if it looks the same?
Taliesin: I don't know if we have the option.
Laura: I can try, but in Whitestone, there was at least a visual path toward the ball, but I don't think there is one here, is there?
Matt: Not within the radius.
Laura: Not within the magic orb.
Marisha: It's too tight a room?
Liam: I think I like your idea, but I worry that we're upping the odds of-- Listen, we just found out that she's alive, or something. She's going to unleash some sort of fresh hell somewhere. We're upping the odds of it happening under your living room.
Taliesin: I know. It's just, what if it happens in both places at once?
Laura: What if we collapse the one in Whitestone?
Taliesin: It's directly under the castle. We would have to maybe fill it with, I don't know. Submerge it or some such.
Laura: At least try to block off the entrance to where they can't get out.
Marisha: Is there an underground water source near Whitestone?
Taliesin: There's acid pits.
Marisha: We could try and flood it with acid.
Ashley: What if we blocked off that entrance when we go inside?
Taliesin: Let's at least make sure this cave is collapsed. We'll leave the chamber standing, but every entrance to this cave should be collapsed. We know there's three of them.
Laura: What if we block this one, and then we block the one in Whitestone, and then we just--
Sam: Game over!
Laura: I think we win, then, right?
Taliesin: We'll be able to get back in if we need to, we just want to make sure that no one can wander in and out of here without making a bit of a ruckus.
Laura: So there are three entrances that we know of, and we need to block all of them.
Taliesin: One's already blocked.
Sam: And one, do we know where it is?
Laura: There's one up top that we heard about.
Liam: How much time do I have left on my wings? A lot, probably, like a half hour or 40 minutes? It wasn't that long.
Matt: Well, no, actually, because when you used your wings outside, you guys came inside. Did you use your wings during the battle?
Liam: Yeah, I did.
Matt: Did you guys take a long rest?
Taliesin: We did, because we had the mansion.
Matt: You did. So by this conversation happening, the rummaging through the bodies, inspecting the vicinity, I'd say you maybe have 20 more minutes on your wings.
Laura: Oh yeah, did we rummage through the bodies? Let's rummage through those bodies.
Matt: You did, that's how you found the objects.
Marisha: While they rummage, Keyleth wants to test the radius.
Sam: No, we found the objects on that cart.
Matt: That's right, you found them on the cart. You did not actually rummage through the bodies.
Laura: Is there anything on the bodies?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Laura: Whoa, that was high. 23.
Matt: 23, okay. Over the next 15 or so minutes, as you go through and begin to gather the corpses, most of the skeletons out here that have armor on, it's old, rusted, destroyed, broken armor, and the weapons either fell apart in the battle against you or are just barely usable or functional at this point in time. Of the various cultists' bodies, the armor on the black guard that you were battling is a pretty nice-looking set of full plate. You also find similar symbols, these dark iron necklaces that you found on the previous cultists.
Laura: We'll take those. We can take the plate armor if there's room for it in the bag, and then see if it's actually magical outside of the field.
Taliesin: How many of those necklaces have we found?
Matt: Six.
Taliesin: Six necklaces.
Laura: All right, and we already had two, so now all of us have one.
Travis: I can make room in the Bag of Holding for the armor, but I have to get rid of one of these two bodies. Does anybody object if I throw one of the bodies at the little black marble?
Liam: I would kind of like to see that.
Taliesin: Actually, I think that's a pretty good idea, but you have to remove it from the bag before you walk over to the marble.
Travis: I have to what?
Taliesin: You have to remove the body from the bag before you walk over.
Travis: Oh right, okay. So can I walk back to the fork?
Taliesin: Remove them both.
Travis: Back to the fork. I pull out-- both? We only need one.
Taliesin: All right.
Travis: I pull one body out.
Laura: He likes to save his bodies for later.
Travis: Listen, I'll run my store the way I run my store. I pull one body out.
Matt: Which, just as a note, the visual of Grog pulling this body out of the Bag of Holding is much like trying to pull a Slim Jim out of the wrapper. It pulls weird and you have to yank.
Travis: What an analogy. The sausage without the casing.
Matt: Yeah, it's like by sections, and you watch him strain as you pull some out and it folds over. It's just really awkward and awful. But yeah, you manage to get the body out.
Travis: Close the Bag of Holding and I just drag him back over.
Matt: (impacts) Up each step.
Travis: Everybody ready? And a one, and a two, and a (whoosh).
Matt: As you throw it, it impacts, and you watch as the body stops in mid-air from the gravity, stopping where it stands. Its legs fold over, and like a broken physics engine, you watch as the body (crackling) twists, cracks, and gets sucked in.
Laura: Let's not do that. Let's not go through that hole.
Travis: It really doesn't seem that bad.
Taliesin: I kind of want to experiment. Would you mind losing one of the necklaces, or no?
Laura: We can try.
Taliesin: Let's put a necklace on the other cadaver and then throw it through.
Travis: I literally just walked all the way over there and now you want me to go back?
Taliesin: You need the cardio, let's not pretend you don't. We're going to put one of the necklaces on the body and throw it through. It'll still be fun to watch.
Travis: I walk back out of the realm of the thing, pinching my belly fat because apparently Percy thinks I'm a couple pounds heavy.
Laura: It's all that ale, Grog.
Taliesin: I can only mock you on graph paper. I take what I can fucking get, man.
Travis: I'll pull the other Slim Jim out of the bag.
Matt: (suction sound) You place one of the various symbols around its neck and then Babe Ruth-style lob it, and you watch as it gets within a certain proximity, the orb seems to shimmer and shift open ever so slightly. It's similar to what you saw, it opened to a mouthed gateway when Delilah and the other cultists walked through. The body still rattles, and you watch it twist a bit, but it's a far less impactful transition.
Laura: All right, so now we have seven of those things, and we have to get eight of us through.
Taliesin: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, yes. Somebody will have to stay behind, but we'll figure that out if we go that direction. There's other options.
Sam: Who's the eighth?
Taliesin: You.
Laura: You and you, bitch.
Sam: I live in Ank'harel and I'm a crime boss.
Laura: Yeah, and you're here with us now.
Ashley: You're not planning on going with us?
Sam: I hadn't been invited.
Laura: Scanlan.
Travis: That was pretty-- I mean, from a third party, non-influenced or partial perspective, flipping gravity was pretty cool.
Liam: Plus, he's got a lot of big words now. You want to be around to see them in action.
Marisha: Technically, I can flip gravity. I don't know. I felt like I should put it on the table.
Sam: Oh, okay, see, you don't really need me after all.
Marisha: No, that's not what I meant. I just wanted to be honest.
Laura: I haven't seen you do it.
Marisha: Well, it hasn't been relevant yet.
Liam: You're also really clever. Forget your spells. And funny, and it's good to have you around, so yeah, do you want to go someplace really horrible with your family, or what?
Sam: All right. Are you all offering?
Travis: I don't know, Pike. Can he earn his way back in in this manner?
Ashley: Well, I do think we could use the help.
Sam: The help. Okay, that's good enough for me. I'm in. Will fancy boy be joining us?
Ashley: Are you jealous of him?
Sam: No. He's part of the team.
Ashley: He is part of the team.
Laura: Tary, what do you think?
Sam: Shit! This again!
Liam: Tary, it's up to you, but you were talking about going back.
Sam: I'm sorry, I was busy caring for my deceased robot.
Laura: Is Doty...
Sam: No, he's fine. He'll be fine. I just have to rebuild him. It'll take some time and money, which I don't have.
Ashley: I wish I could help, Tary, but I think that's out of my...
Taliesin: We can get him back to Whitestone, he'll be perfectly fine. We have everything we need there.
Sam: All right. I need him for the brigade!
Taliesin: Of course.
Laura: The brigade, right.
Sam: Yes. But I can't carry him. Grog, would you be able to...
Matt: "I can carry him!" And you look over and Chod goes over and grabs Doty. (grunt) "Should I put him somewhere?"
Sam: Not yet, Chod. Wait until we get somewhere where I can work on it.
Matt: "Okay."
Taliesin: I say we head back to Whitestone. We gather resources, we figure out how we're getting where we're going to get.
Marisha: We could theoretically forge more of these, right? Or do you think they're blessed?
Taliesin: Let's find out. We now know they work.
Liam: I wonder if we could take them to Allura or to Shaun.
Laura: Well, have Tary Identify them. Maybe it's something specific.
Marisha: Yeah, are they magical, Tary? Are these magical?
Sam: Let me look.
Laura: Outside of the field.
Marisha: Outside of the field.
Matt: They are magical. It's a mild enchantment. It's not extremely strong, but it is very specific, and it is more of an attunement to a specific plane. It has something to do with whoever's bearing it, or whatever's wearing it, is already partially crossed to a certain extent, so it limits the impact of the transition.
Sam: Okay. I don't understand any of that. But there you have it.
Laura: Do you have any more Identify left?
Sam: Sure.
Laura: Can we have you Identify the plate armor that the big guy was wearing, so we can see if it's magical?
Sam: I do that.
Matt: Very well. So this is Plate Armor of Resistance to radiant.
Laura: So it's immune to Pike.
Taliesin: It's anti-Pike armor.
Marisha: Well, that kind of clues us in on a lot, actually.
Sam: Chod can't use that, can he?
Matt: Do you ask this question of him?
Sam: Chod, can you use this?
Matt: "Can I have it?"
Sam: I mean, do we need it?
Ashley: Well...
Sam: Do we need it?
Taliesin: Yes, let's not...
Sam: Do we need it?
Taliesin: Yes.
Travis: Radiant means all gods or just good gods?
Laura: Just good gods I think.
Taliesin: I would like to put somebody in this armor in Whitestone so that whoever comes through the portal, the first thing they see is something that they feel comfortable and familiar with.
Matt: "Those boots are better than my boots. Can I have the boots?"
Taliesin: Yes. Well, what kind of boots are they?
Matt: It's full armor plate. They're still part of the armor set.
Taliesin: We can get you something else nice. I have a plan for this armor!
Laura: I have so many things. Wait, hold on, Chod. There's-- Oh, Chod! Do you want a jewelry box that makes music?
Ashley: No, you can't give him that jewelry box!
Matt: He leans over to Scanlan. "Hey, boss. Do I want a jewelry box?"
Sam: Yes. Just say yes.
Matt: "Yes, I would love a jewelry box. Thank you."
Laura: Do you? It makes music. You like music.
Matt: "It makes music, do I want it?"
Sam: When a girl offers you something, you just say yes.
Matt: "Yes, please. Take all of it." Now he's carrying the music box and Doty. (laughter)
Laura: I'll mark that off.
Liam: Lionel, I have the perfect thing for you. And I pull out the metal skullcap.
Matt: "That's loud."
Laura: Wait. Wait. Is that the Clarota one?
Liam: No, that's the Lionel Gayheart one. People will have a harder time fucking with you, in general.
Laura: That is the Clarota one, wasn't it? You're giving the Clarota thing, the resistance-to-mind stuff?
Liam: Yes, I am.
Laura: Because we could maybe use that.
Travis: Yeah, there's still an idiot in this group.
Laura: Yeah, there's maybe a Grog in the group that could totally use it!
Liam: I've had this hat for years.
Laura: I know! So maybe you should remember that you have it and give it to fucking Grog!
Liam: I've known that I've had it, and I've talked to him about it. No one's ever asked about it, you've never asked about it.
Laura: I didn't know you had it!
Liam: You are a hoarder. You are many good things--
Laura: No! I'm just saying, if Grog has resistance to mind control, then that would be really good for us in a fight with somebody that's really powerfully--
Liam: Grog. This skullcap that Lionel is wearing requires attunement. Would you like to give up one of your really lethal weapons--
Travis: No. Didn't we talk about this?
Laura: I didn't know it required attunement.
Taliesin: Sense of dignity, perhaps?
Travis: Ooh, hey! Is he heavy? Don't you have your own Bag of Holding?
Matt: "No."
Travis: Oh.
Laura: Not everybody has a Bag of Holding, Grog.
Travis: I'll just give him mine. (laughter)
Laura: We just give him everything.
Taliesin: We would turn on you so fast. Let's get back to Whitestone.
Laura: Okay, okay, okay. How do we collapse these tunnels--
Matt: "You guys can keep putting things on me. That's fine."
Taliesin: Well, we have, thankfully, a professional tunnel collapser.
Laura: Well, that's true!
Travis: Yep. Oh, me?
Taliesin: So let's find the upstairs entrance and get rid of that--
Laura: I'll do that from outside.
Marisha: I was trying to test the radius of this sphere, too. Am I still doing that? Is that still relevant?
Taliesin: Well, it's worth noting just in case we cannot find the opening.
Matt: It comes to about 180 feet from the actual sphere.
Marisha: Wow! That's a long way. It's the same as the other one?
Matt: It's similar from when you originally tested it. It was about the width of the whole chamber underneath Whitestone. And that chamber was more cleared out, more of the actual structure was visible. This one is still partially buried and you're only seeing the upper half of it.
Marisha: Okay.
Liam: Do I even have the ability to fly in here? Is there an outer edge where the magic is not--
Matt: In that chamber, you cannot fly.
Liam: Cannot. Okay.
Laura: And I feel like we're going to run into traps if we try to find it from this way. Maybe find it from the outside and just collapse it.
Taliesin: All right.
Laura: That way we don't have to go through a series of shit.
Taliesin: Let's double-reinforce, just pile-drive the one that's already a little collapsed and make it really collapsed. And then we'll collapse the others while we're leaving.
Laura: Yeah.
Travis: (happy grunts) Is that permission?
Taliesin: That is more than permission. That is permission and an audience. We're very excited.
Travis: That's amazing. I'll go for it, and I'll whack on a wall. Do I just hit a wall anywhere?
Laura: Just in the tunnels, maybe?
Sam: Wait. You're an engineer, aren't you?
Taliesin: Yes. No, we're going to be pointing at the things that need to collapse.
Travis: Okay, I'm ready any time.
Laura: Do you want to go up and see if we can find the thing up top?
Marisha: Yeah! Sure! You guys have fun collapsing.
Laura: It's daytime now, right? Outside?
Matt: At this time, it would be. Yes.
Laura: So can me and Keyleth go try to find the entrance up top so we can do something to that one? Matt: Sure, okay.
Travis: Or should we wait 'til we collapse the tunnels?
Taliesin: Well, they can find theirs while we get our tunnels collapsed.
Travis: Yeah, I'm sure it won't fall on me. No big deal.
Ashley: I'm going to help! I'm going to help you.
Travis: Yeah!
Ashley: Yeah.
Marisha: If it falls on you, we can fish you out. Just survive a little bit.
Ashley: Keyleth's got our back. She'll burrow in and pull us out.
Laura: Just earring us if something happens.
Marisha: Badger. Badgers burrow, right? Do badgers burrow?
Liam: They do burrow.
Travis: That's why I said stay, but that's all right!
Matt: (laughs) All righty. So you guys all make your way back to the second entrance, the hidden, illusory one. You all back out of it, leaving just Pike and Grog on the inside.
Taliesin: And we're helping them figure out where to punch to make everything--
Matt: Okay, cool. So I need you to go ahead and make an investigation check.
Taliesin: All right.
Matt: And you can assist him, which gives him advantage.
Sam: Ah. I will assist you.
Taliesin: Thank you. Oh, yes. That's excellent. It's a 19. (laughter)
Matt: Total of 19? Okay. Halfway through the hallway, you find the place where the initial collapse was started. Or you start looking to see what they used to destroy the first entrance that you were supposed to come through. You can see the way it's carved, designed, especially the smooth entrance. Which, now that you get a better look at it, that soft, spongy ground, that dust you were finding: you begin to recognize the pattern of what carved its way in. You saw it used at the top of the Emberhold when you were fighting the queen there. It was a series of Disintegration rays used to carve away into this mountain. That's what that dust is that's on the ground. And why it's such a smooth entrance on this side.
Marisha: But I rolled so shitty on that nature check before, right?
Matt: Mm-hm. However, because it was just a series of magic Disintegrations pushed through to create this second opening, it's a little harder to find points in the structure where the weakness is. So you begin to cut away at some areas, you get like a small axe or one of the various objects that you've-- pointed objects that you've acquired over the--
Travis: I do have just a regular pickaxe.
Matt: Yeah. And you just hit at some areas, and you do find one section where you would think it would be a relatively weak point of impact between the various rocks and stones that hold this up.
Taliesin: Hit this and stand on this side of it, and that should do some intense damage.
Matt: You would recommend hitting it and then running.
Taliesin: And run in this direction. (laughter)
Travis: Okay, Pike.
Ashley: Yeah.
Travis: I want you to warm up this spot for me, and then you're going to jump on my back and then I'm going to hit it.
Ashley: Okay. I jump on your back now?
Travis: No, no, you hit it.
Ashley: Like a backpack?
Travis: Yeah, and then you can come up on my back.
Ashley: Oh, I hit it.
Liam: Do we jump on three, or is it one, two, three, go?
Matt: Pike. Go ahead and make a strength check, as Grog throws you up to the ceiling to where the one place in the rock structure is.
Ashley: Yeah boi.
Travis: Ready to run, just in case she just goes beast mode.
Marisha: We should make little Pike backpacks.
Laura: Oh my gosh, how cute would that be?
Sam: With, like, Ashley's face right here. (laughter)
Ashley: No, guys, that doesn't need to be anywhere.
Liam: We'll just repurpose those Yoda bags.
Ashley: 13.
Matt: 13? Okay, so you take her and you alley-oop and you (impact) hit it and you watch it (cracking) and some dust falls and settles. A couple of small pebbles (falling pebbles). And you grab her like, oh! Okay, seems okay for now.
Travis: All right. Get on, Yoda.
Ashley: I try to wrap my legs around, but they don't go.
Travis: I rage first.
Marisha: Just her but with, like, a jockey on a horse. (straining)
Matt: Okay, so it just happens naturally. So go ahead and roll a strength check with advantage.
Marisha: Those gnomish thighs.
Travis: 23.
Matt: 23. So for the height of the cavern here, you get yourself a nice-- you crouch low and full shoryuken-style, like (impact) punch into the roof and as you hit it, impact and go clean through and bring it to the ground. Land, and you hear the (crumbling).
Taliesin: All right, run.
Matt: You guys start bolting through, and as you're rushing, Pike, you're looking over and you can see the walls (impacts). You guys are bolting out as well. Both of you guys go ahead and make dexterity saving throws, please.
Travis: I forgot we had to roll for this part.
Ashley: Me too.
Travis: I got advantage.
Laura: Oh god, don't drop Pikeys.
Travis: Oh, that's good.
Ashley: Okay okay, 16.
Travis: 20. No-- 18.
Matt: Okay, so as you guys are bolting, you're holding onto Grog, and you manage to look behind just fast enough to see one of the walls is about to full-on collapse at the side, and you go ahead and grab the side of Grog's ear and yank his vision that way.
Travis: (groan)
Ashley: Just going to start kicking him in the side.
Matt: He starts turning off to that side, and you manage to just avoid that side of the wall as it (impact).
Sam: Gif it! Gif it! (laughter)
Matt: So you start steering him from behind like a prized racehorse, and making your way through this cavern until eventually the back half of the cavern collapses and comes to a rest. The front half is not collapsing, but you do-- you have a large portion of the path leading to the ziggurat is now just rubble and rocks.
Ashley: Okay, okay, okay! Good job!
Travis: Nice job!
Taliesin: Well done, well done.
Ashley: We're getting somewhere. But we still need-- there's still more to do?
Laura: Yeah, there's that whole other path. There's that whole-- there's that whole other path and then the one up top.
Ashley: Okay.
Laura: But I could hear a rumble so I know you guys did good on one of those paths already.
Ashley: Thanks! We did pretty good.
Matt: Okay. The rest of it is fairly easy to do because you find the closer you get to the entrance, based on the previous collapsing, elements of it have started to show cracks, like the actual weight, because it was just a smooth transition there. There was no load-bearing platforms or any sort of general structure to the interior of this cavern. So you guys manage to pummel your way out, a large spinning punch on this side and this side as you're rushing out, and as you do (impacts) you hear it slamming and hitting the ground behind you until you guys emerge through. It looks like you're running straight at a wall because the illusory wall is still there, but you both just out the other side. Immediate hot daylight hits you, the blaring sun of the Marquet sky. Clear blue sky, no clouds. You're now surrounded by a series of browned and leafless trees with these large canopies that have the same pear-like fruit hanging from the branches.
Travis: Fruit? Fruit?
Matt: Looks like fruit.
Travis: Are you hungry?
Ashley: I'm hungry!
Travis: Hold on. I hold up Pike to go grab some fruit.
Ashley: We'll check it!
Travis: Don't worry, it's just fruit.
Matt: Make a nature check.
Liam: She can cure us of poison.
Taliesin: Not if she's busy dying from both ends.
Laura: (retching) The spins.
Ashley: Six.
Matt: It's hard to tell, but it looks really tasty.
Travis: Yeah, I got great nature skills! Five.
Matt: So. Looks tasty.
Ashley: You know what, Grog?
Travis: What?
Ashley: As hungry as I am, I think we should wait to have Keyleth look at this fruit.
Travis: Why? It's just fruit!
Ashley: Because it's outside of this cave, and what if it's a distraction like, "Oh, lookit!" and you eat it and you just die?
Travis: You know, I've found if fruit, when it goes bad, falls from the tree, and it's still on it! Therefore!
Ashley: And when fruit goes bad, it turns into wine!
Travis: You get crunk drunk!
Ashley: I think I'm going to wait for Keyleth.
Travis: I'm going to have a bite.
Matt: Okay. You take a bite and it's got a fairly moist center. You can see now, like a cactus, the fruits here, most of the moisture is retained within these fruit elements. The flavor, it's not sweet, it's quite pungent, actually. It has a bitterness to it. It's like putting your tongue in a bunch of lye.
Ashley: Does it taste good?
Travis: (disgusted noises)
Ashley: Maybe make some mayonnaise or something? Want some mayonnaise to cleanse your palate?
Travis: I take out the jug and I go  honey! Hey!
Ashley: Oh, all right!
Laura: Just a couple of sticky warriors.
Ashley: No, Grog!
Matt: Just as a breeze blows a bit of a dust cloud through, which coats your sticky hands with heavy desert sand. You chew for a minute and feel the crunch of granules inside your mouth where you inhaled. (crunching)
Travis: Jug goes away.
Matt: Back to you guys. You were looking for the other entrance?
Laura: Yeah, up top.
Matt: Investigation check.
Laura: Both of us are looking for it. We're flying up. Can you fly? So, we can fly up. I was going to help you look for it because I figure you have a better ability to collapse it than I do.
Liam: What form are you going to take?
Laura: A goldfish!
Marisha: You could hold me in your hands. I've got about 30 seconds. Just to fly up? Can I ride side-saddle with you?
Laura: Of course you can, yes! Put your arms around me, Keyleth.
Marisha: Okay! Your abs are nice, Vex!
Laura: I know, I work out a lot.
Marisha: Have you been working out over the past year? Wow.
Matt: So, who's helming the investigation of this? And you're aiding her, so go ahead and take it with advantage.
Laura: Same thing. 21.
Matt: All righty. I left on my collapsing music.
Travis: They die.
Matt: So, as you glance around and do a pass over the next 20 minutes or so. It's as fast as you can, but it takes you a while to scan and get a feel for it. You do see what looks to be, because you felt the wind was coming through from the interior, you see a small well-like crevasse where the rocks have collapsed inward. You can see, glancing over the top, the dark, five, six-foot-wide hole that leads deeper into the mountain.
Laura: I hover down near it, but don't get off the broom.
Marisha: I lean over, I Druidcraft a pebble, toss it in the hole.
Matt: Don't hear it.
Laura: Oracle arrow down the hole.
Matt: Okay! Your vision watches as it--
Laura: Oh, wait! Can she set the end of it on fire?
Marisha: Yeah!
Matt: Okay, the arrow now, burning, it leads you into this dark space. It lights up the interior. The arrow gets about maybe 60 feet before it hits a rock and shatters.
Laura: Aww.
Matt: It's not straight down. It has a series of platforms, and it looks like it was designed to be climbed down, so it's a bit zig-zaggy. It maybe went 50, 60 feet and it hits a platform and shatters. You lose your vision. But it does appear to be a sizable tunnel used for entry.
Laura: Let's just fucking collapse it.
Marisha: All right!
Laura: Well, just you fucking collapse because I can't do shit to this thing.
Marisha: Can I be like, all right! I want to see if I can do this, like, cool maneuver. I'm going to try to balance on the broom, and then jump off the broom and go Keyteor and go into the--
Laura: Into it, into it?! Or just around it so you collapse the--
Marisha: Nah!
Laura: Oh, god, Keyleth!
Matt: You watch as she leaps and-- cloud of dust. There is no sign she impacted, she's just gone. You just see the side of the mountain.
Laura: Fuck! Fuck! I get out the rope of entanglement and hover close to the surface and start hanging the rope down.
Matt: You glance in the inside with what little bit of daylight is ricocheting off of the stone interior. You can see the edges of Keyleth's elemental form swimming through the rock. Because she can do that.
Laura: That's fucking crazy.
Marisha: It's like Whac-A-Mole!
Laura: Careful of traps, though, Keyleth, because I'm sure there's something in there.
Marisha: All right.
Taliesin: How's it going down there? Have you found it yet?
Laura: Up here?
Taliesin: Yes.
Laura: Fabulous. Our friend, Keyleth, is amazing.
Taliesin: She jumped in, didn't she?
Laura: Yes, she did.
Marisha: I'm going to Earth Glide to the bottom and then peek my earthy face out of the top, see if I can see down.
Matt: Are you following the actual path?
Marisha: Yeah. I'll try to be conscious to make sure I don't hit anything that looks precarious.
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Laura: Don't hit any traps!
Marisha: All right! Looking for traps! That's okay, 15.
Matt: 15. Okay. You get about a third of the way down, and you realize that one of the platforms that you can land on has, uncharacteristically, a softer cushion to it. Everything else is just stone slabs. This one has almost--
Sam: Waterbed.
Matt: Yeah! (laughs) Like a spring air mattress, it's crazy. No, it's like a woven, dried palm frond-like cloth that's rested over it.
Sam: I'm sure it's nothing. Probably nothing. Just leave it.
Marisha: Just a drop-through? Can I, like-- fuck.
Laura: Don't fuck with anything, Keyleth. Just collapse it!
Marisha: I found, like a, it might be a roof or--
Travis: Yeah, I bet Clarota's in there.
Marisha: What? Piranhas? I don't know if piranhas are in rocks, but there might be something else in there. There might be piranhas. Oh, I'll avoid it.
Matt: Okay. You continue southward, scooting. You can sense the very exterior of the wall that leads to this path, so you're staying away from it as you glide through the rock and earth. Eventually, you come close to the very top, breaching the dome that leads down into the chamber where you had your battle naught but an hour ago. As you poke your face through, you're looking down, you can see the dark sphere there, hovering. You can see the large pyramid structure below it, probably about 60 feet below you. You can see the entrance to the tunnel that leads into here. There is a small ladder up along the wall that previously you didn't notice because of the lack of light and attention to the ceiling portion. But people were either climbing up into or climbing down from.
Laura: What do you see, Keyleth?
Marisha: There's a ladder, man, there's some very innovative people. Yeah, these are very innovative cultists.
Laura: Wait, you're looking down at the ziggurat?
Marisha: Yeah! Hey, Pike and Grog, you guys did an excellent job.
Ashley: Oh thanks!
Travis: Oh thanks!
Travis: It really means a lot.
Laura: Get the fuck away from it, Keyleth!
Marisha: Okay! Good idea!
Matt: By the way, it's fantastic. You all hear through it (earth elemental grumbling).
Travis: Oh, right, yeah!
Matt: The grumbling, low voice of an earth elemental speaking to you through the earring.
Laura: We still don't know how far that field goes. If you turn into Keyleth again, you're fucked!
Marisha: (unintelligible grumbling)
Laura: Get the fuck out!
Marisha: I try and say, like, well, I know it's about 180 feet because I tested before, so I'm trying to be conscious of it. And then I back up a little bit, and I go over to where that tunnel was, and I start collapsing it down. As I work my way up, I'm going (impacts).
Matt: Easily enough. You go by and you start kicking through the tunnel as you go. You can sense near proximity where any of the various weak points are in the stone. Systematically go through it, collapse it, piece by piece, until eventually most of the tunnel is useless and unusable.
Marisha: It's like a platformer.
Matt: How long can you maintain your wild shape?
Marisha: Half of my level, or something like that?
Matt: Oh, you're fine, then.
Marisha: Or it's a third of my level? Still several hours.
Matt: You emerge a little over an hour or so of doing this. You emerge from the top. You watch as Keyleth (rock impacts), looking like a large version of Fantastic Four's Thing.
Laura: I'm holding my rope for her. You don't-- okay.
Matt: It appears to be taken care of. All of the entrances have been collapsed. There's no way that you can imagine any average person can find their way into this.
Laura: Good job. Are you going to stay that way, or are you turning back into you so that I can get you on the broom?
Marisha: (guttural noise of agreement) (laughter)
Laura: You can still talk, right? You just sound low.
Travis: No.
Marisha: (guttural gibberish) I speak a different language that I still don't think anyone has--
Matt: You can-- you maintain your mental acuity and statistics when you're in there.
Marisha: I don't know. We've gone back and forth on it!
Taliesin: It never occurred to you to speak Common. Why would I do that?
Matt: The texture and timbre of your voice. You can hear words, but it's almost like words being made by slamming rocks together.
Laura: Crazy.
Marisha: Not that different from my normal speech.
Liam: I won't bore you with the details, but while all that was going on, while they were searching and they were destroying things, Vax wandered a hundred feet out and sat down and did a little talking to the mother of ravens, and basically said, not expecting an answer: This is it, isn't it?
Matt: Make a wisdom check.
All: Ooh.
Liam: Not good. 13.
Matt: 13? That's enough. As you sit there in silence with your eyes closed, beseeching the attention of your patron, which seemingly wasn't present when you attempted to in the proximity of this doorway. The familiar soft, omnipresent voice creeps into your psyche as she tells you, "It seems that the bender of fate is feeling the tug of destiny. It's almost as if you're coming towards me. If you sense this path is the right one, follow your instincts. Perhaps we'll meet soon enough."
Liam: I will see you soon.
Matt: All right. So you guys reconvene.
Laura: Hey, guys. How's it going?
Liam: Hey, guys!
Laura: What should we do?
Travis: You should try the local fruit. It's delicious.
Ashley: Yeah, you guys should try it.
Taliesin: I pick up a piece of the local fruit and smell it.
Matt: How do I describe the smell? It's reminiscent of discovering old lemon juice that has grown sticky on a surface, like a dark mahogany wood surface. Kind of like a bar floor. We'll go with that.
Taliesin: No, I don't think I will.
Travis: It belies its true flavor.
Taliesin: I don't think it does.
Marisha: This looks like it's rotten from the landscape. It looks like it's all gone bad. Has it gone bad?
Matt: Make a nature check.
Travis: Oh, great.
Marisha: 25.
Matt: No. There are elements that have gone bad on the ground and have been covered by sand as winds blow through.
Taliesin: Naturally awful.
Matt: It's like desert noni. It's extremely healthy and has a lot of practical medicinal use. In fact, it's traded specifically for its use in various herb pouches.
Marisha: Does it have a name?
Matt: Yes.
Liam: Like that giant, stinking flower. Grog took a bite of the giant, stinking flower.
Matt: A vafall fruit.
Marisha: A what?
Taliesin: Did it alter Grog's stats on any level?
Matt: No.
Taliesin: Then it's not that healthy, is it? It's like agave.
Marisha: Vafall?
Matt: Listen to Sam. He's got the pronunciation.
Liam: I will eat you with a lovely chianti and some vafall.
All: Vafall.
Ashley: Should we take some, then?
Laura: Make some medicine?
Taliesin: You could try to bake with it. Maybe it's bakeable.
Marisha: It makes a really good salve. It's good for sunburns.
Liam: Or shoving in somebody's bed.
Travis: How do we get back to Whitestone?
Taliesin: Is there a tree that this fruit was coming off of?
Matt: Yes.
Taliesin: I point at the tree.
Matt: The ones on the outskirts of the mountain range are small, but the deeper into the valleys and ravines between the large spire-like mountains, you do find a few that are probably large enough to utilize through your spell.
Marisha: Yeah, I can do that.
Laura: Tary, are you coming back to Whitestone?
Sam: I have to, yes. I have to repair Doty, and also find some new recruits. I think there are some in Whitestone, right?
Taliesin: You're really going through with this?
Sam: Of course. It's my destiny. I met you all to become an adventurer, and now I'm bringing my knowledge back to my people. It's like it was written in a book.
Laura: A very good book.
Travis: Yeah, you're writing a book!
Sam: I am.
Ashley: And not only that, you're going to be the leader of a band of adventurers.
Travis: Are you a colonel, a general, a private?
Sam: I hadn't thought of that. You know what? There's no leader of Vox Machina, so maybe there won't be in the Darrington Brigade. Well, besides you. You're unofficially-- you're definitely the treasurer.
Liam: I'm behind her doing this.
Travis: Yeah, rolling eyes.
Laura: Lionel?
Matt: His mouth is filled with fruit. (laughter)
Laura: Is it good? How are you doing?
Matt: "It's getting really heavy. This is really heavy."
Laura: Yeah. Are you coming back to Whitestone, as well? Scanlan, I mean Aes-- is he coming back?
Sam: I suppose we'll need him for now, yes.
Laura: Okay.
Taliesin: I still like the idea of perhaps the two of you working together. You could talk to Scanlan about it and see if he'd be all right-- (laughter)
Taliesin: I'm never going to get bored of this. I'm never going to get bored of this!
Liam: Scanlan, what do you think?
Travis: That was a fucking awesome physical reaction.
Liam: At least in the short term.
Sam: You're suggesting that I, Scanlan Shorthalt, bequeath my employee Chod to this gentleman here? You mean me, Taryon Darrington? You mean Chod could join my brigade? Well, yes. I guess that's what they're talking about. Well, I don't see why not. He's very capable and strong. Yes, and I won't have much use for him for a while, so if you'd like to take him with your brigade, you can. Well, I'm not going to say no to a fellow member of Vox Machina now, am I? No, you're not. No, I'm not.
Travis: Yes.
Matt: "I don't see any similarities." (laughter)
Taliesin: That's everything I wanted. I'm good.
Laura: Through the tree, then?
Marisha: Through the tree.
Matt: All right, so as you finish concentrating on the outside of one of these large, 15 to 20-foot-tall, leafless, fruit-bearing trees in the center of the Smoldercrown Forest, the doorway shifts open, revealing on the opposite side the dark, sunless night of Whitestone.
Marisha: I pick a blossom from the tree on the way out.
Liam: I pull two of the fruits.
Matt: Okay. You guys arrive. It's early evening. You can see the windows of nearby homes, shops, and various structures near the square are beginning to glow from the interior light of small lanterns and candles. In the distance, you can see the perimeter beacons being put along the castle walls on the exterior of Castle Whitestone. You're back home.
Laura: Let's gather our troops.
Taliesin: Make thy way to the castle.
Laura: Find out what they've learned.
Matt: All right. At which point, Lionel keeps asking, "Can I put him down yet? Can I put him down?"
Sam: Not quite yet.
Taliesin: We're going to take him to the castle.
Sam: Change arms.
Matt: "Ooh! That helps a lot." You make your way to the castle. Doty's delivered to the workshop. Taryon?
Sam: Stays there.
Matt: Okay. (laughter)
Taliesin: We'll keep you informed.
Sam: Thank you.
Matt: All right, so you guys now have the run of the castle. What do you wish to do?
Laura: We asked Cassandra to gather people to study the Shadowfell as soon as we did the oracle arrow last time, so it would probably be smart to find out what they've learned before we make our plans.
Matt: Okay. As you approach Cassandra, at this hour, she currently has a recently steeped, still-steaming cup of tea resting on the table, towards the window side, the front window side, of the general dining hall area of the castle where you usually eat your supper. She's facing away from the table and has a thick robe over her and has the tea and is in the process of reading through books. Her hair's pulled up tightly, and some of it's a mess in front of her face. She's very much in work mode. She's poring through books, and as soon as you enter, she reaches over for her cup of tea. "Oh. Hello, everyone." She gets herself a little more presentable. "I've got the assistance of Eskil Ryndarien. Everyone else seems to be a bit busy at the moment, but Allura is doing the best she can research on her end, as well."
Taliesin: We're going to need everybody. It's worse than we could have imagined.
Laura: And we have far less time than we would have imagined.
Matt: "How much time do we have?"
Taliesin: This has to be taken care of immediately.
Liam: Things are happening now.
Matt: "Well, you have far better means of acquiring these people than I do. I can merely send missives and requests."
Taliesin: We're going to send word out. I'm going to take out my flask and put it on the table. Sit down for a moment.
Matt: She takes it and adds it to her tea.
Laura: Is Ryndarien here?
Matt: "He is. He's currently inspecting the ziggurat again. He's setting his notes up where he previously set up research quarters during the incursion of the Conclave."
Laura: We need to get everyone away from it.
Marisha: Where's Allura?
Matt: "She's in Emon. She's still part of the council there."
Taliesin: We have to get her here immediately.
Liam: Is Gilmore still in town?
Matt: "No, he's back in Emon."
Liam: He left for good?
Laura: I'm going to run down to the ziggurat and try to get Eskil Ryndarien away from it and warn everyone to stay away from it.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: Let's double-check that armor for any weird influences it may have, to make sure it is what it seems to be, which is ornamental, with a bit of magic. Let's make sure that the captain of whatever guard is on shift down by the ziggurat is wearing it, and is aware that he's there to befuddle the enemy.
Matt: Okay. You make your way down there, and you can see it's still fairly dark in that chamber. Most of the lights have been snuffed except for a few torches that are set around the central platform that was built about mid-height on the ziggurat, where you guys had the council meeting with Raishan that one time, and where most of the research is being done there. Up top, you see a number of guards, the Pale Guard are assigned to keep watch. You see Jecht, the manservant of the Realmseer Eskil there, as well. Currently, you see Eskil Ryndarien is spreading out his thick scrolls and books, and they're all across the big central wooden table, and he has his thick spectacles on, and he has a number of candles already set up, and he's deep into getting his space prepped and acquiring whatever information he'd put away since the investigation was put on hold.
Laura: Eskil?
Matt: "Yes? Oh, it has been some time, Lady Vex'ahlia. I've heard you've come up in the world."
Laura: Oh, yes. I'm a lady now.
Matt: "Wondrous. Yes. What do I have the honor?"
Laura: Well, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I'm afraid being down here isn't safe anymore.
Matt: "Right, so you brought me all the way out here, and now I can't do my work? That's great. No, that's par for the course. It's basically most of my life."
Laura: Plenty of work up top, away from this orb of death. It's very dangerous.
Matt: "Oh! You're right. I didn't know that. I've only spent six months with the thing!"
Laura: We've discovered it's a gateway, and things can come through it, and there might be armies coming through because we just fought somebody on the other side of another ziggurat.
Matt: "That's preposterous. Siphons only work one way, my dear. Nothing's coming through there."
Laura: She changed it. Did you know that siphons can be changed? It changed from one color to another.
Matt: "You know this how?"
Laura: Because I was there to witness it.
Matt: "What, here?"
Laura: In Ank'harel. And it looks the exact same as this one.
Matt: He looks you over really intensely. "If what you believe you saw is indeed another one of these siphons, then perhaps we should take a little more care."
Laura: I agree.
Matt: "Jecht, please continue. Gather everything. We're taking this outside."
Laura: Fabulous. You're so agreeable. I do love talking to you.
Matt: "Wonderful. Good to know. Goodbye." They gather up the materials. The Pale Guard escorts them back into the hallway, and he's now talking to Jecht off on the side. He goes, "Well, then we can go ahead and stage ourselves in the grand guestroom with the nice big bed. Yes?"
Laura: The big ornate bed.
Matt: He looks over his shoulder as you say this. "Oh, you're eavesdropping now, as well. That's wondrous."
Laura: I have wonderful hearing.
Matt: "So I can tell. Yes, the big bed. The one that helps with my back."
Laura: Yes, that's terrible. Can you look at this armor really fast and make sure that it's not actually cursed or anything?
Matt: "Looks fine to me!" Keeps walking.
Laura: Was it cursed, or anything, when you looked at it?
Sam: I don't know.
Matt: Did not appear to be cursed from your glance at it.
Laura: Would he have known from the Identify spell if it was cursed? Great. Well.
Marisha: Can Keyleth go talk to Percy?
Taliesin: I'm in Cassandra's room, still.
Marisha: Keyleth waits for Percy. Hang on. I can go talk with Cassandra, as well.
Matt: Unless you're having a closed conversation.
Taliesin: Just ten seconds of it. We'll see how this goes. Have a bit of that flask.
Matt: She's already poured some into her tea.
Taliesin: We've found a second ziggurat. We found a cult that is moving things through it. The cult was being led by Delilah Briarwood.
Matt: The silence, the stark absence of sound, is completely sundered by the sound of shattering porcelainware. The tea that she had recently barely sipped on is now shattered and spilled across the ground. She stands there, her hand open as it slowly curls back. She stares off into the distance, clenching her fist very tightly.
Taliesin: She escaped into the ziggurat, so she's no longer on this plane of existence, but some form of her, whether it's undead or otherwise, we're going to need to put it down again.
Matt: "Yes, we do."
Taliesin: I wanted you to hear it from me. There will be no running this time.
Matt: "No running."
Taliesin: Not from me.
Matt: "But you'll take care of her?"
Taliesin: This is the end of her. I will be there to see it.
Matt: "She's escaped death once already. Who knows how many times she has before. You have to end it."
Taliesin: We will discover what she did.
Matt: "Don't destroy her body. Destroy everything she is."
Taliesin: If we can't kill her, we will entrap her forever.
Matt: "Shatter the soul. Whatever it takes. End her, brother."
Taliesin: I know. I shall.
Matt: She takes the flask.
Taliesin: I wanted you to hear it from me so you could compose yourself when other people begin to tell you.
Matt: "I need a moment alone, please."
Taliesin: They're going to need us to be the strongest. I have faith in you. I'll leave you to it. I'm so sorry.
Matt: "I'm going to be sick."
Taliesin: Yes. I'm going to leave her to her room and shut the door.
Matt: You close the door and there in the hallway, waiting opposite the door, is Keyleth.
Taliesin: Hi.
Marisha: How did that go?
Taliesin: Honestly, better than I expected.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: At which point, you hear behind the door, a muffled (retching).
Taliesin: More sick and less things breaking. I'd rather her be sick than angry.
Marisha: You think? I hate being sick. Anger at least drives you towards something.
Taliesin: It does not drive de Rolos towards anything good.
Marisha: Fair point. I have a crazy thought, and I needed to run by you. Sorry, didn't mean to hit you. Okay. I'm excited. All right. We watched the orb change. She changed the magic in the orb, right? We just spent a year making magical orbs that change in some way, that are all linked to our city. Clearly, not as powerful as what this is.
Taliesin: No, not at all.
Marisha: But what if-- I don't know. What if she corrupted something that was already there that wasn't supposed to be corrupted? What if she can corrupt more things, like our crisis orbs? I had this immediate fear that what if I built something that was supposed to help--
Taliesin: I'm so glad you thought of me when this came up.
Marisha: Well, you helped me build it. Am I crazy for thinking it? Am I totally off base?
Taliesin: I think we're going to be walking a very fine line of paranoia for the next however long.
Marisha: Maybe there's something in our own technology, in our own magic, that can help inform us. I don't know.
Taliesin: When they get here, we're going to look at everything.
Marisha: All right. We'll sleep on it.
Taliesin: I think we're going to be fine, but you did give me some ideas that I'm going to think about.
Marisha: And those symbols. The necklaces. Druids, we use similar things when we plane shift to other worlds.
Taliesin: I'm going to take one to the library and inspect it. I'm going to also see what any of our other arcanists think of it. If it's from a cult that anybody has heard of before.
Marisha: I think I can plane shift us there with it if we don't want to go through the orb.
Taliesin: Really?
Marisha: I think. It seems like very similar technology. Magic.
Taliesin: I'm rubbing off on you.
Marisha: Yeah. I don't know. Sleep on it. I'm going to go think.
Taliesin: I have no idea what just happened. Yeah. I'm going to double-check the orb room just for a moment, for my own paranoia.
Marisha: The crisis orb room? Actually, I'll go with him.
Taliesin: Just to look, and then I'm going to start researching that symbol. I'm going to go to the library and I'm showing the council everything.
Matt: Okay. You speak with the rest of the standing chamber. You begin to do your research. Make a history check.
Marisha: Oh, that's good! Take it.
Taliesin: 22.
Matt: 22. You've read through most of the books here, between you and JB, who's spent some time also reading quite a bit. There's no mention of the symbol itself, and there's very little information on the Whispered One, on Vecna. It's interesting: there's almost a gap in history. There are subtle mentions of this figure, this once-powerful mage that had begun to look into the secrets of life, prolonging it. The fabric of reality. And then it's just missing from history. And you recall... all the books that would cover that time period, you remember hearing stories from Allura regarding the Whispered One, originally. There's no mention.
Taliesin: Is it a physical omission from the books, or is it even that the books that would cover it are not here? Books that should cover it that don't?
Matt: Books that you feel like should cover it. Historical recalling of Wildmount, which if you recall, based on some of Allura's discussion on the Whispered One's previous existence as a mortal, largely, Vecna's work was done over on the Wildmount side of Exandria.
Taliesin: And there's no--
Marisha: Bitch! Sorry. Go on.
Taliesin: I don't know what's happening over here.
Matt: I don't, either.
Taliesin: There's nothing that's simple. Like, the more I'm looking, I'm looking for mention of the symbols--
Matt: No.
Taliesin: Keyleth, you know damn well where I am right now, I'm sitting in the library reading books, so if you have something to say. Oh, wow, you're going way back.
Marisha: I'm looking. I'll meet you in the library.
Sam: How to Play Pathfinder. (laughter)
Taliesin: Is that Hercules Mulligan?
Marisha: This is a tiny Hercules Mulligan. I was looking for him! He's been in here the whole time.
Liam: Delilah gets knocked out, she gets the fuck back up again!
Taliesin: Four set of corsets.
Matt: He's a barbarian, I think it is. We have to work out the 5e classes for the Hamilton characters. Get on it, Critters.
Taliesin: I'll let everyone know where I am, too. I'm in the library reading if anybody needs me.
Matt: Anyone else wishing to accomplish anything else?
Travis: I'm in the kitchen. I want to see if they can make a salad with meat in it.
Taliesin: If they figure out how, bring some up to the library.
Travis: Okay, I'm not very up to--
Taliesin: Deposit it up.
Matt: Grand Poobah, if this is indeed your request, they will do their very best to do so. Within an hour or so, you are presented with a bowl of various textures of shredded, cured, and prepared meats to loosely resemble a salad, I guess.
Taliesin: A malad!
Matt: It's like a giant poke bowl.
Sam: It's not a salad with meat on it, it's a salad made of meat?
Liam: Thin slices.
Travis: This is far greater than anything I could have hoped for.
Taliesin: Previously, on Hannibal.
Travis: Did you invent this just now?
Matt: You look at the wait staff and they, "Actually, sir, it was Chef Varon." You look over and you see this one, and you've seen a couple of the chefs here, you haven't interfaced with them too much. You're not a social figure necessarily, more of a demanding figure when it comes to the food and the meal. But you see this gentleman with this thin John Waters pencil mustache, this thinning hair that's short, but slick, with a bit of pattern baldness going on. He's a bit thick around the waist and he's sitting there with a big, beaming grin of pride.
Travis: Chef, this is going to put you on the map. We need to name it.
Matt: "Oh, well, Grand Poobah, I image that would be your honor to give. I am but humbled to present you with such a meal, so the choice is yours."
Travis: What fine tender meats are in this dish?
Matt: "Oh, well, we've got quite a variety. I wanted to provide an extravagant walk through the various creatures that we prepare here in Whitestone. Would you like me to continue?"
Travis: Please, yes! I'm talking to myself.
Matt: "We have two-week salted goat meat. On top of that we have hickory-kept long angle-smoked fish guts mixed in there with a wondrous mix of minced steaks, we've spared no possible expense on the various pieces of the cow. We've, from that point forward, presented a sprinkling of pork belly that's been ground up and salt-cured as well over the period of about two months usually kept to our various steam meals, but I thought this was a special occasion."
Travis: I'm just free-dripping saliva in and on the plate.
Matt: "So, it has a very sedimentary layers of the planet-type feel to it where each reveal occurs it's a whole different genus of animal. You're eating nature in a bowl!"
Travis: I mean, did you even, like, salt it or nothing? It's just all these beautiful animals in my own private ark of a bowl?
Matt: "They came salted."
Travis: Well, because it's got goat, fish, beef, and pork in it I'm going to call it the GoFiBePo.
Matt: "GoFiBePo it is."
Travis: But, like, you seem to have an accent, so let's put a little flair on it when you say it. The bowl of GoFiBePo.
Matt: "GoFiBePo."
Travis: I like it.
Matt: "Of course, Grand Poobah."
Travis: And I must decree there will be no utensils used when you dine of this sublime dish.
Matt: He begins writing these things down. "All right, all right. You would need approval from Lady Cassandra, of course, to put this in the familial--"
Travis: Approval?
Matt: "Well, if you were to make this the official meal of Whitestone, that is entirely within--"
Travis: This just gets better and better. Submit whatever paperwork is necessary. See that it's done. (laughter)
Matt: "You heard him, folks! Grand Poobah has spoken."
Travis: GoFiBePo.
Matt: GoFiBePo.
Travis: Even better. And I'll just start hand-smashing into my face this delicious salted meat collection.
Laura: I'm hungry now.
Matt: Yeah. Oh, it is delightful. It is delicious.
Travis: You should not be able to make up food that delicious just on the fly like that. I literally felt like I was at a fucking restaurant. That was absurd.
Laura: I want to eat it!
Taliesin: As I was saying 'Grand Poobah', I knew it was going to bite me in the ass. I don't know how.
Travis: Meat salad. You're welcome.
Taliesin: It actually sounds really good. Cured goat meat.
Matt: And it's currently being submitted to the senate of Whitestone for approval to become the official dish.
Travis: Yeah! After every battle, we'll get all the protein we need and we'll just fart our happy asses off, all night long.
Liam: It's all shabu-shabu from here on out.
Matt: Yeah. With a constitution check it might improve your speed. All right. So. What else do you wish to do, as it is now getting close to the midnight hour here at Whitestone?
Ashley: I've been an extra set of eyes in the library.
Marisha: Yeah, and I call Vex there as well.
Laura: Be there in just a moment, dear. I just want to find Vax. Can I find Vax?
Liam: You can certainly try.
Laura: I'm going to go look-- I'll look in his room and then I'll look in the temple to the Raven Queen that we have.
Liam: I'm in my room.
Laura: Hey!
Liam: Kiki, is that-- Oh.
Laura: Oh. Well. No. Hi. That's gross.
Liam: Is it, though? Is it?
Laura: Is it? Hey. One quick thing that I was thinking about, and I know that you keep bringing it up and I keep dodging this, right?
Liam: Right.
Laura: But-- So, when I was researching the Raven Queen--
Liam: Yes.
Laura: -- she hates undead.
Liam: That's kind of her thing, yeah.
Laura: So the fact that Delilah Briarwood is back again and the person that we're going after, it seems perfect.
Liam: Almost like fate, isn't it?
Laura: Hey.
Liam: Hey.
Laura: Do you think your queen lady is going to chime in there and help us out? Maybe end this cycle of whatever the fuck it is she's doing.
Liam: She will be there.
Laura: In the Shadowfell?
Liam: She will be with us when we reach the end.
Laura: That's so cryptic.
Liam: Well, it is religion.
Laura: Right.
Liam: Right.
Laura: Okay.
Liam: I mean, like Pike has always said, I don't have all the answers at all.
Laura: No. I mean, do you talk to her, though? Because, you know, Pike talks to Sarenrae.
Liam: I do.
Laura: Right! So have you asked her if she's going to help us kill Delilah Briarwood?
Liam: You know, she's not very big on specifics. It's more of a vibe kind of thing.
Laura: Okay.
Liam: But the vibe I get, I'm not going to call it good. This is it. This is what you and I have been doing our homework for.
Laura: All right.
Liam: And it's not going to slow down, it's only going to speed up.
Laura: Well.
Liam: I don't think I'm going back to Zephra anytime soon.
Laura: Not necessarily. Don't talk like that. I'm serious. You have to keep a positive outlook. Otherwise you're doomed.
Liam: This is the best year of my life. I'm very happy.
Laura: That's good.
Liam: Life is good.
Laura: Life is good.
Liam: We're going to ensure that it stays that way.
Laura: Yeah. All right.
Liam: Sorry I didn't have more for you.
Laura: No no no! It's about what I expected.
Liam: Hmm. If you see my druid, would you send her to bed?
Laura: Yes.
Liam: Thank you.
Laura: Good night.
Liam: Good night.
Laura: And I go to the library.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: Boring.
Matt: Now, Percival, Keyleth. Pike, I believe you're helping out in the library as well?
Taliesin: We're literally reading through old notes right now.
Marisha: A fuckton of old notes.
Matt: Well, Vex arrives to meet up with you guys in the library of Whitestone. Whatever you're doing, Scanlan, I don't know.
Marisha: Vex.
Laura: What?
Marisha: Okay. Oh my gosh. Oh. Okay. Oh, praise Sarenrae, there's so much going on. Okay. Remember how Whitestone used to be all dead and awful? Very similar to how the other Ziggurat was dead?
Taliesin: Yes, of course.
Marisha: And then they called the ziggurat the seat of Pelor, right? So what if it was already there? What if she's taking doorways and dimensions and corrupting them and bastardizing them and--
Laura: If she's done that, if she did that to the Sun Tree, how old is Delilah Briarwood?
Taliesin: Well, we don't--
Matt: The Sun Tree has been around since before--
Taliesin: The Sun Tree was here before the castle was here, but-- And things have always happened here. The city has a history of strange occurrences. I'm inclined to believe there was something-- Well, there was obviously something beneath the castle before she got here, or else she wouldn't have come here to begin with.
Laura: It was a temple to Ioun.
Matt: The history, you know, is back in the Age of Arcanum, this valley housed a temple to Ioun, which was corrupted, and in the Calamity, the battle between the gods and mortals that changed the epoch, the Knowing Mistress suffered a grievous wound from Tharizdun, the Chained Oblivion. And in that battle, Pelor, the Dawn Father, delivered enough of a blow to the Chained Oblivion to defeat it and aid in locking it away. With the temple still lost beneath this valley, that was when the Sun Tree seed was planted by Pelor to be guardian over this space.
Marisha: What was he locking away?
Matt: A god called the Chained Oblivion.
Marisha: The Chain Oblivion?
Matt: The Chained Oblivion. Tharizdun. Yeah. A mad god of chaos and destruction.
Liam: Totally awesome metal band.
Travis: Yeah, great name.
Marisha: Okay, well, that's a big deal.
Taliesin: And, I mean, I think it's safe to assume that that's what's down there and that's what they were looking for when they came here in the first place.
Laura: Right.
Marisha: And Delilah came from Wildmount?
Taliesin: Yes. She was also, I mean--
Marisha: You did a bunch of research on Vecna. He used to be a man, right?
Taliesin: Yes.
Laura: Yes.
Laura: He wanted to become the Prince of the Undead, right? Am I saying that right? No no no.
Matt: From what you've come to understand and the research you've done since the name has come up--
Taliesin: I'm pulling out my notes.
Liam: We spent a year reading books.
Matt: Right. Now mind you, the information is still very hard to find.
Laura: Because he's the god of secrets?
Matt: He's not a god. Wants to be, or at least wants to, and there is some obsession with the ascension of a mortal to a beyond-mortal state. Which has only been achieved by one being before.
Marisha: I mean, it sounds a lot like what Delilah is going for.
Laura: What if she is Vecna?
Marisha: What if she is Vecna?
Taliesin: Well, or she wants to become the next Vecna.
Marisha: Yeah. Dread Pirate Roberts of the Vecna. She came from Wildmount, where Vecna originated. She came here for research.
Laura: She's just finishing what he started.
Marisha: Maybe she's just finishing what he started. And wasn't she doing a bunch of research for runes and tomes? Do we have the research that the Briarwoods-- Didn't we seize a bunch of their research?
Taliesin: We got some of it, but they burned a lot.
Matt: You got some of it and a lot of it dealt with ley energies. There are certain lines that stretch across, invisible lines that stretch across Exandria, where the magical powers that hold together the planes and protect it through the Divine Gate and other elements--
Marisha: Do any of those ley lines go through where we were in Marquet?
Matt: You don't know that. But you do know that Whitestone resides right beneath a nexus. These ley lines were shifted during the Calamity. And now one of these nexuses is right over Whitestone, which is why this location was chosen for the ritual that the Briarwoods were assembling.
Marisha: I wonder if each ziggurat is over a nexus.
Taliesin: It could be. We know that she's not ancient, because we have a bit of a paper trail. We do know that she was ruling in Wildmount for a while. We do know that she studied at the Alabaster Lyceum briefly. And there's some paperwork for that.
Matt: In looking up the background history, you would know that King Bertrand Dwendal of the Dwendalian Empire was given information in regards to the Briarwoods, who were essentially accused of forbidden necromancy. And were to be arrested and put on trial, and that's when they fled westward towards Tal'Dorei and then encountered your family.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Laura: So they got run out of Wildmount?
Matt: Seemingly.
Taliesin: From what we understand and again, there's not much that survived that. They tend to cover their tracks.
Marisha: They were also trying to build that whole bridge situation? Remember the bridge? That was weird.
Taliesin: They wanted to move. Well--
Marisha: They wanted to move an army. Right?
Matt: The bridge, from what you can tell, there was no way, plans or means of even building a bridge. And a bridge has been attempted in the past over the Shearing Channel and it's just too-- The cliffs are too steep and too windy and the water beneath is too strong. Which is why the prospect to the previous sovereign was such a possible good thing to make a deal with the Briarwoods at the time. But there are no plans. Nothing in their notes spoke of actually making a bridge. It was more a means to get into the graces of the royal family.
Taliesin: And probably collect assets as well.
Marisha: Okay. If you were run out of somewhere--
Taliesin: Which I have been.
Marisha: Which you have been. After a lot of research--
Taliesin: Which I've done.
Marisha: -- and you were trying to do something--
Taliesin: Which I do.
Marisha: -- what would be your second place of choosing to go?
Taliesin: Anywhere that they serve some sort of meat salad, I imagine. (laughter)
Marisha: I'm just saying, if you're run out of one place for doing something, I imagine--
Taliesin: You're thinking maybe they have another portal in Wildmount.
Marisha: Yes, I do.
Taliesin: Yes.
Laura: Another ziggurat?
Taliesin: Could be several of them.
Marisha: If they are run out of one place for something, my first thing would be try to find the next place to keep it going.
Laura: Right. And then she got run out of here, so she went to Ank'harel.
Marisha: Correct. What if she's already been killed in Wildmount? So many theories, you guys. So many theories! It's kind of exciting.
Taliesin: Let's not get overly speculative here.
Travis: Are ziggurats always pyramids?
Liam: That's what a ziggurat is. It's like an Aztec bip-bip-bip.
Marisha: We know the Briarwoods also did dealings with the Stormwinds in Wildmount.
Laura: What other pyramids have we seen, though? Have we seen any other--
Travis: The thing we fought the beholder in.
Laura: The mindflayer place. That was a ziggurat.
Marisha: Son of a bitch!
Laura: Under Kraghammer! Oh my god! Is there a ziggurat in Kraghammer?
Liam: Hell yeah there is a ziggurat. Yeah, it was a ziggurat.
Matt: You've seen a few, actually.
Liam: I'm speaking in my voice because I'm not there, but he said-- Yeah, oh, he's poker-facing it. We said ziggurat many times when we were down there.
Marisha: Did we see a pyramid when we were in Wildmount? When we went there?
Taliesin: We were barely there, though.
Laura: But it would've been underground. I mean, who knows where the fuck it was? Wait, wait, wait! What about the temple where we saw the other sphinx? Was that another ziggurat there?
Marisha: And that was up in Vasselheim! Thank you.
Laura: Ah! Is there a ziggurat--
Marisha: There's a ziggurat on every continent! (singing) Every continent has a ziggurat.
Laura: They can come out everywhere.
Travis: So collapsing the tunnels didn't really do that much.
Taliesin: No, because it shut one potential vein of a dozen.
Marisha: It's these damn ley lines. I knew there's been something up with these ley lines and I tried to talk to the Sun Tree about it and he didn't know.
Laura: Well, he's a tree.
Marisha: He's a tree.
Taliesin: Be nice to the Sun Tree.
Marisha: No, he's very cool.
Travis: So all the bodies that were hanging under Whitestone, right, they were all stapled to the walls? Was that the army? Was she trying to fill them with necromantic energy?
Taliesin: Oh my god, they would've come alive if there had been a giant blast of necrotic energy.
Travis: Yeah. The bodies weren't feeding the thing. She was trying to imbue them with--
Taliesin: She was preparing to create an army.
Liam: Yeah. And they were missing arms?
Laura: We didn't look in the ziggurat in Ank'harel. There could've been bodies there, too.
Taliesin: I don't think they had gotten that far yet.
Marisha: And one of the things I have written down.
Travis: Why were they throwing magical things into it, though? It was magical items into--
Taliesin: Offerings? Because they would've become magical once they got to the other side of the portal. I mean, they would've been great gifts.
Liam: What do you think, Taryon Darrington? Or Scanlan.
Matt: Tary is fixing Doty.
Sam: I'm just giving him CPR. (laughter)
Sam: You've never given up on anything in your life. Now live! (laughter)
Liam: Ed Harris in The Abyss. You've never given up a day in your life, you bitch.
Ashley: Scanlan?
Sam: I'm in my room, praying.
Laura: You're not here?
Marisha: In your room, praying?
Laura: Praying to Sarenrae?
Sam: Mm-hm. Or Logic. (laughter)
Taliesin: Logic is a fickle god.
Marisha: Yeah. Desmond (mumbles). Briarwood's carriage driver. Lady Briarwood is immune to daylight.
Taliesin: It's like watching your game in fast-forward.
Marisha: Briarwoods have an army. I have it in giant, big letters, but I don't know what that means.
Laura: Obviously, it would take a very long time to go to every ziggurat that we've seen and see if there's an army inside of it. If they've been preparing things there over this past year that we haven't been doing anything!
Travis: We don't know that any of this is right. We should just go through.
Laura: We should go to the Shadowfell and fucking end this before she sets out her armies everywhere.
Travis: We did let her regroup a little bit, but we didn't know what we were doing.
Taliesin: There was nothing we could have done.
Travis: Do you want to mess with the stones? Try and duplicate them? We have seven, right?
Laura: We have seven. We could go through.
Taliesin: Seven of us could go through.
Sam: (whispering) We're only seven people.
Laura: There's only seven of us.
Taliesin: There's eight. One of us would have to stay behind.
Sam: Who's the eighth? Count the table, friend.
Travis: Tary's staying.
Taliesin: Tary's the eighth. Are we going to go through with Tary? I'm being such an asshole right now.
Matt: You're terrible.
Marisha: I could also maybe Plane Shift us there with one of these?
Travis: If we take damage going through the portal with the stone, does that mean we might take damage if you Plane Shift us there?
Laura: Who knows? It's the Shadowfell.
Taliesin: I say we speak with Allura, and if this looks--
Laura: We need to talk to Eskil Ryndarien and see what he knows about the Shadowfell, right? He's been studying the Shadowfell, too.
Matt: Since he arrived, yeah.
Taliesin: I think the plan is we take the fight to them.
Laura: Yeah.
Travis: Yeah.
Marisha: Is it worth going back to any of the other ziggurats, or no?
Laura: I don't think so, at this point.
Taliesin: I think that it's not time to check the doors. It's time to go out and chase the monsters. If we take care of them, it doesn't matter how many ziggurats there are.
Travis: Yes.
Laura: We just have to--
Taliesin: Hope we don't miss one. Travel the world.
Laura: Hey, at least Vecna's not a god. Bonus there.
Marisha: That's true.
Taliesin: Let's have an evening, and then tomorrow, we'll--
Travis: Tally-ho?
Taliesin: Collect what we've learned, and if we're prepared, jump into a sphere of death.
Laura: We can't waste time.
Marisha: If we jump through the sphere of death, they might be expecting us on the other side of the sphere of death. If we Plane Shift, we might be able to come up with a flanky, secret, other tactic.
Taliesin: If you can figure out a way to use one of these to create a Plane Shift that you'll feel comfortable with, then I'm all right with that.
Marisha: I'll talk it over with other magic-users, first.
Travis: Which ones?
Marisha: I don't know. I'll find one.
Liam: We can go visit one of them. I'm not there.
Matt: You're not there.
Travis: Make the call.
Marisha: Eskil knows stuff like that.
Taliesin: Let's all get some sleep, and in the morning, we're going to take care of this. One way or the other, we'll take this fight to them.
Laura: You'll talk to Eskil, because I hate that motherfucker.
Taliesin: He likes you. Well, he doesn't dislike you any more than he dislikes anybody else.
Marisha: He dislikes you even less. He just hates everyone.
Taliesin: He's terrible, isn't he?
Laura: Crotchety old fuck.
Matt: All right, so you're all going to go in for the evening, and we'll come back to this in the morning.
Liam: Wait. One second.
Matt: Sorry, go ahead.
Liam: Did you guys--
Marisha: Oh my gosh. We figured out so much stuff.
Liam: Give me the download.
Marisha: Delilah might be Vecna, and all this, there are ziggurats everywhere, and we're so dumb because we've probably seen several ziggurats, and they're all on these massive ley lines, and I give him a whole dialogue.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Holy moly. Do you need to get word back home? Because I don't think we're going home.
Marisha: What do you mean?
Liam: I mean, the dreams I've been having all year and telling you about. They felt like this. This is the moment.
Marisha: You think if we go in, we're never coming back?
Liam: I'm not saying that.
Marisha: You think if we go in, you're never coming back?
Liam: Well, I didn't say that, either. We were going to go back in a day or two, and I don't think that's happening. Do you think everyone at home, they're good?
Marisha: I'll have someone send a message.
Liam: Okay.
Marisha: You can't resign to this. You can't give up on me.
Liam: Kiki, I'm not giving up. I will never give up on you.
Marisha: I can see it in your eyes. You think this is it.
Liam: I'm so glad that we're together for this, whatever it is. And no, I'm not resigned. I would love to see you off to a very long life in Zephra. No, with you. With you, until I'm not with you. Your dad's probably worrying. I worry about him worrying about you, that's all.
Marisha: Really? Everything going on right now, and you're worried about my dad? Typical boyfriend, I guess. That's fair.
Liam: You know, I am so anxious right now, and the only thing that is going to distract me is all your fucking freckles, so come to bed, all right? Come on.
Marisha: Promise me you'll come back with me, no matter what.
Liam: I promise.
Marisha: Even if it doesn't happen, just promise.
Liam: Well, that's an easy promise to make. I promise.
Marisha: I just need you to believe it.
Liam: I believe. Get the fuck in this bed.
Marisha: Sure.
Matt: Okay, so you all find your evening's rest, preparing for the next morning in whatever means you wish to prepare for. We're going to take a break. We'll be back here in a few minutes to pick up this next length of the journey and see where it takes us. We're giving away on the break a Purpleheart dice box from Wyrmwood.
Liam: That's the most beautiful one.
Laura: The Scanlan wood!
Ashley: The Scanlan wood!
Matt: Get that Scanlan wood!
Liam: I mean, the Gabon ebony is really nice, but the Purpleheart--
Sam: Did you say gay-bone?
Liam: It's the Gabon. Gabon?
Matt: Yes, so for that contest you need to come over to Twitch chat, and I've actually forgotten what word we chose for today.
Sam: Scorsese.
Matt: (laughs) What was the word? Thank you. Whisper. The word is whisper. So go ahead and when prompted, enter "whisper" into the chat room to enter, and we'll come back after the break to announce who the lucky winner is. We'll see you guys in a few minutes. (cheering) [break]
Matt: Hello, everyone, and welcome back to Critical Role. Oh god, they're closer now. I'm starting to rethink this scenario.
Liam: Life comes at you fast, Matt.
Matt: That it does, apparently. Anyway, welcome back.
Laura: I think that was the best one I've ever heard, though, Ashley. That was a really good one.
Matt: You may fight one later. (laughter)
Matt: So as you guys rested for the evening and found yourself the following morning, presenting the possibility of making your way into the Shadowfell and what waits for you there. You come to consciousness, you have your morning meal, you begin to plot and plan. What do you wish to do?
Marisha: Go find Eskil.
Laura: Go find Eskil. Somebody else is going to go find out from him, right?
Matt: He's actually eating out in the garden. He has one of the little tables set out there. It's a nice morning out in Whitestone right now. It's chilly, but the clouds have broken a bit. You can see some blue skies; a little bit of sun's breaking through. He's out there with Jecht, his associate, who's in the process of cutting his food for him while Eskil's sitting there, still looking through books and occasionally reaching over and plucking things from his plate to eat. As you approach him, he doesn't even look up. He goes, "Yes? What do you require?"
Marisha: Good morning.
Matt: "Good morning to you, as well, I suppose."
Marisha: Lovely weather today, isn't it?
Matt: "It is weather, yes."
Marisha: So! How's the research on the Shadowfell going?
Matt: "It's done. I've researched it. I don't know what you require."
Marisha: All of it. All of the research?
Matt: "As much as is in the tomes I have at my disposal, yes."
Marisha: Anything we should know? Anything important? Fill us in a little bit? Spark Notes?
Matt: "It's a plane of negative energy, and elements of it are used to funnel the transition of souls from life to death or back. A number of it is scourged by undeath and those that skirt that process. It exists as a mirror plane, much like the Feywild. There are elements that resemble Exandria, but twisted, shifted. It is a very barren, very broken, dust-filled, dark-- not a very pleasant place, really."
Liam: And chock-full of undead, you said?
Matt: "Elements of it, yes."
Marisha: Used to transport souls? Give me a second.
Liam: Sorry, she carries this book around. She's very precise with her notes.
Matt: "Good. You should be. Precision is recommended."
Marisha: Okay. I'm going to show him the necklace that we found. This seems to have a slight magical attunement to the Shadowfell. Do you think I could use this as a plane-shifting device?
Matt: "It would need some alteration. It's possible. Very careful alteration. You need it to be a very narrow fork in order to properly channel the spell, and this does not quite match the proper division of magical energies. It could be physically altered to do so, but too much and you ruin the minor enchantment and attunement."
Marisha: All right. That's very good to know.
Liam: But doable?
Marisha: With how much time?
Matt: "I don't know. I'm no metalworker. I imagine not too much."
Marisha: Okay. Are you able to send messages? You have Sending, yeah?
Matt: He leans back, looking slightly offended. "I have means to communicate with individuals of importance, yes."
Marisha: Just wondering if you could tell my dad that I might be gone for a long time?
Matt: "I have absolutely no interest in any of what you just said."
Marisha: I'd really owe you one, Eskil. Just a quick message?
Matt: "I'm not a messenger service for individuals' parental units."
Liam: Well, we are potentially going to throw ourselves at the greatest evil that this world has ever known, in the hopes that the entire world can survive, so that's a big favor. That's a big gimme for you. So maybe in exchange for that, you could send a little message.
Marisha: Just to my dad to let him know that I might die attempting to--
Matt: "Who's your father?"
Marisha: Korren of the Ashari, who is one of the headmasters.
Matt: "Right, of the wind people. Whatever. Right, okay."
Liam: Who is your daddy, and what does he do? (laughter)
Matt: He thinks for a second. Begins to run his finger in the air, and you watch as there's a faint scrolling of soft bluish-white light. (poof) Turns to smoke and vanishes. "All right, he knows you're going to be off doing stuff in the Shadowfell and probably won't be back for a while."
Marisha: Thank you.
Matt: "You're welcome."
Marisha: Can we maybe borrow your research notes on the Shadowfell? Is that a thing? No? (sighs)
Matt: (thud)
Marisha: Thank you.
Liam: Seriously, thank you.
Marisha: Thank you.
Matt: "You're welcome. I will call into this favor later."
Marisha: Sure. You know where to find us. What?
Liam: Nothing.
Marisha: All right. Enjoy your tea and biscuits.
Matt: "I will."
Marisha: Thanks, Eskil.
Liam: Are they sweet or savory?
Matt: "They're delicious."
Liam: I grab one.
Matt: (frustrated noise)
Laura: While that was going on, is that caravan still in town that was coming through? We've only been gone a day.
Matt: It's still in town.
Laura: Are there any fancy fucking chalices that I could fucking buy for a Heroes' Feast?
Matt: (laughs)
Liam: Whitestone is made of fancy chalices, isn't it, Percy?
Taliesin: We have a chalice room.
Matt: I will say, if you're spending a good portion of the morning going around, asking. Being your charismatic self and well-versed in gathering information in a marketplace, you do find two chalices for sale that would match the specifications required to cast a Heroes' Feast.
Taliesin: Hey. Do you want to buy a chalice?
Laura: Fabulous!
Matt: "The finest chalices this side of Wildemount. It's crazy."
Taliesin: Sipping cups. What do you need?
Liam: One of them is super gauche.
Matt: "This one has an anti-dribble chinnage. For all those nights you're drinking too hard and you don't want to spill all over your front pouch?"
Laura: Do you have a sippy cup lid, though?
Matt: "That will cost you extra."
Laura: How much?
Matt: "Five gold, for the sippy cup."
Sam: Is this fancy enough for a Heroes' Feast?
Laura: How much for the cup?
Matt: "Each cup, because these traveled quite a bit. They'll bring you about 1,200 gold pieces."
Laura: 1,200 gold pieces.
Marisha: Apiece, or total?
Matt: "Apiece."
Liam: Why is the school crossing guard from my hometown in New Jersey in Whitestone right now?
Matt: "Hey, you think I haven't been busy after you left school?" (laughter)
Liam: Everybody in Weehawken is like, what happened to Larry?
Matt: "Found a new occupation  chalice collector."
Taliesin: What am I going to do with all these chalices?
Matt: "Actually..."
Laura: Well, Larry. You know that these chalices are probably going to be used to save the world.
Matt: "That sounds like a perfect reason to buy them."
Laura: It does, doesn't it? And just think how wonderful it will be when you can tell everyone that you sell to that you sold the things that saved the world to Vox Machina.
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Laura: It wasn't a one. Persuasion, 19.
Matt: "Vox Machina, you say? You know these folks?"
Laura: Lady Vex'ahlia, at your service.
Matt: His eye widens on one side. "Well, I've not really seen or know much about you folks, but I've heard tales of you."
Laura: I turn and show him the scales from the Chroma Conclave.
Matt: "That real dragon? No shit. Well, I mean, tell you what." He pulls out a piece of paper and starts scrawling on it. He pulls out his inkwell and starts dipping it. "If you would do the honor of signing this official document that says that these were sold to none other than Lady Vex'ahlia of Vox Machina that I can use as proof of this transaction for my own promotional purposes, I'll be happy to give you both of these--"
Laura: This is my favorite shop on the Citadel.
Taliesin: This is the equivalent of the head shot on the wall.
Matt: Yeah, basically. "I will happily give you both of these at a discount of 1,000 gold pieces apiece."
Laura: I like your style. Can I insight and make sure this isn't some sort of enchanted piece of fucking--
Matt: Sure, go for it.
Laura: What would I add to that?
Matt: Your insight.
Laura: Okay, see if he's full of shit. 14?
Matt: 14? Hard to read. (laughter)
Laura: You know what? Fuck it. We're probably going to die, anyway.
Matt: "A pleasure doing business with you, milady." Hands you the two chalices. They're beautiful. One's more reddish gem-encrusted. The other has a platinum spiral that runs around the base of it. They're both beautiful and intricate.
Laura: And you just threw the sippy cup lid as a little--
Matt: "Yeah, okay."
Taliesin: For the chalice on the go.
Liam: Now stay in school, Liam. Stay in school.
Matt: "Wait, that guy looks familiar." I forgot to also say we have a winner, by the way. Kiajade. Congratulations. I should have mentioned that. I got caught up in the story. Thank god that's never happened before. But congratulations. All right. You've acquired your chalices. What other business do you guys want to take care of?
Taliesin: I'm going to make sure I have enough powder and shot for a bit of a jaunt, so I'm going into the stores of what we make here and reloading. I'm also going to try and make some silver shot. I've never tried it before.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: Not a ton. I want to try and make 12. I want to see if I can make 12.
Matt: Make a tinkering check. Dexterity. Well, no. This would be intelligence.
Taliesin: It's intelligence?
Matt: It's a new concept you're trying.
Taliesin: Intelligence check.
Matt: Plus your proficiency.
Taliesin: Plus my proficiency. That's 19.
Matt: 19? Sure. You manage to make about 12 pieces of silver shot. You know, for the most part, because it's not as hard as other forms, it's going to be... but it is susceptible to enchantment.
Taliesin: Which is why I was going to then take those to Pike. I don't entirely understand how this works, but I had an idea. And I show her the 12 silver bearings, basically. Would you know how to bless something like this?
Ashley: I could certainly try.
Taliesin: I think this might come in handy. It's a wild idea. I don't know. I'm trying to think of surprising her with something.
Ashley: I think that's actually a fantastic idea.
Taliesin: They're a bit hard to make, and they may just not be useful at all, but I thought... I don't know how any of this works.
Ashley: I'll see what I can do. Yeah. I'll see what I can do.
Taliesin: Thank you.
Matt: Okay. You take the silver shot. Anyone want to try anything else?
Laura: Yeah. I want to buy some holy oil, or get some holy oil from the church, or something. (laughter) Where do I get holy oil?
Sam: From the church.
Laura: We've gotten holy oil before. I just can't remember from where.
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Laura: 21.
Matt: 21. "You look like you're looking for something to buy."
Laura: Oh, really? Larry, do you have any holy oil?
Matt: "My lady. Do I? I happen to have one vial of holy oil, good for two applications."
Laura: All right. That's it? Just one?
Matt: "Traveled a long way, and you're a little late in the shopping day. I was all full on them, but they've been flying off the shelf. My apologies."
Laura: Skeletons everywhere.
Ashley: Vex, I have some holy oil?
Laura: How much?
Ashley: I don't know. I just have a vial of it. I don't know how much that is.
Laura: That's good for two applications, I think.
Ashley: Probably good for two applications.
Matt: Three applications with the vial that you have.
Laura: Oh, this one has a little bit missing? How much? Because this is less than it normally is.
Matt: "Look, you've already done some good business with me. I'll give it to you for 150."
Sam: But you have to sign this poster. (laughter)
Ashley: For my Hawaiian poke bowl mascot. (laughter)
Travis: I would eat there all the time.
Laura: 150 gold. Sure. Only because Percy gave me a look. You know what-- yeah, okay.
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: She's going to keep trying to listen to one word.
Marisha: A lot to unpack here.
Matt: I'm not hearing music. We'll check that in a second. Anybody else want to prepare anything?
Liam: Yeah. I want to track down Kynan for a minute.
Matt: Okay. You find him. It's early morning. They've finished their early round of training for the morning, and some of the early Pale Guard recruits are in the process of rushing off and taking a small lunch break. He's currently taking a lot of the equipment from the training grounds and setting it aside in the various weapon racks, and generally cleaning up the space as you approach. He looks over his shoulder as he sets some of the practice blades along the edge.
Liam: Hey, brother man. How's all?
Matt: "Good. All's well. Just keeping things going. Got a lot of good up-and-coming folks."
Liam: You got all these ladies and gentlemen in shape?
Matt: "Working on it. It's a process."
Liam: I don't want to take up a lot of your time. We just got in, and we're heading out again. Anyway, I'm glad that I have Simon back, but I feel bad because I gave it to you and I took it away. But we're leaving, and I want to travel light, so I wanted to make it up to you. I have this. I'm going to give you this dagger. It's the Keen Dagger. Take this. It's too much; I can't use it. I've got this thing. Anyway. Just hold onto it. That's it.
Matt: "Thank you very much. I'll keep it at my side." He takes the basic dagger out of his sheath and chucks it into the corner.
Liam: Yeah. That one's better. And thanks, and I think Percy's thankful, too. I think. You're doing really good work here.
Matt: "Thank you. Thank you very much."
Liam: Long, twisted road, but look where we are. Look where you are.
Matt: "There's still a ways to go."
Liam: Pat, pat.
Laura: Pat, pat where?
Liam: On his dick, obviously. (laughter)
Travis: The open palm?
Liam: On his cheek. That's it. Anyway, you're busy. We'll see you soon.
Matt: "I look forward to it. Stay safe."
Liam: I will. Keep up the good work. (whoosh)
Matt: All right.
Sam: I guess Taryon will go find Vex. Stumble up and say, I have to stay here and keep working on Doty. I understand you're leaving today.
Laura: You're not going to come with us?
Sam: I cannot. I have to stay and fix Doty and get back to my home. I'm sorry. It's been a pleasure.
Laura: Don't say it's been a pleasure!
Sam: It's been an honor to have your acquaintance, and I'm afraid I have to return, but perhaps we'll meet again sometime.
Laura: I give him a big old hug. And I give him...
Liam: Three copper.
Laura: I give him-- I don't have any feathers left, I don't think.
Sam: Do you have any money? (laughter)
Laura: I have no money, Tary.
Sam: I need money.
Taliesin: Technically speaking, you've been on salary.
Sam: How about this? I wrote you a check. Can you rip it up? I don't think I can pay it, ever. (laughter)
Laura: Tary, I ripped it up about two weeks after you moved in.
Sam: Thank you. And you have no other money on you?
Laura: I open up my pouch, and I've got zero personal gold. Just party funds.
Sam: Well, I feel like I should leave you with all of my belongings, and all of my magical items, but I need them for my brigade. I'll leave you with the seashell crown that who gave me? Grog?
Laura: Percy.
Sam: Percy gave me.
Laura: I think he'd want you to have that.
Sam: Do you want the half of a geode rock with 30 living souls inside of it?
Laura: Yeah, give it to me. Thanks, friend.
Sam: I can't use it.
Laura: 30-soul rock. Got it.
Marisha: 30 Rock Soul? (giggles)
Travis: 30 souls just sitting in a rock. You think my shit's weird?
Sam: Maybe I should have shown that to Pike sometime in the last year?
Laura: I will show it to her.
Taliesin: That's just been sitting on your bedside, hasn't it? Slowly making the sound of crying.
Matt: If you get really close at night, you hear this faint (screams).
Laura: Help me!
Matt: He puts another pillow over it.
Laura: What is that?
Taliesin: Anything else?
Sam: Do you think you'll see Percy anytime soon?
Laura: I think I might.
Sam: When you do, (pink) can you give him this little gem for his flashlight? I can't spare many, but that will give him one flashlight.
Laura: Definitely.
Taliesin: He'll have to come back, anyway, because he doesn't know how to make the ammo for his gun.
Laura: How are you going to get Doty home?
Sam: Well, after he's fixed, me and Chod--
Laura: Right. Lionel. I think he likes to be called Lionel.
Sam: I prefer Chod. I think we'll set off the old-fashioned way.
Laura: See who you pick up along the way?
Sam: Ooh! That could be chapter one of the new book.
Laura: Exactly.
Sam: Yes. A New Hope. Something like that.
Laura: I like it. It's epic. Catchy.
Sam: Yes. Well, I'm not going to say have fun, because you're going to a terrible place.
Laura: We might not make it out alive. If you talk to my brother, that's what he says. He says it every time.
Liam: I never said that.
Sam: If you die, I will be very upset. Hey, if I die, your thing will glow, so that will be good.
Laura: Same. So we'll know.
Sam: I'll see you sometime in Wildemount?
Laura: Of course we'll come visit you.
Sam: All right.
Laura: I love you so much.
Sam: You, too. Take care of your hair. You know, you shouldn't wash it as often as you do. It just makes it dry and flaky.
Laura: The oil is helpful. Thank you.
Sam: Get it trimmed every two weeks.
Laura: Right.
Sam: And have someone comb it.
Laura: Yeah, I probably should do that, huh?
Sam: It's really disgusting sometimes.
Laura: Okay. I'll brush it a hundred brush strokes every night, just like you.
Sam: Thank you. All right. Goodbye. I'll see you soon, Little Elf Girl.
Laura: Bye, Goldie. (fake-cries)
Matt: All right, so what do you wish to do, guys?
Ashley: Is there a way that I can bless these bullets?
Taliesin: They're musket balls, technically. They're not bullets.
Matt: It will take you a while to do so. You could temporarily bless them with the Bless spell, but to infuse them with the blessing would be the equivalent of a small enchantment, so it would take you a couple of days or something.
Ashley: Well, I could start it, depending on when we leave, I guess. I have Bless. I was looking at that, but I didn't know I could use that on actual objects, other than people.
Taliesin: We also have to modify one of the necklaces.
Laura: Yeah. That needs to go to a blacksmith, or something?
Marisha: Unless we want to go through the old-fashioned way like the cultists did.
Liam: The old-fashioned way?
Laura: We can't Plane Shift unless we alter the necklace.
Taliesin: But we have enough necklaces that we could just jump through.
Travis: That one.
Marisha: We might take a little bit of damage on the way through.
Travis: I'm game.
Laura: You have a bajillion health points.
Travis: I also thought of something overnight. All right? It hurt, because it's kind of brilliant. Can you hold your breath for-- (whispering) what's higher than ten?
Ashley: (whispering) 11.
Travis: 11 seconds.
Sam: Sure.
Laura: Why?
Travis: Why don't all you bitches just hop in the Bag of Holding, I jump through, take all the damage for us, and then you just (popping sounds) pop right back out?
Taliesin: I can think of many reasons why that's probably not a good idea.
Travis: What could it possibly be?
Taliesin: The Bag of Holding is a negative space. It's not designed to sustain life.
Travis: Have you ever been in one?
Taliesin: Very specifically not, because things die in there.
Liam: Grog, think of all the things you've pulled out of there that look like sloppy joes, when they didn't look like that going in.
Laura: Let's put something living inside of there and wait ten seconds and then take it out and see if it's still alive.
Travis: But it has to be able to hold its breath. If we throw a dog in there--
Ashley: So if it breathes, it will die.
Travis: Yeah, there's no air, I don't think.
Laura: If it's ten seconds and it's not knowing to hold its breath, it will come out alive, still.
Travis: If you want to do CPR, whatever.
Taliesin: What if the things inside take the damage even if they are in the Bag of Holding?
Travis: We should find out. Are you going in?
Taliesin: No.
Travis: I'll go in.
Ashley: You stick your hand in there all the time. No?
Taliesin: This is not a magic you want to be messing around with.
Travis: All right. I just wanted to put it out there. We can all take the stones and go through. I bet it's not going to be that bad of a deal.
Taliesin: No, this is the fantasy equivalent of locking yourself in a refrigerator.
Travis: Just wanted to put it out there if you wanted to live on the edge of life, but no, we'll just do it the boring way.
Taliesin: I feel comfortable with the level of risk-taking of jumping into a giant sphere that crushes anything it touches.
Marisha: It's definitely a large amount of risk-taking already.
Laura: Can anybody tell if this plate is cursed? Can you tell if something's cursed, bro?
Sam: Oh, the armor?
Liam: No.
Laura: Can you tell if something is cursed, Pike?
Ashley: I could try. Can I check it out and see if it's cursed?
Travis: That is a face that says, I'm giving you nothing. (groans) Garlic chicken.
Laura: Gross. Were you the one burping earlier, too?
Travis: I blew it that way, though.
Laura: Yeah, but somebody burped in the first half of the game, and it was foul.
Travis: It's probably me.
Taliesin: Careful where you aim that. You might break a camera.
Sam: Let's go. Let's move!
Laura: I'm trying to figure out if this plate mail is cursed or not.
Sam: Who the fuck cares? We're going to a cursed place.
Laura: No, but it's so we can put it on somebody here.
Taliesin: Let's grab a bit of funds. Do we have the group funds, as well? We have access to the group funds.
Sam: You think one plate armor's going to do anything?
Marisha: Scanlan's back.
Travis: Let's go.
Liam: Guess who's back?
Marisha: Hang on. Do we want to do a Heroes' Feast?
Taliesin: Not yet.
Laura: Yeah, 'cause what if something's waiting for us on the other side?
Taliesin: What if nothing's waiting for us on the other side? Because now we're down one Heroes' Feast.
Laura: Yeah, but what if there is?
Travis: We've got a mansion.
Taliesin: Then we dive into the mansion and we have a Heroes' Feast.
Laura: We've got to waste a fucking minute. We've got to protect Scanlan for a minute.
Taliesin: I think we're going to be okay.
Liam: I'm with your beau.
Taliesin: I think over-cautious. Even when jumping into the depths of the undead, there's such a thing as over-cautious.
Travis: Let's go down to the ziggurat.
Taliesin: I'm putting the-- as I hit the microphone. Do not touch your microphone when you put on your necklace. I'm putting on my necklace.
Laura: Okay, I'll put on my necklace.
Matt: Each of you don one of the symbols?
Travis: Yeah.
Marisha: Do we need to put on the robes, too, that we found?
Laura: Fuck the robes.
Taliesin: I want them to see me coming.
Marisha: All right. Do you want the robes?
Liam: I don't feel strongly about it.
Travis: If we put on the robes, we've got to pull out an eyeball each, too.
Ashley: We're already there? We're standing at the ball?
Laura: Are we going down? Sure.
Travis: We're going down to the ziggurat.
Matt: All right. You find your way down into the subterranean tunnels beneath Whitestone, winding through the caverns until you enter the chamber that contains the ziggurat where you initially faced off with the Briarwoods. As you climb to the top, there before you, you see standing in all of its glory, the black, as you've called it, spinning orb of death. Approximately that large now, and it's this dark void, that as you get close, it has this weird vibration to it. And there it is, suspended about four feet off the ground at the top of this ziggurat.
Laura: Can I get close to it and put the necklace near it without touching it?
Matt: Yeah. You put the necklace near it, and you watch as the sphere, this weird grayish aura around it begins to emanate faintly, almost like the closer it gets, the brighter this weird gray aura tends to get and the wider it grows.
Laura: That seems promising.
Liam: I'm right behind you.
Taliesin: Who first?
Liam: Me. (whoosh)
Sam: (screams)
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: Well, that happened.
Matt: I would like you to make a constitution saving throw.
Marisha: Keyleth reaches for Vax right as he goes in. Oh shit.
Liam: I'll use my first Luck of the day. Wasn't that bad, but it's an important roll. That's better. 20.
Matt: 20. Okay.
Travis: That's a lot of dice.
Marisha: Oh Jesus, that's so many dice.
Ashley: (whispering) I thought we bamfed into it.
Marisha: He twitched again.
Matt: You take 11 points of necrotic damage. Anybody else?
Marisha: Just that? That's it?
Matt: You don't know that. You just saw him vanish.
Travis: I'm game. I'll go.
Marisha: All right.
Matt: Everybody going in?
Marisha: Yeah, in.
Matt: All right. Everyone, make a constitution saving throw, please.
Sam: Nine. No, 17.
Matt: 17.
Taliesin: 23.
Matt: 22 points of necrotic damage. 11 points of necrotic damage.
Travis: Nine.
Matt: 22 points of necrotic damage. 22 points of necrotic damage.
Ashley: Six.
Matt: 22 points of necrotic damage.
Marisha: 16.
Matt: 22 points of necrotic damage. So as you leap into the sphere, you feel as if the gravity that holds you to the ground, or sometimes the ceiling, bends around you and your limbs are wrenched forward, like someone has you in a full Nelson that doesn't end. Your body is about to be condensed and crushed, when you feel the symbol pulse, and the gravity lessens somewhat. It's still tearing into you, and you feel this coldness and this numbness come over your body, as you feel like you're a square peg being pushed through a round hole, physically pushed through against your will. You begin to yell out in pain instinctually before it comes to a stop and you all land to your feet, out of breath. The numbness begins to fade to immediate pins and needles, just pain across your entire body. You feel like someone just raked a number of tacks across every surface of your skin and as the pain begins to throb, you can feel the blood pulsing throughout your body as it all shoots to the surface. You still sense that you, thanks to your symbols around your neck, you managed to withstand a much more dangerous arrival. As your eyes focus, you already feel the chilled air that surrounds you, like a cold, cold winter morning. The sky above is sunless and gray, like an overcast horizon without clouds to texture it, breached by distant mountain ranges like so much broken glass. You see behind you immediately the other corresponding siphon, floating, bright gray-white in color and glowing, the same color that you saw briefly shifted to in the ziggurat near Ank'harel. Beneath it, you find shards of ruined objects, piles of long-dead bodies, flesh and bone rended and twisted like they'd been put through some rapid tornado on different sides of their body. And you see a lot of these shattered pieces of wood and metal were all a number of objects that were thrown in here during the experimental phase when you guys first uncovered this. You look around and notice that you stand atop a rectangular platform of dark, smooth stone, about 15 feet on each side. Beneath the edges, about 20 feet down, 'til it comes to the ground. So you're on an elevated stone platform that the siphon is affixed to above, floating about four feet above the top of the surface. And you look down to the ground immediately around you and you see just dry, cracked badlands. It seems to spread out, making up the majority of the Shadowfell around you. Surrounding your location, your sight clarifies to see what appears to be hundreds of buildings and structures that form this shade of an ancient city, like a town, a sprawling village. Half the structures toppled and destroyed, piles of rubble and rock. The ground itself seems to jut up in places, these tiny, shooting spires of black and gray earth that the city has either been built around or seemed to have grown through. As you look past that, you see movement throughout the streets in the distance, but before you can focus on that, your vision immediately sticks towards, in the center of this circular-like city, the standing, ominous, commanding, massive spire of obsidian black, familiar to both of you through two different types of vision you've experienced. A jagged monolith that exudes ancient hatred, encircled by dozens of dark, winged beasts that watch over the dreary skies. Who here is proficient in history?
Laura: Nobody is proficient in history?!
Sam: We're doomed to repeat it.
Travis: Really, Percy?
Taliesin: No, I have other qualities, history was not my forefront. I know Whitestone.
Sam: Somewhere, Taryon is reading a history book.
Matt: Exactly. The two of you make history checks with disadvantage because you lack proficiency. Yes, you being a bard, you pick up information in passing. With disadvantage, each of you.
Taliesin: Nine.
Sam: 11.
Laura: Oh god.
Sam: That's a bad sign.
Matt: You have no inclination of where you stand or what's before you. All you know is you stand now on the cold plane of the Shadowfell, the echo of the Prime Material.
Laura: Our notes on the Shadowfell.
Matt: You do.
Taliesin: Can we consult the Rand McNally?
Travis: The Rand McNally guide, yeah.
Matt: You're welcome to. Just so you guys know, you are all standing out in the middle of the open, on this large stone platform looking down in the center of this giant city--
Laura: There are things that are moving below. I see them.
Marisha: And the ziggurat is above us?
Matt: There is no ziggurat. There is a large, black spire, but that's in the center of the city maybe two miles off.
Laura: As we hop down, I cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us.
Liam: There are buildings around, so are we in the middle of a field, a plain, badlands?
Matt: There are buildings. You see two structures maybe 50 or 60 feet from you on each side, and then going forward, from your current position, it leads right into the city. So this structure is on the outskirts. It's right on the perimeter.
Laura: Do we see any other orbs around?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Laura: 25.
Matt: You glance and, in the faint gray sky above you, around the glowing white-gray orb this side of the siphon, you see a very, very faint aura of bluish-purple that is weaving into a thread, a rope almost, various strands that knot and twist to form a cord, a very barely visible cord that just drifts up towards the very top of that tower for miles. And there at the top of the tower, you see a vibrant, sparking, pulsing, purple glow. And from there, you can see two other distant strands that arc off into the very faint other edges across, triangulating around the other sides of the outskirts of this ancient city. You see the faint, glowing white-gray pulse of two other siphons affixed to two other platforms, all these strands converging at the top of the tower.
Ashley: Before we get to it, can I cast Bless on his bullets so I can give them back to him?
Matt: How long does it last?
Ashley: Not very long.
Matt: You can. There's a difference between casting a spell and enchanting something. It's a loose enchantment to Bless the ammunition. That takes a while to focus on.
Taliesin: I imagine it'll take a few days when it's done.
Ashley: When it's done.
Taliesin: I don't expect us to be in and out of here, I think this is going to take some time.
Ashley: I'd rather enchant them.
Travis: The structures to our left and our right, are they solid, do they have focus?
Matt: They're solid, they're stone buildings, they're homes, though plain and cracked. There are sections of wall missing in places. As you look about the grounds here, and you know this because you've ransacked and been responsible for the ransacking... or the rubble of Westruun. But this city appears to have been, some time long ago, under siege. You see signs of battle, you see impact, you see roofs that were burned and now lie as just black husks. This area has seen warfare long ago and the signs of it are old and it looks like the signs of life that exist in this space, the movement you see of figures in the distance wandering through the streets, there's no immediate threat to this city, but you get the sense just looking out that something big happened here a long time ago.
Travis: Any of you with the eyes, can you see what that is up in the air?
Laura: Yeah, I also want to look and see what the fuck kind of creatures it is that are moving around in the city. But I want to see what kind of creatures are flying around as well.
Matt: Okay, so you guys have moved down from the platform, and you cast Pass Without a Trace, so I'd like everyone to make a stealth check, please. Adding plus ten to your roll.
Sam: 26.
Taliesin: 22.
Marisha: 27.
Liam: 40.
Laura: 23.
Ashley: 21.
Travis: 18.
Laura: Ooh shit, you rolled bad, yo!
Matt: Okay! So, to stay stealthed, you have to find some place to be stealthy. You're not stealthing out in the middle of nowhere. Where are you going to find--
Taliesin: Towards the city.
Laura: Those buildings.
Liam: Are we temporarily staying put and talking shit out or are we going?
Taliesin: The building on the left, I'd say.
Laura: Yeah, like hide behind something.
Matt: Okay, you guys dart off to the left. It appears to have once been a two-story structure, but the upper level has since collapsed and part of it is falling into the bottom floor. As you begin to approach the doorway on the inside, Vex'ahlia, you hear what sounds like a faint crunching sound on the inside.
Travis: (nervous laughter) What the fuck? Oh my god.
Liam: (whispering) What's the matter?
Laura: (whispering) There's something in this building. (louder) Are there windows on the building, at all?
Matt: There are. There is one window on your side, and the doorway around the corner.
Laura: Peek in.
Liam: I'll look in the window with my 40 stealth.
Matt: You glance inside, and as you peek over the top, in the brief bits of light coming through the shadow in here, you can see the collapsed piles of broken stone and wood planks that used to hold the structure of the upper level together. You can see what looks like furniture that's been destroyed. Simple, basic. This is not an extravagantly decorated space. Built for function, more than anything. But moving amidst the shadow, you see what appears to be a humanoid creature of pale gray skin, elongated limbs, long, clawed fingers. Bald head, pointed, hooked ears, and what looks to be slightly broken, jagged, yellow, elongated teeth in this jaw, as it's currently munching on what looks to be a small furred rodent of some kind. (crunching)
Liam: This is probably redundant, but I will Divine Sense undead.
Matt: It is very undead.
Liam: Do I sense, see, hear anything besides this one?
Matt: What's the radius?
Liam: 60 feet.
Matt: Nothing else catches your attention, no. You watch as it finishes and walks toward the doorway. Vex'ahlia, as you're off to the side, you watch as this creature leans forward and goes into a sprint, and then leaps up onto a distant rooftop. (leaping noises) Just leaping from rooftop to rooftop. As you're watching that leap, another movement catches your eye, and you see another one about three blocks down. You can see, there are at least a handful of these creatures stalking through the ruins, leaping from building to building, from floor to floor.
Ashley: What was it eating?
Matt: A small, furred creature. You didn't get a good look at it. You got a fair look at it.
Travis: It was an otter. I love otters.
Matt: Apparently, so does the creature.
Laura: Why would there be otters in the Shadowfell?
Matt: There's something you didn't know about otters, Laura.
Marisha: They love holding hands?
Laura: Does it look like any of those scary creatures are around each other, or are they avoiding each other?
Matt: It's hard to tell at this distance. You're so far out of the city. You've only been able to notice a few shapes from this distance. You'd probably have to get in a little closer and spend some time watching their behavior to pick that up.
Liam: I'm going to crouch down by this dead rodent. Do I sense the Queen, more or less, here?
Matt: Make a wisdom check.
Liam: 18.
Matt: You close your eyes for a second. No. None.
Travis: Can I pop my head back out the door, and looking at the ground, is there any semblance of a sewer system or a runoff grate or anything?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Travis: Oh Jesus. Yeah, bitch. Seven.
Matt: No. Not at all.
Laura: Grog! Get your head back inside.
Travis: What?
Laura: There's things flying around out there.
Travis: I'm keeping a lookout.
Taliesin: I'm going to crawl up the wall to the second floor to see what's up there.
Matt: As you go up the side and step over onto the rubble, you see a large, broken, what was once the floor of the top floor that slid into this giant decline, this slide of rubble, if you will. At the top, you can see what looks to be a broken weapon rack that is empty. No weapons on it, but you get the sense that this small structure was a perimeter tower outpost.
Taliesin: It's been cleaned out.
Matt: Apparently.
Taliesin: There's no sign of anybody who used to be here? Nothing of value, nothing of interest?
Matt: Not in the structure, no.
Taliesin: I think we're going to have to move deeper in.
Sam: Should I make us all ghoulie?
Travis: Do we notice anything strange about the little necklaces that we're wearing now that we're in this place?
Matt: Nothing at the moment, no.
Liam: Hey, you feeling good about your decision to come with us?
Sam: This is terrible. I haven't had this much fun in a long time. Let's go do it. I'll cast Seeming on us and make us all gray, pointy-eared, little Nosferatu-vampirey things, I suppose. Did I see the thing that skittered out?
Matt: Very briefly.
Sam: I've seen other undead things.
Matt: Yeah. You can make something that looks undead-adjacent.
Sam: Yeah. My guy will look more like the Meat Man in undead form, but otherwise, everyone's normal.
Laura: I want straggly, but still a braid. Really nasty, straggly hair.
Sam: Your ear's half off.
Travis: I definitely want an eyeball hanging out.
Sam: Sure.
Taliesin: Straight hole right through the head. No jaw.
Sam: Okay.
Matt: All right. What do you guys do?
Laura: I think we should probably try to observe the things that are flying around the tower.
Taliesin: Slowly make our way to the town.
Laura: Observe. Still try to avoid any of those scary creatures, but see if they avoid each other as we look at them.
Liam: Super slow, super careful.
Sam: Maybe we should stagger.
Laura: No, those things were speedy. Be normal.
Sam: We'll walk like this.
Taliesin: Left, right, left, step, step, step. (laughter)
Matt: Make a performance check. No.
Marisha: While they were looking at weapons racks and doing stuff like that--
Taliesin: You make it sound so tawdry. Carry on.
Marisha: While they were doing that, I pull Vax aside. I grab him--
Sam: Let's get married.
Laura: Let's just do it.
Marisha: Goddamn it. Scanlan's back. Listen, you can't die, and I don't know what's going on in your head, or what you're thinking, but I feel like it's not good.
Liam: I'm the best I've ever been. Don't worry about me. Worry about us.
Marisha: Has the Raven Queen spoken to you at all?
Liam: Yes.
Marisha: Recently? Down here?
Liam: Not since we got here, no, but recently.
Marisha: I need you with us. Not with her. I need you with us, and with me. So let me do this. And I'm going to burn my 9th-level spell and cast Foresight on Vax.
Sam: Ooh, Foresight!
Laura: What is that?
Sam: Shit. It's real good. (laughter)
Liam: This one goes to nine.
Laura: What is Foresight?
Marisha: Don't fuck it up, man. It's my 9th-level spell.
Matt: For the next eight hours, not concentration, you can't be surprised. You have advantage on all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws, and other creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against you.
Laura: Holy shit.
Sam: You can see just in the future. Three seconds.
Laura: That's amazing!
Liam: You guys, let's go shopping! (laughter)
Travis: I raise my blood axe...
Matt: All right.
Sam: Am I going to die in three seconds? Am I going to die in three seconds? (laughter)
Taliesin: Let's make our way into town. Quietly.
Liam: Within the next eight hours.
Sam: I feel like Vax should lead the party.
Matt: All right, so are you stealthing through?
Taliesin: Yes.
Laura: Still being stealthy, but yeah.
Liam: Looking cool, but stealthing.
Marisha: We look so cool.
Taliesin: We're not doing--
Laura: Matt's like, I will kill you all.
Matt: You guys scatter just enough to dart between alleys and find shaded bits and leap from base of building to alley, keeping a cohesive unit as best you can. The first thing you notice, the further in you get, even within just the first couple of blocks of the city, you see broken swords, you see pieces of armor, and you see figures walking through the street ahead of you. You see hundreds of scattered skeletons, decomposing bodies shambling through, but they all walk in patterns. They're not scattered, mindless. There is some will or direction to their movements. You see them wearing ornate armor with designs and symbols on them that look old and tarnished and scratched.
Liam: Are they moving like troops or is each individual following its own...?
Matt: Some are moving as troops, and occasionally you see an individual wander off, but they're just sort of walking around and scanning. I'm going to have Scanlan, you roll a history check, and Pike, roll a religion check.
Sam: 17. Oh! You know what, seems important, I will inspire myself. Can I do that? I haven't done this in so long.
Matt: Yeah, add a d12 to it.
Sam: 18.
Matt: Got to get the dust off, man.
Ashley: 23.
Matt: Okay. You, looking over there, a lot of the armor that these skeletons are wearing, it doesn't fit with the Shadowfell. The silvers, the golds, the tattered blue cloaks, there's something regal about some of these armor sets, as old and ancient as they may be. It doesn't seem to match the sense and feel of the Shadowfell. While you're having this thought, Pike, you glance over and look at one of these pieces of armor and you recognize the symbol, it's like a stained-glass circle with a gold star in the center. It's the symbol of Pelor. Many of these bodies, these undead wandering the city, seem to have been soldiers that fell in whatever battle that once besieged this city, and many bear the mark of Pelor.
Taliesin: I mean, the Chained--
Laura: The Chained Oblivion.
Taliesin: The Chained Oblivion, there was a fight between.
Matt: That was, but that was on the Prime Material, and that was in the vicinity of the Alabaster Sierras.
Taliesin: That mark couldn't have ended up--
Laura: Was the Shadowfell always the Shadowfell?
Taliesin: I don't know.
Sam: Maybe this city was taken somewhere else or something. Transported here.
Marisha: Does this city look like Whitestone?
Matt: No. None of the buildings, the structures, resemble Whitestone.
Sam: Is there any architecture that I, or anyone, notices, like from a region of where we've been?
Matt: No. Not really.
Sam: Mid-century modern, mostly?
Matt: Yeah, yeah, lot of Ikea. No, but you do get the sense-- some of the architecture here does resemble elements of some architecture designs that remind you of Wildemount.
Sam: Man, we should have brought Tary.
Matt: But, like, old Wildemount. Like, no modern structures, definitely from centuries back. As you continue to wander and keep your eyes out, you occasionally hear the distant (creature shrieking). You watch as the (wings flapping) winged, dark beasts are circling overhead.
Sam: Do we recognize them?
Matt: No, not yet.
Laura: Never seen anything like it?
Matt: You have not seen anything like these before. Black as night against the gray sky. From this distance, you make out no details in their bodies. It's almost like a moving shadow above you. Wherever light would hit to give you some sense of structure, it's just absence, void. It's just a flying shadow.
Taliesin: Are there any buildings that have enough structure to them where it feels like there might be things inside that have been relatively unmolested at this point?
Matt: Possibly. Make a perception check.
Taliesin: 12.
Matt: 12. I mean, there are some buildings that look like they have some structure, and the further into the city you get, the more you see that this becomes a little less destroyed. But you begin to see some figures moving that are not armored undead, not zombies, and not any of these quick-moving creatures. You see three figures walking back towards the orb where you guys came from in the same black cult robes, hoods off. They would appear to be human.
Taliesin: But they're cultists.
Matt: But they're cultists.
Laura: They don't look like they're afraid of walking around?
Liam: Yeah, what's their demeanor?
Matt: They're just walking through.
Liam: How far are they from us?
Matt: They're about 100 feet up. A little further than that.
Liam: Coming our way?
Matt: Coming your way towards the sphere where you guys were.
Ashley: Maybe that's what we need to look like.
Travis: Cover and ambush?
Liam: Or watch, see what they're doing.
Taliesin: Kill two, keep one to question?
Marisha: How many are there, three?
Matt: Three of them.
Taliesin: God, can we even kill people here? Will they die?
Liam: Yes. But do we watch, see what they do with the sphere first?
Taliesin: Let's cut them off.
Sam: I could be bait. Then you could come ambush them.
Liam: Let's watch for a moment longer.
Travis: Find cover.
Matt: Okay. So what do you guys do?
Travis: I'm going into the building.
Laura: I'm following them, just subtly.
Marisha: Yeah, let the twins go ahead first.
Matt: Okay, so the two twins follow and the rest of you duck into a building off to the side? Okay. You guys, I need you both individually to roll stealth as you tail behind them.
Laura: And we still have Pass Without a Trace on. 34.
Liam: 45.
Sam: Wait, we're staying put and they're walking off somewhere else? How are we going to see what's going to happen?
Travis: They were walking towards us.
Matt: The cultists are basically walking past you guys, going the opposite direction of where you were traveling, and both the twins just vanish from sight. You're like, "Well what if-- Gone again." You guys pace behind them, jumping from alley to alley. Occasionally they'll stop and do a walk over. There's not a sense of paranoia, but they're very watchful. Their attire, while still cult robes, is a little more intricately adorned, and you see the one in the front is carrying a hanging lantern that gives off this weird smoke behind it, like a censer.
Travis: A censer?
Liam: Yeah, like a Catholic.
Matt: Yeah. But it gives off this faint glow, and they walk and make their way slowly outside of the city towards the pillar where the orb is. And they just look around it, walk over to the few buildings to the side, divide a little bit to a perimeter, reconvene at the base of the orb, and begin making their way back to the center of the city.
Laura: Is there anything else around? Should we kill them?
Liam: All three? Take one? Kill two, leave one?
Sam: We can ambush them.
Laura: Get ready for an ambush.
Taliesin: When they walk by the house, push them.
Laura: When they walk past you guys, we'll attack.
Sam: Should I put someone out there to confuse them?
Liam: No. When we go, follow suit.
Marisha: I can Grasping Vine one into the building, right into Grog's hands.
Laura: Wait until we attack them first.
Matt: All right. The three of them walk back, leaving a small censer trail behind. The smoke, the almost incense-like smoke, burns off within a few feet after. They eventually cross right next to the doorway and window to where the rest of you are waiting. Both of you guys roll for an attack. Are you aiming at two different ones? Same one?
Laura: Two different ones. And it's an automatic...
Matt: It's an automatic crit if you hit, and you have advantage on the hit because they don't see you.
Laura: Natural 20. Not that it matters, because I already got a crit.
Matt: But still, it's nice.
Liam: 26.
Matt: 26. Both hit. Go ahead and roll damage, both of you, doubling your weapon die damage and your sneak attack.
Laura: Bramble shot.
Sam: There's three of them, right?
Matt: Three of them, yes... You also double the bramble shot damage because it's a crit.
Sam: Hey, look, we're killing things! Well, maybe.
Taliesin: Incapacitating, at the very least.
Liam: 85.
Laura: Oh, shit, dude.
Sam: 85?
Matt: 85 damage. Rogues, man. It's what they do.
Taliesin: The head is cleaved from the body.
Laura: 56 for me.
Sam: It was Kima and Allura on a mission. They're dead.
Matt: As the three of them walk, the two on the outside both, at the same time, (impacts), crumple. No noise, just fall to their knees, face down on the ground, unmoving. The one in the center that's holding the censer turns and looks back and sees--
Marisha: And I go (whoosh) and Grasping Vine him, and throw him right into Grog's hands.
Laura: Don't kill him!
Travis: And if he's successfully thrown, I just cover his mouth and grab the back of his head and squeeze.
Sam: Which mouth?
Travis: Ew, God.
Matt: That is a 16.
Marisha: Fail.
Matt: Fail. That's right, because 21. So as soon as he turns around, out of one of the cracks in the stonework nearby, you can see some dry, grass-like gray brush. There is what appears to be some faint hints of local plant life, but it all looks like gray, dry grass. Or, you know after a morning freeze, when you see elements of a field that have that weird, textured, almost water plant look to it? It's clusters of that, but curled. And one of those whips out with this one, long, grayish, almost fleshy-looking vine that wraps around it and yanks it inside the house. (grunt) Gets yanked in. Grog, you catch him.
Travis: Cover his mouth.
Liam: Like clockwork.
Matt: Go ahead and make an athletics check, Grog.
Travis: Oh, that's a million. 26.
Matt: He struggles against your grasp, and it's nothing. It's like holding a baby in your arms.
Travis: Percy, will you give him a reminder not to move?
Taliesin: Oh, yes, this will be fun. I take out a small, three-inch steel ball. I look him right in the eye, and go, Manners. And I toss the steel ball at our friend. The iron bands.
Matt: Okay. What does he have to save on that?
Taliesin: I actually make a ranged attack roll.
Matt: Okay, make a ranged attack roll. d20 plus your dexterity. You have advantage because he's currently restrained by Grog.
Taliesin: Makes me feel better. Thank God. That's still fine. 23.
Matt: Okay, so as you chuck it the three feet, it impacts, and you watch as the orb swells and expands, and all of these chain-like plates of dark, reddish iron metal wrap around him, constraining his hands, his legs, and locking him into place around his jaw and his head and his mouth.
Taliesin: Excellent.
Laura: Can he still talk?
Travis: Yeah, when I take my hand off his mouth.
Taliesin: This thing will allow him to talk. I believe this thing has a...
Matt: It has a little slit that you can remove to the side.
Liam: It's got a gimp hole?
Matt: All good magical items do, Liam. That's what you call an artifact.
Taliesin: I give him a second to sit and I wait until we're all inside.
Matt: Okay. You guys both attacked.
Laura: Pull the bodies inside.
Matt: First make a stealth check, because you both exposed yourselves with the attack, and there are creatures overhead shrieking.
Taliesin: With advantage. He has advantage.
Liam: Plus Pass Without Trace.
Laura: 35.
Liam: 37, that's kind of low for me.
Matt: Okay. You watch as one swoops nearby, and you hear the (shrieking), and you guys dart by. Doesn't seem to take notice. You drop back into the building, and there you see your quarry now bolted to himself through a series of dark iron metal plates.
Travis: Our quarry, does he have two eyes?
Matt: He does not have both eyes. Left eye is missing. You see him now. This is a man in his mid-40s, salt and pepper hair, seems to be an unkempt beard around his chin. Hair is maybe about ear-length, a little tattered now since he's been roughed up and manhandled a bit. His skin's a bit yellowed, a little jaundiced. You get the sense he's probably been living here for quite some time, and he doesn't look healthy.
Laura: I grab the thing that was making the smoke and bring it.
Matt: The smell is awful. It's hard to differentiate from the general smell of decay and dust that this entire realm seems to be suffused with, but the smoke that billows off of this is like fresh putrescence, mixed with a very, very strong charcoal.
Taliesin: This may be how they move freely.
Laura: That's what I'm thinking. We hide the bodies. We'll bring the bodies inside, too, so that nobody sees them.
Liam: Press him.
Taliesin: I'm going to let you speak, and we're going to have a conversation. Given where you are, the circumstances that we find you in, I'm going to let you know that there is a curse upon my weapon, and the souls that are killed with this weapon are claimed by a demon named Orthax. Now, I haven't experimented as to what happens when somebody's soul is claimed by more than one creature, but I'm excited to find out. So wouldn't it be interesting if everything you've been promised here is suddenly null and void? So, yes, we may threaten your life, but I want you to know that what's really at stake here is just precisely what's left of your soul, so answer with caution. And I unlock.
Matt: Roll an intimidation check.
Travis: That was nasty, it was real good.
Taliesin: Fucking dice. No love on that one. Terrible. Eight.
Matt: You unlock, and he just goes (laughs) "I don't have to tell you anything."
Liam: I punch him in the temple.
Matt: "This pain is meager. I've felt far worse. I've given myself far worse. Pry and poke all you want."
Liam: I punch him in the mouth.
Taliesin: This sort of thing isn't going to get us anywhere. Pike. Think you can give him back his eye?
Laura: Oh, that's a good idea.
Sam: You're going to use a carrot?
Liam: No, that's the stick.
Marisha: Do you have Regenerate with you?
Ashley: I do.
Laura: Separate him from his god.
Ashley: I put my hand over his eye.
Matt: He doesn't flinch.
Laura: Do it.
Ashley: Are you ready to have your eye back?
Matt: "I'll just pluck it right back out."
Ashley: Well, you can't. Because you're just going to stay in these binds forever.
Liam: Or Grog will pull your arms off.
Matt: "Do your worst."
Laura: No, he's not scared of pain.
Travis: Just ask him some questions before the fun begins. Let's see what he answers with.
Laura: Do you know Delilah Briarwood?
Matt: "Maybe. The fact that you're already here means that you have no way out, so I fear not. Even if I perish, I die with the comfort of knowing that you'll perish soon after. That is the comfort in the Whispered One."
Laura: Vecna.
Matt: "So you knowingly came here. You are both foolish and simple."
Travis: No, that's just me.
Matt: "So you said you have questions."
Travis: What's flying around in the sky?
Matt: "The sentinels."
Travis: Sentinels.
Matt: "That is what they are for us, but they are known more formally as Gloom Stalkers."
Travis: Gloom Stalkers. That is a great name.
Matt: "They are hungry. Ever hungry."
Travis: They also look fearsome. Do people cower before them in their presence?
Matt: "You will."
Travis: I'll bet. I am easily startled.
Taliesin: Where are you from?
Matt: "It does not matter. The past means nothing when you give up your secrets."
Taliesin: The ziggurats, there's three of them. You've come through the Wildemount one?
Matt: He shakes his head. "You will get no information from me."
Sam: All right. Can I have a try? You've got one eye, right? Ugh.
Matt: You see the gaping socket, and as he goes to blink one eye, you can see the marking on the inside, it looks like it was burned out, so you watch the outer edge of the flesh and muscle twitch whenever he blinks.
Sam: Gross ocular muscles. I just want to make you feel good, man, so I'll just sing to you. I'll hold up my cone, and I'll sing, (singing) Just the two of us. You can't quit me if you tried. Just the two of us. Me and your eye. So I'll Dominate Person.
Travis: He's back.
Matt: That is... That's an 11. All right. His grin glazes over and he goes...
Sam: Will you please tell us everything you know when we ask you?
Matt: "But of course."
Sam: Where are you from?
Matt: "I am from the outskirts of a far eastern Wildemount village named Zuvan. It was built on the ruins of Orthanus. I was a poor man, but I found purpose."
Sam: Did you come through a ziggurat in Wildemount? And if so, where?
Matt: "I don't know. I was taken with many others who had given themselves to the secrets of the Undying King. I awoke here, mauled but living, and was inducted, and that was when he took my eye."
Sam: He?
Matt: "He. One of the acolytes."
Sam: The flying things. Well, we know what they are now.
Travis: What do they do?
Sam: Do the flying things have magical powers?
Matt: "I do not know. They shriek, they eat, they watch. I do not mess with such terrible and wonderful instruments."
Ashley: How does he get through all the dead?
Sam: The smoke-making thing that you were carrying. What is it and how does it work?
Matt: "It protects those of us who are not as esteemed in the arts of necromancy to not be bothered by the roving, long-dead soldiers of the last war on Thar Amphala."
Sam: The last war on Thar Amphala! What does that mean?
Laura: I don't know!
Sam: What does that mean?
Marisha: The last war on what?
Matt: Thar Amphala. Thar Amphala, the city built for the Whispered One, long ago.
Sam: Oh, that's where we are.
Laura: Who lives in the tower, Vecna? Is that where he is?
Matt: He just looks at you strangely.
Liam: It's got to come from him.
Laura: I'm a really good friend of his.
Sam: She really is, that's being rude. But who lives in the tower? Is it Vecna or Mistress Delilah?
Matt: "It's where his essence has slowly reclaimed the space. He will live soon."
Laura: Oh, but he's not back yet!
Sam: The Mistress Delilah. Where is she right now?
Matt: "I have not seen her, but if she is not out, then perhaps the ritual is soon. She is probably at the top of Entropis."
Sam: Entropis is the tower?
Matt: "Yes."
Marisha: That tower?
Sam: The only tower.
Travis: What other alarms are there in the city that would detect outsiders?
Sam: What protections do you have on the tower?
Matt: "I do not know the specifics. I am but a watcher on the outside of Thar Amphala."
Sam: You don't go in?
Matt: "I have not gone in since I gave my eye."
Sam: And what are your people called? Your group, your cult?
Matt: "We are the Remnants."
Ashley: What's his purpose?
Sam: What's your job with the Remnants?
Matt: "I am to watch the outskirts of the city. I am to escort those who would bring various things in preparation for the ritual."
Laura: What ritual? What is the ritual going to do?
Sam: What will the ritual do?
Matt: "The ritual is to restore him. To bring him, so that he can complete the main purpose. The ritual of seeding."
Sam: He's just a farmer, guys.
Liam: How does Delilah factor into it? What does she get out of it? What does she do?
Sam: I don't think he knows all of the intricacies.
Liam: I know, but he's probably promised them all something.
Sam: What has Delilah promised you? What do you gain out of this?
Matt: "When he, the Undying King, returns to this world, and we bring what we have gained, what we have brought from the other plane, that seed will be taken to the ritual of the space."
Laura: What have they brought?
Sam: Did you bring something through the portal? What was it?
Matt: "I do not understand the details, but for many months now, these siphons, they have been building the seed. They have been preparing for his return. And from there, he will complete what he started so long ago."
Laura: And that shit's happening soon?
Sam: When does the ritual begin?
Matt: "Soon. Things accelerate."
Sam: I know we look different now, but if you had to pick one of us, which is the most handsome?
Matt: "That would be you, my friend."
Sam: I thought so.
Travis: Can he take us safely to the tower?
Sam: Can you escort us to the tower? Dominate Person has got to be wearing off.
Matt: I'm checking the spell just to be sure.
Laura: We have a thing. We can at least get through town.
Sam: One minute. It's probably over.
Matt: Yeah. So by about now, after these questions have come through, his one eye blinks, and he goes, (grunt), "It matters not. He already knows you're here."
Liam: I punch him in the temple again.
Laura: He likes it. Stop giving him pleasure.
Travis: I poke him in his remaining eyeball.
Matt: Do you? Roll a strength check.
Liam: A strength check? For some Jello?
Travis: Oh God. 25.
Matt: (shriek of pain)
Taliesin: I close the mouth.
Matt: There is a smear of crimson down his face as the other eye has just been turned to paste.
Laura: Wow, we're terrible people.
Travis: Oh, what was that? It matters not? Oh, are you going to be rewarded? Yeah. How many middle fingers am I holding up?
Laura: We should put him out of his misery.
Travis: Why? I like misery.
Sam: Well, if we just release him into the city without his censer...
Liam: He's going to stumble out like a maniac. Squish the bug, Grog.
Sam: No, no. If we send him away from us, maybe one of those things will find him and we'll have a clearer path.
Travis: He's yelling. He'll make all sorts of sound.
Sam: Yeah, if we send him away from us and then we go the other way. He's a human distraction!
Taliesin: We don't need a distraction, we need quiet at this point.
Liam: And those things, we don't know if they could alert back if they saw something fishy like that.
Taliesin: I'll release him and you do your business, all right? Manners.
Matt: (mechanical clicking) It all unfolds and returns into the sphere.
Travis: Great word.
Taliesin: Thank you. It's programmable.
Travis: Should we let you back out so you can find your way back?
Matt: "Do your worst."
Travis: (crack)
Matt: With a sickening snap, you can hear as the spinal column is severed at the base of the neck, and he goes limp in Grog's grasp.
Ashley: Grab his necklace in case we need another one for some reason.
Laura: Should we grab any cloaks?
Taliesin: Grab the necklaces and the cloaks and the censer. All three of them.
Matt: Actually, he has almost nothing on him but the censer.
Marisha: No necklace?
Matt: He has-- Actually, no, he would not have one of the necklaces. Because he does not...
Marisha: Travel through?
Matt: He has a symbol, a similar symbol, but it's much smaller, more just a basic holy symbol of some kind. Same shape, but it doesn't have the same thick iron presentation as the ones that you guys encountered.
Laura: I have a holy symbol to Vecna that we took off of somebody in the original ziggurat.
Matt: Yes, and that is the same symbol.
Laura: It is, okay.
Liam: We're in an ancient city. Are there the remains of furniture in here?
Laura: I just want to take a nap or a cozy sit-down.
Liam: No, I want to shove him in a closet or wrap him up in something.
Travis: I'm putting him in the Bag of Holding as you're talking.
Taliesin: We can't keep everything.
Liam: Does anybody see any-- Never mind.
Taliesin: Is there anything of interest in this building, since we have a moment?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Liam: I'm going to investigate, too, because I was looking for furniture.
Taliesin: 15.
Liam: And I have advantage, hold on. Investigation... 22.
Matt: Okay. You do find some furniture. Most of it's very basic, tables, maybe a couple chairs, a couple of cots that are mainly wood boards with a thin cushion on it. The existence here was not to be-- It's a very plain city of worship. You can see everything was built here to gather worshipers, to gather the Remnants, or whatever they were called before, the last time that Vecna fell and the city was assaulted.
Liam: Right, so this is all worse than Fallout Three at this point.
Matt: It's on par with.
Liam: PlayStation Three graphics.
Taliesin: I say we make our way towards the spire.
Matt: So now, still under the guise of various undead, holding a wandering burning censer procured from the now-dead, eye-popped corpse of a wandering cultist, you slowly make your way deeper into the city of Thar Amphala, towards the tower of Entropis, where seemingly the cult of the Remnant are attempting to bring Vecna back to physical form for an even greater ritual thereafter. And that's where we'll finish tonight's episode. We'll return next week to pick up from there, guys.
Laura: This is amazing!
Travis: This is the best setup ever!
Matt: So happy. I know! I get to touch people's hands!
Liam: Dorks!
Matt: I know, we're such huge nerds. This feels so much like the home game, it makes me happy.
Liam: Serious deja vu.
Taliesin: All it needs is honey and brie.
Laura: We could put food out in front of us!
Matt: Next week, pajamas and mimosas. What better way to celebrate a Vecna arc in the Shadowfell?
Liam: Bring your dog to work day!
Taliesin: PJ's, mimosas, and very old puppies?
Liam: And Charlie? Can Charlie come?
Laura: I think it's necessary.
Taliesin: Charlie can run Trinket.
Matt: So guys, thank you so much. We're back next week. I want to give another big thank you to the amazing crew and people here at Legendary/Geek and Sundry that have been working almost around the clock to make this set work, to make this table work, to make the equipment work, the lighting, the audio. We've taken all of your suggestions, we've reached out to the community, to try and make this as best and as comfortable as possible for us and you guys. I know it's a work in progress, and you'll watch things improve as we go, as we learn and figure things out, so thank you for your patience. But seriously, if you get the opportunity, show some appreciation for the people who've been working really hard to try and improve this experience for everyone involved. Thank you guys, you're all so amazing. (cheers)
Matt: In the meantime, I want to tell you all, I love you very much. Happy 101st episode. And is it Thursday yet? Good night, guys! [art]
