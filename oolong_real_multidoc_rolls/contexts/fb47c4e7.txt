[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello, and welcome to this evening's episode of Critical Role! We'll be with you in just a second. Unfortunately we're down a Travis Willingham tonight, but in Grog's stead we have the rest of the party venturing forth into the Emberhold after just recently discovering Lady Kima. We shall see what happens very shortly, but in the meantime, let's go ahead and give you guys some character backstory. [dramatic music]
Ashley: Pike grew up on the outskirts of town, near the Bramblewood. Her ancestors were a family of deep gnomes with quite an unfavorable reputation. Thievery, destruction, and trickery left them with the curse of the last name Trickfoot. Sarenrae, the goddess of healing and redemption, had other plans for Pike's great-great-grandfather Wilhand, who left his family at a young age after a dream, a dream that changed the course of the Trickfoot family. Wilhand devoted his life to Sarenrae, and pledged from then on that him and his family would live a life of service and devotion. As a child, Pike seemed to have an affinity to heal. Whether it was animals, people, or even flowers, she felt she had a purpose in making things whole that had once been broken. She studied and learned the ways to heal through divine magic. She lived a peaceful life, quiet and simple, until one day Wilhand was captured and almost killed by a group of goliath barbarians. One of the goliaths took a stand against the murder of the innocent gnome, and he himself was beaten, bloodied, and left for dead, abandoned by his herd. Wilhand went to Pike for help. She prayed and healed this barbarian as best she could, bringing him back to life. When he awoke, she discovered his name was Grog Strongjaw. After that, they were the best of friends, a rather unlikely pair. Little did she know that in a few years' time Grog would soon return the favor and bring her back from the clutches of death. (roaring, crunch) After being killed in battle, Pike felt angry. She wanted to be stronger so that it would never happen again. She spent four months at sea, training with the men and women aboard a ship called the Broken Howl. Gripping her holy symbol in one hand, and her morningstar in the other, this time, Pike is ready.
Travis: Right, listen up! If you have ale, then you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw. A goliath of towering height and size, this barbarian has an appetite for the two great loves in his life: combat, women, and ale. Wait... Easily the brains of the group, Grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes, colors, and shiny things. Also ale. In his early years, armed with his two-handed great axe, Grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst the ranks of his family's wandering herd. But after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly gnome in the woods, he objected to the killing of such an innocent life. A creature of impulse, Grog felt only pity for this terrified little thing. His disobedience cost him dearly. Beaten bloody and banished by the herd leader, his uncle Kevdak, Grog was abandoned and left to die. Exiled from his herd, it was then that the relative of the very gnome he fought to save, saved him. It was the kindness of a gnome cleric named Pike that healed Grog, bringing him back from death's edge. And they have remained close friends ever since. Most nights, Grog can be found challenging entire taverns to wrestling matches! Or accompanying Scanlan to the nearest house where you pay for lady favors. Also ale.
Marisha: A first impression of Keyleth would leave you with little information on the half-elven druid. You might even think that her social awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is kind of sweet. Of course, it would be unwise to underestimate her based on first impressions. Under that unintimidating petite frame is a vicious beast waiting to be unleashed, whose natural powers have made even the fiercest of champions pee their pants. Literally. (laughs) Born to the Air tribe of the Ashari people, Keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and the elemental magics. It is her people's inherent duty to protect the delicate areas in Tal'Dorei, where the four elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm. Since she was a little girl, she had quite a knack for air manipulation and beast-shaping abilities. Well, if you consider kittens and flying squirrels to be little beasts. Which, I do. Anyways, it wasn't long before the headmaster of the tribe, her father, Korren, realized her true prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster. Just like that, her jovial childhood was stripped and replaced with endless spell memorization, teachings from ancient traditions, and exceedingly high expectations. Every druid leader to be must embark on a journey to seek out the sister tribes in order to introduce and establish respect amongst the fellow headmasters. They call this the Aramente, or Noble Odyssey. When her father felt she was ready, he set her on the path to truly discovering herself, not knowing when, or if she will ever return. As she hiked down the mountain towards Stillben, she meditated on the task ahead. Part of the Aramente is proving yourself a strong warrior, a valiant protector, and a wise and compassionate leader. With this knowledge, one thought plays in repeat in her mind: is she even worthy?
Taliesin: Percy was the third of seven children, born to a noble family who lived far to the north, in the ancient castle of Whitestone. With so many siblings to share the burdens of lordship, Percy turned his attentions to the sciences, engineering and naturalism. One day, a mysterious couple, named Lord and Lady Briarwood, came to court. During a feast held in their honor, the Briarwoods violently took control of the castle, killing or imprisoning everyone who would stand in their way. Percy awoke chained in the dungeon, only to be freed by his younger sister. Together they fled, chased by the Briarwoods' men. As they ran, Percy's sister took several arrows to the chest and fell. Percy kept running, eventually jumping into a freezing river and floating unconscious to freedom. He did not remember waking up on a fishing boat. He barely remembered the next two years, as he slowly made his way as far south as possible. Then, one night, Percy had a dream. A roaring cloud of smoke offered him vengeance against those who destroyed his family. When he awoke, Percy began to design his first gun. (gunshot)
Sam: Oh, you haven't heard of Scanlan Shorthalt? Well, gird your loins, ladies, because he has his eye on you. A talented musician, master of disguise, and dashingly handsome in his own mind, Scanlan sings songs almost as much as he sings his own praises. Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used his endless charm and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and support his single mother. One day he was discovered by a half-orc promoter, and joined Dr. Dranzel's Spectacular Traveling Troupe where he learned the ways of the world, and honed his skills as a bard extraordinaire. A loner much of his life, Scanlan has never quite come to terms with the violent death of his mother at the hands of a goblin invasion. While his years on the road provided many, shall we say, educational experiences with the opposite sex, deep down Scanlan yearns for the one thing he's never known: the true love of a fellow gnome. Still, Scanlan considers himself a lover first, performer second, and fighter distant third. On the battlefield, he'll support his allies, but rarely draws blood unless it's to protect fellow gnome, Pike. Count on Scanlan for a hearty laugh, a rollicking song, and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts and makes the females swoon.
Orion: Greetings and salutations. I am Tiberius Stormwind. I hail from a town called Ty'rex, located in the heart of Draconia, born from a politically respected family. At the age of 15, I succeeded in passing the Sorcerer's Rite, showing prodigy-like control of my magic. The judges and the Draconian High Council were amazed at how powerful my spells were for how long I had been training. At 20 years old, I was the youngest appointed member of the Magic Guild in Draconian history. For the next few years, I almost went mad from the malaise of being a guild member, as it's rather boring. However, one day I happened upon a chamber, unused for quite some time. In the room were stacks of books and maps of the surrounding cities and areas around the known world. For months I would frequent the chamber, and learned of artifacts from legend. After a long period of research, I made a list of artifacts that caught my eye. I brought these findings to the high council and was told that all of the information in the chamber I had stumbled upon was either believed to be fiction, or unsolvable mysteries, and hence were lost forever. I found those answers to be unacceptable. A year later I devised a ruse and managed to convince the city council to lend support in me leaving Draconia on a mission of peace and diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms, going from town to town and making friends and allies, in and for the name of Draconia. Being a red dragonborn, I had quite the task on my hands in that respect, but it was exactly what I needed, so I could explore the world and find these artifacts, as I felt the truth was out there. Some may describe me as buffoonish, but I say poppycock to all that. I am much sharper than most give me credit for. I just don't pay attention to things sometimes. I've also been known to be rather cunning, loyal, happy-go-lucky, and well, dangerous. I can't help but show my true scales every now and then. But overall, I think I'm quite friendly for a dragonborn.
Liam: Never entirely welcome in the company of elves or men, Vax'ildan learned at a young age to skip past formality, preferring instead to invite himself in your door. Along with twin sister Vex'ahlia, Vax was born by a chance encounter between elven royalty and human peasantry. Raised by their mother in their early years, the twins were eventually sent off to their father in the elven capital of Syngorn, but their cool reception among the elves there never warmed, and their time in the capital didn't last. The siblings stole away one autumn night and set out on the open road. After a few years of wandering, they eventually decided to return to their mother, and journeyed back to the lands of their youth. But instead of finding their childhood home, they returned to a pile of rubble. Their mother was gone, their home burned to ash. Pressing the townspeople for answers, they learned of the day the dragon came. With their ties all severed, Vax'ildan and his sister set out to find their fortune together in Tal'Dorei. An outsider since birth, Vax quickly learned to solve life's challenges in his own particular way, often by sidestepping them entirely. And when his knack for circumventing adversity isn't enough, the way of blades the elves schooled him in more than makes up the difference.
Laura: Like so many half-elves, Vex'ahlia has spent most of her life suffering the cool reception of a people who don't fully accept her. Born of a human mother and an elven father who only later in life took an interest in their existence, Vex'ahlia and her twin brother Vax'ildan quickly realized the only people they could truly rely on in this world were each other. It was at the age of ten when the two were taken from their mother, and brought to live in Syngorn, the isolated elven city for which their father was an ambassador. He quietly took them in, but always kept an icy distance, and after too many years of disdainful looks, the pair decided to leave his indifference behind, and set out on their own. Vax took to the cities, stealing small trinkets and learning the ways of the thief, while Vex kept to the woods. She preferred the isolation. Always the keen observer, she learned to hunt and to track, to spy and to shoot. And through a series of fateful events, earned herself a companion in the form of a bear, her own stolen Trinket, to fight alongside her and protect her fiercely. Also, he is adorable, and gives expert massages. [dramatic music]
Matt: Hello everyone, and welcome back to the next episode of Critical Role. We unfortunately are down one Grog this evening, as I mentioned before.
All: (distressed noises)
Matt: We are missing him terribly. We'll see what terrors will transpire in his absence. However, though! We do have some fun things to announce real fast: first off, we're still giving away promo kits for every 50 subscribers we get, so we'll be having those randomly drawn from everyone in the chat room every time 50 subscribers are joined to the channel, I guess you would say. Also, every ten subscribers we're giving away Steam keys for different games, so also cool giveaways, which is kind of fun. I want to take a moment also to mention our... charity, there, that's the word I was looking for, it's been a long day. (laughter)
Matt: Our charity, 826LA, which we're putting up links in the chat room for you guys if you're able to donate. It's a fantastic program that tutors children, helps with creative writing and general literacy skills. It's a wonderful program, you can look it up at 826LA, you should Google it, find the website, it has all the information you need. It's a really great charity and we're still pushing that through our show every week, so thank you for all who have donated, and if you have the opportunity to, I highly recommend it. Also! I wanted to let you guys know we have-- Marisha wants to mention a cool sponsor tonight or at least a promotional push we're pushing.
Marisha: Yes! Yes! Friends of the show, Espionage Cosmetics, hooked us all up with some awesome nerdy manicures. We'll tweet pictures of our nails, so yes, we're all wearing awesome nails and we're going to be doing a giveaway from Espionage. Their tabletop bath bombs, which are awesome d20s--
Matt: d10s, technically.
Marisha: Oh, d10s-- No, there's a d20! There's a d10 and there's a percentile die!
Matt: No, you're right! I saw the wrong side of it, my apologies. Forget I said anything.
Marisha: So yes, and we'll probably also go ahead and throw in a Critical Role signed picture as well with this. What you have to do is tweet @EspionageMakeup, is their twitter, @EspionageMakeup and #CriticalRole, and tell them what your favorite character is from Critical Role and who your favorite nail wraps are today and then we'll pick at half-time a winner.
Matt: Indeed. So fantastic. I may have some more stuff down the road we'll be able to talk about but in the meantime, let's go ahead and get everyone caught up to speed with what has transpired recently on Critical Role. So the party, to give you a quick overview for those who have just joined us, they were given a mission to seek out a female halfling paladin named Lady Kima of Vord, who had been missing, going on a vision quest, apparently seeking some deep, dark evil that had begun to simmer and grow beneath the dwarven city of Kraghammer. The party managed to make their way to the city, delve deep within its caverns to discover an entire series of caves, and what eventually led to the Underdark itself. A subterranean landscape of terror and darkness. After a series of battles with some duergar, which are kinda ashy-skinned evil dwarven offshoot people, characters, and a few brushes with some illithids or mind flayer creatures, they managed to befriend one, or I should say, ally with one named Clarota. Who has been traveling with them, who has apparently been kicked away from his society and wishes reentry to save them from the kind of ominous presence of this unseen, barely spoken entity called K'vorn. K'varn. (laughter)
Matt: Long day. Long day. So upon traveling deep into the recesses--
Sam: Don't worry Matt, you just have to talk for three straight hours.
Matt: (laughs) I know. I know. (laughter)
Marisha: Your day is just getting started.
Matt: I know. But yes, so they have now, after a series of battles, found their way into the magma-covered, kind of obsidian jagged caverns where the Emberhold, the duergar fortress currently resides, where they believe Lady Kima was. Upon finding a way in, unfortunately announcing their presence to the fortress itself, they managed to find Lady Kima in a torture chamber beneath Emberhold, save her, slay her oppressor, and now they have, after a tenuous alliance was made-- as Lady Kima and their mind-flayer friend Clarota are very much at odds-- a very tenuous alliance was forged. And they now journey back up to the main basement floor, or main base floor of the Emberhold proper. And that's where we left off last time. So, hope you can absorb all that, guys. (laughs)
Sam: We are inside this fortress.
Matt: Correct.
Sam: We are moving towards the armory. We're trying to find the armory or something, is that right?
Matt: You're trying to find, essentially-- Lady Kima has mentioned she wants to find the rest of her equipment that she says is either in an armory, or she mentioned a vault. And also she knows-- she mentioned something about vengeance to those who run the keep. So she stormed up.
Laura: We're following her, right?
Matt: You've followed her back into the base floor of the Emberhold itself. You all currently are now back kinda where you started after you snuck into the side passage of the Emberhold.
Laura: And she said she would lead the way to the vault?
Sam: Can we be quiet for a second and see if there's any footsteps around us or guards marching around? Are we in immediate peril or do we have a second?
Matt: Certainly. Everyone go ahead and make an immediate perception roll.
Sam: Okay.
Laura: So fast!
Marisha: Website went live, if you want to announce that now or later.
Matt: Later. Two?
Laura: No, 22! (laughs)
Liam: 28.
Ashley: 13.
Taliesin: 24.
Orion: Fail.
Sam: Ten. (laughs)
Matt: That's a fail! All right, so-- You've got to be ready!
Marisha: 27!
Matt: Okay. (laughter)
Sam: I'm sure he'll give you half of that.
Matt: Nearly at the ready. All right, so as you all take a moment and kind of steel yourselves, your ears perk up and you can hear what sounds like echoes of distant footsteps down hallways, far out of sight. You hear some movement across the stone ceiling above you that eventually comes to a stop. And you wait for about a minute, and the entire place is now in a very eerie silence.
Liam: They know we're here, still.
Laura: But they don't know where we are.
Liam: No.
Orion: Maybe they went to sleep?
Taliesin: Lady Kima, do you remember where the vault is? Do you remember how we can get back there?
Matt: Kima turns to you, her eyes still peering back, and she's creeping towards the edge of the hallway. She looks back at you, briefly, and says, "I've only seen half of this stronghold before they captured me. As far as I know, probably somewhere on the second floor."
Laura: What floor are we on now?
Matt: "The ground floor."
Liam: The ground floor.
Laura: Right, cool.
Ashley: So it's just one up? (laughter)
Matt: "Apparently."
Liam: Were there stairs-- When we went down that set of stairs there, was there also stairs going up right there, or stairs going up?
Matt: There were stairs-- Right there? No. There were stairs going up in the first room you entered.
Laura: Oh, right! So we could go back in the little storage room.
Liam: We could.
Laura: And go up.
Liam: We should just spend the next three hours in the storage room.
Laura: Let's go in the storage room and go up.
Liam: Lady Kima, allow me to take a peek around the corner, see what's going on. So I'm gonna go stealth.
Matt: Okay, go ahead and roll stealth.
Liam: And inch past her. That's good. 29.
Matt: 29? All right. She begrudgingly steps back. You can see there's that eagerness to get in some sort of a fray or to feel somebody else bash along the side of this greatsword that she borrowed from you guys. She lets you pass. You creep up along the edge. As you do, you see-- back here there is, in the middle of this hallway, a series of doorways, and what looks to be a large room in the center of the chamber where two duergar currently stand.
Liam: I turn back to the group.
Taliesin: (whispers) How about the other way?
Sam: Why don't we just kill them?
Liam: Isn't that a corner-- a dead-on corner right there?
Matt: This is another hallway.
Liam: Another hallway.
Sam: Let's go kill the duergar.
Laura: How dark is it in here? Is it like--
Matt: No. It's pretty dark in here. Like, with low light vision, you're able to see maybe a good 30 to 40 feet ahead of you. There are a few of those red crystal clusters that give off a little bit of light, incrementally, but duergar themselves, you've gotten to the point where you see they like it very, very dark. They actually aren't needing light. This is more of a courtesy to guests they may have.
Laura: So potentially, brother, we could take them both out if you throw your knife and I do an arrow.
Orion: Wait, didn't we see further past that, 'cause that's where Grog did the-- (crushing noise)
Sam: No, this is the area that we haven't been in yet.
Liam: I just put up a hand, and then slip around this direction and slip down this second hallway that you revealed.
Matt: All right. As you step past, you do see, this room here is a little ajar; the inside looks to be a storage room. There's just a series of boxes, barrels, and various--
Laura: (gasps) Maybe you can put yourself in a box and walk around.
Marisha: (gasps) Yes! Metal Gear Solid it!
Liam: I continue to creep away from my sister, specifically.
Matt: All right, you glare down the side of this hallway. It leads to two other smaller rooms down the way, with a split towards the back end. There does not appear to be anybody visible in that hall.
Liam: All right, I got this, I'm going to keep going.
Sam: Wait, what about us!?
Laura: Why are you doing this?
Matt: All right, so you go past this way.
Sam: Jesus. Two duergar, we can take them out in a second!
Matt: Now this hallway, there appears to be an opening to this room, no doorway.
Laura: Everybody wait while my brother goes on a field trip.
Matt: And this additional room, you do not currently see an entrance.
Liam: An opening that's not a doorway? Or--
Matt: I mean, there isn't a door in the way, it's just an opening.
Liam: The door is open. All right, so I'm going to press against the wall, up to the edge, wait for five seconds, see if I can hear anything, and then if not, curve around and peek in.
Matt: Perception roll.
Liam: 20.
Matt: 20. You take a moment and listen. You hear what sounds like a light crackling of some sort of a fire? And the occasional dull ring of metal being hit against metal.
Sam: What was it? Metal against metal?
Liam: Okay, I'm going to get low to the ground, and peek in the door.
Matt: All right. Peeking through, you do see, indeed, it is some sort of a smithy, with two kilns, or two anvils, set up, a work table in the center, and there is one lone duergar that, apparently, in the middle of his work, has not been paying attention to any of the ruckus going on around, and is just in the middle of hitting some sort of long, thick piece of black iron, and it's just, (ting ting), sweat dripping down the front of his brow, the room itself is-- even against the corner of the doorway, you can tell the temperature is a lot warmer on the inside.
Liam: And his back is to me, currently?
Matt: It's kinda to the side to you. He's currently looking-- working out the anvil, banging down.
Liam: So this way?
Matt: Yes.
Liam: Oh, but I see the door on the other side, so I take the earring--
Sam: Oh, why don't you just keep going forever?
Liam: -- take the earring and I whisper to my sister, (whispers) follow along.
Laura: Oh. I've been invited on the field trip, guys!
Sam: Just you?
Laura: Just me!
Sam: Come on!
Laura: Who else can stealth?
Marisha: I'm a stealthy panther right now.
Laura: Do you wanna be something and pop in my pocket? (laughs) That sounded wrong.
Matt: You haven't had a short rest yet, and you do--
Marisha: (clears throat) I was gonna say, I'm still a cat form. But I can accompany you.
Laura: I should not go with you, I can't stealth for shit right now. (laughter)
Laura: I rolled a seven.
Liam: (whispers) Send Scanlan up.
Laura: (whispers) Scanlan.
Sam: Huh, what?
Laura: My brother's calling for you.
Matt: You feel the oppressive force of Clarota's voice in your heads simultaneously say, "I can also accompany."
Ashley: Good plan. Good plan, Clarota.
Sam: All right. I'll step ahead and go invisible.
Matt: All right, so mark off your next Invisibility spell. As you vanish, Clarota also kind of waves his hand for a moment, and his image disappears the same way Scanlan's did.
Sam: Ooh! He does that too?
Matt: Apparently.
Laura: What did he do?
Sam: He went invisible! (sings) We're walking down a hall, nobody's watching us. (laughter)
Matt: As you're humming to yourself--
Sam: Oh no!
Matt: You make your way down and eventually towards the back of where Vax is pressed against the--
Liam: I can feel Scanlan's flute pressing into my buttocks.
Sam: That's not my flute! (laughter)
Liam: So I turn to them, and then I start-- I pass the door.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: I'm gonna go around the corner to that other door.
Matt: All right.
Liam: And now I'm going to stab the duergar in the neck.
Matt: All right! Go ahead and roll for an attack!
Liam: Natural 20, natural 20! (cheering)
Matt: That's how you start the game.
Marisha: It's a good day! I feel like it's gonna be a good day.
Matt: All righty. So go ahead and roll damage. This is a sneak attack, as he didn't-- it was not aware you were there.
Liam: I'll use my keen dagger, I think. Four plus seven is-- This is a pencil, right? Okay, 11. Where-- how do you make it work? 11.
Matt: All right.
Liam: Eight, 13--
Sam: Get him in the neck so he can't yell.
Liam: Ooh. 66.
Matt: You don't multiply the modifier. The modifier goes on at the end. So it's the dice roll plus your sneak attack, multiplied by two, and then the dex modifier at the end.
Marisha: That's a lot!
Liam: Okay.
Matt: Plus seven, I think, right at the end.
Liam: Yeah, that's right. So it's the damage plus the sneak attack, double that--
Matt: And then add the plus seven at the end.
Laura: That's 28 times two plus seven.
Liam: 26.
Matt: Splitting hairs here! That's enough. So.
Liam: One plus two plus two plus one.
Matt: So you hear this, 'Tink! Tink! Tink!' (pause) That's it. Without even a guttural noise, the dagger buries itself in the base of his skull. You see him just (grunts) and slump down to the ground.
Liam: I catch the hammer and I start going 'Tink! Tink! Tink!' And wave the two invisible beings into the room.
Ashley: Hey! What happened in there?
Sam: We're here! We're ready to fight. What do you need us to do?
Matt: Kima at this point-- You can see her hand kind of tensing around the sword as she looks back at Grog, whose hands are also wringing his greataxe. "I want to kill something!" She kind of backs off to the side and sees the other duergar that are there.
Ashley: (Grog voice) I want to rage!
Matt: And she's going to go ahead and run around.
Liam: Don't waste my natural 20, Kima. Come on!
Laura: Man, you can't control Kima!
Marisha: This is why we don't have AI in the party, guys. You can't control the AI.
Matt: You know you guys are telling a very, very angry woman right now to be patient. Doesn't seem to make a ruckus.
Laura: Can I sneak up to the corner at least, so I can be ready to attack those two bastards?
Matt: Over to here? All righty. Trinket, who hasn't seen you in a while, is sticking to your back.
Laura: I sit there and I kind of pet him as I look around the corner.
Matt: Okay. Trinket is enjoying the petting. All right, so that duergar's down, the current armory section appears to be completely open and at your disposal. There are a series of partially made weapons kind of scattered in a pile. There are some ingots, and even some raw iron material in the far corner. Other than that, it just looks like your general smithing workshop.
Sam: Is Kima with us now?
Matt: Kima is currently looking around this section with you guys.
Sam: Kima, do you see any of your equipment here that you wanted?
Matt: She glances around, goes and move some of the piles by, turning over the room as quietly as she can-- not as quietly as you'd like-- but quiet enough. "No. Nothing's here."
Sam: Can't you just take one of these things and call it a day? (laughter)
Matt: She glares in the direction of your voice.
Sam: I'm invisible, I--
Matt: "This will do me just fine for now!"
Sam: Oh!
Matt: "Right. Let's keep looking." She leaves the room. She starts heading down this way--
Liam: All right, I'm following after her, tiptoeing after her.
Laura: We should go after her. 'Cause we're all gonna split up.
Liam: Yeah, I speak into my earring and say zubba zubba zubba zubba.
Laura: Let's all go in that back way and see if we can stealth around.
Matt: Okay. For everyone else, stealth check.
Taliesin: Oh boy.
Ashley: Here we go!
Orion: Yes! Natural 20!
Matt: Disadvantage on you, Pike, because of your heavy armor.
Ashley: So that means I roll twice?
Matt: Roll twice, take the lower.
Ashley: I take the lower one.
Orion: Now as that happens, I want to cast Mage Hand and I want to cast Light on it, and I want to slowly have it drift down there.
Matt: They're both concentration spells. You can have one or the other.
Orion: Dagnabbit.
Matt: Mage Hand isn't an actual object, unfortunately.
Orion: Dagnabbit. Okay, fine. Instead I cast Prestidigitation and I make a little glowy orb, and it's a little flickery, and I cast-- I think I can maybe try, what, 15 feet?
Matt: Okay. And where are you casting it? Just in the middle of this hallway here?
Orion: No. To my left.
Matt: Here?
Sam: He wants to see in the dark place.
Orion: I wanna see in the dark place.
Matt: There is no entrance to this room currently from what you can see. It's just a wall. There is a door on the opposite side.
Sam: Now it's a well-lit wall.
Orion: Hm. All right, well, I follow after the bear. (laughter)
Matt: All right, so what was your stealth roll?
Laura: Oh, it was 17.
Matt: 17. Roll for Trinket.
Laura: Oh gosh.
Sam: (bear noises)
Laura: I thought he just got what I got. Crap.
Sam: Not good.
Laura: What do I add to it?
Sam: Nothing.
Matt: Add his dex modifier. Trinket's dex modifier.
Laura: Okay, hold on. Hold on. Oh, good.
Liam: 11.
Laura: 11.
Matt: All right, as you guys are making your way down the hallway, slowly--
Laura: I kinda clamp my hand over his mouth and tell him to shush.
Matt: You guys make your way down here. One of the duergar glances over--
Sam: Oh boy.
Matt: -- utters something to the friend at his side and he goes--
Liam: I heard the bear and I start sliding my back down along the wall.
Laura: Oh crap. I turn around and notch my arrow for them.
Matt: Okay, Trinket moves past
Taliesin: I walk up to the very, very edge of the hallway.
Liam: And I'm stabbing! Stabbing, stabbing! Stabbing.
Orion: Matthew, behind the bear.
Matt: You move behind the bear?
Orion: Yes.
Matt: You are right there and they both see you
Orion: No, no, the other bear. I mean, the other side of the bear.
Matt: As you're walking behind Trinket, all this transpires simultaneously. Right. And they saw the bear and then saw something move behind it. Their attention was got. They see you and they start walking towards--
Liam: Stabbing duergars, stabbing duergars.
Matt: However, as they pass there, you get one shot at this guy as he passes past you. Go ahead and make your attack.
Orion: I wave at them.
Matt: Okay. (laughs) Tiberius waves at them.
Marisha: I go ahead and move up next to Percy.
Orion: Hello. I don't think they're our friends.
Matt: Unfortunately, the space is a little limited for your size. You have to wait for the rest of them to let you by.
Marisha: Oh, but Grog's behind me. He's not here, right? Where's Grog?
Matt: You're a big cat right now.
Marisha: I'm a big kitty.
Liam: I rolled a 15.
Matt: 15? 15 does barely hit.
Liam: Okay, so same keen dagger.
Matt: As you go ahead, move around the corner and fire. Two arrows?
Laura: 17.
Matt: All right. Second one? Same guy or different targets?
Laura: Same target. He's right in front. That one hits too, that's 19.
Matt: Both hit, go ahead and roll damage on both.
Liam: 32 for me.
Matt: Okay. So as you watch them both walk past you, one of them continues past with his hammer out, rushing towards whatever he sees moving at the end of the hallway, probably Tiberius after Trinket. The next one that comes past you, you reach around and just take your dagger and swing it across the back of his neck area. You manage to sever the base of the spine and he just crumples into a pile in front of you. The other one-- Damage?
Laura: 22 with the two arrows. Nine and 13.
Matt: Both arrows impact his chest. The duergar steps back for a second, surprised by the moment, looks really furious and begins to step forward, his size enlarging.
Taliesin: I knock him right in the face with the butt of my gun as he rounds the corner.
Matt: All right. Go ahead and make a stealth check to see whether or not he sees you.
Taliesin: I can't use my previous stealth roll?
Matt: Not for this point. This is an active combat.
Taliesin: Damn it. Eight.
Matt: Okay. So you still get the attack, but you don't have advantage, 'cause he's aware you're there. As he's running past you, he glances and sees you in the corner of his eye and is preparing for the blows. Go ahead and roll your attack.
Taliesin: What do I add to this, by the way? I've never done a physical attack.
Matt: You're hitting it with the blunt. Go ahead and roll a d20 and add your strength modifier and four.
Taliesin: All right. Natural 20! (cheering)
Marisha: Look, it's flashing!
Taliesin: It flashes if I hit a natural 20.
Matt: All right, so go ahead and roll damage. It is a 1d4 plus your strength modifier.
Taliesin: So that would be 2d4 plus my strength modifier, because it's a natural 20.
Matt: Correct, yes.
Taliesin: That's six points of damage.
Matt: Well, it's five on there, right?
Taliesin: My strength modifier is one.
Matt: Okay, so that's five times two is ten plus one. 11 points of damage.
Taliesin: 11 points of damage.
Matt: Which will do it. As the duergar sees you, is rushing past with his hammer, about to fall back and swing at you, you rush out from behind the corner with the blunt end of your weapon and just whack him in the side of the temple.
Sam: Girly scream.
Orion: What was that?
Taliesin: (whispers) We're good, we're good.
Matt: Unconscious on the ground. Alive but unconscious.
Ashley: He's not dead? Can I-- so he's at a disadvantage, basically?
Matt: He's incapacitated.
Ashley: So can I go up to him and slit his throat with my mace of disruption? To make sure he's dead?
Matt: If you'd like to?
Ashley: Yes, I want to.
Matt: Okay.
Ashley: Is that really bad, though?
Matt: Pike walks up and grabs the back of the duergar's hair, holds it back and using the jagged edge of her mace of disruption, tears open the throat of the duergar, which then spills all this blackish ichor across the ground.
Liam: She went renegade, folks. She's gone renegade.
Ashley: I just wanted to make sure he didn't come after us.
Matt: Grog looks impressed but also slightly worried as the man who grew up alongside you. All right, so that happened.
Liam: And then she says, okay, I'm gonna dismember the body. Hold on. (laughter)
Laura: Torture weapons.
Sam: Because I'm invisible in the thing with Lady Kima, I get up on a stool to see if I can catch some cleavage. (laughter)
Sam: Just peek over, peek in.
Matt: The leather armor that she wore is a full torso-covering leather armor piece, I apologize.
Sam: (sighs) I give up.
Matt: Sorry, Scanlan. She is-- Yeah, which by the way, I mean, it's not just so much the fact that Pike did it, it's the fact that Pike did it by running a jagged, blade-edged mace across someone's throat. It was less of a slice and more of a--
Ashley: Is Sarenrae gonna get really mad at me?
Matt: We'll see.
Ashley: They're really bad! If they're really bad guys, they were super bad. The duergar are so bad. She'd probably be happy--
Orion: Right, Pike, but man, that was rough.
Matt: We'll find out.
Taliesin: He had a little duergar back at home.
Matt: So, given this case, now the rest of the party is able to move forward. This hallway now, you can only see about that far down with the current light source. You can see Kima is now moving across--
Sam: Aw, she's just going?
Laura: Go listen-- aw, she's still going that direction?
Liam: All right. I'm tiptoe-jogging behind Kima.
Marisha: Can we do something to slow her down?
Sam: I can stop her if you want?
Marisha: Well, I mean, can we-- I mean, we don't wanna stop her I just wanna be like, hey, slow, girl.
Laura: She's-- you know what? I bet she's pretty noisy too!
Matt: She's wearing leather armor, she's not very noisy right now.
Liam: I carefully place a hand on Kima's shoulder, and do a little, sort of, curtsy motion. Allow me, I can--
Matt: Okay, as you do so she kinda stops and looks back over her shoulder and gives a begrudging nod. But you can see she's-- there's shaking, her hand holding the greatsword is currently shaking with rage.
Liam: I say-- (silent) Two words, three syllables. (laughter)
Matt: All right, so. Coasting down this hallway. It leads down to an open doorway and a closed doorway immediately to your right. And then the room to-- actually, the doorway's to your left, and to the right you see another wall to another room that you don't have a doorway currently available.
Liam: There's a door to my left and a door straight ahead, right?
Matt: Correct.
Liam: Okay, I inch up to the closed door on the left and place my ear to the door and listen.
Matt: Okay, go ahead and make a perception check.
Liam: Yeah, natural 20.
Marisha: What?!
Ashley: Come on!
Sam: Yeah. It's gonna be one of those nights.
Laura: I need that one! Oh my goodness.
Taliesin: Don't. Jinx it.
Matt: I'm gon' kill all you.
Laura: No! (laughter)
Matt: You put your ear to the side, and you hear nothing.
Liam: Okay. Do I sense any kind of-- I'm checking for traps on the door.
Matt: Okay. Yup.
Liam: Trap's perception, right? 26.
Matt: So the door itself does not appear to be trapped. It does appear to be locked, though.
Liam: All right, well, I pull out my picks. And I get a three on that, so--
Matt: That's okay. It's a really, really, really crappy lock.
Laura: Oh!
Matt: You notice that the door itself, it has a locking mechanism on it. It was kinda half-locked, and as you push, it opens up, into a commode.
Liam: Aw, yes!
Matt: There's nobody in there. It is a room with what looks almost like a bench, with a series of holes cut into the bench. It's a communal--
Liam: Well, I'm tempted to close the door for a moment, but I will press on instead.
Sam: Check for loot! (laughter)
Laura: Gross!
Liam: All right, so I'm going to inch towards that open door ahead of me, see what's around the corner.
Sam: I'm gonna follow-- I'm gonna inch up behind him as well. I'm still invisible, right? How long does that last?
Matt: Okay. It's concentration for quite some time, I believe.
Marisha: Actually--
Taliesin: Really quickly-- Oh, do you want to go first?
Marisha: No, you go.
Taliesin: Does anyone want to hide these bodies that we've just scattered about--
Laura: Yeah, that would be good!
Marisha: Inside the loo.
Taliesin: It's a perfect place for them to be interred.
Liam: So, Pike, hold still, please.
Ashley: I'm not moving!
Sam: Pike, eviscerate the bodies!
Marisha: Here, I'm gonna-- I'll walk over, in tiger form, and I just grab one by the scruff and start dragging it.
Matt: Grog helps out. You guys move the two bodies slowly over into the restroom area.
Marisha: Wait, we kinda prop them up to kinda like Weekend at Bernie's them, yeah, make them just look like they're, you know, passed out.
Matt: Okay, as they're both generally laying back, like they just got really drunk and barely found their way to the toilet.
Sam: And throats slit. (laughter)
Matt: It's really rough blockage.
Marisha: We take that one and kind of like lean him forward so you can't tell immediately.
Matt: Okay. All right, that's not a worry. You bring that up to that little area there. All right.
Liam: Well done, there.
Taliesin: Oh, thank you.
Matt: You guys move forward to that. Grog has come over here to be able to help. Now, looking down this hallway, here you can see--
Sam: Who we got, who we got?
Matt: This side opens up--
Laura: All I want to do is find the damn treasure room.
Matt: Looking into this room, it appears to be a barracks. A room that is just filled with different beds, all apparently empty.
Laura: Oh, they're up and looking for us.
Marisha: Apparently empty?
Matt: From what you can see.
Marisha: Can I use my keen smell to see if I smell any duergar in there?
Matt: Sure. So you slowly approach the door using your keen senses, which opens up this hallway a little bit visibly to you. You can see it goes back quite a bit. Sniffing this room, you can tell that there were duergar there recently. Apparently, at the moment, though, there is no immediate scent that matches a duergar. So the room, for the most part, has been completely evacuated.
Marisha: Okay, I kinda-- even though I'm not a dog, I'm a cat, I still kinda point. I go into pointer face. You know? Like--
Orion: Pointer face?
Marisha: You know, like a pointer.
Liam: Yeah, angling your nose forward, all right.
Sam: I think Keyleth has to pee. (laughter)
Sam: I never had a cat.
Liam: All right, I'm gonna start sliding down that hall there, ignoring this other passage, and get up to the door and again place my ear to it. Oh look, there's the front entrance.
Matt: As you look to your right, this is a large foyer-type area with two red carpets that are rolled on the sides of it that lead to the front of the main double-sided, large ten-foot-tall stone doors of the front of the fortress. To your left, there is a double wooden door, about eight feet tall each side, about five feet wide, that are currently closed, leading into whatever this large chamber is immediately to your left.
Sam: Can I hang a right and go down that other hall?
Taliesin: We should check out what's in that other hall.
Sam: Is there a door over there?
Matt: There are two doors, actually.
Sam: Closed?
Matt: Both closed.
Sam: I'm going to listen into those doors.
Matt: Make a perception check.
Sam: Natural 17. (cheering)
Marisha: Gotta love that nat 17.
Matt: Listening in, you don't hear any noise.
Sam: That could mean nothing.
Liam: Are you at the double doors with me?
Sam: I'm to the right. I went the other way.
Liam: Okay. I'm going to listen at the big wooden doors, and I rolled, oh, not that great. 17.
Matt: All right. Listening in--
Orion: I scootch up ahead of Grog like, excuse me, excuse me.
Matt: As you listen back, there is no noise internally, except for the slight squeak as you put yourself against the door. It shifts a little bit, making no noticeable noise, but it appears the doors are unlocked, or there is no lock.
Laura: Oh no.
Matt: You're not hearing anything from inside that one door you're at.
Sam: Wait, I just heard a noise?
Matt: No, you hear no noise coming from that room.
Sam: Oh, okay. Stinking Cloud, can I go through doors, or do I have to see what I'm casting it at?
Matt: You have to have sight, unfortunately. I mean, you could peek very low.
Sam: I'm going to open the door and look.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: 'Cause why not?
Matt: You open the door. It appears to be some sort of a guest bedroom. It's a singular bed that's in much better condition than the barracks, it's empty, it's well-made. It's more lit than the other rooms. It seems to be a room that's designed for either non-duergar riff-raff or general soldiers or guests or people that would come to the fortress to stay, so.
Sam: Okay.
Liam: I'm going to try to peer into the door, and I haven't talked about this before, but I'm wearing a cloak of elvenkind, which means I have advantage on stealth, and enemies have disadvantage on spotting me, so I'm going to lean my head in.
Matt: All right.
Liam: Do I need to roll for stealth or am I already stealthed?
Matt: For this, you're already stealthed. So as you glance inside the room, you see what appears to be a great hall of some kind. There are large wooden tables, there is a fire pit in the center that has a number of mostly burned wood that is mainly just small darkened embers with a little bit of glowing yellow and red to it. There are stools scattered about the room, you can see there are remnants of some of a meal that hasn't been fully cleaned up yet on some of the tables. But the room appears to be empty. You do see a slight glimmer across the way on one of the tables.
Liam: Oh, I'm going to go check it out.
Laura: (whispers) Get the sparkly thing.
Matt: All right. Everyone else, what are you doing?
Sam: Can I look around the guest bedroom? Just kinda snoop around up in things?
Laura: Can I ask him, I'm asking you what you see in there. What do you see in there?
Liam: I don't know yet, hold on
Laura: Is it sparkly?
Liam: I'm going to try to sense for traps in this room.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: I'm going to snoop in the barracks.
Matt: Snoop in the barracks.
Liam: 14.
Orion: I'm going to make my way around all this riff-raff, uh, no, uh, yes.
Matt: You push your way through. "Excuse me, excuse me, pardon me." Pushing through everybody.
Orion: I'm going to go past where Vax is in the room down that hallway, then I'm going to do my Mage Hand thingy again. Oh, my Prestidigitation.
Matt: Down this hallway?
Orion: Mm-hm.
Matt: Okay.
Orion: Slowly, five feet by five feet.
Matt: All right. You see slowly, as you move down this hallway to check it out, a secondary set of barracks that are also apparently empty.
Laura: Where are they? The stairs are up in the storage room, man. That's where we just were.
Matt: You see a secondary commode that is open. And as you glance around the corner as the light passes by you see there are two duergar currently coming down the hallway this direction.
Marisha: Oh shit!
Orion: I just stop! And I creep back.
Matt: Okay. As you creep back, you hear footsteps coming your way quickly.
Liam: I'm going to the door, then, I can hear that. Inside the door, inside the door.
Matt: Oh, inside the door there?
Marisha: I'm going to stay actually right there, just right at the threshold.
Matt: Okay. The rest of you guys?
Laura: I mean, I'm so far away. I can try to get up there but--
Matt: You can glance, there's still a hallway around that way if you wanted to go around.
Laura: Okay. I'll go around the back way then.
Matt: Okay, so you move around--
Laura: With Trinket!
Matt: Trinket follows up behind. Makes your way up there. Scanlan, you staying in that room?
Sam: I'm taking a dump on the guest bed. (laughter)
Orion: They don't see me, right?
Laura: I like walk by the door and see that happening (laughter)
Sam: But also just covering it up with a blanket afterwards.
Matt: Okay, well, you're in mid-process, this is all happening very quickly.
Sam: Oh. (grunts)
Ashley: I'll go around back behind where Trinket and Vex just went.
Matt: Okay. Because of your little legs you get about that far. Your little legs carry you.
Sam: I'm invisible. It's poop. (laughter)
Matt: (sighs) (grunting and laughter)
Marisha: It's apparating poo.
Taliesin: I'm staying in the hallway,
Sam: Scanlan's just like, I hate this mission.
Matt: Okay, so. Tiberius, as you're backing up, both the duergar turn around immediately, seeing you, and rear back with javelins, throwing them directly at you.
Orion: Oh! I'll cast Blur instead.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and roll initiative real fast to see who gets off first what.
Orion: I'm not going to count that. Oh, I'll count that. 19. (laughter)
Matt: What, why didn't you count it?
Orion: Because it flew out of my hand, I didn't roll it.
Matt: Okay. All right.
Orion: Yeah. (laughter)
Orion: It's on camera, tell them to play back.
Matt: So you go ahead and cast Blur. You guys see as Tiberius comes running back, (startled sounds). He manages to cast a spell really fast as two javelins come flying towards him. His visible image begins to actually blur; the outline looks almost like there's two mirror images of Tiberius in the same place that are both shimmering and preventing them from actually telling where he's actually standing. The first javelin comes in at a 14.
Orion: Nope.
Matt: Second one comes in at a 17.
Orion: 17. Yes.
Matt: Oh sorry, no, it's a four, 'cause it has disadvantage. So both javelins just whish past. Looks like they pierced part of that kinda shimmering blurring form, but both just ricochet off the walls of stone and come clattering to the ground. Kinda near back where Kima and Grog are. They both step out of the way as they land.
Marisha: Ha-ha.
Matt: All right, so that brings us to-- that was your action. Who else wants to take the next action?
Liam: I'm gonna hold.
Laura: I can't see anything, can I, from where I am?
Matt: It's kinda dark, and you can see movement in the distance.
Laura: Can I hop on Trinket's back and see if I can see higher?
Matt: You can try. All right. So you hop on the back of Trinket, (laughs) looking over the top, and you know Grog is kinda blocking part of your view, but you can see, with your low-light vision, what looks to be Tiberius' form shimmering and two duergar-height individuals that are partially blocked by him. So they do have partial cover, or three-quarters cover. Do you have the feat that ignores that?
Laura: I don't know? I don't know.
Matt: (laughs) Because you don't know I'm going to say no.
Taliesin: It would be called Sharpshooter.
Matt: Yeah it would be called Sharpshooter, is the feat.
Laura: No, I don't have that.
Matt: Okay, yeah. So go ahead and roll for attack on one or both duergar, up to you.
Laura: 21.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: And 23.
Matt: Okay. The 21 misses, the 23 hits. Because they have cover and because it's so dark it's difficult to make out their form, but you do manage to hit one with the arrow.
Laura: Okay. I Hunter's Mark him.
Matt: Okay. Next time, make sure you do that before you attack. Otherwise it won't count for the attack.
Laura: Okay. Okay. 13, uh, 12! (laughs) Math! Stay in school.
Matt: (laughs) All right. There you go. 12, then add your Hunter's Mark bonus to that as well.
Laura: Oh, good, one.
Matt: All right, gotcha. So one arrow sinks in the shoulder, but doesn't appear to be stopping his angry advance towards Tiberius. Let's see. You're staying where you are?
Liam: Waiting.
Matt: All right. You guys are actually kind of like pinched off in the hallway right here, so as you guys are all kind of--
Sam: (strained) Don't say 'pinched off' to me. (laughter)
Matt: -- as you're doing this, Tiberius, you're right there. The two duergar catch up to you and both, now that their javelins are out of their hands, pull out their hammers with their bonus actions and come down at you with an attack each.
Marisha: Run, Tiberius!
Matt: That's gonna be a six.
Orion: No.
Matt: And a 17.
Orion: 17 hits.
Matt: Okay, yeah, that Blur is saving you, man. All right, so as the one-- both the duergar are kinda like swelling with frustration, anger. It's an ability, you've now gotten to the point where you can see, these duergar can actually temporarily increase their form for stronger blows and attacks. Comes and strikes you for 12 points of bludgeoning damage as the hammer comes cracking down, finding purchase on your torso, and it kinda pushes you back a few inches. That's gonna bruise tomorrow morning.
Marisha: Can I do a combo move with Grog, assuming that he would agree with me that it's gonna be super cool?
Matt: He'd probably agree with you, what do you wanna do?
Marisha: Okay. (laughs) Thanks, Grog! So since Grog's kind of there-- Can we arrange like a fastball special, almost? So have him like kind of go up and crouch and I'm gonna bust out--
Matt: How are you going to communicate this to Grog?
Marisha: He-- with--
Liam: (meows) (laughter)
Matt: I'm gonna have to say, unfortunately, that's not gonna work out for this moment. Grog's attention is on the duergar and you are a giant cat.
Liam: Hey, I'm gonna sneak behind Tiberius and stab that guy.
Laura: It would've been so cool, though.
Ashley: That would've been really cool.
Liam: And since Tiberius is there, I can get sneak attack damage, 'cause one of my allies is there--
Matt: All right, just a second there, you're still holding, let's finish Keyleth. So Keyleth, what are you doing?
Marisha: Well, is Grog in my way?
Matt: Grog is there. You can attempt to leap over Grog.
Marisha: I was wanting to vault off Grog's back, is what I was wanting to do.
Matt: You can do that without asking him.
Marisha: Yeah, that's what I was going to do.
Matt: No, you were saying you wanted to tell Grog you were going to do that. But yes, you can still do it. So go ahead and roll an acrobatics check.
Marisha: No, you asked how I was communicating it.
Laura: Just do it, Keyleth!
Marisha: So I'm gonna come out and I'm gonna vault off his back and try and do a pounce over top of Tiberius for that duergar that's closest to you. What am I rolling?
Taliesin: Acrobatics.
Marisha: Acrobatics? Is this an acrobatics thing?
Matt: Yes. From around the corner, you pull back, leap up, jump onto Grog's back and attempt to spring off of it.
Marisha: 11.
Matt: 11, okay. (laughs) All right. So you jump off of Grog's back. Grog, not expecting it, instinctively ducks down and the force you push off, as he's not aware there's going to be a giant cat there--
Marisha: Uh-huh.
Matt: -- in doing so, it doesn't give you the momentum you need. You are able to jump over him and get kind of into center of the fray. But you do not have the pounce attack, unfortunately.
Marisha: Okay. That's fine.
Matt: But it gets you there, at least.
Marisha: Oh, can I not attack?
Matt: You can attack, yeah.
Marisha: Okay, okay, okay. I'm gonna go ahead and do my bite attack.
Matt: Go for it.
Marisha: I'm gonna go right for his throat. Still with the same intention that I had in mind.
Matt: Okay, this is the one that took the arrow from Laura.
Marisha: Okay, 17.
Matt: 17? That hits. Go ahead and roll for damage.
Marisha: 1d10 plus five. Where's my d10s? Ten damage. Piercing damage.
Matt: Ten piercing damage, all right. So, as you rush forward, you bite at him. You see he pulls back, but you get a big, meaty chunk of his forearm and clamp down, and you feel a snap, some sort of bone in the middle of his arm and he gives out a horrible-- (yells) sound, as he takes the butt of his hammer and hits you on the snout. Doesn't do any damage, but it's enough to get you to kind of let go of your grip a little bit, and he rips his arm out of your jaws. Leaving that kind of nasty, irony taste of duergar blood, that you've now become accustomed to, unfortunately. That ends the round. Now you have Tiberius and a cat in your way.
Marisha: (meows)
Liam: Do the doors go in or out, that I'm by?
Matt: The doors go in.
Liam: In. So I'm just gonna go like this (hinges creak) and throw a dagger and say peek-a-boo at the same time. (laughter)
Matt: Okay. As you step out (fwip).
Liam: That is a 29 to hit.
Matt: That does hit.
Liam: Okay.
Matt: You do not get sneak attack bonus, unfortunately.
Liam: Even though my ally is five feet away from him? I thought I remembered that rule.
Matt: You do if you are in melee with them.
Laura: Oh, right.
Matt: You get the bonus if you're both like flanking them, or you're like harrying them in combat. Because you're at a distance, you don't get the bonus.
Liam: Okay, so that is a nine. And then I'm going to follow-- the nine of damage.
Matt: All right.
Liam: And immediately follow up with my other dagger, which also hits.
Matt: All right, go ahead and roll damage on the second dagger. Which is 1d4 plus what?
Liam: Six. That's a nine.
Matt: Nine, okay. So, after the guy rips his arm out of Keyleth's face, essentially, a dagger comes swinging out from behind the doorway, stabs him in the other shoulder. You see he looks down at it confused for a second, and as that dagger vanishes in a puff of dark smoke, returning to your-- the side of your hilt, he looks up just in time to see the second dagger catch him right in the middle of the forehead, and he just falls onto his back at that point, unmoving. That duergar is stripped.
Laura: What-what!
Matt: Who's up next? Who wants to do anything? Who hasn't done anything yet this action?
Sam: Is there is a door next to me for another room?
Matt: You're just finishing.
Sam: Oh, I'm just finishing, okay.
Matt: Sorry. So, Pike, have you done anything yet?
Ashley: Can I-- Is there a door there? Somewhere, right there?
Matt: You move around here, there is a door over here, yes.
Ashley: I can't really do anything. Check it out, check it out.
Liam: Yeah, bust in. You can't stealth.
Matt: The door is a secondary guest room.
Liam: And now, poop on this bed.
Ashley: All right. (laughter)
Taliesin: I can't do anything that could make noise anyway.
Matt: It is a guest room of equal design and dressing as the one that Scanlan, you are unaware, is currently fouling. (laughter)
Ashley: Maybe I get a sudden urge for some reason to just poo on the bed. (laughter)
Matt: You can do what you want. Be aware, Pike as a character has her intent, the more you stray from that, the more it will have ramifications for her in the end.
Ashley: Yes, I know, I'm just kidding, That's not what, that's not what I want to do. I was just, had this feeling that Scanlan was doing something and I felt that--
Sam: She could probably hear, muffled from behind the door, (grunts).
Ashley: Okay, so I'll just-- I guess I can't do anything while I'm in there, so? Can I just--
Matt: That's about as far as you're able to move. You can still use your action if you wanted to do anything, but right now your vision is currently fairly well-blocked by a woman and a bear, and a man the size of a bear.
Ashley: Yeah, okay, so I'll just hang out there.
Matt: Okay, so that brings us back to Kima, who currently doesn't have any sort of way of getting over there, kind of frustrating, trying to find a way over.
Marisha: It's a narrow hallway.
Matt: Clarota, who is still invisible, is just gonna hold on that point.
Orion: As everybody is doing this, I'm going to-- why are you blocking me, I'm not supposed to be this close to this thing! Keep going.
Matt: Okay, Percy! Stand there? All right, Tiberius, you're up.
Orion: Oh, like I was saying. Well, shit.
Sam: Aren't you right next to the guy? Kill him.
Matt: Do it quick, or we are gonna move for the next turn.
Orion: Okay, I'll just lift up my hand and go, Firebolt.
Matt: Okay, point-blank Firebolt. Go ahead and roll your spell attack.
Orion: Okay, okay, 20.
Matt: 20, all right. That'll hit, go ahead and roll for damage for the Firebolt.
Orion: Okay, ten, 18, 20, 21, 23.
Matt: 23 damage? All right. So as you instinctively pull back, you release the blast of Firebolt energy, the duergar who is currently harrying you with this warhammer takes the brunt of it right to the bottom of his face and his torso. The studded leather armor that he's wearing tears open with a sheer flaming burst of the impact of it, and you see most of his skin is charred and burned at that point. He reels back for a second, looking very, very hurt but not quite put down yet.
Orion: As my bonus action, I'm gonna spend two sorcery points and do it again. So I roll for that. It's a 22.
Matt: All right, the second blast, as he reaches back, before he can get a chance to get back to his feet, the second blast hits. This time, it sends him off his feet, flying about five to ten feet back, skidding across the ground.
Orion: 15 damage.
Matt: Yes, and that puts him, still on the floor, laid out with a burning, kind of crippling, crispy scent in the air of what was once a standing duergar, now dead and burning on the ground.
Marisha: So once again I grab him by the scruff, take him, and put him in the bathroom.
Liam: I give a couple of pats on Tiberius's shoulder and start to inch down the hall.
Matt: All right, as you guys are doing this, Scanlan steps out of the guest room, getting his pantaloons back on.
Sam: My invisible pantaloons.
Matt: Yes. You hear the footprints of Scanlan, you being still invisible, you essentially just--
Sam: I phantom pooped. Did I find anything in there, by the way?
Liam: Just relief.
Matt: You found a fun way to prank duergar.
Marisha: Oh, yeah, did I find anything in the barracks?
Matt: Over there? No.
Taliesin: Did Liam-- Did Vax find anything shiny in the room? The shiny thing.
Liam: No, I got interrupted. That's a good idea, thanks for the reminder, Percy.
Taliesin: You're welcome, yes.
Liam: Checking for-- I checked for traps before, but I can't remember what I rolled. I'm sure it was successful.
Matt: Go ahead and roll again. (laughter)
Liam: 17.
Matt: Okay, as you push the door open and get a glance inside of the main hall, you don't see any traps across the floor.
Liam: Okay, I'm gonna go check out the shiny thing.
Matt: Okay. Everyone else staying out in the hallway?
Sam: I'm coming with him.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: If I can get there.
Matt: You manage to scoot through, dancing around folks, people kind of let you get by. Anyone else?
Laura: Yeah, sure, I like shiny things.
Marisha: I'm burying my shame, again. Burying the duergar.
Matt: So, you're dragging the duergar over in the--
Taliesin: I'll go in, too.
Ashley: I'll follow, I'll follow.
Laura: We're all going. It's a big, happy room.
Liam: So say we all.
Marisha: Well, I guess I'll go after I bury duergar.
Matt: Yes, as you guys step in here, move up towards the back corner, where there's the shiny glint. Tiberius, you stay inside or outside?
Orion: I'm going to wait for everybody to go inside.
Marisha: We will be Team Outside Posse.
Matt: Kima walks in, Grog goes to start making his way in. As he does, you go over towards the glimmer. The glimmer on the table, you look, it's just formless and kind of this weird spark of light. It then vanishes, and the doors that you guys entered--
Laura: (singsong) It's a trap.
Matt: -- slam behind you, with Tiberius, Grog and Keyleth all kept outside of the room.
Ashley: No!
Matt: The rest of you guys, the flames go to darkness and the entire room goes pitch-black.
Marisha: Oh, shit!
Laura: Oh, no, we don't have light.
Liam: In the darkness, I say, fuck! (laughter)
Laura: Stupid, stupid, stupid!
Orion: I motion to Grog and I'm like, you know what to do, damn it.
Matt: Grog's gonna go for the door, however, at this point in time, I'm going to ask for--
Laura: Can we stealth? I mean, I guess we're all kind of--
Sam: Ask for?
Liam: Roll for Deus ex Machina.
Sam: Oh, You're gonna ask the chat room something?
Matt: No, no, no. I'm not. I'm working out what's actually gonna happen here. All right, so, suddenly there is a cacophonous bit of pain streaking through Pike, Vex, and Clarota. Guys, go ahead and make an intelligence saving throw.
Sam: Intelligence?
Laura: All of us?
Sam: Some sort of a mind thing.
Laura: Oh, crud.
Marisha: Intelligence.
Laura: Oh, oh, oh! Oh, no, I don't get any advantage in this.
Liam: 13.
Matt: Not you, just you two. So what's the--
Taliesin: Never mind, that was such a good roll.
Ashley: What was that? That's a one. (laughs)
Matt: Okay.
Ashley: I rolled a one!
Matt: So in the darkness, suddenly there is this searing pain, like some sort of screaming sound is blasting you from the inside of your very mind. You two are both currently stunned.
Laura: Oh, crud.
Sam: Who's you two?
Laura: Me and Pike.
Ashley: I did bad things, I did bad things. I shouldn't have killed a man while he was down. Wait, so what does that-- That means we just can't do anything, right?
Matt: On every turn, you get to try and break that, but right now neither of you can--
Marisha: Every turn they have to try and break out of it? It keeps going? It's like a keep-going thing?
Matt: You both just sit there, grasping your heads, just screaming in pain as your body is unable to function or listen to any thought process. Clarota also unfortunately falls victim to this and is also unable to make any actions.
Sam: Oh boy!
Liam: I'm pulling out my flametongue dagger to try to get a little bit of light in here.
Matt: All right, however-- You, as you are currently pulling out your flametongue dagger, you feel a presence nearby, and with a little bit of embers around the fire, you see, out of nothing, a figure step into view that apparently was not visible but a moment before. A tall, lithe figure, with long limbs, fingers and a wrapping of facial tentacles coming towards your face.
Sam: It was invisible.
Liam: I see him, I'm gonna stab, I'm just gonna stab.
Matt: Before you get the chance to stab, you get a surprise attack from this guy.
Laura: Oh, no, what if he sucks our brains out?
Matt: All right, that comes to an 18 versus armor class.
Liam: Yeah, he got me.
Matt: So, as you go back for your blade to pull it out, he grabs you by the shoulders and pulls you, and the tentacles wrap around your face and pull you into this horrible toothy maw. You feel this tearing pain sensation as its teeth begin to dig into your face.
Ashley: No, no, no, no.
Laura: Oh my god, he's gonna die.
Liam: That hurts. A lot.
Matt: You take 17 points of psychic damage as the actual presence of the tentacles pulling on your face, you feel it's kind of grabbing your brain and trying to hold it in place. You are currently considered grappled.
Marisha: Son of a bitch.
Matt: Now, guys, everyone roll initiative. That was a surprise round.
Marisha: Surprise round.
Matt: Yes.
Marisha: 'Cause they got the drop on us
Taliesin: That'll do.
Orion: What's going on in there? I hear lots of ruckus.
Sam: We'll be out in a minute.
Orion: Don't give me that, Scanlan. Oh. Scanlan, you can hear me. What's going on in there?
Sam: We're all dying.
Orion: I turn to Grog. They're all dying.
Matt: (laughs) All right, so 25 to 20?
Sam: No one.
Matt: All right, 25 to 20, no one-- almost forgot, go ahead and make an intelligence saving throw.
Liam: 23.
Matt: 23, all right, you feel the presence of its mind pressing into your brain and you manage to, through the pain of its tentacles pulling you towards its mouth, shrug off its current attempt to push into your mind.
Liam: I'm thinking of the middle finger.
Matt: That's a good thing. Okay. So you're still grappled but you're not stunned.
Sam: Is he a piece on the board yet?
Matt: Both of them are now visible right there. All right, so, 25 to 20?
Laura: Nobody.
Matt: 20 to 15?
Liam: 17.
Taliesin: 16.
Orion: 17.
Matt: 17 and 16, all right. So actually, Grog is going first. All right, and Percy. 15 to ten? Ten to five?
Marisha: Oh, oh, wait, 13. (laughter)
Marisha: Sorry, I was thinking about shit.
Matt: That's okay. Ten to five?
Laura: Nine.
Taliesin: Thinking about shit.
Marisha: Thinking about life and death. (laughs)
Taliesin: Word.
Matt: All right.
Sam: Two.
Ashley: Oh, so did I. Best friends.
Sam: Besties. Twinsies.
Ashley: Gnomesies. (laughter)
Sam: We're still-- Mr. Dungeon Master, sir, this is all the same day. I don't get any of my spells back?
Matt: No, you guys have not rested. All right, so first, the top actually-- Kima is at the top of the initiative order.
Marisha: Kima, get it girl, get it, get it girl.
Matt: Kima angrily leaps on top of the table and goes running down with an angry yell, and leaps down toward the one that's currently grabbing onto you with its grapple. As she's running a little bit of light bursts, as you can see this divine energy begin to burst and glow off the edge of the greatsword that she's holding. She leaps down, and with a giant arc through the air that lights up that portion of the room with a brief sweep, the blade comes down towards-- oh, that'll hit. Second attack also hits.
Ashley: Yes, go Kima.
Matt: So that comes to-- okay, using her Divine Smite ability on top of that, she manages to deal 37 points of damage to it.
Taliesin: Damn.
Matt: As she finishes both of her strikes simultaneously. The mindflayer, however, does not release its grasp on you. You are still considered grappled. That ends her turn. Grog now is gonna angrily attempt to bash into this door, is gonna make an-- actually no, no athletics check, he's going to go into a rage and hitting away at the door. (growling)
Liam: (Grog voice) I would like to rage. (laughter)
Laura: (Grog voice) I would like to rage. (laughter)
Matt: All right, that puts a total of 32 points of damage, that's enough. So Grog just takes two big swings. The first one comes through, cracks the door in half, splitting it down the center. Rears back a second time, cleaves through the door entirely. What little bit is left on the hinges, he kicks out with his foot, leaving now this side completely open to the interior. He then moves in around Clarota. That's as far as he can get in this current turn. That brings us to Vax.
Liam: What can I do while grappled, nothing until I'm ungrappled?
Matt: Well, no, you can try and make an acrobatics or athletics roll against them to try and break free.
Liam: Okay, but then do I have an action once that's done or that's the action?
Matt: I'll let you use that as your move.
Liam: All right, so I'm gonna try to use, I guess athletics is what I would do.
Matt: Or acrobatics, up to you, whichever's higher.
Liam: Well, that would be acrobatics.
Matt: Acrobatics, then.
Liam: 27.
Matt: 27?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: That'll do it.
Liam: Okay.
Matt: You manage to, just in that moment of it being struck with the two blade strikes from Lady Kima, you manage to pull your head free from its grasp. And just manage to right yourself now, the throbbing pain in your head of what you just narrowly avoided still there.
Liam: Okay. Poison dagger in hand, I roll an 18. Does that hit?
Matt: Okay. 18. Currently that does hit, yes.
Liam: I wanna grab him by the calamari and stab him in the eye. (laughter)
Matt: Okay, go for it.
Liam: That's what I did, so-- and then if I'm five feet-- if Kima's there, I can sneak attack according to the rules?
Matt: Correct.
Liam: All right, so I'm gonna stab him in the eye. One. Plus the sneak attack damage is two, four, ten, 13, 19, 38, plus seven-- 45.
Matt: 45. All right. So, as you--
Liam: With the poison dagger.
Matt: Right, the poison dagger. I think you've already used the daily poison ability on this.
Liam: I don't remember, so it's just a stab.
Matt: Okay. So the 45 points of damage. You pull back and you jam it into the side of its eye. You can see as it rears back, a spray of dark-colored liquid kind of warms the side of your face. As you pull the blade back out it rears back and (growls). You can hear its voice piercing into your head going, "I will eat you one way or another!"
Ashley: No, you won't!
Laura: Did it distract him enough that we lost our thingy?
Matt: That's your main attack?
Liam: I mean, I would imagine between ungrappling and stabbing, is that it for me? Or do I get my second attack, I don't know?
Matt: You can get your second attack, I'm sorry.
Liam: Okay, well I think, go fuck yourself, and stab again. Nine plus-- 19.
Matt: 19? Yeah, that hits.
Liam: Other eye, other eye. No sneak attack. Two plus-- eight.
Matt: Eight. Okay. As it rears back and you hear it saying that, you pull back and you grab with your off hand the cluster of tentacles in the front of its face and pull it down. As you do, the inertia-- you jam the blade into the other eye. As you do, you hear this blast burst of angry scream inside your head, before it goes dead cold, silent, and the mind flayer falls to the ground.
Liam: I fucking hate these things!
Matt: All right. That brings us to Clarota, who's currently stunned and fails save, Clarota's still stunned. Tiberius.
Orion: I look through the door.
Matt: Look through the door.
Orion: What's going on in here? Are there any enemies I can see?
Matt: You can see over here, barely. It's very dark in the far corner, you can see just the shape of some humanoid there.
Orion: Oh. Okay, is he-- (laughs)
Matt: What are you doing, Tiberius?
Orion: (laughs) How tall is the thing?
Matt: From what you can see, it's maybe roughly six, seven feet. Grog's blocking most of it.
Orion: No, like, we're in a bunker, right?
Matt: Right now, you're in this giant great hall with giant tables and stools everywhere.
Orion: And the ceiling is--
Matt: You can't see the ceiling right now, there's no light.
Orion: Oh.
Matt: The room is near pitch-black, like there's just very little light in there currently.
Orion: I will waltz in behind Grog.
Matt: All right.
Orion: I cast Light.
Matt: Okay. The room all of a sudden bursts into view, you can now see the walls, the ceiling-- it's a smooth stone room. There is a large chandelier currently hanging from the top of the ceiling. It's about 25 feet up to the ceiling in this current room.
Marisha: (gasps) There's a big chandelier. That's fun.
Orion: And now do I see that guy better?
Matt: You do, yes. You see now there is a mind flayer currently ducking behind one of the tables right now. You can see a number of your friends in the party are currently clutching their heads, silently screaming to themselves, unmoving.
Orion: Ah, right. There's another one of those guys over there!
Marisha: Wait, there's another one?
Orion: Yes!
Marisha: There's two?
Matt: There's two.
Orion: I spend three sorcerer points.
Matt: How many sorcerer points do you have left? You spent a lot over the past couple games.
Orion: No, I have not, because I didn't do anything last game, because I was all recharged.
Matt: That's true, actually. Okay. Just keep track of that. So how many do you have left?
Orion: I have eight right now. Now I'll spend it to go down to--
Laura: Five.
Orion: Five. 'Cause math.
Matt: Okay, got you. Cool, good on you.
Marisha: Fantasy math. Once again, 826LA, after-school tutoring. Good charity.
Orion: I could have used it. I cast my pillars, or Grand Columns, as I like to call it, and (piston sound) all the way up and smash that little bastard.
Matt: All right.
Marisha: Smashy smashy.
Matt: So what's the save you get past that for the spell?
Orion: He does a dex save, and he takes 6d6 damage, and the dex save is to see if he's pinned or not.
Matt: Right. It does make its save, I believe, it's 21?
Orion: Oh, my, what?
Matt: Rolled a 21 versus your DC of your spell, which I believe is not higher than 21.
Orion: No.
Matt: So yeah, so he still takes the damage, but is not pinned.
Orion: Which is 15, 18 points of damage.
Matt: Okay, 18 points of damage, and manages to pull out of the way just in time as it slams into him, he darts off and catches himself on the ground, kind of slowly levitating above the ground as he comes to a stop. The pillar then slams into the roof, this section here. Actually splinters part of the table, which is now kind of lifted off-kilter at an angle. Yup. It--
Orion: Oh, so that-- does that mean he's in the air for a whole round? 'Cause how it works is, he's all the way up to that height, but he gets to come, or fall, back down if he makes the save. That's how-- so he has to travel that distance, so does he cast Levitate as he's coming down?
Matt: How I'm playing it is, the impact of the pillar suddenly slamming in from underneath is what does the initial damage, and he manages to roll off before it slams into the ceiling. He kinda-- So. However, that ends your turn. The mind flayer, now looking around and seeing the room lit up, seeing the entire group now in this room, looks around at everyone, puts its hands together and concentrates-- and as it does you see its form (sucking noise) vanish.
Marisha: Damn it!
Matt: A few seconds pass, you guys manage to shrug your stun, and Clarota as well.
Ashley: Whoa, what happened?
Marisha: That's not good.
Laura: What happened?
Marisha: They really know we're here.
Laura: We need to get out of this room, then.
Taliesin: Let's just search the rest of this floor as quickly as possible.
Marisha: As quickly as possible.
Laura: Grog, can you always put down the dust of tracelessness?
Matt: "All right, I will." He's doing his flower-girl moment. Passes behind you guys. All right, so, what is the current mode of action for you guys?
Marisha: I'm going to go ahead and dart down this hall that we know is for sure empty.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Exit the other side of the great hall that we're in.
Matt: All right.
Laura: And I think we should all go back-- we should go to the second floor.
Matt: Through here.
Liam: Walking in that door.
Matt: You look through here and see what appears to be some sort of a kitchen. You can see shelf units, you can see what looks like a few tables, you can see some kitchen elements.
Liam: I'm gonna walk all the way in, all the way in.
Matt: All right, you walk all the way in. There's a door towards the back--
Liam: The right, what do I see?
Matt: The right, you see what looks to be a doorway that's partially open that leads to a staircase.
Liam: Up or down?
Matt: Looks like it's going up.
Marisha: And what's in this room? I'm looking over here.
Matt: Okay, you look over here. It's a double door that is currently closed.
Taliesin: I will head in your direction as well.
Orion: Eight, two of my d6s to heal up.
Matt: You haven't taken a short rest yet. You have to-- you guys have to stop and take ten minutes, 15 minutes to rest to do that, so--
Sam: I'm gonna look all over the great hall and see if there's any cool stuff in there.
Matt: Make a perception check.
Laura: I think what we should do-- Everyone, I think what we should do is make our way back to the initial storage room we were in and go up that stairway, because that one's hidden. It's by a hidden entrance, people aren't gonna think about that one as much as main stairways.
Taliesin: I agree, I think we should-- I agree with that, I just think we should check the rest of the floor as well. Just double-check everything, make sure we didn't miss the--
Liam: Vax is heading back to the group.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Percy and I are checking this room with the double doors. Do you have any trap checks to see if it's locked?
Liam: I do!
Matt: Okay, so Percy and both you guys open this doorway. It opens up into what looks to be another smaller eating hall. This one's nicer, this one has one long table. This is probably where the more socially risen--
Taliesin: Take a quick look around.
Marisha: Yeah, anything in there?
Matt: Looks like it hasn't been used for a day or two.
Taliesin: All right.
Marisha: No cool goodies?
Matt: No current goodies in this area, no.
Taliesin: So we'll go-- just keep going down and check the rest of that hallway.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: There's a lot more, you guys. I think we should go find the vault on the second floor.
Matt: All right, you guys press down here. There apparently are now-- you can see there's another set of double doors--
Liam: Vax is following.
Matt: All right.
Laura: I think I should gather the group and try to make it back to the other storage room. Just to get us out of this area specifically.
Matt: So you guys are all moving back with--
Laura: Is that cool?
Matt: -- Vex to return to the previous storage room?
Marisha: We can do that. Yeah, go for it.
Taliesin: And you'll hear us if anything goes wrong. Yeah, we'll power through it.
Laura: Use your earring.
Matt: All right.
Marisha: I'll go ahead and very-- I'm just gonna kinda use my keen sense-- or sorry, my keen smell again to see if I can smell any duergar in the area.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and make a perception check with advantage.
Marisha: That's pretty good. Oh yeah, I'll take that first roll, which was seven-- 27.
Matt: 27. You smell that on this floor, there doesn't appear to be any duergar in your immediate vicinity. There is a strong, lingering scent of them coming from the doorway that you're currently at.
Marisha: A strong, lingering scent?
Matt: Correct, like it-- you can kind of tell there was a recent moving of a large number of duergar.
Marisha: But probably not present.
Matt: You don't know.
Marisha: Whatever. I guess we'll see what's in here.
Matt: All righty.
Marisha: Peeky, peeky.
Liam: I kind of parkour past Percy.
Matt: Okay.
Orion: Parkour past Percy!
Marisha: Parkour, parkour!
Matt: You open the doors into what appears to be a large temple chamber, a place of worship. What you see are a series of long, wooden benches that are arranged to look towards the center. There is an altar to the right that is a risen kind of stone dais, and in the center there is a stone table, an altar which has a piece of black cloth wrapped over it and something on top of it you can't see from this distance. In the center of the room there is a 12-foot-tall statue of what looks like an extremely strong armored duergar clutching a giant warhammer and a shield.
Marisha: Hm. I'm gonna-- oh wait, I'm a tiger.
Matt: Yup.
Liam: I'm gonna perception check the room. Which is high. 27.
Matt: 27? There does not appear to be anybody inside this room.
Liam: Screw this room.
Matt: However, do you have a religion--
Taliesin: I would like to do a religion roll.
Matt: Roll religion, guys.
Taliesin: Nine.
Liam: Nine.
Ashley: Could I do a religion roll from where I am?
Matt: You are not over there, unfortunately.
Marisha: That's what I was gonna do, is tell somebody to get Pike over here real quick.
Laura: Do you guys have earrings?
Ashley: I can put on my sprinter's boots.
Liam: Yeah, Pike, Pike? There's some sort of religious artifacts over here. Could use your expertise.
Matt: Pike, you make your way through, eventually coming down this hallway-- (clanking)
Marisha: She's coming! I can hear her coming.
Ashley: Hey guys, I'm here! Did you know I was coming? (laughter)
Matt: Go ahead and make a religion check.
Liam: Don't stab anything.
Orion: I'm gonna follow suit, but slowly.
Ashley: 17.
Matt: All right. As you're heading that direction slowly, best that you can tell right now, this room is definitely a small temple built to-- and the name kind of escapes you, the words trying to form in your head for a second, and then eventually you come to realize this is a chapel to Laduguer. Laduguer is the deity of the duergar. It's the god that basically freed them from their original enslavement from the illithids, and they worship as a pinnacle of power, strength, and conquest.
Orion: I make it up to where those guys are.
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: Let's keep searching.
Sam: Hey, what's the darkness right next to me? Is there a door there? What is that?
Matt: There is a door right over here.
Sam: Oh. I'm gonna open it.
Matt: Okay. All right. So you go ahead and open the door. It opens up into what you can immediately see is a chamber that is some kind of magical laboratory. You see in the far corner, hunched, a robed duergar, and as you open the door, there's a slight sound, a click sound, and a jet of greenish fume begins to spray up into your face. Make a constitution save.
Sam: Oh, god. I don't even know what that is! (laughs) 15.
Matt: 15? All right. So you take 11 points of poison damage. However, you can feel the poison forcing its way into your lungs. You manage to back out of the cloud in time and cough it up and your general physical well-being-- you resist most of the effects of the poison. However, this poison fume trap did appear to go off and as the smoke slowly dissipates, you hear a chuckle across the other side.
Orion: As I hear the noise, I--
Matt: You don't hear the noise, you're too far away.
Orion: Oh, shit.
Matt: You guys do hear it, though.
Laura: Okay, I come over there and see what the-- what just happened.
Matt: Okay, as you rush over, Scanlan's backed up away and you can see there's this chamber here.
Laura: Is the poison still in the air, or is it--
Matt: It's dissipated at this point. It's thin enough. You still can smell it, and it smells awful, like a very, very heavy, electrical fire-type smell.
Laura: So I can see that guy?
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: So should I notch an arrow and try to hit him?
Matt: It's up to you. What're you going to do?
Laura: All right, I attack him, then!
Matt: All right, go for it then.
Ashley: Attack him! Get him!
Laura: Shabang! Oh, dang it, I didn't do it. I meant to Hunter's Mark him and transfer it over, but that's okay, I didn't say it.
Matt: You didn't say it this time.
Laura: That's 30. For the first.
Liam: You did say shabang.
Laura: I did say shabang, and 16 for the second.
Matt: Okay, both hit. Go ahead and roll damage on each.
Ashley: Hit it. (music flares up)
Laura: Well, sort of. 15 and eight.
Matt: 15 and eight. All right.
Liam: The music is on.
Matt: All right. So both arrows you've been firing over the top. He's kind of hard to see with the table and from being crouched in the corner, but both arrows still manage to barely make their mark. One kind of pins him against the wall, and he looks at his shoulder briefly, looks back at you, raises his hand, as he begins muttering something under his breath. As he does, your arrow (shnk) through his hand and he tries to shake it, and now he's pinned to the wall with an arrow in the middle of his hand.
Laura: Yeah!
Ashley: Yeah!
Laura: Trinket! Oh no, I used two attacks.
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: Dang it.
Matt: You can still tell Trinket to move. What are you gonna do?
Laura: No, no no, I'm gonna hold him there, 'cause he's already in the room.
Matt: Okay, got you. All right, so what are you guys doing over in the temple?
Liam: Exiting.
Matt: All right.
Marisha: No! Look and see if there's anything cool, first. What was that thing that's covered up by the blanket on the altar?
Matt: You keep walking towards it?
Marisha: Yeah. What's up with that?
Matt: You make your way, you look at the top of the dais where the altar is, and on top you can see the black cloth that is wrapped over it. The scent gets to you before the actual visual. It's freshly rotting flesh of some kind, and as you glance over, you can see there is a heart that has been cut from a body and it's at the point where the blood has coagulated and begin to become thick. It's roughly dwarven size.
Marisha: I get up and I grab it in my mouth.
Matt: Okay. It tastes disgusting.
Marisha: And then I walk over to Vax and I lay it at his feet. I kind of nudge it with my nose.
Matt: She got you a heart.
Liam: I scritch Keyleth behind the ear, but nudge it aside with my toe and exit the room.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: I did scritch her ears, but I'm going to continue down to the end of the hall.
Matt: This way?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: Okay, you make your way into what looks like a giant foyer, into a secondary entrance in the side of the fortress.
Liam: I just walk all the way over to the corner, stealthing.
Matt: Make a stealth check.
Liam: It's high, it's 28.
Matt: 28, got it, okay. So, as you make your way through, you eventually careen to this corner. You can see another hallway, what appears to be another room of some kind. You also glance back and see there are two sets of stairways that go up and down.
Liam: What's behind me?
Matt: This is a giant foyer that leads outside of the fortress.
Liam: And the edge of the map this way?
Matt: This way here? This way? This comes to an abrupt end at that point, a rocky wall into the mountain itself that it's buttressed up against.
Liam: Okay, I'm gonna keep coming this way, stealthing.
Matt: All right. As you move through--
Laura: What's happening with that dude I-- are you doing all this while I just pin down--
Liam: Yeah. I don't know what's going on back there. I'm just walking around.
Matt: So, you glance in this room. There's an open walkway and what appears to be another barrack section, also completely empty.
Liam: Screw that. Do I see a door for this room that's still darkened out? Then I'm gonna keep sliding along the wall.
Matt: Okay, as you slide along here, to make your way around to a door there.
Liam: Okay. Pressing my hand, just to see if I can check any for traps.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: 26.
Matt: 26, all right. The door does not appear to be trapped.
Taliesin: I'm gonna be heading in that direction anyway.
Marisha: Agreed. Same here.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: I would like to stealth through the door.
Orion: Before I leave, I carefully examine that statue.
Matt: Okay, what are you examining?
Orion: The facial features of the god, the deity, right? Is that what he is?
Matt: Yeah. Okay, so you look at the face of Laduguer. You can see it's very, very old, it's very well-crafted. You can see a lot of very meticulous craftsmanship went into its creation. It almost glistens with a perfection that is out of place in an area that is so covered in soot and various other volcanic activity-based mineral deposits.
Orion: I'm gonna do a quick arcana check, just to see if there's any kind of mystical thing around it or anything like that. And it's 19.
Matt: Okay. There is some sort of a hum to the air that has an arcane element to it, but you are unable to pinpoint what it necessarily means or what the source is.
Orion: Interesting. Knowing that, I kind of gather my thoughts and I head towards where the rest of the group is.
Matt: Okay, so, while you're opening the door, the mage in the far corner kind of looks about sporadically and looks down at the arrow in its hand and its shoulder and just kind of fearfully, "Wait wait wait! Wait. Stop. Don't attack. Let's have a conversation."
Laura: Speak fast. Before I kill you.
Matt: He leans forward, kind of pulling the arrow out of the doorway. (groans in pain) Starts hobbling towards you a little bit.
Laura: Can we all-- we go in the room and Trinket goes up next to him and, like, gets all up in his face?
Matt: Okay. As you both enter, both of you make constitution saving throws. As two more plumes of poison (pff) out of the ground as both you and Trinket walk in.
Liam: Good.
Laura: 15?
Matt: 15, okay. And for Trinket as well.
Laura: Oh, I should've been so smart, but I wasn't. (laughter)
Laura: 14 for Trinket.
Matt: Okay. You take seven points of poison damage.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: Trinket, however, takes 14 points of poison damage.
Laura: Oh man. What did I get, seven?
Matt: Seven. And Trinket is currently considered poisoned.
Laura: Oh no!
Sam: What does that mean?
Matt: It means disadvantage on attack rolls, disadvantage on ability checks.
Laura: That's okay.
Matt: And now there's a bear coughing and kind of thrashing about the room. The table it bumps into and it kind of topples over.
Laura: Is this like a turn thing or can I do something?
Matt: Well, this is just a reactionary moment of you guys coughing and trying to get out of this poisonous fume.
Laura: I mean, can I quickly cast Protection from Poison on Trinket?
Matt: You can, yes.
Laura: Okay. I do that.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: And that cures it.
Matt: That completely removes the poison?
Laura: Yes it does.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Yay Trinket!
Matt: Well done. So that's your action. You now, as you are checking the door and you open it up, you hear all this commotion going off to the side now. Scanlan, you're over there as well, watching as more plumes of these poisonous smoke bits.
Sam: If I get close to the door without going through it, can I see the guy?
Matt: You can move over and look, you can just barely make out his form. It is a dark room that is currently filled with a slowly dissipating green cloud so it's hard to make him out.
Sam: Okay, well then I will just-- fuck (laughs). Well, if I can't see him then I will just yell at him.
Matt: All right.
Sam: I'll yell with Vicious Mockery. I don't like you very much for poisoning me and my friends, you're a poopy head! (laughter)
Marisha: So vicious.
Laura: That is threatening.
Marisha: Damn.
Sam: Ooh. That does seven points of damage.
Matt: Seven points from Vicious Mockery? All right! (laughter)
Matt: I don't know how that works.
Sam: It's Vicious Mockery. It's an attack.
Matt: That's crazy.
Liam: That's, like, 80 points of damage!
Marisha: And who said that words couldn't hurt people?
Taliesin: And bonus damage to his mother, wherever she may be.
Marisha: Sticks and stones can break my bones, but words can hurt.
Matt: Okay. So it has to make a will saving throw, against your DC. It rolls a three. It does not. So, as you shout out into this room, the currently fearful duergar mage kind of glances, eyes slide about, hears these words and you see him wrack his head for a second with a sudden sense of self-loathing and disappointment. (laughter)
Matt: His hands drop and it looks like for a minute his intent to begin muttering some sort of incantation is momentarily distracted.
Orion: Nice!
Matt: All right, awesome.
Ashley: Can I start moving back?
Matt: Yeah, you can start moving back this way.
Liam: I hear that, but I'm still going to poke my head stealthily through the door and see what I see. Do I need a new stealth check or?
Matt: Yes you do.
Liam: Okay, great. So that is a 32.
Matt: All right, you glance inside at what looks to be some sort of a training room. There are-- most of the floor itself is stone, and in the far corner there is a large section that is mainly just sand and dirt and there are a number of wooden training structures. You know, various shields and wooden bars that are used as a means of training for weaponry. There's what looks like a giant rack of weapons, full of arms and stuff.
Liam: Anything good-looking?
Matt: Go ahead and make a perception check.
Liam: One.
Matt: Most of the materials in this room look like the basic duergar fare.
Liam: These don't look very good.
Taliesin: I was going to run in and take a look around anyway so--
Matt: (laughs) Okay. As you run in, go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw.
Taliesin: God damn it. Okay.
Sam: (sings) Traps, traps, traps-traps-traps.
Taliesin: 24.
Matt: All right, so. You take ten points of lightning damage as you feel a tile on the ground trigger and then spring up, and as it does, you hear this sudden high-pitched whine as blue energy streaks up from the floor, runs through your body. Thankfully, you manage to dive out of the way and touch the ground to ground the energy, minimizing the damage. But yeah, you triggered (laughs) triggered a trap plate. You're beginning to get the sense that a lot of this tactic of this fortress now has been to lead you guys through a--
Marisha: Maze?
Matt: A maze of traps.
Sam: A labyrinth.
Liam: Before we hurt ourselves any longer, we should--
Laura: We've got to kill this guy. Or talk to him at least.
Liam: We need to get to the main event here.
Matt: All right. At this point, Kima is now-- As Kima hears you shouting all these curses into the room, Kima pushes past you, and pushes past you. You can see Kima coming into the room behind you guys. Steps over the broken table, down in front of the circle, and grabs the mage by the front of his robe, pulling him into her face. The mage at this point is still kind of reeling from the fact that you managed to strike him so deeply in the heart of his hearts.
Sam: He's just not a nice man.
Matt: However, Kima, with a look of absolute death in her face, grabs him and pulls him forward and says, "Listen, where is the rest of your fucking army?" She's going to make an intimidation check.
Taliesin: Yeah! Damn.
Matt: He does not succeed in resisting that.
Laura: Yes!
Matt: The duergar is pressed against the wall now, and she's slamming him against the back of a bookshelf. "Look, all right, they're waiting for you up there, all right? You're not going to survive this. At this point, the entire city's probably waiting for you in the outside of the fortress and those that are upstairs are well-prepared. Okay? Your best chance of survival is laying down your arms and surrendering. I'm looking out for your best interests here."
Liam: Kill this asshole.
Marisha: Kill him.
Matt: Kima, who is still holding him against there, you can see her hand releases the scruff and he takes a deep breath for a second. But before he can finish exhaling, she goes in, immediately grabbing his throat and squeezing it extremely tight. As she does, you see his tongue, dangling out the side of his mouth (strangling noises) as she's cutting off his entire air supply. She pulls forward and takes the greatsword and begins to slowly push it into his abdomen. As she does, he starts screaming in terrible pain. You can see her just slowly pushing the blade through his body into the bookcase behind. As she does, she goes, "You're gonna tell me, right now, who they have waiting for us upstairs." As she begins to push all the way to the hilt now, he's pinned up against the bookcase and probably a portion of the stonework behind him. He's now got blood pouring out the sides of his face and outside the front of his nose. The duergar being held up against the wall says, "Whatever you haven't killed. The army's probably up with the king himself. They're all waiting for you and I hope they piss on your body when they're done!" At which point she takes the blade and twists it. As she does, he gives this guttural yelp and his eyes just go blank. Blanker than the duergar eyes normally are.
Orion: I make it to the doorway and go, what is going on in here?
Laura: Are there any-- taking that in-- any healing potions or anything in here that we could use?
Matt: Go ahead and make an investigation check.
Sam: Can I look at the door and see if the trap will go off again if we step through it again?
Matt: Perception check.
Sam: 20.
Matt: Looks like, from glancing about the room and getting a feel for it, there were three traps that were all placed directly at the front of the door, basically to give him a point of defense, they've all been triggered, so you don't have to worry about any more in this room.
Laura: Is this still considered the Underdark?
Matt: This is, yes.
Laura: Oh, cool!
Sam: I'm going to go in and look around some more.
Matt: You're looking around as well?
Sam: Look around for potions and stuff.
Laura: Oh, that's considered the-- aw, I could have been rolling twice for all these damn things!
Matt: (sings) Remember your abilities.
Laura: (sings) 25.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Who's the singer here, people?
Matt: Sorry, Scanlan. So, as Kima pulls the blade from its body, kicking it off the greatsword and wiping it across the leather on the side-- the leather that you gave to her! And a little part of you is like, (sadly) hmm.
Liam: That's all right. Worth it. This halfling's hot.
Matt: So you guys made your way back, Clarota's there, against the corner, and Grog rushes over, just feeling like he was ready for action. "What's going on?"
Ashley: You're too late.
Marisha: This might be a good time to stop for a moment.
Matt: That's up to you guys, as I say, do you guys want to take a short rest?
Laura: Did I find any potions? Did I find anything?
Matt: Yes. Glancing around the room, you manage to find two potions of healing, one potion of superior healing.
All: Ooh.
Laura: What is that? That's major.
Marisha: That's cool.
Matt: You also find one vial of some sort of weird, viscous yellow liquid that you cannot identify.
Marisha: Oh, don't open that. Who knows how long those guards had to be staked out here? Don't open that.
Sam: Can I do a-- can I investigate it or arcana it?
Matt: Sure, you can give it a go.
Sam: Yeah. That's a one.
Laura: Oh good.
Sam: Oh wait, no, that's a seven. These dice are horrible. Anyway, it doesn't matter. It's bad.
Matt: It looks delicious. No, actually, you can't make out, it has some changing color as you kind of swirl the bottle and watch the texture inside shift and change with the centrifugal force. You can't make out anything about its intent, but it does feel like it's a potion created with some effect.
Sam: Tiberius, do you want to drink this?
Orion: No! What is it? I check it for 18.
Sam: For what?
Orion: For whatever you're trying to hand to me.
Matt: 18 arcana? Okay. You take a look at it. It definitely is magical, you don't have a lot of experience with alchemy but you gather that the effect that it would have upon imbibement would be to alter your physical form in some way, you just don't know the specific effects.
Orion: Absolutely, Scanlan, I'll take that for now. And I put it in my pouch.
Taliesin: Let's take a short rest.
Matt: So, as you guys all kind of enter this room, this brief safe zone to take a short rest, if you feel you want to heal yourself up and regain any short rest-based abilities, do so.
Marisha: Can we talk about what this duergar just told us?
Laura: Can we go to the bathroom before we do that?
Matt: That's what I was going to say. We can return-- So we're going to take a quick bathroom break, we're going to play the videos again, we'll return here in just a second, as the next element of the attack on Emberhold continues.
Marisha: Oh, and this is your last chance because after the break we'll pick a winner for the Espionage giveaway. So, last chance if you want to tweet @EspionageMakeup and #CriticalRole and look at our sweet nails! They're awesome. They're cool.
Matt: (whispers) Galaxies! All right, see you guys in a second.
Orion: I have text and whatnot. [break]
Matt: Welcome back, guys! All right, so we've had ourselves sufficiently rested.
Zac: Indeed we have. We have a Tabletop Promo Day kit to give away, because you guys got the 50 subs since we started today.
Matt: Which is awesome.
Zac: And we'll give away another one with another signed poster at the end of the night if you get another 50. So we're about to give this away, but I just want to remind you guys to donate to 826LA. That's the group that Critical Role is supporting, and these guys are here out of the graces of their heart, and it would be very helpful for you guys to donate to them and show your love for Critical Role by donating to the charity. We'll post the link in the chat. Get those donations rolling!
Matt: Awesome.
Zac: Zac out!
Matt: All right, thank you, Zac! Couple of quick things. You wanted to announce the Espionage--
Marisha: Yes! Our winner for the Espionage Bath Bombs Tabletop from @espionagemakeup goes to (drumroll) Danny Carr. Who is @Eleine35. So, Danny, I'm pretty sure you follow me on Twitter, just PM me your address and I'll get these out to you. And thank you!
Matt: Yeah, did you follow him? Because you have to follow him--
Marisha: Oh, I have to follow-- Oh, well then I'll follow Danny right now.
Matt: Awesome! Also, as a heads-up, guys, we've had some people perpetually asking us about the shirts that we made.
Orion: You mean these shirts?
Matt: That shirt right there. So, we have a-- it's a temporary-- it's very basic, but we have up, if you guys ever want to go to critrole.com, we have a limited run of those shirts currently available for purchase.
Marisha: Very limited, like once they're gone, they're gone.
Laura: It's less than-- probably less than 15 of each size, less than that, probably. It was a small amount.
Liam: I was wearing mine earlier today and I only rolled 20s. Only.
Marisha: It's true. So, it's www.critrole.com, and, yeah, and the site is still under construction, so. But we managed to rush it out, and I wanna give a huge shout-out to Michael Whitesman, who's a big friend of ours, for helping us make the website
Orion: Thanks, Whitey!
Marisha: @whitesly, if you want to bug him, and, yeah, so, if you buy--
Orion: That's his nickname! It's not like a--
Marisha: Whitesly! His last name is Whitesly.
Orion: I know. But I said, "What's up Whitey," like, to him personally, and then they look at me like, "Oh my lord, that's so racist." (laughter)
Orion: And I'm like, no, no, it's his nickname. It's okay.
Matt: That is actually his nickname.
Liam: I'm just sad that you don't call me Whitey.
Orion: I mean, I can.
Liam: Okay. Let's start. After this game.
Marisha: Anyways. Anyways, you can go buy t-shirts now, which was the whole point of that. At critrole.com. And there's a limited run. Once they're gone, they're gone.
Matt: The cost includes shipping. We'll get-- we're packaging them ourselves. We'll have, hopefully, more in the future, but this is the first attempt at trying to do something like this for you guys, so--
Marisha: Yeah. We're doing this all ourselves just to, just 'cause-- See how this works. You guys--
Laura: And that includes the shipping, that's why the price is--
Ashley: So future t-shirts-- Were you guys saying something, like it would be artwork from--
Marisha: Yes, this was, we got this from @rusegafdi. He wore this at Tabletop Day, so--
Laura: A very similar design, so yeah.
Marisha: Yeah, so we're-- we decided we're going to do, like, fan-designed t-shirts. So, once every so often, we'll do a fan-designed t-shirt, and yes. And then-- but they'll all be limited, so yeah!
Matt: Yeah. Shipping, shipping is included with the price, guys, don't worry. But yeah. So, anyway, check that out! Thank you guys so much, and let's go ahead and get back to the game proper.
Crew: Hey, the t-shirts are sold out already. They're now sold out. They bought all of them.
Marisha: T-shirts are sold out!
Orion: Wait, what?
Taliesin: We didn't even finish telling you people!
Laura: No they're not.
Taliesin: Let us finish our sentence first!
Matt: Okay, so, so, so the limited run was very limited--
Marisha: Holy shit!
Matt: I guess we'll have to order some more, then.
Sam: Uh, mental note  make more t-shirts.
Marisha: We didn't know! We didn't know!
Matt: We were gauging interest. I guess there's interest.
Marisha: I'm sorry! Now I almost feel guilty. Congratulations to the 100 people who got 'em.
Orion: Hold on. Tiberius is gonna work some magic, and then try to conjure up a few more. He was unaware there was a shortage of, of those-- okay.
Matt: Sorry, guys, all right, well, we'll-- thank you guys very much, we'll get more to you very soon.
Marisha: I don't know what to say! Oh god, I'm like, going to cry.
Laura: Second run, yeah! Just hashtag them critical role and we'll-- oh, but if you're selling them already, there's somebody that's making really cool t-shirts on Redbubble, but if you're making them there, like, we can't print them too, so, like, just submit them to us, and then we can--
Matt: Yeah, we'll figure it out! Anyway, guys, thank you so much! Let's get to the game!
Taliesin: Thank you! Cool!
Sam: Guys, guys, the chatroom just solved the Israeli-Palestinian conflict! (laughter)
Matt: Thank you so much, chat! Nice.
Taliesin: We've got a box of stuff coming right for you right now. Thank you.
Marisha: Oh my god, I'm like, shaking.
Matt: All right, so. For all who didn't get 'em, we'll have more soon, I promise.
Liam: Do you guys like D&D? What is that?
Marisha: (laughs) We didn't know if people liked our show or not!
Matt: So. So. So, you've housed yourselves into this enchanting room, this magical laboratory, and taken about a 15-minute rest. You're able to use any of your unused hit dice to heal yourself up if need be. Any--
Ashley: Oh, well, where's everybody at? 'Cause maybe I can just do a-- some healing up.
Taliesin: I just spent a healing surge, so.
Laura: Well, he's, well, as far as health goes--
Liam: I'm low, yeah, I'm pretty low.
Ashley: Yeah, what are you at?
Matt: How many hit dice do you have left?
Liam: I know, I have, I don't have that many left. I'm at, like-- I accidentally erased it, but I believe I'm at 30?
Ashley: Ooh, yeah, you-- I need to, I'll get on that. Anybody else? What's everybody at?
Sam: I can sing to you and give you an extra little roll.
Liam: I'd like you to sing to me, either in the game or on another day.
Sam: Are you Vex or Vax? (laughs)
Liam: I'm Vix.
Sam: All right, I'll sing to you and-- are you gonna use a dice?
Liam: Thank you. Ah, let me see how beautiful your song is
Sam: (sings) Heal the Vax, make him a better elf.
Sam: (sings) For you and for me and the entire adventuring band.
Ashley: (sings) For you and for me and the entire adventuring band.
Sam: (sings) There are duergar dying, if you cared enough for the adventurers, you'd bring Vax back to help us with the stabby-stab. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Liam: And please, vaccinate your kids. (laughter)
Liam: I mean, don't Vax-inate them.
Matt: Yeah, there's the difference. All right, so.
Sam: You get a 1d6 for that.
Matt: So, an extra 1d6 healing to anyone.
Liam: Who needs more than one? Three, okay.
Ashley: I healed you, 18, which was actually low, but I rolled really high for each roll. That's my--
Liam: Oh, thanks. That's very good. Okay, great, I am almost tip-top condition, thank you. I have a blister.
Matt: So, as you guys manage to pull yourself out of your rest mode, you now glance out, and the hallway's still quiet, you can hear the movement of footsteps up above you. What is your intent?
Sam: To win!
Marisha: Okay. Wait, what are we gonna do, 'cause here's-- there's an army waiting upstairs for us?
Liam: They know we're up there, but Kima needs her stuff, and we need to kind of put an end to this problem.
Marisha: I'm gonna hop out of tiger form, by the way, since we rested and stuff.
Sam: Wait, they're above us?
Liam: Yeah, they're all upstairs, including the mind flayer who vanished from the room we're in, so I'm sure he told everyone what's going on. But they don't know we've found the secret entrance, so I think we should go-- Vex'ahlia's correct, we should use the stairwell near the secret entrance.
Orion: Are we sure there's no other way out of here, through this particular floor? Is that the only exit?
Laura: There's-- I mean, there's the front entrance, there's that door over there, there's like two other stairways, but we should use this back one, by the back entrance.
Liam: Also, Lady Kima, our purpose here was to find you, but your purpose is somewhat greater than our own. What do you suggest we do in this moment?
Matt: As she stands up, and she holds the greatsword and swings it a bit. "What I'm seeking lies deeper into this cavern. Whatever is at the heart of this illithid scourge." And she glances over at Clarota-- who's in the back corner, hands folded-- and there's a slight mental hiss sound in her direction. "There's something far darker at the heart of this temple. I've seen it. But I have my thoughts and my ideas, but I need confirmation before I speak of any doom-saying. However, the link between those foul creatures and the assault that's currently mounting against Kraghammer lie upstairs at the center of this duergar people."
Sam: Oh, here? Here at-- where we are now? Yes, here?
Matt: "The link between this K'varn character--"
Liam: And let me ask you this. We can be on the same page, we can go up and fuck shit up. However, your weapons and armor-- would they be a great help? Should they be our short-term purpose, or should we just go up and try to end this problem?
Matt: "To be honest, we've entirely lost the element of surprise. I would not wish to sacrifice as foolishly for a few additional trinkets of my own when I feel that this should do well enough, as long as we manage to work together and be smart about this."
Laura: So we should potentially just leave this castle for now and go find K'varn, rest up--
Sam: No, no, no.
Liam: No, Kima is saying this is the main event.
Sam: She just said there's a link upstairs. The link from-- to K'varn that we need to--
Laura: I get it! Okay. Yeah.
Matt: "How do you think K'varn is able to send these armies up again and again towards the back door of Kraghammer?"
Laura: Right.
Matt: "Besides, if we go on and leave them as they are, who's to say they wouldn't come up behind us, and then we're fighting a two-sided front once we get there?"
Laura: Then let's-- We gotta go upstairs.
Liam: Vox Machina, our years are short. Let's make good use of them.
Sam: Let's leave this decision up to Grog.
Orion: Absolutely not! (laughter)
Matt: Grog's standing there clutching his greataxe. "I say, I haven't been able to kill much since we got here. Let's kill something!"
Orion: That's a terrible idea.
Laura: Have some ale before we go out, Grog.
Matt: "Oh, yeah, of course." And he goes into his bag of holding, and pulls out his now half-empty cask, and you see him frown as he hears it clink around. He pours everyone a small drink, to what is now an empty cask.
Laura: This could potentially kill us all.
Travis: Vox Machina.
All: Vox Machina!
Laura: Scanlan had a great idea, though. Should we talk about what Scanlan wants to do?
Sam: Ah, yes, I have an idea. But also, are there two stairs up to the top floor?
Liam: There's multiple.
Sam: Perhaps we should use more than one. One, half of our band go up, create a diversion. The other half sneak up and kill, kill, kill. That's one option. The other option--
Liam: Pike leads the diversion group.
Ashley: Definitely the stealthy ones with me. (laughter)
Sam: Ah, I do have an idea about gaining the upper hand on our first meeting with this army that's upstairs. An intimidation technique of some sort.
Marisha: You're not going to kill another pony, are you?
Sam: I can't anymore.
Marisha: Good.
Sam: Much as I would love to. No, but we've heard over our eavesdropping that some of these duergar bastards are scared of that strange chimera sort of hodgepodge, human centipede thing? We could be one of those with a little bit of deception, and all of us sort of piling on each other. We could act like a big scary monster and go up and freak the fuck out of them.
Marisha: Ah! That's actually a really good idea.
Laura: -- all of us piled on Grog and Trinket and you as the bases, and we become this--
Sam: They would probably be, at least for the moment, intimidated a bit, and we could get a few licks in before they realized we're just a pile of idiots running at them. (laughter)
Laura: I like it.
Marisha: So we're basically gonna be like three kids Little Rascals-style on each other's shoulders with a giant coat?
Sam: But that could be the diversion, at least.
Marisha: Okay, well then, why don't-- I actually like this idea. Why don't we have a few of our stealthy members, why don't we have the twins be in the shadows, and picking people off while--
Laura: That's true, 'cause I've got range, so that makes sense.
Marisha: Right, why don't we have some of our ranged people-- I'll transform. I can transform into-- how about a giant scorpion? That sounds fun.
Sam: Can you transform into anything?
Marisha: I can transform into beasts. They have to be beasts.
Sam: How about the type of beast that we know would scare them, like that big triceratops thing that we saw with the big metal thing on it.
Marisha: I can be a rhinoceros-- I can be, like-- Can I do dinosaurs? I can be a dinosaur, right? That's a new thing I can be, right?
Matt: Up to a certain point.
Liam: What if you were a scorpion, with a dragonborn tail sliding around and a gnome on your front leg and a--
Marisha: Well here's, oh wait wait, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, hang on, hang on, hang on, this might be crazy-- wonder what would happen if I drank that weird yellowish potion? While I'm a monster?
Laura: No, It could be poison, though.
Marisha: But I'm wondering if you can, like, if I can transform into a monster and then you with Polymorph can maybe just transform.
Orion: Stop talking, stop talking! Hold on. (laughter)
Marisha: You don't have to snap at me.
Orion: No, no, no, you're brilliant, your highness.
Marisha: Oh, thank you. I mean.
Orion: I have an idea, I have an idea.
Liam: We're off the rails, here.
Laura: Tell it to us, Tiberius, what's the idea?
Sam: Does it involve shitting on a bed? (laughter)
Orion: Eventually, actually, yes.
Taliesin: Aren't you empty yet?
Orion: This is what's going to happen. As far as we know, they're all duergar up there, correct?
Laura: Mostly, except for the mind flayers. And another big monster probably, they might have--
Ashley: Which I saw in a vision. I think that's what's controlling them
Laura: Oh no, that's K'varn. No, no, no, he's at the other one.
Ashley: Sorry, read it wrong.
Orion: This is what will happen. Those who can go stealth, we will creep up there. I will go invisible myself. I will be in front. You closely behind me.
Sam: He has a name.
Orion: Vax. There we go. You closely behind me, and whoever else can stealth follows suit. I will cast Alter Self and turn myself into their god.
Sam: Their god?
All: K'varn?
Marisha: But you don't know what he looks like.
Laura: Oh, or into that other thingie.
Orion: I absolutely know what he looks like.
Matt: You mean Laduguer?
Orion: We just saw his statue.
Marisha: Well. that's not K'varn though.
Orion: But that's who they worship. As I give my, whatever the hell I come up with to say at that particular time--
Sam: Maybe you should think it first, think it through first.
Orion: As soon as the mind flayers catch on, and I turn to Clarota, and I turn to Kima, that's when all of you will strike at them first. The rest of you will wait 'til I shoot off a couple of Fireballs at the duergar once they figure out we're full of crap. 'Cause I'm sure that might happen unless I'm super convincing, which I hope that's the case-- But I think that's our best bet to keep a certain element of surprise.
Marisha: So wait, so wait, are you going to be their god, and I'm still going to also be a crazy monster, as like your pet crazy monster, with our stealthy team, or just--
Taliesin: I think the only thing better than their god would be their god on top of a giant scorpion.
Laura: Ooh!
Marisha: Ooh!
Liam: I have faith in you, Tiberius.
Marisha: You'll be like Xerxes.
Ashley: Can I cast, 'cause I've been wanting to use Thaumaturgy. Which can make your voice three times as louder.
Matt: At the moment he would be speaking, yeah.
Ashley: At the moment he'd be speaking, okay, so let's do that.
Laura: Oh, that's going to be so cool.
Marisha: Some theatrics.
Liam: I love it when a good plan comes together.
Sam: So some of us are stealthing, you're being a big god who talks loud and is riding a scorpion.
Ashley: So maybe I'll tuck behind him, on top of you the scorpion, and then when you're getting ready to talk I'll just (whoosh) and then you'll-- your voice will be, you know, you'll have--
Liam: Yeah, that's good, that's good.
Sam: How about this-- so, just to clarify, are we all going up the same staircase, or are we going up two separate staircases, Vex and Vax--
Laura: I think we should just go up the same staircase. There's too many of them. If we split up we could just all die.
Sam: You don't know what-- there could be a million rooms up there.
Liam: We have no idea what's up there, but Tiberius has got a plan, I like it.
Laura: If he's the god, we just go in behind him as the god.
Ashley: What if we did like your Dimension Door? Is it too not very god-like if he's coming up the staircase like, hey?
Sam: The Dimension Door's off the table.
Liam: Tiberius, Tiberius. Tibs.
Sam: But don't use the god thing. But don't use the god thing until we get to the big group. The big thing, if you see a guard, don't turn into a god, you gotta see like more than five people before you turn into a god.
Liam: Tiberius.
Orion: Yes, Vax?
Liam: Do you intend to go up one of the other stairways? I believe this one by the entrance, the secret entrance we came in, will afford us the element of surprise. Do you think you want to go up one of the others?
Orion: No, let's go up that one.
Liam: And make a distraction, right? Your plan is to make a distraction.
Orion: Yes, of course.
Liam: You're a brave dragonborn.
Marisha: I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace on the party. Everyone stay close.
Liam: Who's the stealth party, not you, you and me, you.
Marisha: Well, all of us, all of us I guess, until we get upstairs.
Laura: Potentially all of us will be stealthed except for Tiberius, and you who is a scorpion, and you who's riding behind Tiberius.
Ashley: I'm riding on her, so I probably won't be rolling for stealth.
Matt: Uh.
Ashley: Just kidding.
Matt: You'll be rolling.
Ashley: I probably won't roll well, just putting it out there.
Matt: You hear in the back of your mind this subtle, soft, echoing chuckle. "You're all crazy. I like it." (laughter)
Matt: At which point, Kima, who's listening to all this with a look of kind of awe and curiosity says, "You know, for once? I actually agree with the thing." (laughter)
Matt: "All right." Takes her greatsword in her hands. "Lead the way."
Ashley: So you guys are stealthing up first?
Marisha: We all have Pass Without a Trace as long as you stand close enough.
Liam: Wait, wait for the inspiration.
Sam: I have some inspiration dice to give out, that I can give out as bonus actions. Can I give it out before we go into battle?
Matt: I would say like momentarily, right beforehand.
Sam: Okay, good to know. But I can't mass give it out, just have to give it to one person.
Matt: It's one of those things where it has to be in the moment when the adrenaline's pumping, I think, for it to last into the combat.
Sam: Okay, and do we want to send Clarota and Kima off through a different staircase so we have at least a backup plan?
Laura: No, no, no stick together. Too big of a group of an army upstairs to split us up.
Liam: Don't split the party.
Sam: In those action movies, when there's one guy who goes away for a while, he comes back at the end and saves the day. If we did that--
Laura: That's not going to be us!
Liam: We few, we happy few. (laughter)
Liam: About to go and do something very stupid. Let's do it.
Matt: So you are venturing up which stairway?
Laura: The secret one, the one by-- in the storage room.
Matt: All right. So. You guys--
Marisha: We got this. We got this.
Laura: Oh no, Grog fell over. Oh my gosh.
Marisha: It's been a good day. What are you going to say? Are you thinking about this? Think about something.
Orion: Okay.
Marisha: Start thinking about this now.
Liam: There are rooms up there.
Taliesin: What's the name of the god again?
Marisha: Laduguer.
Ashley: Can I take off my armor right now?
Matt: You'd become a soft target. All right, you guys all make your way up, and you're all squeezing into this tiny, tiny room. You're all shoulder-to-shoulder, essentially. You come up to the top area, there's a small box, and there is just a single stone door.
Laura: Check for traps.
Liam: Excuse me, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, excuse me Kima, sorry, sorry, All right, my hands are on the door. I'm going to check for traps on this door. I get a 21.
Matt: Okay, you take a moment and you place your hand along this stone surface. You find that there's a low hum to it.
Liam: Careful, careful, careful.
Matt: And you can tell that there's a small, almost like a thin whisper of string laid across the very top of the stone, where the wall meets it.
Liam: Of course I can, of course I can. I'm going to take care of this, hold on. Yeah, this is thieves' tools, correct? 26.
Matt: 26, okay. You come up and you find that this is a very, very fine hair trigger. This is actually a partial enchantment as part of a magical trap. You know that with the slightest hint of false vibration to it, the door shifting or hitting it in the wrong place will trigger whatever this trap is. And so you bring your tools up, you manage to place one at the base of each point at where this arcane silver thread lies across. Simultaneously, you take your daggers and place them underneath the thread at each ends and sever them both at the same time. The thin whisper of a string just slowly glides down and vanishes into a small sparkle of light.
Sam: Cut the red wire.
Liam: I'm just going to lay my ear on the door and see what I can hear. That is 21.
Matt: Hearing it, you hear what sounds like a low mutter of somewhere in the neighbourhood of ten to 15 low voices, and the slow, small shuffling of many, many, many, many footsteps.
Liam: Shuffling, you said? And if I listen for a moment, do I-- does it continue?
Matt: It, kind of, couple of footsteps, some talking, soft footprints. You can hear the scraping of metal--
Liam: And it's the only way we can go is through this door, right? We're all smooshed into this hallway--
Matt: There is a hallway this way.
Laura: Oh, so we stealth down the other hall, we try.
Liam: So I mooshed everyone away from this hall.
Matt: The whispers and voices aren't directly on the other side of this wall, they're just in that room echoing through, but you do hear a lot of people there. All right, so, what are you doing?
Laura: Well, well, stealthing down that hallway. Can we check for traps, check for traps, I look, I'm perceiving.
Matt: (laughs) Roll for perceiving (laughter)
Liam: 23 for Vax.
Laura: Oh, I get twice that, good. Oh, good, that was way better.
Matt: (laughs)
Laura: Ten.
Matt: Okay, no traps.
Laura: Yay!
Matt: You both glide your way up and peek around the corner. What you see immediately are six duergar all stationed in this hallway guarding what looks like two large doors and entrance to this main chamber. And they're all just standing there, weapons ready, looking around.
Sam: Wait, which is the main chamber that you just--
Matt: This big chamber here that you--
Sam: Oh, that we were listening to at the door.
Liam: Vax sneaks back to the group and motions Tiberius over, and Keyleth over.
Sam: We're doing this?
Liam: One moment, one moment. Lightning, Lightning, who knows Lightning?
Marisha: Are you gonna try to Lightning Bolt an entire line?
Liam: Do you know the magic of lightning? I've seen you do it before, I've seen you.
Marisha: I do know it right now.
Liam: You know it? Anyone who knows Lightning, I've seen it done on the battlefield with us, person to person to person.
Sam: I can do it.
Matt: Who is up once again, clearing his throat in your presence.
Sam: Hi! Scanlan here.
Liam: Scanlan, you know how to harness the power of electricity.
Sam: I don't wanna brag, but I'm a regular Ben Franklin over here. He's a guy, he's a gnome I knew once.
Marisha: Scanlan, can you and I focus our Call Lightning spells together? To Lightning these--
Sam: I mean, mine's so fricking powerful.
Liam: If Scanlan and one of the others does Lightning at the same time and it goes through that line, we could drop them all at once.
Laura: But that's noisy, they'll come out.
Liam: It's not that noisy, it's not like armor banging around.
Laura: I think it's gonna be noisy, it's not a stealthy attack.
Taliesin: It's a quick way to get rid of six people, though.
Orion: Oh, is that what we need to do?
Liam: There's a row of duergar around the corner, they're all in a line like Radio City, we just-- if I can get-- Scanlan, if you-- what about you, Keyleth? Do I remember light-- or do you bring it down from above? Tiberius.
Orion: What, what?
Sam: Do you want me to shock 'em?
Orion: Oh, I have an idea. Okay, I'll peek around.
Matt: Okay, make a stealth check.
Orion: Sweet.
Marisha: You have plus ten because of my Pass Without a Trace.
Liam: You've got six duergar in a row. Is there anything you can do that's--
Orion: 27.
Matt: That's when you see this long row of duergar that are all kind of armored and ready, guarding the front of this chamber.
Orion: I cast Watery Sphere at the end of the last guy and create a giant ball.
Liam: Wait, you're doing it now?
Orion: What does it look like, Vax?
Matt: Okay, so this giant water sphere appears. At which side of the wall?
Orion: On the last guy. Yeah, and I draw it towards us.
Liam: Vax is grabbing the gnome and tossing him out to the right, out here at the front of the group.
Orion: And I stop at the last guy.
Matt: Okay, as the water sphere begins to pull in. Saving throws, what's your DC?
Orion: My spell DC, 17.
Matt: This is a dexterity save? All right.
Sam: One at a time.
Matt: All of them fail! (cheering)
Marisha: This is gonna be cool, this is gonna be cool. It's gonna put them all in one spot.
Sam: They were already in a line.
Marisha: No, now we can electrocute them and they're wet!
Matt: There is now an entire clustered sphere of water that is containing a mishmash of duergar.
Marisha: Lightning Bolt!
Matt: Call Lightning. All right, so, as Keyleth, you step forward, out in the hallway, you bring your arm up and there's this small cluster of dark clouds beginning to form and swirl up on the top of the 20-foot hallway. As it swirls, you bring your arm downward, and there's a sudden crack of thunder, a loud blasting sound that echoes through the hallway. As the lightning strikes the center of the sphere, the water itself bursts as the actual cacophonous blast of the lightning loosely shakes the aquatic sphere. However, go ahead and roll damage.
Marisha: Do I get any more damage because of the--
Matt: You get an additional two dice of damage to each one of the duergar because they are contained in the water.
Orion: Yeah!
Marisha: So 5d10?
Matt: Correct.
Marisha: Do I roll for each one?
Matt: You just roll once, and that's across the board for all of them, and they are at a disadvantage because they are in the sphere.
Marisha: Oh, and they're at a disadvantage?
Orion: Yeah, yeah, because I'm like holding them up.
Marisha: All right.
Matt: It's really funny, because two of them rolled 20s in a row, but they're at a disadvantage.
Marisha: Nice. Not too shabby. So we have ten, 19 plus 18, bringing it to 28 plus three, 31 plus one. 32.
Matt: Okay. So the sphere explodes, the actual stone on the ground you can feel shake and shudder with the impact of the lightning storm. All but one of the duergar are blown apart and scattered across the wall Akira-style, just (splat) against the walls. One of them is still in the center of the sphere, now looking charred and burnt, and eyes wide open with anger and frustration.
Marisha: Scanlan, go!
Sam: I say, (chants) you ugly, you ugly, yo mama says you ugly! And I cast Vicious Mockery. (laughter)
Matt: He rolled a 14 vs the DC which I think is--
Sam: 19.
Matt: All right, how much total did you do?
Sam: Just a five.
Matt: How much did you do, total?
Marisha: 32, total.
Matt: Hold on. So as the duergar is currently held aloft in this aquatic sphere, half-charred and burnt with pieces of his friends floating in the water around him, he hears through this kind of warbling sound, "You ugly, you ugly," and he sees everyone kind of step in the hallway clapping with you, and he kind of looks around at himself, looks at his situation... and eventually just gives up and takes a big old gulp of water and drowns inside the aquatic sphere. (laughter)
Sam: Yes! I shamed him to death
Ashley: Amazing.
Marisha: (laughs) What a terrible way to die.
Matt: Good news is, you guys royally screwed over six duergar, one of which you shamed him to death. (laughter)
Matt: You have definitely, however, announced your presence at the chamber.
Liam: Vax spanks Tiberius on the tail and says, get ready to deity! Going stealth.
Marisha: I say-- I go, get on my back, get on my back, and I piggyback him.
Matt: You transform?
Orion: I do.
Matt: No, Marisha, did you transform?
Marisha: Well I'm piggybacking him, just now. I'm literally just piggybacking Tiberius waiting.
Matt: Okay, so Tiberius, you leap onto her back.
Orion: Mm-hm, and I cast Alter Self, and I turn to--
Liam: Scanlan, Vex.
Ashley: I'm going to cast the thing on him.
Matt: Okay, so you cast Thaumaturgy on him to give him a vocal emphasis, a roaring, booming voice. Do you stay with him or do you move back with the rest of the group?
Marisha: Oh, oh, Pike Pike Pike Pike Pike. What kind of animal would this god use? Would you know what kind of animal the duergar would worship? Do you know?
Orion: It's a religion check.
Matt: Religion check.
Marisha: What kind of animals he might like? You know, check out-- you know, animals.
Ashley: 14.
Matt: You have no idea. You know the deity exists, you don't know of any sort of animal, beast or creature symbolism that would befit a duergar god.
Ashley: I have no idea.
Marisha: I guess a scorpion, a scorpion sounds good? Scorpion. Giant Scorpion.
Matt: Keyleth's form shifts. As you see a bunch of arachnid-like legs sprawl out the side of her torso, her form condenses into a dark, chitinous shell as two giant claws form out the side of her body, and a giant poison stinger curls up from behind. Tiberius kind of holds on during the transformation--
Ashley: I'm going to go back, because if they see me, then they'll know something's fishy.
Matt: All right, the rest of you are here. So. You feel this kind of divine energy cascade around your throat. You can feel your vocal cords themselves are temporarily infused with some sort of divine presence. You've transformed yourself now into the visage of this duergar deity. Standing at probably a good-- what height are you going at?
Orion: How tall are the--
Matt: The duergar are about four-and-a-half feet tall.
Orion: So let's make him six feet tall.
Matt: All right, six-foot-tall duergar standing there.
Laura: The two of us get back by the other twin door, and get ready to bust into that entrance.
Sam: I'm with them. We're the stealth party.
Liam: I'm in fact nudging Grog away from this door towards the front towards Tiberius. I don't know, they're not that strong.
Matt: What are you doing? Grog says, "Which way, which way do I go?"
Liam: Vax kicks Grog in the butt and sends him forward. Go help Tiberius!
Matt: "I'm walking back for you."
Laura: Grog, don't do that. Not that far. Grog, come back, because if they see him--
Orion: No, stay in the corner, Grog. Wait 'til I say help me, and then come kill everything.
Matt: He looks like he's listening. Mostly. (laughter)
Marisha: Back him up. Back him up.
Matt: You hear shifting in the doorway from the front where you guys are. What's the plan? What's doing what?
Sam: Who's going in first?
Orion: Is this going to be the entrance where we're going in?
Laura: Yeah you bust in and be a god.
Marisha: Oh, are we busting in?
Laura: When you give it, we'll go in the other way.
Marisha: Fuck if I know.
Orion: That's your job. Bust the door open.
Matt: All right, go ahead and make an athletics check.
Liam: I'm simultaneously checking our door for-- no, I already did. It's unlocked, and untrapped. Never mind.
Marisha: Giant scorpion. Athletics. Plus my dex, I'm assuming?
Matt: No, plus your strength.
Marisha: Strength, that's pretty cool, though. 22.
Matt: A 22.
Marisha: I rolled a 19.
Matt: All right, the doors splinter open. The doors are actually broken off the hinges.
Orion: As that happens, I cast Light and I cast Prestidigitation.
Sam: Concentrate. Don't cast too much shit.
Orion: I can't hear what's going on. I hear some annoyances in the background as I cast Prestidigitation to make my voice louder.
Laura: No, she already did it. It's three times louder than it normally would be.
Orion: Oh, shit.
Marisha: So just keep focusing on your Light.
Matt: As you guys come bursting in--
Liam: Holy shit.
Laura: Yeah, there's a lot of them.
Marisha: Maybe do some Prestidigitation where you move shit around.
Ashley: Oh ho ho. What!
Marisha: Oh! Hello, everybody.
Liam: (Grog voice) I would like to rage.
Laura: (Grog voice) I would like to rage.
Laura: Oh, no. Basilisks!
Liam: What?
Laura: Those thingies!
Marisha: Oh, that's right, they have those pet basilisks. Remember?
Matt: So the doors burst open and you guys come through. All of the duergar stand there with their weapons at the ready. You can see in the back, on this raised platform, where the cloth stops, there is two thrones, at the top two duergar sitting on the thrones at the ready. You can see two kind of lizard-like creatures in the back on chained leashes. However, all of the duergar that are ready to strike as you burst through, take a step back, looking extremely confused about what's going on.
Orion: (shouts) Silence! All of you, silence!
Sam: We weren't talking.
Orion: Who knows who I am?
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Marisha: Get it. Get it. Get it.
Liam: Yep. Yep yep yep yep. Vax is quietly moving along the back wall.
Sam: Our door is open?
Liam: It is now.
Laura: Yeah we're going to try to stealth in and sneak attack them.
Orion: 16.
Laura: Oh god. Oh god.
Matt: Okay. The duergar in the front take another step back, looking both frightened and awed. The one nearest to you takes his hammer and throws it to the ground, and takes a knee.
Orion: Well, it looks like there's one saved soul at this point in time.
Matt: At which point two of the other ones nearby kind of look at each other and look back at the one who's on on the ground. They put their hammers down, and they kneel as well. At which point, in the back, you see the two throned figures stand up. One of which you can barely see in the dim light outside of your Light spell that's currently gleaming above you. This long, almost-touching-the-floor black, braided beard that drags right over this heavy-set plate of jagged black iron metal. A giant sword in his hand. "You're kneeling below this false idol."
Orion: Silence!
Matt: "This imposter!"
Orion: As I cast-- As I say silence, I blow a big plume of fire out of my mouth, and I cast Control Flames.
Matt: So the light (pff).
Orion: I don't cast Control Flames. I just do the Fireball for effect. I don't do Control Flames, because that's a concentration spell.
Matt: All right, so you do Fireball. Where are you casting Fireball? Or just doing it to do it?
Orion: Just (fwoosh).
Matt: Plume of flame. Roll an intimidation check.
Taliesin: You guys, what are you doing right now?
Liam: I'm moving along the back wall. I want that illithid.
Orion: 18.
Matt: Okay. Make a stealth check. Who else is going in there with him?
Laura: I go in and stand at the walls next to the door.
Liam: 32.
Matt: Okay, your stealth roll?
Ashley: I'm so stressed.
Marisha: I know! I feel like I'm going to have a heart attack.
Matt: So you rolled a--
Orion: 18.
Matt: Okay, you can see this figure-- which you are gathering at this point is probably King Murghol-- still holding his sword aloft, looks back towards his wife who's sitting in the throne next to him, who is just standing up kind of confused.
Orion: That's right, boy. I am Laduguer! You know, and you know your deeds as of late might upset my rest.
Matt: All of the duergar are now looking over their shoulders back towards the king and watching this transpire between the two of you.
Orion: (shouts) All of you, lay down your arms!
Laura: 32.
Matt: 32. You're moving in, everyone else staying in the hallway?
Ashley: I'm not moving. I'm like this!
Matt: As you guys push in further and further, the group that are kneeling move back in sheer fear and horror. At which point the king takes a step down off of the throne area onto the next platform, weapons still at his side and says, "Men, I've trained you. I've raised you. I've fed you and I've kept you alive."
Orion: And I don't care for you to finish that sentence! I cast Fireball. Right fucking-- Right on him.
Sam: That's an attack right there.
Orion: Of course it is!
Matt: So the blast hits him and a 20-foot radius that will grab everything in that radius. Including you. So go ahead and roll damage. 8d6.
Liam: It's all right.
Marisha: 8d6.
Liam: Heal me, Pike, heal me. Heal me in three minutes, heal me. This is gonna hurt. This is gonna sting.
Marisha: Oh, god damn. Come on, you got this. You got this, Vax.
Sam: You want it to be a lot, but not too much. (laughter)
Liam: A little less than 55.
Orion: Uh, 25.
Matt: 25, okay.
Orion: Oh, I'm sorry, 30.
Matt: Okay, good. So it explodes around them. You see all of them kind of shield themselves from the blast of flame. As it spreads out--
Liam: Wait, I'm doing the rogue thing that I can't remember the name for.
Laura: Uncanny Dodge?
Marisha: Uncanny Dodge?
Liam: No, it's something else.
Orion: Quickly. Quickly.
Matt: So while you're looking that up-- The duergar brace themselves and they have an innate natural resistance against things magical in nature.
Liam: Evasion!
Matt: So they all take the brunt of the damage, however, it does not do as much as you hoped to the group. All of them look hurt, but definitely not taken out of the fight. The two lizard creatures you now have a better look at, you do see it's familiar. They have numerous sets of legs, and though the chains hold them at bay, both of them glance up instinctually. I want you, Tiberius, to make two constitution saving throws.
Sam: Traps.
Orion: Yes.
Liam: DM. Evasion, if I make a success I get half-damage, if I fail I get-- If I fail, I get half-damage, if I succeed I get no damage. I think I failed. I got a nine.
Matt: Yeah you take half-damage. So you take the-- What was the total damage on your Fireball? So you take 15 points of fire damage. So as you glance about the room now, you look over and both of these lizard creatures kind of look towards you. You kind of look back and forth-- there's a slight gleam in their eye. Suddenly you feel your form begin to tighten up, instant. You are considered restrained, which means you are at disadvantage to all your attack rolls and ability checks for right now.
Orion: Hold on, I still have a bonus attack I can do before that happens, correct?
Matt: No, this is as it's happening. Your turn is still happening.
Orion: I got it.
Matt: This is all kind of a fluid moment. Things happen as they happen until initiative is being rolled, which is now. So everyone roll initiative.
Marisha: Sneaky sneaky.
Laura: Oh, great.
Matt: All right, so, 25 to 20?
Sam: Natural 20.
Matt: Plus your--
Sam: Nothing.
Matt: Plus nothing for dex. Okay.
Sam: Oh, for dex. Plus nothing.
Matt: Okay, so 25 to 20?
Taliesin: 23.
Liam: 21.
Matt: 21, all right, all right.
Taliesin: Yeah. Sneak attack.
Matt: All righty, 20 to 15?
Laura: 19.
Orion: 17.
Matt: All right, 15 to ten?
Marisha: I'm nine.
Ashley: Five. Not to brag.
Marisha: (laughs) Big number five.
Matt: All right.
Marisha: I just noticed your shirt. It's really great.
Sam: Guys, tune in every week for this kind of intense action.
Laura: Unless we're all dead next week. In which case--
Liam: -- Mama put the coins on my eyes.
Matt: All right, that brings us to top of the round. Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: I'm going to hold off until-- I'm actually going to delay my turn until post-Pike.
Orion: Can I still yell out shit while this is happening? Even though it isn't my turn?
Matt: I mean, you can yell like one thing.
Taliesin: I'm loud and I've got range, so I'm going to let the room fill, and then I'm going to come in and get some.
Orion: As this is all going down, I'm going to yell, those who want to live, throw down your arms. That's what I do.
Matt: Okay. That brings us back to the top. Vax, you're up.
Liam: Okay, I use my bonus action to click my boots of haste together. And I tap-dance over to the illithid, and I'm going to use two daggers to stab him in his eyeballs.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: First one hits, it's 18.
Matt: It is a critical because it does not see you and has not acted yet this combat.
Liam: Yeah it is. So I just take my keen dagger and I shove it in his eyeball. 1d4 is two, plus--
Marisha: Feel like I'm going to have a heart attack.
Taliesin: We're going to be fine. It's nothing we can't handle.
Marisha: Nothing we can't handle.
Liam: 19, 28, plus 36 is the first dagger into his eyeball.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Second dagger also hits for a little less, for seven points of fire damage in his other eyeball.
Matt: All right. Gotcha. So the first one actually jams into one of its eyes. It didn't even see you, it recoils back, slapping your hand back out of the way. The other dagger strikes and just gleans off its shoulder. However, it turns around with its other eye and it definitely knows you're there.
Liam: I'd like to circulate my hands to kind of carve out the eyeball area. (laughter)
Matt: No, it pushed you off.
Liam: Yeah, okay, okay, it's all right.
Matt: All right. That brings us to Grog.
Sam: (Grog voice) I would like to rage.
Liam: (Grog voice) I would like to go to a whore house.
Matt: He goes into a rage. And Grog is going to go ahead and take his axe with the chain on it and throw it toward the first duergar he sees, which is right here. Throws it. All right, that is a-- That's going to miss. He rolled a four. Swings past. He's going to make an athletics check to see if he can bring it back. That he succeeds. So he throws the axe. It swings past the duergar, clangs to the ground, uses his chain, he yanks it back, catches it in his hand. His turn is spent, however. Next up is Scanlan.
Sam: I step into the room, lining myself up with those two pig, creature, beast things. In a line. Yeah. Can I also catch the king or no?
Matt: No, it has to be a line. It has to go straight.
Sam: Going for the guys. I don't want to scald you. You're already hurting. I'm going to go straight across the piggies and make them squeal with Lightning.
Matt: All right. At the start of your turn--
Sam: Oh shit, there's a trap.
Matt: No, at the start of your turn you come up and the creature looks over and you guys make eye contact. You weren't averting your gaze. Go ahead and make a constitution save.
Liam: Saving throw, saving throw. Come on, Scanlan, you lucky motherfucker! Roll high.
Sam: 17, plus what?
Matt: Plus your constitution modifier.
Sam: 19.
Matt: All right, so, as it glances over at you, there's a shine in its eye, and you feel all of a sudden your form, for a second, tense, and you shrug off the effect, untouched by it. Now, go ahead and take your turn.
Sam: I cast Lightning on the two beasts. In a straight line.
Matt: Okay, so you pull back and you unleash a lightning bolt. It goes streaking across the room.
Sam: If I can get the king, I'll try.
Matt: Unfortunately, he's just out of the line array, but it does streak across and blast both of these now visibly basilisks in front of you. You hit automatically. Just go ahead and roll damage. (laughter)
Marisha: Oh sweet, sweet dice rolls.
Liam: Let it rain!
Marisha: Let it rain d6s from the sky!
Sam: 29.
Matt: 29. One fails its saving throw, one makes it. So 29 damage to one, and 14 to the other.
Sam: And then, for bonus action, I inspire Vax with a little ditty.
Matt: All right.
Sam: (sings) I want to sing a song of inspiration, of inspiration! (laughter)
Matt: All righty, that's it. That ends Scanlan's turn. King Murghol's turn, now. King Murghol is going to-- It sees this blast of lightning streak past now, as it blasts, just barely passing in front of it, hitting both of his pet basilisks. Now seeing that there's, like, a full army between himself and the current intruders, one of which is visibly stiffening, he glances over at this tiny gnome individual, who now gave loose to this bolt of energy. Grabs his blade with both hands and goes running towards you with an angry-- but he uses a bonus action, quickly, to pull out a vial, pop a cork, chug it, shatter the glass on the ground. As he does, you can see his arms actually billow and grow extremely strong and thick with muscle.
Marisha: What color was the vial?
Laura: What color was the vial?
Matt: This was purplish in color. He then runs forward. And is going to take his turn, swinging at Scanlan.
Sam: As he does, I sing (sings) Dodge that sexy attack-oh white boy. (laughter)
Sam: I sing my-- what is it called? Counter-- Cutting Word-- no, yes, what? Cutting Words! And I try to distract him as he's attacking me. What is that, a d8?
Matt: A d8 off of his first attack.
Sam: Five.
Matt: Five. Okay, well, he rolled a 20, which brings it down, oh, a total of 20, which brings it down to 15. What's your armor class?
Sam: 14.
Matt: Oh. Second strike is a 13. Third strike is a 12. Wow, he just can't hit at all this turn. But, however, the one strike he does get on you, the sword comes down, streaks across the front of you, and as you're finishing your last, final note of that song, you take 18 points of slashing damage.
Sam: Okay, okay, okay.
Ashley: Where you at?
Sam: I'm fine.
Ashley: Where are you at?
Sam: I'm fine. I've got more than him.
Matt: That ends his turn. This brings us back to Vex!
Laura: That's me! I cast Hunter's Mark! Actually, I just transfer it, because the other one died. I transfer it to the king. And then I cast-- First I want to move Trinket over and-- oh no, I can only move Trinket. Okay, first I'm gonna cast Conjure Barrage. It's a 60-foot cone. So I want to see how many of them I can get.
Matt: You can, you can get-- let's see. That'll get everybody.
Laura: Can I angle it so I don't hit my buddies?
Matt: You can angle it in a way that will-- well, if you wanna get the king in it, you're going to hit these two here. And Grog.
Laura: All right, I'll hit them.
Matt: Okay, so, you will be able to hit everything in that row. So go for it. How does the effect on that work?
Laura: I roll 3d8.
Matt: All right, so go ahead and roll 3d8.
Laura: That was on a corner. Oh good! 17.
Matt: 17, okay. And what's the effect on the spell, like what do they roll against?
Laura: They roll a dexterity saving throw.
Matt: Dexterity saving throw. King makes his, with a 20. So he takes half-damage for it, or no damage?
Laura: Half as much, yeah.
Matt: Okay, so what was the total again? It was-- What was the total originally? It was-- what was the total?
Laura: The total? Was 17.
Matt: 17. Okay, so that is eight damage to the king.
Laura: Plus a Hunter's Mark.
Matt: Right, so roll the additional one on that.
Laura: Four.
Matt: Four, gotcha. All right. The basilisk also does not make its save. What's the DC on this?
Laura: DC. What do you mean?
Matt: Your spell DC. At the top of your spell page.
Laura: Yes. It's 14.
Matt: 14.
Laura: Oh, I did get a-- I didn't add my spell attack bonus! Should I have done that?
Matt: No, that's just to hit something with a spell.
Laura: Okay, cool.
Matt: All right, so basilisk in front makes it, so it takes the eight damage. Okay, the rest of the duergar, they do make their saves, they take half damage. However, with the spray of arrows that comes flying out of the front of your bow, you manage to take out five duergar in one swipe. The others ones remain, damaged but still standing. Also, now dexterity saving throw for you, Tiberius, and Grog.
Marisha: Natural 20.
Orion: 19.
Matt: Nice. So both you guys take eight damage. Grog fails, Grog takes 17.
Laura: I'm sorry, Grog.
Matt: "It's all right." All right, Vex, is that the end of your turn?
Laura: Oh, I move Trinket in, and I want to-- If I can get him to illithid, I want to get Trinket close, like kind of behind the queen. No, no, I want to get him near. That way he can flank.
Matt: Okay, all right. That ends your turn. It is now Lady Kima's turn.
Sam: Ooh, I forgot about her.
Matt: Kima rushes in angrily. She has to make a saving throw. Succeeds against the basilisk, as it glances past. Rushes forward, in combat with both King Murghol and the basilisk. However, as she goes in for King Murghol, screaming, the blade of the greatsword arcing across the air with a divine glowing energy, you see it aiming for the king, but then looks to her side and sees this dangerous lizard creature, recognizing it in a moment, she changes her trajectory and swings next to the lizard with her first strike. That is a-- that hits. And that strike does just enough damage. She cleaves that basilisk in two with her first strike. With her first strike, using the inertia, she turns around and strikes at King Murghol. However, King Murghol, seeing her come forward, takes his sword up and manages to parry hers to the side. Both of them lock for a second as he steps into her and kind of glares into her face. "Oh, you're supposed to be downstairs for playtime." Pushes her off with his blade..
Marisha: Playtime? I don't-- (laughs) I know, all the ladies are like 'ew'.
Matt: That brings us to Queen Ulara's turn. Queen Ulara is now standing over there with Trinket towards her back. As she instinctually does this, she goes ahead and reaches up, places her hand on the front of her robes. You can see this duergar woman with kind of long, reddish hair that she's let flow to the back, to the small of her back. She stands up out of the throne. As she puts her hand on her chest, her form shimmers, much like you saw earlier on Tiberius, in your earlier battle. She moves back to there.
Orion: As she does that, I try to Counterspell it.
Matt: That's a reaction?
Orion: Yep.
Matt: Okay. So let's go ahead and do the contested roll.
Orion: Contested roll.
Sam: That was almost the name of this show. Not as catchy.
Orion: DC equals ten plus the spell's level.
Matt: Okay. So the DC is 12. Go ahead and you roll that.
Orion: DC is 13. It's a third-level spell. Right?
Matt: Blur is second-level.
Orion: Oh, I thought Counter-- Okay, I see.
Matt: Yes. So, Counterspell. Go ahead and-- Oh-- interrupt a creature in process of casting a spell. If the creature is casting a spell-- third level or lower, it fails and has no effect. So, yeah, it just counters it entirely. So, the-- her form begins to shimmer for a second. All of a sudden, Tiberius, your attempt to go ahead and counter the spell, that burst of energy you're trying to put through the Blur vanishes. She looks back at you.
Orion: What do you think you're doing, lass?
Sam: You still trying to be a god?
Orion: I'm in that form still. (laughter)
Matt: Yeah. So with her sorcery points expended on that quick cast, she turns around for her main action, puts out her fingers, and you see these blasts of blue energy begin to rocket out from her fingertips, across the room, in what is a Chain Lightning.
Liam: Shit. He's got the iPhone out.
Matt: So, this'll be towards-- actually, this'd be towards you, Vex, Kima, and Scanlan.
Laura: All right.
Liam: Did you say Vex or Vax?
Matt: Yeah, Vex and Vax, both of you.
Laura: Wait, you're all the way over there.
Sam: Yeah, you're all the way over somewhere else, right?
Matt: Over there, yeah. Chain Lightning, man. It's a bitch. All right. All right, so. Vax, go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw.
Liam: Not good. Seven.
Matt: Seven, all right.
Liam: Can I use Evasion, or-- Uncanny Dodge or Evasion?
Sam: I gave you some dice. I gave you, I gave you some dice.
Liam: You did give me some dice.
Sam: It's not going to be enough, though.
Liam: So now I'm at 13, but can I use Evasion or Uncanny Dodge? Evasion is for area effects, Uncanny Dodge is--
Matt: Well, you've already used one for the area effect, the other one reduces the damage by half.
Liam: All right, Uncanny Dodge.
Matt: Okay, so you're reducing the damage by half?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: Okay, so instead, you take 18 points of lightning damage. However, both Vex and Scanlan and Kima all have to make dexterity saving throws as well. She makes hers.
Sam: Not great. 14. I have no dexterity.
Laura: 16.
Matt: 16, okay. So you took, was it 18 lightning damage, I said?
Liam: Oh, I didn't add any dexterity. I add a 9 to what I got, which means I'm at 22.
Matt: Just, you mean, your dexterity modifier? 22? Okay, then you would've taken half damage, make it quarter damage, so you take half of that even. So keep that in mind when you make your dexterity saving throw. So, that would give you total how much damage? So, it was 18 you took, right?
Liam: Yeah, and we halved it to nine. Five?
Matt: So, 36 damage to Scanlan and to Kima, and to you, Vex. 36 points of lightning damage. That ends her turn. Tiberius, you're up. So you, it's your turn now, as you're now on top of the scorpion still.
Ashley: It's okay.
Marisha: You're on top of me. I'm holding you!
Ashley: I got you.
Orion: Cool. This is-- there's still on the altar that's raised above-- and all that.
Taliesin: You've got a problem down there, to be fair.
Orion: Where we're at?
Taliesin: You've got the witch problem to deal with.
Matt: What do you got, Tiberius? Quick, before you miss your turn.
Orion: I shall miss nothing. I'm going to stay right where I'm at.
Matt: All right.
Orion: I'm going to snicker, and I will (laughs) hand out, put out my hand, and give my little ring a rub, and let out a Fireball from it, right where no one else but these buttholes will get hurt.
Matt: All right, so (laughs), I'd say probably a 20-foot radius around would put it about there.
Liam: (Tiberius voice) What is the Common word for it?
All: (Tiberius voice) Butthole.
Matt: So, as you polish off the ring and release it, the bead of red energy streaks across, blasting the floor, the secondary explosion, giant Fireball just bursts into the room, go ahead and roll damage on that.
Orion: Six, I have enough, there's a four, this is terrible, help me count, eight.
Marisha: Okay, well, we have all these twos. Let's put the twos side by side. That's fun. Uh-huh.
Laura: Your turns are taking so long!
Orion: 18. 23!
Matt: 23. Okay. The rest of these duergar detonate, blasted away out of play. Just, their bodies go thrown against the walls and the various pillars in the room. There's two pillars over there, they're kind of holding the ceiling up. The rest of them just go thrown about the room. The queen takes a bit of the damage, but seems to shrug off most of it.
Orion: I'm going to spend two sorcerer points. And I'm going to reach out my hand, and I'm going to form an ice knife and-- where is the queen, actually?
Matt: Right there.
Orion: Oh, very good. I'm going to throw the ice knife right there.
Matt: Okay. Right there? All right.
Orion: And I cast it at level two.
Matt: All right. So you get to throw at a target, though, right? Or are you just throwing on the ground to do the radial? Okay, so you take-- you form the ice knife, you throw it, it streaks across, slams into the stone floor and explodes, sending shards of ice out. Go ahead and roll damage.
Orion: Which is 3d6, because it's at level two now.
Matt: Correct. Saving throw, which it succeeds.
Orion: Much better. 14 points of damage.
Matt: Okay. Both succeed for half damage. So seven points of damage to each. All right, got it, cool. That ends your turn, Tiberius. Clarota, now--
Orion: How do you like them apples?!
Matt: Clarota steps forward-- Seeing the other mind flayer there, steps past and decides to go into a contest of wills against it.
Marisha: Contest of wills, staring contest, staring contest!
Matt: All right, this is intense. All right. Clarota is going to step forward and begin to intensely stare at-- you can see the air itself seems to shimmer and push, like a strange bubble shifting between the two of them at this connection point. Mind flayer, now one-eyed and seeping liquid from the side of its face, glares back at him. Fails his saving throw.
Marisha: That's right, he does.
Matt: This mind flayer suddenly diverts its attention away from Clarota and towards the queen. (cheering)
Sam: The old Dominate.
Ashley: Tight, tight, tight. (laughter)
Matt: That ends Clarota's turn. All right. The duergar would go if they weren't all blasted to hell. That brings us to Keyleth.
Marisha: All right. I'm going to go right for the king. You're coming for a ride, Tiberius. I'm gonna make a straight line. I have a 40-foot movement, pretty straight movement.
Orion: All right! Let's get 'em!
Laura: Oh no, Tiberius fell off.
Matt: There you go.
Marisha: Okay, I'm in melee, yeah?
Matt: Yes, you are.
Marisha: All right, I'm gonna do my full three multi-attack.
Orion: I'm maniacally laughing.
Matt: You are going to have a disadvantage on the tail attack, because you have Tiberius on your back and you're trying to make sure you don't hit him with your tail.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: So, first two claw strikes.
Marisha: Okay, first one, probably not gonna hit. 12?
Matt: No, that does not hit.
Marisha: Second one. 16?
Matt: Does not hit. Clink, clink! Off the armor. Tail strike.
Marisha: Tail strike. Two. Ten. Nothing.
Matt: Yeah, unfortunately just his thick suit of armor-- you're just hitting at him with the giant scorpion claws, but nothing seems to be getting through.
Marisha: God, you're so heavy, Tiberius, god!
Matt: You hear this clacking scorpion angrily (scorpion sounds).
Marisha: My balance is wonky.
Matt: Pike, you're up!
Ashley: All right, time for some healing. So pull me in there. I'm gonna do a-- I'm gonna do a Mass Cure Wounds. At level five gives, which I thinks gives-- thinks? Which methinks gives me 4d8? Plus my spell ability modifier. Okay, so--
Marisha: Get your heal on.
Liam: (Yoda voice) 4d8 you would give.
Ashley: Oh, so, 20. 20 points of healing for whoever would like it.
Matt: For everyone who's in the radius. Everyone but Grog, essentially, gets healed for 20 points. Grog's too far away from you, unfortunately.
Sam: Thank you, my love.
Matt: All right, Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: All right, I'm going to just get-- just step into the doorway to take a look. I'm just stepping one step. And now I'm just going to shoot-- can I-- I'm just gonna try and-- The minute I recognize what a basilisk is, since I've faced them before, I'm going to do my best not to look and take a shot.
Matt: Okay, so go ahead and fire with a disadvantage against the basilisk on the far end of the room.
Sam: Don't you shoot me.
Marisha: Oh, that was a pretty one.
Taliesin: I get 16 at my disadvantage.
Matt: 16 at disadvantage? That does hit. Go ahead and roll damage.
Taliesin: Nice! I'll be taking another shot, too.
Matt: Also, Tiberius, make another constitution saving throw.
Taliesin: Six points of damage.
Matt: Six points of damage to the basilisk, got it.
Taliesin: I'm going to take another shot, though. 16 again.
Orion: Ten.
Taliesin: 16 hits. This time I do 12 points of damage.
Marisha: 12 points?
Taliesin: 12 points. And then I'm gonna duck back around the corner again.
Matt: Okay. Cool. As you duck around the corner, you've gotten these strikes in, and as you're trying to-- as you finish your blows on the duergar king, Murghol, in front of you, you hear this clanking sound as Tiberius's now fully stone form falls off of the scorpion onto the ground, beside you.
Sam: Oh no! He's stoned!
Ashley: You turned to stone?
Laura: 'Cause of the basilisk.
Liam: We've dealt with this before.
Laura: Basilisk blood, we can fix it.
Sam: I think you pee on the body and it cures them.
Ashley: Can I-- I can't, I have to go--
Sam: Let's try it and find out.
Matt: The basilisk now takes its turn.
Liam: (stone Tiberius voice) Please, no!
Matt: Steps forward onto the edge. It's going to go ahead and-- it's gonna be for Lady Kima. It's going to attempt to make its stare at her. Lady Kima--
Ashley: Close your eyes!
Laura: She's smart, she's closing her eyes.
Matt: Lady Kima, who's currently in this blood frenzy against the king, unfortunately is not paying attention. Off to the side, the basilisk gets a glance out, which she looks at from the corner of her eye, she sees the movement over and has a hard time pushing through the stiffness as the gaze begins to take a clenching effect on her body.
Laura: Oh no.
Computer: All set, let's go.
Generated voice: All set, let's go.
Matt: Yes, thank you. Let's do that. Oh, Waze. Why's my phone on? All right, so, that brings us to the-- Oof, okay.
Liam: (computer voice) I'm sorry, I can't help you with that, Vex'ahlia.
Matt: This mind flayer, who's currently Dominated, steps forward and is going to attempt to make a tentacle grab against the queen. Queen Ulara manages to dodge out of the way, seeing this coming, and just backhands it, while taking a step back. Unfortunately does not cling with the tentacle. That ends its action. Yeah, unfortunately that didn't hit. All right, next, at the top, that brings us to Vax.
Liam: I'm hasted. I'm gonna try to go stealth again from where I am. So I'm stealth, 17-- 30. Okay. I'm going to scuttle along the floor and leap on the back of the basilisk and try to stab it in the eye while looking at the ceiling.
Matt: Well, at the start of your turn, it's within 30 feet of you and you can see it. Are you going to--
Liam: Not look at it, no, no.
Matt: Okay, so you're taking disadvantage on this attack. So you move behind, you're hidden.
Liam: 15 for my first attack.
Matt: Your first attack, that will not hit, unfortunately.
Liam: And second time, 19 for the second attack.
Matt: That does hit, yes.
Liam: Okay. Feel for the eyes, stab it with keen dagger-- Four. 11.
Matt: Okay. As you rush over, you take your first strike at the basilisk, you see it reel back and slap around its tail. You barely just get out of the way, and as you see its head turning around to attempt to glare at you, you instinctively take your offhand dagger and place it directly into the eye socket of the basilisk. It sinks past your fingers and you feel that warm rush of blood and gore against your hand. As you pull back, it just slumps to the ground. (cheering)
Ashley: We'll get you some of that-- we'll get you some of that blood. Blood! Basilisk blood!
Liam: I only moved ten feet. So who's stone right now? Tiberius and-- wasn't-- aren't two people?
Matt: Lady Kima is mid-effect and Tiberius is solid stone.
Liam: I've got Haste on-- If I've got Haste on, can I get to Kima? 'Cause I've got haste boots.
Matt: I would say, yeah, you could spend the rest of your movement doing that, yeah.
Liam: Okay, and I use my thumb to slide some of its blood off the blade and drip it onto her eyes.
Matt: Okay. All right. That ends your turn. That brings us to Grog. Grog turns and is going to go ahead and go raging, frenzied, against the queen. And a critical hit. (cheering)
Marisha: He crit?
Orion: Yeah.
Matt: The first hit, she's gonna go ahead and use her reaction to do Shield, it's going to up her defense. First attack misses, so two attacks miss now and the last attack is a critical hit, which is nice. So that's a--
Marisha: No crits for you! Crit happens, whether you're here or not.
Matt: All right, so that's 31 points of damage. Oof, that's a hefty chunk. All right, that ends Grog's turn. That brings us to Scanlan!
Sam: I'm next to the king, right? I'm near the king? Over there.
Matt: Yep. You're right next to him.
Sam: Okay. I just make eye contact with him and I mentally tell him that he really has the urge to try to do a headstand. Lay down his weapon and he really just wants to see if he can do it. (laughter)
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Suggestion.
Matt: Okay. (laughs) What's your DC?
Sam: 19.
Matt: All right. This is through the hand cone?
Sam: Through the hand cone, through the hand cone.
Matt: Okay. That will be a 20, unfortunately. Makes his saving throw. He glances back towards you with a look of confusion for a second. Looks at his feet and like begins to reach forward and then steels his mind and looks up at you angrily. All right.
Sam: Can I also, as my bonus action-- Who's around me? Who needs inspiration? Who needs inspiring? Who's-- yeah, oh, shit. I'll give Pike some inspiration, 'cause she's my awesome sweetheart.
Ashley: What do I get?
Laura: You get 1d8.
Ashley: Hey, thanks, man.
Matt: Next up is King Murghol, who's furious now. Both of his beasts have been slain and most of his men have been completely torn asunder by multitudes of arrows and fireball spells. He, now growing in physical form, on top of already the musculature he acquired from that potion, is going to make his three attacks against whatever is nearby. That's actually going to be-- actually, that's gonna be two strikes against you, Scanlan, since you just now tried to make him stand on his head, and one against Kima. (laughter)
Matt: That is a 15--
Sam: Hit.
Matt: -- a 24--
Sam: (higher voice) Hit.
Matt: -- and against Kima is a 20, that also hits. So all three hit.
Liam: Nobody puts baby in the corner. (laughter)
Matt: Oof, all right. So the first strike hits you for 21 points of slashing damage.
Sam: Still alive.
Matt: The next one hits you for 23 points of slashing damage.
Sam: No longer alive (laughs).
Ashley: You're no longer alive?
Laura: Are you unconscious?!
Matt: Scanlan falls unconscious on the ground from the two strikes of the king. The third strike back towards Kima, who's currently seizing from the effect of the spell. She's restrained, so he has advantage.
Liam: But she's got the basilisk blood in her eyes.
Matt: There's a process to undoing a creature into stone. To your knowledge, it does not seem to be having an effect. However, Lady Kima takes 22 points of damage. All righty. That brings us to-- Vex, you're up.
Laura: Oh, that's me. Every time!
Liam: I'm Vex.
Laura: No, you're not. Okay, I'm gonna hail, I'm gonna-- hail of arr-- no, yeah, Hail of Thorns? At level three.
Matt: Okay, at who?
Laura: At the queen and the illithid. So, I should've transferred my bonus action over to-- but I didn't, that's okay. That gives me-- I should've done this before, I'm an asshole, I'm sorry.
Liam: But what about in the game?
Laura: That gives me 2d10.
Matt: Additional damage to the arrow.
Laura: Yes.
Matt: So it explodes around, right? All right, so, fire the arrow. So, as your bonus action, you go and you grab one of the arrows out from the back, and as you pull it back you can see a bunch of these little thorns begin to grow and sprout from the actual shaft of the arrow. You release it and as it arcs across--
Laura: Yes! Natural 20! (cheering)
Matt: Against the queen. All right, go ahead and roll the damage for the arrow and the damage for the spell. And all that doubles.
Laura: Oh, awesome.
Marisha: (sings) All that doubles is gold.
Taliesin: (sings) Only shooting arrows.
Orion: (sings) In a butthole.
Laura: Yeah, all of it doubles.
Matt: The bonus at the end doesn't double, just the dice.
Laura: Oh, so, 36--
Matt: 36 points of damage. Yeah, plus the seven. And then it does-- it explodes? In a radius. And it does the dice damage, the 2d10, to--
Laura: To everything within five feet.
Matt: All right, so the mind flayer and Grog.
Laura: Oh, right, yeah, I should've hit the mind flayer with that arrow. No, it would've still hit Grog. Okay.
Liam: Grog is a tank.
Laura: They have to make a dexterity saving throw.
Matt: All righty. Grog does not make it and the mind flayer does not make it.
Laura: Yes!
Matt: All right, cool. All right, second arrow you can fire now if you want to.
Laura: Second arrow. I'm gonna fire from my flaming bow. I've got one shot on that left. At her again.
Matt: All right.
Laura: And that's a 28.
Matt: That hits.
Laura: And that's nine plus a ten, where's my ten? There they are. That's plus two. 11.
Matt: All right. You see flames begin to burn up along the side of her robe and she's looking really flustered and frustrated at this point. All right, that brings us to Kima's turn. No. She's made of hardy stuff. Kima currently is fighting this, is going to go ahead and release an entire-- all of her attacks against the king Murghol as he's right in front of her. She has disadvantage on that, unfortunately, because she is restrained. She's gonna make two attacks against him using Divine Smite, expending a 3rd-level spell. So that's 3d8 extra damage to each strike. So the first one hits. Both hit. All right. She's going to do it twice. That's gonna be 6d8 additional damage.
Marisha: Ooh! That's hot.
Matt: Oof. Okay. So, as Kima rears back, her first strike comes down and hits overhead, into King Murghol's armor, and as it does, it hits. The blade only goes about a few inches in, but then all of a sudden the blade heats up white-hot and actually buries itself an additional six inches into his shoulder. He screams out in pain, reaches up and grabs the blade and as he does, his hand actually burns in the process. She pulls the blade out, around and swings it down again, sinking another eight inches into the side of his torso. This time with a giant arc of white divine light into the side. He looks like he's starting to bleed out from the two of the wounds really heavily. The king is looking a little rough. That ends Kima's turn. Kima's going to try and make a saving throw. Kima pulls the blade out, and turns to stone herself.
Laura: Oh shit. Shit, shit, shit. He's still at like really high health, too. The king.
Sam: What, he is?
Matt: The king is looking a little rough.
Sam: You never know. He might just start doing a headstand. (laughter)
Matt: The queen's turn.
Laura: Oh no.
Matt: The queen looks over at Grog in front of her, kinda frustratedly, uses a bulk of sorcery points, puts her hand up towards him as he's pulling his axe back angrily. He fails his save. And he puts his axe back down and looks towards the rest of the group.
Marisha: Oh no! Not again!
Matt: Eye color glazed over.
Sam: He's so easily influenced.
Laura: No, he's under her control.
Matt: So that was her sorcery points, her quick action. She then says, "We're not gonna die this day alone and I won't die. My love, I'm sorry, but there's much more work to be done." And she raises her hand up and you see this buildup of green arcane energy at her hand. She turns it towards the rest of the group, faces it up towards the ceiling and releases this pulse of arcane, green, ill-looking energy that blasts into the stone ceiling. As it does, the stone itself disintegrates in a large chunk, and a glowing mass of seeping, hot, molten magma begins to pour into the room.
Marisha: Oh shit!
Orion: Where's it coming from?
Matt: It's now coming from right here.
Laura: Oh my god.
Liam: (sings) TPK. TPK.
Matt: So now, magma is pouring onto the throne room from above. The giant fall that is on top of the fortress is now peering into the room.
Sam: (high-pitched) Someone grab me and leave.
Matt: That brings us to Tiberius, who is stone. Clarota currently looks around and--
Orion: Hold on. Am I conscious in stone form?
Matt: No. You are a slate. You are a blue screen. You are Grog after the intellect devourer.
Ashley: Oh god, this is bad.
Matt: Okay. (laughs)
Sam: Pike, it's all on you, dude.
Marisha: Do you have water?
Ashley: I can create it.
Matt: Clarota steps back and grabs Lady Kima and begins dragging her back through the doorway.
Laura: Oh god, we've got to get out. That's a retreat.
Matt: Pulling her down towards the stairway. That brings us to Keyleth.
Sam: Keyleth. Keyleth. Get us out of here.
Marisha: Okay, okay, okay. I come out of the form. Yes, thank you.
Matt: It's a free action.
Orion: Isn't there a dead basilisk right in front of us right now?
Matt: There is a body of a dead basilisk on the ground, yes.
Marisha: I'm going to take Wind Wall. I'm gonna cast Wind Wall and try and wrap it around the lava column and try and contain it within the Wind Wall, cooling it down. Essentially making a tornado-like vortex around the lava.
Matt: Okay. For the purposes of this, I want you to go ahead and make a basic religion check.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: Wait no, not religion. For you it'd be nature. Just for the purposes of my thought, I think a nature check would be an interesting way to see how this plays out.
Marisha: 18.
Matt: 18? Okay. So, as you bring this gust of cold wind, swirling around, the column of magma begins to cool and darken as Trinket is like backing up against the wall and the magma is starting to singe the edge of Trinket's nails. It cools to a dark, black, kind of rockish color. And the magma fall ceases, but you can see parts of it breaking and beginning to break past that shell exterior. So you've slowed it.
Marisha: This isn't gonna hold for long! Somebody rub some blood on Tiberius, quick, and let's get the hell out of here! I'm just holding this.
Matt: Holding it there? Okay. That brings us to Pike.
Ashley: There's so much to do. I don't know if I should heal you, if I should rub blood on you or if I should go try to remove the curse from Grog.
Laura: See if you can get the curse out of Grog. Because if we've got to retreat, then--
Ashley: Can Remove Curse remove the thing off of him?
Matt: From your knowledge, no, it's an arcane effect, not a curse.
Ashley: That's an arcane effect. Okay, so, Grog might be on his own for a little bit. Okay. So can I heal Scanlan and then also rub some basilisk blood on Tiberius?
Matt: From your previous experience, it's not the blood directly. The blood itself has to be distilled into a specific alchemical form to reverse the effect.
Orion: We just drank the blood last time.
Matt: No, it wasn't drinking. After the battle, you guys took the blood, prepared it, and then used it as part of the recovery.
Marisha: Will someone collect some blood?
Matt: Okay, so you heal Scanlan. How much does he heal?
Orion: The king's almost dead.
Marisha: Do we want to kill the king? Do we need somebody alive to help us?
Ashley: Oh, 19, 19!
Matt: So you're healed 19. You're on the ground, prone, but you're conscious now.
Sam: Hi!
Matt: You look up at Pike and smile and you look over and see this large column of magma that's now cracking through stone and pouring into the throne room again.
Ashley: Is there anything else we can do? Is there anything else I can do at this moment?
Matt: No, this has been a heal, this has been-- no, okay, you can move, that's about it.
Ashley: I can move? Can I take anyone with me while I move?
Matt: I will say you can drag him. You'll be at half speed.
Ashley: Can I try to drag Tiberius away from the magma?
Matt: You can try. Make a strength check.
Sam: You're two feet tall. He's a dragon.
Matt: Let's say athletics, do athletics.
Ashley: Athletics? 19.
Matt: Okay. So, you grab onto Tiberius, you rush over after healing him, grab and start dragging him towards the entrance. At half-speed you manage to get him three squares, that's as far as you got. As you're pulling back, the king, as a reaction, gets one strike on you with his sword. That's gonna be a 19.
Ashley: Get outta here. (laughter)
Matt: Your AC is 20?
Ashley: It's 20.
Matt: So the blade hits you--
Ashley: I just flip him off. (laughter)
Matt: The blade comes down towards you, but with a flash of divine energy in your shoulder armor, it just gets deflected off the side and you glare at him out of the side of your face. And continue to drag Tiberius out of the room.
Liam: Now go home and get your shine box. (laughter)
Matt: All right. Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: All right. I'm going to step into the room, to give some cover. Right about, probably just slightly on the other end of this.
Matt: Where, over here?
Taliesin: No, like, next to Keyleth, like near Keyleth.
Matt: Oh, you're gonna have to go around here, then. This is a really harrowing place.
Taliesin: Okay, the first thing I'm going to do, is I'm going to-- I've got my ice shot loaded. I'm going to take a shot at the break in the ceiling and I'm gonna try and ice it over.
Matt: Okay, all right. So as you pull over, you go ahead and aim up with your ice shot ready. Go ahead and fire.
Taliesin: That's 20.
Matt: 20 definitively hits. It's not hard to do. Go ahead and roll damage and that will signify how long and how much it will stop. So just the ice damage. Not the actual bullet, it won't do anything. So just--
Taliesin: Oh. So just the ice damage
Matt: Just the ice damage.
Taliesin: Two.
Matt: Two. Okay. So as you blast up, you can see, as the magma's beginning to pour down again, you blast it and it immediately-- a spot cools into a rock and begins to slip again. You've maybe given yourself a couple more seconds. That may be what you need, you don't know. But that's all you got on that one.
Taliesin: Okay, my next shot, I'm just gonna turn to the king and just shoot.
Matt: Okay, go for it.
Taliesin: I'm also gonna spend a point for additional damage. And I'm also taking Sharpshooter for additional damage.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: That's 16.
Matt: 16 versus armor class will not hit, unfortunately.
Taliesin: Oh! Wait, okay, no, I just, I don't get the-- oh god, it's not Pathfinder, gah!
Matt: Yeah.
Taliesin: Okay, that's fine. I'm gonna spend my bonus action to take another shot.
Matt: Okay, so you're using your Action Surge?
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: Okay. So Action Surge. You now have two more attacks. Go for it.
Taliesin: 23, eff you.
Matt: That hits. (laughter)
Taliesin: That's nine points of damage.
Matt: Nine points of damage, got it.
Taliesin: Taking another shot.
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: This shot's fire, fire bonus damage. And I'm also gonna spend another grit point to maybe do a little more damage. 28 to hit.
Matt: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage. With the extra grit point you do two dice, right?
Taliesin: Yeah. I get a bonus die, I just have to find one. Oh, that'll do. That's 17 points of damage plus one point of fire damage.
Matt: Nice. Okay, so, the next-- the first shot fires, just ricochets off his armor and streaks across the room. You get his attention, though, and he looks back at you with this kind of wild look in his eyes, the muscles tensing. You can see the armor actually bending and twisting against his physical form underneath. However, the next shot blasts off side of his jaw, there's actually a giant gap now in his flesh as he looks back at you and you can see his teeth. And as he grits down towards you, now definitely intent on getting vengeance on that, the second shot (impact sound) takes off a chunk of his head. You can see the skull exposed on where you've now taken a piece of flesh off the top of his scalp. He's looking pretty rough.
Taliesin: Let's move it, people. And I'm gonna take like a step back towards the door. Just with what's remaining of my movement.
Matt: Okay. You can get back to there. All right. That brings us to--
Taliesin: Oh, I killed him, didn't I? No, he's not dead, damn it.
Matt: He's not dead yet. Not dead yet.
Taliesin: I know, that would've been so cool.
Matt: All right. The mind flayer, who is no longer dominated as Clarota took his attention off of that for the time being, looks around at everyone, sees the circumstance, the magma flowing down, and just grabs his chest and you can see his form blink out and vanish.
Orion: (groans) He peaced out.
Matt: That brings us to the top. Vax. At this round, by the way, is broken and has begun to spread, the magma has now filled this much of the room. And it's quickening.
Liam: My boots of haste are on, so I run-- I just dart right around Grog, around that column, up to the queen, while pulling out my keen dagger, I speak my mother's name, kiss the blade and shove it in, right into her collarbone.
Matt: All right, go ahead and roll for the attack.
Liam: So that's a two, but I'm gonna use Luck. I get ad-- 20.
Matt: 20 does hit.
Liam: Because of it, and because Grog's there, this--
Matt: Grog is not an ally, currently. You do not get Sneak Attack.
Liam: Don't get Sneak Attack, all right. Three, ten, then. That's the first attack. And the second one also hits, that's a 29.
Matt: All right.
Liam: Is ten.
Matt: Ten, nice. So the first blade plunges into her clavicle, she maneuvers out of the way to the point where it misses any vital points, but still sinks in. She looks at you angrily and you can see her dull white, ashy, duergar eyes flash with an intense arcane rage. As you pull the blade out, her eyes dart around with some sort of a plan, a thought process going through her head, as the other blade sinks into the side of her torso she spits out blood that actually spatters across your face. She pushes the blade out and you see her preparing herself for something. That ends your turn. Grog currently moves forward towards you.
Liam: (Grog voice) Wrong direction!
Matt: That is a 25 versus armor class.
Liam: Yeah, but Uncanny Dodge!
Matt: How many times can you-- you've already used that. It's once per encounter. Once per encounter you can use that. Next one is a 21 versus armor class?
Liam: Once a round.
Matt: Once a round you can do it? Okay, well never mind. So take half on that first attack. All right, so. First strike comes at you with a-- oof, that'll be 19 points of damage. Reduced to nine.
Liam: Yeah, okay.
Matt: Second strike hits you for a total of 15 points of damage. So 24 total.
Marisha: Could be worse.
Matt: And that's Grog's go. That brings us to Scanlan.
Liam: That really hurts, Grog.
Sam: With my knowledge of the arcane arts, do I have any knowledge that using my Dispel Magic spell would work on Grog? Or do I just have to try it?
Matt: It's a possibility. You know the spell that's been cast on him-- you use it. There is a chance, but it has to be a contested roll.
Liam: You could roll a 20.
Marisha: You could roll a 20.
Sam: Does it take my move to just stand up?
Matt: Yes, it does, unfortunately. So it's your call.
Sam: But I don't have to be standing to cast a spell--
Matt: No, but I would say it's going to be difficult, it's going to give--
Sam: All right, I'll stand up.
Matt: All right. You get back up. What are you doing?
Sam: And I will-- Jesus, is it better for me to get out of there or get the king?
Laura: Yeah, get the king. You may be able to kill him. He's on his last legs, probably.
Matt: He's looking pretty rough.
Sam: Yeah, but Keyleth is right behind him.
Liam: Do it. Stab him.
Laura: You can attack him with your sword.
Sam: I am a tiny, tiny boy. I can only do--
Laura: Do it anyway. He's at his last legs. It would be epic, Scanlan.
Matt: What do you got? Go ahead, quick. Magma's pouring through.
Sam: Okay, I swing my Singing Dawnblade at him. (laughs) I have a dawn blade. It's just so lame though! It's so weak!
Matt: Okay, so. Go ahead and roll for an attack, d20.
Sam: A natural 20. (cheering)
Marisha: We said he could roll a 20! We called it! Who called it? We called it.
Matt: So, roll the dice.
Sam: So that's eight.
Matt: You rolled an eight. Times two, that's 16, plus whatever the bonus damage is for the sword.
Sam: Plus seven. Plus the dawn blade gets another bonus attack at disadvantage.
Matt: It does. So, you strike with a critical hit, doing-- let's see, that's eight, 16, plus seven, 23 points of damage, go ahead and roll for a second attack.
Sam: I've never hit anyone with a sword before! Five.
Ashley: Can I give him a War God's Blessing and give him a plus ten?
Matt: You can.
Ashley: All right, plus ten, so fifteen.
Matt: So what's your total? You rolled a five, plus--
Sam: Five plus-- ten-- I don't know, what am I adding? I've never used a sword before!
Matt: Add your proficiency modifier, which is four, plus your strength modifier, so that's five to that, which is ten, makes it 20, which hits! Roll damage on the attack. (cheering)
Marisha: Kill him, kill him!
Sam: Six!
Matt: Six points of damage. All right, six on that plus your strength, which is one. Seven. Plus the dawn blade, which is-- that's eight. So that's eight damage on top of the 23. How do you want to do this? (cheering)
Sam: I-- as I draw back the blade, I say, oh! You should've stood on your head! And I lop it off.
Matt: So. As you say that, you-- the blade vibrates to the sound of your voice, like the echoing of a song of Scanlan behind yours in almost a chorus out of nowhere. The blade streaks through the air, coming down, slitting across the back of his Achilles' tendon. He instinctually falls to one knee, which is kind of the height level for you. As you do, you bring the blade around with a flourish and take Murghol's head off his shoulders. It spins, tumbles to the ground, and rolls across the floor into the magma. Blackened beard curling back as the rest of his face is melted away by the lava, which is now pouring pretty heavily into this room.
Sam: (sings) Scanlan make you feel good!
Matt: All right. So that's your action. And your movement. And your bonus action. No, you did your bonus action to do the extra attack.
Sam: Oh! Great, great. I don't know how to use swords!
Matt: All right, so. That's the end of your turn. Wow! You used a sword! And got a kill! On a boss!
Sam: Yay!
Ashley: Good job, Scanlan!
Matt: All right, King Murghol's turn would be now, but he's on the ground. Vex?
Laura: I call Trinket back. Get him away from that lava. I run past, 'cause I can't-- can I see? Do I have an angle or is it being blocked by molten tornado?
Matt: You-- it's completely blocked right now.
Laura: Can I run across behind it?
Matt: Through here?
Laura: Yeah. Is that magmous right now?
Matt: Yeah, it is. It's still pouring! She slowed it down, but it's still breaking through and pouring out slower. It would be even bigger if they hadn't slowed it.
Laura: Okay, then well, maybe I won't run in that direction. I run in the other direction and down-- yeah. So I can see.
Matt: Go for it. Roll for an attack.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: First attack.
Laura: First attack is (sings) 20. No. 19.
Matt: Hits.
Laura: Yes! Okay. 14.
Matt: 14 points of damage.
Laura: Second attack is-- Second attack is (sings) 21!
Matt: Hits. Roll damage on that.
Laura: What's that? 12?
Matt: 12 to hit?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Or 12 damage?
Laura: 12 damage.
Matt: All right, 12 damage.
Laura: Oh, um. Hunter's Mark. Damn it. Bonus action!
Matt: Yep. All right, so both arrows (impact sounds). One clips her in the leg, and the other embeds itself in her abdomen. You see she grabs for it. She's looking really rough. Next is Kima. Kima's stone. It's now the queen's turn. She looks over at you who's stabbed her, the arrows in her abdomen, and she looks up at Grog and says, (sighs) "We've got business elsewhere." And she reaches out and touches Grog. Both of them blink out, Dimension Door.
Sam: We've lost Grog again!
Matt: A very familiar purplish color as you've seen you cast it, they Dimension Door out of the entire vicinity.
Sam: Son of a--
Marisha: This is the second time we've lost Grog.
Matt: At which point, the stone rocks crack on the column and the magma now goes into full pour.
Laura: We've got to get out!
Matt: You guys have to get out of that tunnel. What do you do now, what's the process?
Ashley: We run!
Sam: Wait, we gotta get our stone friends out.
Matt: So, this is going into a skill challenge now.
Laura: Yeah, we all run out that--
Sam: No, we don't all run out, they're stone, we have to drag them out, yeah.
Liam: Who all's stone, it's Tiberius and Kima? Okay.
Marisha: Can we-- where's the magic carpet? Throw their asses on the magic carpet!
Laura: Grog has the magic carpet. Grog had everything.
Sam: Wait, Feather Fall, do you have Feather Fall?
Ashley: Before, before we leave, can I take some of the basilisk's blood and put it in a vial?
Matt: Okay, this will be the first skill challenge. Go ahead and make a dexterity check.
Ashley: Dexterity check?
Marisha: Oh, can we get the magic carpet now?
Matt: No, the magic carpet is in the bag of holding. That thing is huge. You carry that with you, you would be at disadvantage for everything you've been doing.
Orion: Oh, I see.
Ashley: 18!
Matt: 18, okay, so. I mean, you go over to it, and you manage to gather up into your wine skin a little bit of basilisk's blood, best you can. The magma pulls close to you and you manage to just take six points of fire damage from just the general heat of the magma now pouring into the room. It's spilling out and now just continuing to fill the rest of this chamber.
Liam: I shout to Percy, come, Tiberius, now!
Taliesin: We pick him up.
Matt: Both of you guys make an athletics check.
Sam: Oh, it's not a strength check?
Matt: For this, this is just an athletics to pull them all off.
Liam: 19.
Taliesin: 17.
Matt: Okay. You guys grab and pull Tiberius out of the room. It takes the two of you to heft him over. You manage to pull him out of the way, that works out well. Down the stairway, all right. We don't need the video for this, we're just going to do this visually. So, you guys manage to bring Tiberius down the stairway. What are you doing, Scanlan?
Sam: I'm unfurling my Bull's Strength scroll and reading it so I get a plus five to strength? Is that a thing?
Matt: All right, so that's Enhance Ability. So you go ahead and give yourself Enhance Ability. Your strength is now-- you have advantage on all of your strength checks.
Sam: Okay, and I start to help, who was pushing Kima? I'm gonna help push Kima out.
Laura: Oh wait, no! Wait, didn't Clarota take Kima?
Matt: No, Clarota pulled Kima out of the room.
Laura: Oh, so we're all fucking fine, let's just get out.
Matt: So you guys are fine.
Marisha: I go ahead and on our way out I cast Create Water, and I kinda just use my air ability and make a mist to try and like mist the lava that's coming towards us.
Matt: Okay. You do, but the magma's so intense and this has filled so much of the room now that you get a localized area. The rest of it just kinda flows around and continues to fill the space. All right, so. All of you guys make a dexterity check to try to get down quickly. Go for it.
Ashley: Can I make another one?
Matt: Yes, everyone makes one.
Taliesin: Natural 20.
Liam: Natural 20.
Orion: (hoarsely) I rolled a 19!
Marisha: 20.
Sam: (sings) Seven!
Ashley: Four!
Laura: Do I get to roll twice 'cause of terrain?
Matt: Because of-- yes you do.
Sam: Do I get my Enhance Ability?
Matt: Not for this one.
Orion: I would like to note that I am frozen like this.
Matt: Okay, Tiberius is.
Laura: 29.
Matt: Okay, gotcha. So, Pike and Scanlan, both of you guys are, unfortunately 'cause you're smaller and your legs are moving, you guys rush down the stairway and curl around. As the rest of you make your way to the door, which is currently closed, you are all kinda gathered at the exterior of that hidden doorway. It's currently dark and held shut on where you guys entered. However, you two, the magma's now reached the stairway. It's beginning to pour down off the top, and it manages to catch the two of you. You guys each take five points of heat damage from the magma's proximity.
Liam: To the two ladies?
Matt: No, Pike and Scanlan. You guys make it to the bottom floor. The doorway is currently closed for the secret exit of the fortress.
Liam: Vax drops Tiberius' stone ass to the ground and starts feeling to get the mechanism of the door open.
Sam: Are we at the foot of the stairs yet, me and Pike?
Matt: You guys just make it to the foot of the stairs. You guys are now--
Marisha: It's a big stone door?
Matt: Yeah, it's the one you guys, the one you guys-- it opens up, outward.
Marisha: I just cast Stone Shape and make a hole.
Matt: Okay, as you're feeling around for the mechanism, Keyleth steps forward and basically the stone turns into almost a clay, and she just pulls it apart.
Marisha: Sorry, Vax. I didn't mean to, like, overstep there.
Matt: A giant glob of magma pours down and splashes down onto the ground, hitting everyone in the vicinity. Everyone down here takes 12 points of heat damage.
Liam: Ah, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot!
Laura: Hot hot hot hot hot.
Liam: All right, I'm picking up Tiberius' stone butt and continuing--
Matt: Okay, you guys push through the open hole that Keyleth pushed in, sweat dripping down your faces as the heat proximity to you is nigh-intolerable. You make your way out of the gate and now you have that giant magma flow.
Laura: Oh, right! Is the thing not-- wasn't there--
Matt: No no-- as you guys go and step out, the doorway that opened up, previously? Is what parted the magma flow. You pulled it open, so now it's just a wall of magma in front of you.
Laura: She also had created a wall barrier.
Marisha: I did create a wall over top.
Matt: You did. It's not there anymore.
Marisha: It was permanent!
Matt: It was permanent, but a perpetual flow of magma on it for a period of a few hours will eventually eat through a stone wall.
Laura: Can you cast it again?
Marisha: I can. Yeah. Do it again. Bam.
Matt: Okay. It's probably the last of that. You create a stone wall that juts out, once again blocking off the magma flow. You guys all step out of the room just as the main force of magma begins to fill the room behind you. Everyone make one more dexterity check to get out in time, as it's a small space and you're pushing out.
Sam: Natural 20.
Orion: 16.
Matt: You made nothing.
Marisha: "You made nothing." Seven.
Taliesin: Ten.
Ashley: Two.
Laura: Oh no. 29.
Liam: 12.
Matt: Okay. Everyone under 15  you, you, Percy, I believe, and Keyleth. The magma now, as you're helping getting your friends out, you're pushing out, you push Vex out-- Vex darts out, Scanlan manages to get out. As you guys are pulling Tiberius through, the hefty force of magma comes funneling down into the room and splashes across the floor.
Taliesin: Oh, that's a lot of dice.
Matt: That is 18 points of heat damage.
Liam: Vax is unconscious.
Marisha: 18 points?
Matt: As you're pushing through, Vax, you fall unconscious as the magma is currently lapping at the back of your leg. The rest of you begin pushing out as you begin to realize that your half-elf friend is currently melting in a pool of magma.
Ashley: Can I grab him? Can I grab him out?
Matt: Go ahead and make a strength check. This is strength at this point, this is pure adrenaline pushing through.
Ashley: 12!
Matt: 12. You manage to start pulling him up through the hole that Keyleth made.
Taliesin: I'm going to assist, I'm pulling out-- I'm doing another ice shot to try and cool off the magma around him.
Laura: I send Trinket up, to like, pull him.
Matt: Before you get to that point, as you're readying for it, 'cause it's a small space-- as you're pulling it, giant bear claws come over and latch onto the back of Vax's armor. The grizzly bear begins to tense, pulling back. Makes a strength check. That'll do it. Both of you manage to pull you out. You take an additional bit of heat damage. You are now at two failed saving throws. Two failed death saving throws.
Liam: I am a centimeter away from real death.
Matt: As he pulls it out, you can see most of his foot is melted. And his right leg.
Sam: Aw, that's his best leg.
Taliesin: I pull a level two healing potion, just get it in his mouth.
Matt: Okay, you pull it out. At this point, the magma's beginning to fill up the room, by the way.
Marisha: Okay, wait wait wait, can I take my stone wall and like, close it off? We're all out, right?
Matt: You're outside of it. How long does Stone Shape last?
Marisha: Stone Shape?
Matt: What you used on the wall.
Marisha: I'm just-- I'm just taking it away.
Matt: Closing the wall?
Marisha: I'm closing it. I can do it again, I still have two more spell slots.
Matt: Okay, how many spells do you have at that level?
Marisha: Three.
Matt: Three. So you spent--
Marisha: One, so far.
Matt: One going out, coming-- no, wait, it's the same-- you haven't had a chance to do a full night's rest.
Marisha: I know. I was an animal all week-- all last game. I didn't use any last game.
Matt: That's true, so you used the stone form, used Stone Wall.
Marisha: I used one Stone Wall last week and I have two level five spells now.
Matt: That's true, that's true, you do, that's good. All right, I just wanted to make sure. Okay, so as you do that, you send up another Stone Wall. It blocks off the magma just as it begins to pour over and spill out into this vicinity. It'll last a short time, but it'll last enough for what you guys need. You guys drag--
Ashley: Can I heal him?
Matt: You can attempt to, yeah, go for it.
Laura: Anticipation.
Marisha: I know. C'mon, Pike!
Ashley: 24.
Matt: All right. Heals you.
Laura: Oh my god.
Matt: Comes to consciousness. You guys are about ten feet away from the base of the stronghold. Your foot heals up, but it's still burned.
Laura: Ew, get that away from me.
Matt: For the time being, until you can take some serious physical rest, your movement is reduced by five. And your stealth rolls are currently at disadvantage.
Ashley: Can that ever be healed?
Matt: Over time with some rest it can be, but right now-- like, you're healed up, but that foot is scarred. It probably spent a good six seconds completely submerged in molten lava.
Liam: Are you telling me I'll never compete in the roller derby again? (laughter)
Matt: Quite possibly. You all are just on the outskirts of the stronghold. You can see now elements of the windows of the top floor are beginning to glow with internal light, as the entire stronghold is currently filling up entirely with molten rock.
Sam: Oh, I left my keys in there! (laughter)
Matt: You're all resting for a moment, off to the side. Grog is missing. And you all take a moment to realize that somehow you all managed to survive this, mostly.
Marisha: Sort of.
Matt: However, you didn't find the vault, didn't find Kima's stuff, and a number of escaped individuals from this are out and at large. We'll end today's game on that note.
Liam: Percy, I need Bad News to be my other foot now.
Marisha: Yeah, you should have-- you need, like, a sweet pimp swagger now.
Matt: So that went a little long, guys. Thank you for your-- for hanging out, but that was an intense session. Some climactic moments there.
Liam: Are you sure you guys don't want to send in a bulette, right now?
Marisha: Yeah, or maybe, like, you know, a black ooze. You wanna do that?
Sam: Wow, guys.
Zac: That was fucking intense.
Matt: That was crazy!
Zac: Guys. Riveting. And exhausting. Are you guys tired?
All: Yes.
Zac: No dancing tonight, guys, get over it.
Ashley: Sorry it went late.
Laura: That went so long, I'm sorry guys.
Zac: No, they are happy that you went late. They want you to stay forever.
Matt: That was nuts.
Zac: So I wanted to make a couple announcements of people that helped out tonight. Not just donators, oh so-- I'm gonna read off a couple of people who helped out first and then we're gonna start off reading off people who donated to the charity. If you want us to read off who you are and your message to the Critical Role crew, you still have time to donate, 'cause I'll start at the bottom and work my way up. So if the mods could post the link to, you know, the command for Critical Role and you guys'll see there's a link there to donate. Donate to 826LA. Every little bit helps these guys a lot and it would be really helpful to the stream and the show. These guys have been working really hard and Matt puts in a ton of time and to show your support, go donate to the charity and we'll get to your messages. Okay, so first off, I'm gonna thank the_Duganator8--
Marisha: Yes! Was it the Duganator's birthday?
Zac: Yes!
All: Happy birthday, Duganator!
Marisha: (sings) Happy happy birthday, from all of us to you. We wish it was our birthdays, so... we're partying. Yay, woohoo!
Zac: Way to not use the copywritten one.
Marisha: (laughs) Yeah, way to not use the copywritten one, yeah.
Zac: Arislan and Alduin and JakeBoudreaux and Negihama and Duganator8 were all the ones that pitched in to buy dinner for you guys.
Marisha: Thank you guys, we love it, cupcakes! Happy birthday.
Zac: And then as a quick update for what's happening tomorrow, we have three performances tomorrow night. So tomorrow is Gather Your Party and it's kinda like our bring your friends, have a good time with board games and music and everything. So Indiecade's coming by tomorrow night to show off some new board games. And then we have two bands playing, Sonja Midtune and Bearwolf. And then we have the musical improv group that was here during the charity drive is coming back to do a performance, Robot Teammates and The Accidental Party, and that's tomorrow night, it'll be a lot of fun. So I'm just gonna pull up these donations and messages, if you wanted to see and start going through 'em. And we'll probably have more as we get to the top. So starting at Fifthdreamtoday said, "I love Critical role, kudos for giving to a great cause."
Matt: Oh thank you, Fifthdreamertoday.
Zac: Ravendreamer  "Cheers and godspeed to the bold members of Critical Role for supporting reading in children."
Matt: Thank you, Ravendreamer.
Zac: Voractin24  "A combined donation for Critical Role and for myself and my role group." Oh. "from AngelMitsu."

Zac: Sickwizard  "Every kid should know how to read, I love Critical Role, Matt, feel free to TPK."
Laura: No!
Matt: I don't try to!

Popeblasterfighter: "I love you guys so much and you guys make me laugh every time." Danmanmountain: "Thanks Critical Rollers. Great show tonight, happy to give back #23fu."

Marisha: FicklePicketickler, that's great.
Matt: Thanks FicklePicketickler.
Orion: Also lives in bonertown.
Zac: And one more, this will be the last one, SilentKagamusha: "Critical Role is why I am now addicted to and starting my first game of D&D." (cheering)

Matt: Good on you, buddy! Storytelling.
Zac: If anyone donates after and we go offline, I'll make sure these guys get the messages and they're aware that you donated. Thank you all for tuning in. You guys are killer. Killer show.

Zac: We're going to go offline and then come back up with the rebroadcast of Thursday and you'll see this playing throughout the night and tomorrow morning, and will be up on the website tomorrow, so thank you. Thank you guys.
Matt: See you next week.
Sam: Bye!

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to this evening's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy voice actors sit around a table and play Dungeons & Dragons. If you are returning, welcome back. For those who it's their first time watching us live on the stream, welcome to the chaos. So, before I begin, a couple of quick notifications I want to give you guys. We had our first subscriber giveaway hit before the show started at 4,200. It was LL1973. Turn the mic around. Oh, now you can hear me. Look at this! The magic of live. Live communication. You have a wonderful view of this fantastic midsection. It's delightful. There we go. Is that better?
Zac: Yep.
Matt: Velcome. So, welcome to Critical Role, for those who didn't hear me before. D&D, voice actors, you know the drill now. So our first giveaway already happened tonight for the subscriber count at 4,200 to LL1973. Congratulations. You're going to be winning a signed Player's Handbook of Dungeons & Dragons Fifth Edition, as well as a signed photo of the Critical Role cast. Our next one will be at 4,250, so, up to every fifty subscribers after that we will be giving away an additional Player's Handbook and photo signed by the cast. Awesome times. (cheering)
Marisha: Awesome times?
Matt: Indeed, very awesome times.
Marisha: Good times, good time together.
Matt: I think so, indeed. Also, as a heads-up to you guys, there will be no Critical Role next week because the San Diego Comic-Con is happening. Down in San Diego.
Marisha: We're doing a panel, aren't we?
Matt: I know, we have a panel, though. We have a panel Thursday, I'll be on the main Geek and Sundry panel with Laura at 1-2 and then we have our actual full Critical Role panel from 4-5. So if you are going to be there, come see us at PetCo Park on Thursday.
Laura: You don't need a badge.
Matt: Nope, you can just come and walk on in.
Marisha: Yeah, it is at PetCo Park, so don't get lost looking around the convention center. Because it won't be there. It's at PetCo Park.
Matt: It's the big sports stadium, which to me is a wonderful irony of us giving a panel about Dungeons & Dragons in the center of a giant sports stadium. That's right! Indoor kids. However, however, they are also filming the panel for those who can't be there. The panel will be on the stream the following day, I believe, so check it out there, after, with the rest of the Comic-Con stream coverage. It'll be fun. Yeah, so that'll be good. The week after that, me and Marisha are going to be out of town in New Zealand, so this means a two-week period without Critical Role main-story stuff, and I apologize, this is all stuff that got planned before the stream even started. We'll be at a convention in New Zealand. For those out there planning to come to Armageddon, please come see us, we'll be down there. It'll be fun for all New Zealand fans. Otherwise, the rest of the Critical Role cast that are available will be here and will play some other sort of game together and generally interact with the chat and have a good time until we return. So.
Marisha: We're working it out.
Matt: Yeah, we're getting the circumstance ironed out.
Marisha: Hi, Liam!
Orion: Hi, Liam!
Matt: We have Liam on Skype over here.
Liam: Hi, guys.
Matt: What's up, buddy?
Liam: Hi!
Matt: Liam, who's finishing up his vacation as well. As far as I understand, we have a--
Marisha: How's New Jersey?
Liam: I am deep in upstate New York on the Canadian border.
Matt: Slowly migrating into expatriotism. Don't go Canadian on us.
Liam: It's frightening to drive here at night. I can't wait to do it at two in the morning.
Laura: Yay.
Matt: Yes.
Ashley: I'm drinking out of your mug.
Matt: She is.
Liam: My mug? Here's mine.
Matt: On river time, there you go.
Marisha: On river time, what?
Matt: That is-- that's a mug.
Marisha: Did you instantly turn into a 64-year-old golfer as soon as you went there?
Liam: I'm on a river. I'm on a river.
Laura: I'm on a boat. I'm on a boat.
Matt: So that's going on. Other things we want to mention. We'll have a special presentation at the break today. We're taking a break from the 826LA charity for another special charity that has been running for the past week known as GameChanger: it's a cancer charity and it's been working in conjunction with SquareEnix this past week. To raise money for cancer research, they've been doing-- if you donate $1 to it they're giving away codes for the first Deus Ex game for PC and a lot of other fun stuff. We'll have more information and a presentation for you at the break. So be aware that's the fun charity we're promoting tonight, so if anyone has the ability to give, please do, they're an awesome charity. We're also waiting on Sam Riegel and Taliesin Jaffe, they're both fighting traffic but will be here shortly. However, let's go ahead and cut to the intro to give us a one-minute break, and then we'll jump right into this crazy, crazy episode. So see you in just a moment. [no audio] Well, while we get that figured out--
Orion: Oh, is this a podcast now?
Matt: Apparently.
Orion: (old-timey voice) Old time radio.
Marisha: Well, I think the intro--
Matt: Intro video's frozen.
Orion: Damn it.
Matt: Also, this is, as opposed to making it a surprise, this'll be our last game for a little while with--
Laura: No, don't say it, don't say it yet.
Matt: Don't say it-- okay.
Travis: If you say it, it makes it true.
Marisha: Makes it too real.
Matt: Okay, you're right.
Orion: Ooh.
Matt: I'll hold off, all right.
Liam: Unfortunately, Travis has to leave the show.
Matt: No, that's not true. Grog's ale still needs to be filled.
Travis: Smash.
Matt: Indeed. So we'll patiently wait, folks, pizza at the ready. Now.
Marisha: What's going on?
Liam: Is there a full table behind this computer?
Laura: Pretty much.
Matt: There is, yes.
Laura: Travis is directly behind you.
Liam: Am I in his chest again?
Laura: Yeah, you might be even in his face at this point.
Orion: It's pretty good, though, I like this better than the iPad.
Marisha: And we can see you more.
Laura: Can you still see Travis?
Marisha: Yeah.
Orion: Yeah.
Laura: Oh.
Matt: It'll be fine.
Orion: How can we not see him?
Marisha: Yeah. (laughs)
Laura: That's true.
Orion: He's a mountain of man.
Travis: I am Rushmore.
Marisha: Travis takes up this side of the frame.
Orion: I'm Rushmore.
Matt: If we're having an issue with the intro video, do you want to just go to the game?
Travis: We can do a live intro video.
All: (intro video music)
Matt: Grog! Goliath Barbarian.
Marisha: (crow sound) (laughter)
Matt: -- and we're done.
Travis: I'd been thinking that this had to happen at some point.
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: Boomf! I was being you, Tiberius.
Marisha: Yeah.
Travis: We could totally do a Brady Bunch.
Marisha: Ah ha!
Laura: Light!
Matt: That was pretty good.
Travis: You guys are on the bottom of the feed, right?
Orion: Right.
Travis: So if you looked up and we looked down, we'd essentially be looking at each other.
Marisha: Oh right, Brady Bunch style!
Laura: (gasps) Oh, no way.
Travis: Oh, hi guys.
Marisha: Hi, Travis.
Orion: Is that how it looks?
Travis: And then everyone looks to the right to look at Mercer.
Laura: No, yeah, everyone looks to the same--
Travis: Oh, we look right, you look left.
Travis: No.
Matt: No.
Matt: They look right. Everyone looks right.
Marisha: Everyone looks right? So if we're looking this way, "Hi, Matt!"
Matt: And I disapprovingly look to my left. There you go.
Ashley: Are we still on?
Marisha: Yeah.
Ashley: Still going?
Matt: Real-time Critical Role.
Marisha: We're still kind of confused.
Laura: I can't tell what happening.
Matt: So I figure if the intro video's not working, let's not worry about it. Let's just jump into the game and get this started. How about that?
Travis: Yeah, why not.
Matt: Cool with that?
Ashley: Wait, can we show someone that's here that's really cool?
Matt: What's up?
Marisha: Go ahead and bring him on?
Matt: Oh, well, we're waiting on the break, unless you want to do it now.
Ashley: Do it on the break.
Orion: So we have video problems?
Marisha: You can come say hi.
Orion: I'm Periscope-ing until we're not having video issues.
Matt: Well, as far as I know we're on camera.
Orion: Oh, we are?
Crew: Yeah.
Matt: Yeah, just the intro video's not working.
Orion: Okay.
Marisha: Oh, we probably could have been going for a while. We've just been like dicking around.
Orion: Bye, guys, we're live.
Matt: Ah, welcome to the chaos of live internet. All right, so let's--
Liam: I don't think we should go any more meta than it has to be.
Matt: Let's jump in, guys. Let's jump in. So a little bit of overview for those of you who are just joining us. At this point in the story, Vox Machina, this intrepid band of adventurers, misfits, whatever you must call them, completed an adventure through the Underdark, a very dangerous, cavernous--
Laura: Oh, Sam's here.
Matt: Oh, we're gonna let Sam in.
Marisha: Sam's here!
Orion: Yeah, he texted.
Matt: All right, so after completing this Underdark challenge, they discovered and managed to extract an evil artifact known as the Horn of Orcus that held great power and seemingly has a partner somewhere in the world that is unknown. But the one they have acquired is indestructible, as far as folks know, and it was decided by the Council of Tal'Dorei and Vox Machina that it should be sealed away and hopefully forgotten for the rest of eternity. The best place to do so came up in the conversation to be the city of Vasselheim, which is on a different continent far to the northwest of Tal'Dorei, the kingdom where most of the story as to this point has taken place, to be sealed in what is referred to as the Platinum Sanctuary, the oldest existing temple to Bahamut, the good platinum dragon deity. So they were given passage on a skyship to cross the Ozmit Sea to Othanzia, the continent that houses the capital city, Vasselheim. So the group gathered together, rode on to the magically elevated skyship, and are traversing the ocean carrying the Horn of Orcus within this holy container. Hello!
Marisha: Hi, Sam.
Matt: Sam has joined us.
Sam: Hi!
Matt: They found themselves over the ocean, suddenly attacked by a band of what seemed to be wyvern- and griffin-riding bandits. The battle took place on the top of the skyship, some of the magic being taken out, a few lives lost, but the party managed to persevere, take a captive, and continue on their journey, the Horn of Orcus and its container kept safe. And that's where we pick up and begin.
Sam: Can you say all of that again for me? (laughter)
Travis: You don't listen, anyway.
Matt: No.
Marisha: (laughs) You don't listen, anyway.
Matt: All righty, so as you guys have settled in, the Horn safe, you've taken a couple more days on this journey, what was told to be about a six-day journey across the ocean, six to seven days. Is there anything you guys wish to accomplish at this moment?
Sam: Are we in the air?
Matt: You are still in the air on the skyship.
Sam: Not much we can do.
Marisha: Well, we just-- so we fought off the wyverns.
Sam: Oh, do we have one? We have one.
Travis: Is the little magician halfling still being polite and brushing her teeth and stuff?
Laura: Oh, that's right, our little halfling that we--
Travis: Who you saved. Wuss.
Matt: Yes.
Sam: She's a mage, right?
Matt: That you saved. She is a mage, and she has also been bound, at the orders of the captain, so as not to cause any issues on the ship while she's there. So as to her future, after your conversation with him, as to whether or not she could work on this ship, based on the fact that their first meeting involved her and her band attacking and trying to murder his entire crew, Captain Damon was not too keen on the idea at the time being and decided to lock her up.
Laura: Oh.
Matt: So. We shall see her fate in the near future.
Travis: She's locked up.
Laura: Okay. She's locked up.
Travis: She's got tricks, though, right?
Matt: She has tricks, but there is an anti-magic brig built into the ship specifically for this purpose.
Sam: Ooh. Fancy.
Travis: That's all I needed to know.
Laura: Oh, that's good to know. I was going to pay you to put the kibosh on her.
Orion: She's negged.
Travis: Cool.
Matt: (laughs) So. I'll say that Percy is continuing to read his book. The next few days pass without incident. Is there anything you want to accomplish? Anything?
Orion: You said the next few days without incident? Cool.
Travis: Could I try to further my beard?
Sam: Oh, yes! Try to grow a beard.
Marisha: Yeah, his beard. Let's go for the beard.
Matt: Go ahead and roll another percentage dice.
Travis: Yeah! It's a d20, right?
Laura: It's a percentage die.
Travis: Oh, that's right, that's right. The two in a row. I remember.
Matt: Two d10s.
Travis: I'm learning. I'm learning.
Marisha: Yep.
Matt: First one and the second one.
Travis: Three. Eight.
Matt: 38. The little bit of peach-fuzz stubble on the chin of your goliath face begins to slowly grow. It's coming out colorless. It's almost translucent with a hint of gray and white.
Sam: Ew.
Laura: Ew.
Travis: I'm a Targaryen, baby. (laughter)
Liam: That's hot.
Laura: It's translucent, like--
Matt: A color is there. It's almost like fishing line is growing out of the bottom of his chin.
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: Ugh.
Ashley: Whoa.
Travis: Don't be jealous.
Ashley: Grog, it's sparkling. It's sparkling!
Laura: It's really creepy, Grog.
Ashley: Hey, I feel it. It's like sandpaper, a little bit.
Travis: Thank you. Thank you.
Matt: Keep in mind, goliaths, predominantly-- especially pureblood goliaths-- do not grow facial hair. The fact that this magical feat is even achieving any modicum of growth is in itself an arcane marvel, and who knows what detrimental effects this may have in the long run, going against your physiology.
Travis: Oh, crap. It's all right. It'll make me look really wise, you guys. Nobody will know.
Marisha: I have some beads. If you want, we can braid it and put beads in there.
Laura: Ooh.
Travis: I'm all about it. Beads and bells and shit?
Marisha: Okay!
Marisha: I braid Grog's beard.
Travis: Give me a staff and I'll be Gandalf.
Matt: All right.
Marisha: And put beads in it. And a few flowers, as well.
Travis: Wait! Ooh, weird.
Marisha: It looks nice.
Travis: All right.
Matt: It takes you a lot of concentration to try and get any sort of braidage through the about an inch to inch and a half facial hair that is growing from his chin.
Marisha: Looks good!
Travis: It's really tight when you braid it like that. It pinches.
Marisha: You'll get used to it.
Laura: Maybe you can cast Grasping Vine on his chin and grow it out.
Matt: What could possibly go wrong? (laughter)
Travis: Do it. Could be great.
Orion: I suggest against this.
Travis: I thought you suggest violence.
Orion: No.
Sam: He encourages violence.
Laura: I encourage violence.
Orion: I'm against this.
Ashley: Is it just violence?
Laura: So we're healed. We're healed, right?
Sam: Oh, days have gone by, right?
Matt: Yeah, you guys have rested. Days have gone by, your spells have returned to you--
Liam: Hey, DM, days have gone by?
Laura: Trinket's feeling good.
Matt: Days have gone by at this time. You've continued traveling over the Ozmit Sea.
Orion: Are we nearing the destination?
Matt: I'll get to that in just a second. Do you have a question, Liam?
Liam: No, not a question, but last night while Grog was sleeping-- I can see right up Grog's nose. While Grog was sleeping, I went and got a bit of rope from the ship and used my disguise kit that I have. I sort of frayed a part of the rope and spent about an hour using spirit gum to glue bits of frayed rope to Grog's chin into a small Gilmore-esque goatee. And he didn't seem to wake up, and I'd like to see how that worked out.
Matt: (laughs) All righty.
Travis: I'm gonna do a sleep check or something, right? I can't let him survive that.
Matt: For this, go ahead and make a perception check with disadvantage.
Travis: With disadvantage?!
Sam: Because you're asleep!
Travis: One. (laughter)
Orion: Get it out now.
Matt: You wake up the following morning and immediately run to the nearest reflective surface to check on yourself, and you have a glorious, dark brown, well-braided, mildly frayed, thick, coarse goatee braid. It goes about a good three to four inches from the bottom of your chin. And you are very proud.
Travis: I knew it! I knew it! I am a special boy. (laughs) (laughter)
Travis: Only this one strand is this color and everything else is white and translucent, whatever--
Orion: I think it looks good on you, Grog.
Travis: Thank you! I wave my head and it whips around.
Ashley: (sings) I whip my beard back and forth.
Travis: (sings) I whip my beard back and forth.
Matt: It stays taut on your chin. All right, so as you reach the middle of the sixth day of travel, the sky, which up to this point had been fairly sunny and clear, begins to slowly cloud over. The weather grows more gray, and the clouds themselves seem to cluster more into-- I wouldn't say a stormfront, but definitely a more gloomy atmosphere.
Marisha: Can I do a nature check to see if this seems to be natural or arcane?
Matt: Certainly.
Orion: Nice.
Laura: (sings) With her big fancy die!
Marisha: Okay, that's a 10 plus-- 20, total.
Matt: All right. Looking at these clouds, it is a slow formation, and they aren't moving at an unnecessary speed or seem to have any ominous press towards you. It just seems like the weather itself towards this northern continent seems to be of a colder variety.
Orion: I'm going to sense the weather, I suppose, because this doesn't look fun.
Matt: Okay. The weather is cold.
Orion: Ooh, it's cold.
Travis: So the weather outside is frightful?
Laura: Good call, Tiberius. Good call. I agree, it is rather cold.
Orion: I don't like this. Scanlan.
Sam: Oi?
Orion: Like we were discussing earlier, would you be interested in the still-standing trade of my Ioun Stone for your circlet-crown thingy?
Sam: Oh, you know what, Tiberius, I have been giving this a lot of thought and consideration. What's for lunch?
Orion: What would you like for lunch? I already ate.
Sam: Oh. No. No, I was done with the conversation.
Travis: Oh, good diss.
Laura: Oh.
Ashley: Oh.
Orion: Well. Keyleth, if you could put a little slate up for me, I'd like to illustrate something for little Scanlan. And perhaps his tiny mind can comprehend it. (clears throat)
Laura: Ooh!
Ashley: Hey, that's rude.
Orion: Would you, perhaps, do this?
Laura: His tiny mind is exactly proportionate for the rest of his body, Tiberius.
Sam: Well, not the entire body.
Orion: I'm going to walk up to the hull and be like--
Marisha: No! Write it right here! I throw up a slate.
Orion: Oh. (clears throat)
Matt: Okay. It's the strangest wall you've constructed, as up in the air on the ship that is mostly constructed out of iron and metal, there is little to no stone available of which you can sprout a Wall of Stone. However, there are weights set up on top, so what you create is less of a smooth Wall of Stone and more of a very thin, brittle shale wall that may function for the time being, but probably won't stand up for more than five to ten minutes.
Orion: I see. Prestidigitation. Some chalk.
Matt: All right.
Orion: You see, Scanlan, you've had this particular piece for over ten, let's say, matches or weeks. You have used it zero times. In over six battles, over the same course, using it zero times. (laughter)
Orion: I, being a sorcerer, have a special ability called sorcerer points, where I can do multiple spells in a single round.
Sam: Yes.
Orion: Which none of you can do. Other than monks, of course.
Laura: That's true. Brag about it, Tiberius. Just keep bragging about it.
Orion: When I can do multiple spells, like two, versus you, who can do one, that means that I can do one more spell than you can per round. (laughter)
Sam: All right.
Orion: And every round after that. One hundred percent. (laughter)
Sam: This is amazing.
Orion: Your utilization of the actual item has been equivalent to nothing. In the interest of the group and the use of items in general, it would be wise to switch it, because you have needed extra spells like Invisibility--
Matt: The shale wall cracks. (laughter)
Orion: Several times.
Marisha: I'm sorry.
Orion: Where my item would be more useful in general to you.
Liam: May I ask, is magical ability inversely proportionate to wisdom?
Orion: Oh, me?
Sam: Who are you asking?
Ashley: Is magical ability inversely proportionate to wisdom?
Orion: Absolutely not. I am one of the strongest casters in all of Draconia, and it only takes the strength of my charisma to do my stuff.
Laura: Oh. Everything makes sense now, Tiberius.
Travis: So are you saying you want what he has back?
Sam: (laughs) I didn't recognize you, Grog. Is that you?
Travis: It is I, Brad Pitt from Legends of the Fall. (laughter)
Travis: My beard of glory.
Orion: That is a movie.
Travis: It's an old bard's tale.
Orion: So, Scanlan. What say you?
Sam: Your mathematical skills have been quite impressive.
Orion: I don't like to show them off.
Sam: No, no. For a man of such low wisdom, you are proving wiser than I ever imagined. (laughter)
Sam: I will gladly make this trade with you. You have convinced me.
Laura: Hey.
Marisha: Aww.
Orion: Oh, wonderful. Thank you.
Sam: Yes. Yes.
Ashley: Hey.
Laura: That's wonderful.
Sam: All right. Hugs, hugs, hugs. (laughter)
Orion: (explosion sound)
Sam: Now, what does this thing do?
Orion: Now you can store up to three level spells. Three of them in there.
Laura: Oh, it's better than the Pearl of Power!
Orion: And you don't have to expend spell slots to do the spells.
Sam: All right. Thank you very much.
Ashley: Hey.
Laura: That's a good trade.
Travis: Oh my god, that was so good.
Ashley: That was amazing.
Orion: You can put three Lightning Bolts in there and it costs nothing.
Ashley: Oh, math!
Sam: All right, all right. I'm man enough to admit that he's convinced me.
Travis: That was so good.
Ashley: That was awesome.
Travis: I don't know what you wrote, but it looked good.
Marisha: Oh, man.
Orion: I'm sorry.
Matt: The Ioun Stone which you had taken, you place by your head and release. It seems to fix itself in the air and slowly rotate above your head.
Orion: It orbits.
Matt: Almost held in its own orbital gravity around your head.
Laura: Ooh.
Sam: Pike.
Ashley: Oh. (laughs) Oh, wow. It's like you have a halo.
Orion: It is fancy.
Sam: It's like a halo. Like your god has smiled on me, maybe, and said, "He's cool. Go for it."
Ashley: Oh, wow. Well, I don't know if that's what it means.
Sam: Well. You know, religion is up to interpretation, so I interpret it that way.
Ashley: It is very cool-looking.
Sam: Thank you, Pike.
Travis: (laughs) So casual, her god. "It's cool. Go for it."
Matt: (laughs) Sarenrae. The she-bro you never had. (laughter)
Sam: Sarenrae's my wingman.
Ashley: We cool, Sarenrae.
Travis: I can't breathe.
Matt: Many a cart hold that bumper sticker. All right, so as this conversation comes to a close, the temperature in the sky has gotten noticeably chillier. And you swear for an instant you start seeing what looks like specks of white snow beginning to drift from the clouds ahead.
Marisha: (gasps) It's snowing.
Laura: It's snow, Keyleth.
Sam: (sings) I'm dreaming of a white whatever-we-celebrate.
Travis: Festivus!
Orion: Festivus.
Marisha: There was something I should probably tell you. In this area of land, in Vasselheim, on this continent, somewhere, I'm not sure where, resides the Fire Ashari. Somewhere in the town of Pyrah.
Laura: What's that?
Ashley: Ooh.
Laura: What are Fire Ashari?
Marisha: Well, they're my sister tribe. They're a part of my sister tribe. I come from the Air Ashari.
Laura: Right.
Travis: Uh-huh.
Marisha: Yeah, from Zephra.
Ashley: (whispers) Fire Ashari?
Laura: So they-- oh.
Marisha: Yeah, so there are Fire Ashari. So the point behind the Ashari-- I'm not sure I have expressed this to you all in the past few months. The point of our tribe is we sought out the weakest points where the elemental planes start to bleed with our plane of existence, and these planes need to be protected, so our people have sought them all out in order to make haven there and be the protectors that we were all born to be. And as part of my Aramente, I have to seek out each of the headmasters and prove myself a worthy leader.
Travis: Ooh.
Marisha: Which makes me really nervous.
Laura: We've got your back, Keyleth.
Ashley: Oh, you'll do it. You'll totally do it.
Travis: Yeah. Yeah, we can burn shit for days.
Marisha: So I just thought, you know, maybe after we handle the Horn, maybe we can pop in. You know, since we're here.
Laura: Totally. You know, if you want to, Keyleth, when we go, we'll all follow your orders and make it seem like you're an extraordinary leader of us.
Travis: Ooh, yeah.
Marisha: Oh. That could be good. Oh, that sounds fun!
Orion: Oh. Good idea, yes. Of course, I will be your mage guard.
Travis: Do they make you burn things as a display of your abilities?
Marisha: Well, they kind of teach me new things.
Laura: Ooh!
Marisha: They kind of instill me with their knowledge.
Laura: So the tornado thing. You could be like a fire tornado?
Marisha: I could. I know!
Travis: Shut up!
Marisha: I'm so excited! But yes. Super nervous, because social skills aren't my strongest suit.
Laura: We've noticed.
Travis: You're a natural. You're great.
Laura: You're great, though.
Marisha: Oh, you guys.
Ashley: But it's very charming.
Travis: We gotta go there. It's fire everywhere!
Orion: (laughs) Oh.
Marisha: Yes. Yes.
Liam: Is everything copacetic between the different tribes?
Travis: Oh, good question.
Marisha: What? What?
Travis: Is it copacetic?
Laura: Are you guys friendly with each other?
Liam: Are they happy?
Orion: The tribes.
Marisha: Well, yes. Yeah, no, we're all happy. I mean, that's kind of the thing, where once a generation someone sets out and goes on the Aramente in order to come back a headmaster, and it's kind of like our once-a-generation check-in, if you will, to make sure everything's okay.
Travis: Exchange students.
Marisha: Unfortunately, the last person to go on the Aramente didn't come back, which happens sometimes. Yeah.
Travis: Like, didn't come back ever?
Marisha: No.
Laura: So, like, you could die?
Orion: Or maybe they got lost to the winds of the road.
Travis: Right, yeah.
Marisha: It was actually my mother.
Orion: Oh, goodness.
Laura: (gasps) What?
Travis: To which tribe?
Marisha: I-- we don't know. She left when I was a little girl, so I don't remember much. So I don't know if she's alive or dead, really, but--
Laura: Keyleth.
Travis: We did not know that.
Marisha: It's okay. It's okay.
Travis: Yeah, no bigs, right?
Laura: Yeah.
Travis: Just your mother.
Marisha: I mean, it's-- I mean. Well. It's fine. It's just. It's weird. I haven't seen her, so I don't know.
Sam: Awkward.
Marisha: I barely remember her.
Travis: Do you think there's a chance of when we visit this place, we might have to defend ourselves?
Marisha: No. No. I wouldn't think so.
Orion: Which means "of course."
Laura: It's not like your family, Grog. They're actually nice.
Marisha: Yeah, we're pretty-- we're cool.
Travis: Look, my family is nice, too. We just share love with fists.
Orion: Understandable.
Laura: That sounds wrong in so many ways.
Travis: It does, actually.
Liam: Keyleth, did your mother have to go alone, or does your tribe permit there to be help for you?
Marisha: I'm assuming it would be okay. We're pretty welcoming.
Laura: That's good.
Travis: Yeah, we should totally be there.
Laura: All right. We will go.
Marisha: Yeah.
Travis: And maybe ask them if they've seen your mom.
Marisha: Yeah. That'd be interesting.
Laura: Yeah.
Marisha: It's weird. There's this part of me in the back of my head that kind of always wonders if I'm going to run into her.
Travis: How old-- when was the last time you saw your mother, or do you even remember?
Marisha: I was five, six maybe, years old when she left.
Travis: Wow.
Marisha: So I'm the next in line.
Laura: (whispers) Wow.
Sam: This is heavy.
Travis: Yeah.
Ashley: This is very heavy.
Marisha: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bring the mood down.
Sam: No, it's fine. It's good to know this.
Marisha: I'm just letting you know that we're going to be in that neck of the woods, so I should probably--
Laura: Stop by.
Ashley: Yes.
Marisha: -- you know, go.
Travis: Absolutely.
Laura: Give a little hello.
Matt: "Land sighted!" A voice breaks out from the side of the ship's bow.
Orion: Ooh.
Matt: You guys glance over quickly to the edge of the skyship, and you see, right over the edge of Deera, what looks to be this ominous continent slowly approaching. Through the mists, the low clouds of this area, you can make out what looks to be a fairly heavily wooded and overgrown landscape. You can see dark forest peppered with a little bit of snowfall across the top.
Laura: My kind of place.
Matt: Occasional mountaintops and peaks breaking through the canopy of the distant forest.
Laura: Look, Trinket! Home.
Matt: Trinket looms up to the side and looks a bit chilly and shakes it off. At which point, Kima comes up and joins the rest of you. Puts her elbows over and looks off wistfully for a second and goes, (sighs) "It's been some time. Welcome to Othanzia, folks. It's an interesting place."
Travis: It is, isn't it?
Laura: We'll follow your lead.
Matt: She points off, says, "This forest here we refer to as the Vesper Timberland, and it goes for miles and miles and miles before bleeding into endless tundra to the north, so let's hopefully not travel that far." (sighs) "This'll be interesting." And she turns around and heads back down into the ship. As you continue--
Laura: Good talk!
Marisha: Why did she say that? (laughs) I know!
Orion: Who was that person?
Marisha: That was so weird, right?
Orion: Everywhere we go. It's everywhere we go. Why can't people be normal?
Travis: She's warming up to me, I can feel it.
Matt: As the ship slowly begins to descend, you can see, in the distance, from one of the various mountain ranges that break past the top, there is one singular mountain spire that tends to protrude from the center of the forest, about 20 to 30 miles off the shoreline of the Ozmit Sea. Around the base of this mountain, you can see, the closer you get to it, what looks like hundreds upon hundreds of stone buildings. You can see little details along the mountainside. Countless staircases are spiraling up this mountain in different directions in a chaotic fashion. There are large structures, fortresses, built into the side of this mountain spire as you progress up the top. And this city proper, which spreads out, I'd say, about a third larger than Emon. Layers of walls and walls and walls. This is probably the most-fortified city you've seen in your existence up to this point. Slowly it begins to bring itself down towards-- and you can see, as you get closer to the city, the walls vary in color and material. Some look recently built. Some look like they'd been constructed in the past 50 to 60 years or so from fine, smooth stone, using modern architectural techniques. Some walls look extremely ancient, partially crumbled and having to be refortified. You also notice the top of these walls are completely covered with what looks like these strange dragon-headed ballistae. These defense ballistae that are along every single row of walls. This is a city that is meant to withstand--
Marisha: A siege.
Matt: -- any sort of a siege or onslaught.
Laura: Does it look like it's suffered a lot of sieges? I mean, is there battle damage to the--
Matt: It's hard to tell from this distance. You're just starting to pick up details as the ship slowly descends into the city of Vasselheim proper. But from what you can tell, there are scars across some of the larger buildings. Some of the walls look like they have sections that have been knocked down and then rebuilt and then knocked down and then rebuilt. This is a very, very old, old city. Slowly, the ship descends towards what looks like a smoothed-out, flattened platform on top of some mill of some kind. It doesn't look like it's built for skyship purposes, more than it's been haphazardly put together to receive a skyship should it come to the city. But it looks like that type of travel doesn't come to this area too often. At this point in time, you can see now, the crew is gathering their ropes, they're getting ready to go ahead and lower it down. Captain Damon is slowly steering and shouting directions back and forth to his deckhands. The Scalebearers and Kima come up to the top of the ship, carrying the box that contains the Horn of Orcus, as well. As the ship slowly makes its way to dock on the top of this mill, Kima, who has all of her materials over her shoulder, says, "All right, so. It's everyone's first time here in the city?"
Sam: Yes.
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: Yeah, well. Keyleth?
Orion: I've never been here.
Marisha: No.
Sam: Okay. Yes.
Matt: "All right."
Orion: And there's enough in the interim for a short rest from us getting from there to the last day to where we're at?
Matt: Yeah, yeah.
Travis: A day's rest? All right.
Orion: Okay, cool. Awesome.
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: Tiberius, you ever been here?
Orion: No. (laughter)
Laura: Is it cold in the city?
Matt: It's pretty chilly as you come down. I mean, you wear furs naturally in cold environments, but this is-- the temperature's to the point where you may have to consider getting a little bit of warmer clothing if you travel too far outside of the city.
Travis: How do goliaths do? Not wearing much.
Laura: I have a lot of winter cloaks already in my--
Sam: We have some fancy cloaks, too, don't we?
Laura: Well, those are fancy clothes.
Sam: Oh.
Laura: But I've got winter coats that I bought for the group a long time ago.
Sam: All right. Pass them out.
Laura: All right.
Matt: So she pulls out the really nice, thick--
Marisha: Oh, that's right. We went shopping.
Laura: Remember?
Marisha: I remember.
Ashley: Oh, we went shopping.
Travis: We have three other fancy robes.
Ashley: We had a girl shop day.
Marisha: Yep.
Sam: A fancy. I want a fancy robe.
Travis: You do? It's huge on you. You want it anyway.
Orion: I'd have to take off my cloak, though, to wear that, right?
Matt: Yeah.
Orion: I won't wear one. I keep my cloak on.
Travis: I give you a colorful one.
Sam: I'll gird it.
Matt: We'll say you could probably put it over. It will just look a little chunky.
Orion: Okay.
Sam: I'm going to take a large fancy robe and try to tie it up-- to gird it so that it looks okay.
Laura: He wants a fancy robe, not a fur.
Travis: Be aware, we only have two left.
Sam: I'm going to gird my loins.
Matt: And you gird them well. You look like the tiniest Turkish wrestler you've ever seen.
Laura: Oh. (laughter)
Matt: It's kind of adorable.
Sam: Also, I'm going to cast Lightning Bolt into the Ioun Stone.
Orion: Yay.
Matt: Okay. So mark that down, you have a third-level Lightning Bolt saved. You still used the spell slot, but after you rest, it'll be safe inside there. Which is an interesting experience, you see him do this arcane finger wiggle in the air, and then he releases what is a burst of electrical energy that immediately funnels itself and vanishes into the stone, which is now humming with this low pulsing glow of greenish-blue light.
Sam: (whispers) Pike, are you watching this?
Ashley: Wow, and you're--
Laura: It's green? It's a green-- wait, is it like a diamond shape?
Sam: I don't know.
Laura: It's like a Sim!
Marisha: Oh, it's like a Sims thing.
Orion: It's like a little--
Laura: As long as it's green, you're happy, Scanlan!
Orion: But I believe it's white, right? It's a white stone?
Matt: It is a white stone, but the energy glowing off it is greenish in color.
Orion: Ah, there you go.
Marisha: He's happy.
Ashley: And you're so well-girded.
Sam: I'm girded and I've got a shiny head.
Matt: Eventually the ship comes to a stop. You feel a little bit of a lurching sensation as the ship suddenly halts its advancing. All the ropes get dropped off the sides. They start bringing what looks to be some sort of a haphazard crane also, in preparation for Trinket to be lowered off the ship. You can see, there's a look of-- I can't describe it better than anxiousness to Kima. She says, "If you have any questions about the city, just speak up and I'll do my best."
Laura: Where do we take the Horn?
Sam: (laughs) That's a good question. (laughter)
Matt: "I believe--" And she looks over the edge of the ship. "I believe our escorts will be happy to guide us."
Laura: Our escorts?
Liam: I'd like to do an insight check before we hustle off.
Matt: On?
Travis: Kima.
Liam: Kima.
Matt: Go for it.
Orion: I would like to look for any places-- oh, sorry.
Liam: I rolled an 18.
Matt: Okay, and what are you trying to glean off of her?
Liam: Why does she seem anxious? Does she seem different? Does her demeanor seem different, or does she just seem in a hurry?
Matt: You can probably take it as a little bit of being in a hurry, but you also get the feeling like-- there's a nervousness to her that stems-- it's hard to really tell where it comes from, but there is a nervousness to her.
Laura: Kima, when was the last time you were with your Order?
Matt: "Proper? That would be eight years."
Laura: Oh.
Orion: That's a long time to be out of Order.
Matt: "Of which-- we are about to meet them."
Orion: Sorry.
Sam: High five.
Laura: Do you get along well with them?
Matt: "Yes. Yes. They're just, well." (laughs) "You'll see." And she leaps over the side of the ship, grabbing the rope, and lowers herself down, as do the rest of the-- the two Scalebearers come down in tandem, clutching the chain on the sides of the box, bringing it down almost like a big Jacob's ladder.
Travis: (quietly) I love you.
Matt: Eventually, you all make your way onto the platform, and they're waiting for you. You see there's a cluster of well-armored men and women, wearing semi-matching gray tabards over patchwork and plated armor. They look like a really rough-and-tumble militia, but they all stand firm and as you guys walk up, they give a nod of respect and understanding. Amongst them, you see one gentleman, an elderly gentleman with no hair, completely bald, thick spectacles on the tip of his nose, wearing the same silver and blue robes as the envoys that met you at the Council of Tal'Dorei, the ones that are carrying the box. As you all approach, Kima steps out ahead and says, "Yonn. It's been a while."
Sam: Yonn.
Matt: The old man steps forward. "It has been, indeed, Kima. It has, indeed. And that's Scalebearer Yonn, if you don't mind--"
Travis: Scalebearer.
Matt: "I would prefer in mixed company the proper niceties of our presentation."
Laura: Oh, we're no proper company. It's all right.
Matt: "Hm. And you are?"
Sam: We are--
Orion: I'm Tiberius Stormwind, and we are Vox Machina. Everybody has names, too.
Laura: Hmm.
Ashley: I'm Pike.
Marisha: Keyleth.
Sam: I'm Ioun Stone-bearer Scanlan. (laughter)
Matt: He cocks his head curiously.
Sam: You can call me Kingslayer. I also did that.
Matt: "Very well." Percy introduces himself, as well.
Travis: I have a beard. (laughter)
Matt: He gives you the most curious look of all, which is hard to follow off of Scanlan over here. "And I'm to understand these are the bearers of the artifact?" Kima gives a nod. "Yes, and I think we should be on our way quickly." "Yes, yes, of course. Please. These are our escorts. Follow suit. We will bring you onward to the Platinum Sanctuary proper to dispose of this thing."
Sam: How far is the Platinum Sanctuary?
Matt: "No more than a 25-minute walk."
Laura: Oh.
Sam: Oh.
Ashley: May I insight-check Yonn?
Matt: You may.
Liam: Yes, please.
Marisha: Oh, so--
Orion: I'm going to look for any temples that might have a sigil inside while we're going through the town.
Matt: All right. Do you want to ask around about that?
Orion: I'll ask the Yonn guy.
Matt: Okay. Well, first off, you finish your insight check. What did you roll?
Ashley: What did you get, Liam?
Liam: 13.
Ashley: Okay. I got 15.
Matt: Okay. He seems stuffy. He seems definitely dedicated to whatever his intent is, but there doesn't seem to be anything deceptive in his speech.
Marisha: So am I correct to assume our plan is that we're going to march this Horn through the town? Until we get to the temple?
Laura: Well, nobody knows what it is.
Orion: Right.
Sam: Well, unless someone--
Laura: So we'll just be aware there's a huge envoy.
Marisha: I mean, we can only assume-- Yonn?
Matt: "Yes?"
Marisha: How many people in this city are aware of this Horn being brought here?
Matt: "Well, up until now, other than myself, you travelers, and the Highbearer Vord himself, no one else."
Orion: Hm.
Marisha: Highbearer Vor-- his name is Vord?
Matt: "Vord. The Highbearer of the Platinum Dragon."
Laura: What kind of man is he?
Matt: You hear when he mentions Vord, Kima twitches a little bit, and you remember Kima's official title is Lady Kima of Vord.
Laura: Hm.
Orion: Hm.
Sam: Her ex?
Travis: Is that her pops? Her pops?
Orion: Vonn. Yonn?
Matt: "Scalebearer Yonn, yes."
Orion: Oh, Scalebearer Yonn, that's a fun name. (clears throat) As we travel through town, if you could point me to any place that would have a sigil of arcane-ness--
Sam: Arcane-iosity is what he's trying to say.
Matt: "There are none."
Orion: Oh.
Matt: "This city, arcane magic for the most part, is not allowed within consistent practice. This is a divine, a holy place."
Orion: Ah.
Matt: "And the arcane tends to, ah. How do you say, when unwatched, corrupt and destroy from the inside. "
Liam: Oh shit, Tiberius.
Orion: No, I'm fine! He's talking about other people.
Travis: You don't have any arcane abilities anyway, right?
Orion: Oh of course I do, I'm a sorcerer.
Laura: No no no, right?
Sam: Ix-nay.
Travis: Wink wink, nudge nudge.
Orion: No, no, I think he-- sure.
Matt: "This here in Vasselheim, the cradle of faith, the Dawn City, of once all civilization and current faith once stemmed from. There is no way in but by foot. It is a pilgrimage, a journey for each to come here, and those that stay, stay of their own will and divine right." And as he refers to the guards, each guard you see now has around their neck a very visibly shown holy symbol of some kind of deity. Most seem to fall--
Marisha: We've basically walked into the Crucible.
Orion: It's fine.
Matt: -- into the realm of Arathis, Avandra, Melora, and a couple with Bahamut. None of--
Ashley: None of Sarenrae.
Matt: None of Sarenrae.
Travis: Or as Liam calls it, Sa-REN-rae.
Laura: The best one?
Ashley: The best, the best one.
Liam: Sa-REN-rae! (laughter)
Ashley: Sarenrae!
Orion: I'm going to take it you don't see very many dragonborn in these parts.
Matt: "No, and frankly you're making me a bit nervous."
Orion: Oh.
Matt: "However, as we ourselves are followers of the Platinum Dragon, we understand that it is dragonkind at the heart of it, the metallics, that bring life and civilization and order to this world."
Orion: Yes.
Matt: "Your color I find off-putting."
Orion: It's--
Laura: I've always noticed a fine metallic sheen coming from your red scales.
Orion: No, I'm of the chromatic nature, I'm a bit of an anomaly in my family, they're all of the metallic brand, I assure you. The Stormwind name runs true and wide throughout Draconia, but--
Matt: "I have heard of the Stormwinds, yes."
Orion: I cast Alter Self real quick and I turn myself into, I believe, gold. Because that's the red-- equivalent of red. On the metallic scale.
Matt: Okay. He gives you a curious look and goes--
Orion: I think that would be better for everyone involved.
Matt: "I would be mindful to not do such things so openly in public in the future."
Orion: Oh, sorry.
Matt: "Ahem." And he kind of adjusts his robe. "This way please, follow me." And Scalebearer Yonn leads you--
Laura: You look very nice, Tiberius.
Ashley: You look really great in gold.
Orion: Thank you, thank you.
Marisha: So wait, hang on, hang on, hang on.
Travis: What?
Marisha: Before we move on-- we're about to leave, I'm assuming?
Matt: You're stepping off the platform onto a staircase that leads off of the top of the mill.
Marisha: Should a few of us kind of like flank around and--
Laura: Definitely, we should all kind of surround the box, sure.
Travis: Like rooftops and shit.
Marisha: Rooftop shit, yeah.
Laura: Oh.
Travis: I like it.
Marisha: I can go eagle form and have aerial support.
Travis: I love it.
Laura: I can stick to the rooftops, I guess, try to follow along.
Travis: Overwatch.
Marisha: Overwatch. What's that? Yeah.
Laura: I'll snick to the rooftops and try to follow along, sniper eye.
Marisha: Okay.
Travis: Yeah, you two up top.
Ashley: I'll just stay right on the path.
Travis: Yep, you and me.
Matt: All right.
Travis: Smash hands.
Matt: All right, so.
Orion: I'll take the six.
Matt: Okay. As you--
Liam: I'm gonna stay with it but try to blend in with the crowd.
Matt: All right, all right. Go ahead and make a stealth check.
Liam: Yes.
Travis: Scanlan?
Liam: 23 for stealth.
Matt: All right, ah, if you wouldn't mind, Vex, making a stealth check as well?
Laura: Oh.
Travis: Overwatch.
Matt: Just to keep your rooftop activity inconspicuous.
Laura: Not disturbing.
Travis: We have a UAV.
Laura: Oh, well I rolled a one. So that's lovely.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Are you flying up above?
Marisha: Yeah, I'm going eagle.
Travis: Don't you have advantage?
Laura: Do I have advantage in-- no.
Orion: And I'm taking up the rear, following behind.
Matt: No. Not in this terrain, unfortunately.
Ashley: But there are forests here.
Laura: But with the forests I'd be amazing.
Liam: I do applaud your honesty, though, sister.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: So as you loudly clomp up and begin rooftop-hopping, a few individuals in the city kind of take notice and they point up, which by the way--
Laura: I wink at them as I'm climbing up.
Matt: Ah, the classic Vex wink. All right, so. Just you guys-- kind of atmosphere, as you step down the staircase and get to the main city street proper, the first thing you notice, the roads themselves are not cobblestone, are not brick, they are mud. They are thick, recently sleeted mud. You hear the clomping of horse hooves as carts are pulled through and each one is a sickly (squelch) sound as each footstep makes it through. The people of this city are a very hardened and rugged folk. Most clothing is swathed in furs and thick leathers, armor is patchwork in itself, most of the men grow coarse facial hair and the women themselves, their hair is wild and their appearance very stoic and grizzled. The landscape of Vasselheim-- oh, thank you kindly. Delivery of our chicken.
Marisha: Chicken through the magic door.
Matt: The people who live here, you gather, quickly walking through-- and Kima gives you a bit of insight as well-- live here not because it's easy to live, not because there's many comforts, it's a very harsh living in the city of Vasselheim. But the city is also currently the oldest known bastion of civilization in the world. As far as it's understood, most human civilization, and a lot of humans believe pre-elf and pre-dwarf, although the dwarves and elves very staunchly disagree, all stemmed from this city, which is believed to be tens of thousands of years old. They have uncovered the single oldest temples to the main deities of good and neutrality within this city, and as such it is considered the holiest place in the modern world, which is why it has been through many, many wars and has seen much warfare and strife and difficulty. And those that live here live here because they feel that they can fight against this, and they actually call it a privilege to exist in this harsh landscape as devotion to their respective deities. Also, because it is such a holy place, this is why the arcane is considered, for the most part, profane in public and very carefully controlled otherwise.
Travis: So we gotta be sneaky with that.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: The buildings look old--
Travis: So I'll put my spells in my back pocket for now.
Matt: The buildings range from old to newer stone, warped wood from just the weather itself. You can see a lot of the wood has a kind of mossy texture to it just from the general overgrowth that tends to take the city. It's not kept for beauty, it's kept for function. There's scars across most of the buildings where you can see warfare has bled into the city, and there are markings and various points of ancient damage and certain structures that have not been rebuilt, that have just been left in ruin where they stand, because they have not yet found somebody or a purpose to be restructured. It's a very different landscape than what you're used to, and the walk itself is a very solemn, quiet walk through the city. The folks that do take notice just kind of give a nod of acknowledgement or a gruff grunt as they pass by. There doesn't seem to be a definite interest in your travel, this isn't a special occasion. It seems like travelers and strange occurrences are not that unnatural in this city.
Marisha: Okay. So it's like New York.
Matt: You could say that, yeah. It's a very ancient New York.
Sam: And we're carrying a large ark, or a box of some sort?
Matt: You are carrying the platinum box that the Horn was kept in.
Sam: How big is it?
Matt: It's approximately like a foot and a half, or two feet by two feet.
Ashley: Oh, Taliesin's here.
Laura: Oh!
Travis: Taliesin's outside.
Sam: And it's platinum? It's just a platinum box?
Matt: Yes, it is made of like solid platinum and silver with a series of very, very intricate scrolling and engravings on it.
Marisha: Is it sticking out like a sore thumb?
Laura: There were some sapphires in there, too, some blue sapphires, I remember.
Matt: Yes, yes.
Marisha: Is it sticking out like a sore thumb?
Matt: Best you can tell, there are people taking notice of it, but none that like stop and gawk, they just kind of, "huh." Keep walking.
Marisha: Damn, maybe we should've thrown a blanket or something over it.
Matt: You could if you want to, now.
Travis: Can we, though?
Marisha: Burlap sack or something? Anybody?
Matt: The guards still flanking you guys, surrounding this ensemble as it presses towards the base of the mountain. You make your way towards the edge of the mountain, or where the mountain begins at the bottom of the floor, and you can see dozens of staircases ascending the outskirts of this giant pointed cragless spire that just sticks up into, actually, the clouds cut off the top of it. It's reminiscent of Gatshadow, the mountain outside of Westruun that you guys traveled to long ago.
Travis: Right.
Matt: But even larger. You continue up this staircase, and the stonework itself is a little lopsided and awkward, and with each step sometimes you have to kinda catch yourself, especially as the wind begins to pick up the higher up the mountain you go, and it takes about 15 to 20 minutes to ascend this staircase. Your legs begin to grow a little sore, until eventually you reach the base of what you can only imagine is the Platinum Sanctuary. You see before you, built into the side of the rock of this mountain, a grand stone fortress that looks older than time in itself. You can see the elements have weathered to the point where even the solid points and how the stonework was meant to be an edge has been rounded and smoothed down. There are a series of silver markings across the outskirts of it, which Tiberius, you recognize as Draconic.
Orion: Look, Percy, it's Draconic.
Taliesin: Oh, so it is. (laughter)
Matt: Certain words in Draconic--
Marisha: Percy, you've been so quiet here lately.
Taliesin: I don't want to talk about it.
Matt: You see phrases emblazoned on the side of this giant temple that say things like "honor, justice." Various, very old base Draconic stuff. The current language is a more refined version. This is a very, very ancient basis of that language.
Orion: See that, Scanlan? That says something like Apollo Justice something.
Sam: It's Phoenix something.
Orion: It's maybe the rise of the justice of the phoenix.
Sam: Nah, I don't know.
Orion: It's a lot of things.
Travis: Dawn of justice--
Matt: On the top of this fortress, you see three constructs that don't match the stone structure. These may have been constructed or built many years later and have been added onto the temple. But three ivory and silver spires, towers that ascend from the top of the fortress itself, almost parallel to the very steep mountainside that this fortress is built into. You come to the front doors of this structure. Two very, very large gray stone doors with almost what looks like white marbling through them, and you can see, mostly worn away but still barely visible, the symbol of a shield with a dragon head emblazoned on the front of it, the symbol of Bahamut. As the Scalebearer-- yes, that there-- as the Scalebearers approach the front, the doors, on their own, and open to the interior, the grinding sound of stone across the marble flooring of the fortress proper. You can see the interior. Did you have a question?
Marisha: Can I see inside the temple? Or are the temples pretty enclosed?
Matt: You can see now as the doors begin to open.
Marisha: Well, I was an eagle flying overhead.
Matt: Oh, yes! You--
Marisha: And I was gonna do a perception check to see if I noticed, like kinda do a loop of the temple.
Matt: Go for it.
Sam: So, I'm an eagle.
Marisha: So I'm an eagle right now, so.
Taliesin: You're such an eagle. Oh my god.
Laura: I very, very poorly fall off of the roof and clamber down.
Marisha: 20 total.
Matt: Best you can tell, there are for the makeshift guards in the city-- which, you've heard them referred to as Bastions, they're all volunteers, and actually from what you gather here, probably a quarter of the populace are Bastions. So they have a very, very heavy civilian-based militia that guards this city.
Sam: Are those the guys who were with us, the envoys?
Matt: Yes. No, no, not the envoys, the envoys' come from the temple of Bahamut, they have the blue and silver robes. You see, they're just wearing makeshift patchwork armor, whatever that could be scavenged or constructed to outfit a militia, essentially.
Sam: Okay.
Matt: You see them going up and down every which staircase, just doing various passes and patrolwork. Some of them have spyglasses and you see them looking off in the distance, and as you're getting higher up the mountain, too, you look out about, and you can see the entire forest around you. Very thick, ominous, and you swear every now and then you can see some trees move suddenly and heavily before coming to rest in the distance.
Marisha: I'm gonna go check that out first.
Matt: The rest of you are entering the temple. Keyleth is not there.
Orion: Is it lit in there?
Matt: The doors close behind you.
Sam: Hope Keyleth is okay.
Laura: Keyleth--
Marisha: (eagle noises)
Liam: I don't think that I was with the group, I think I was back with the crowd--
Laura: No, you--
Sam: Great.
Liam: -- so I see the eagle fly off and I'm just gonna follow after her.
Laura: What?
Matt: The eagle flies out of the city.
Liam: Yeah.
Laura: You're gonna leave the city, brother?
Liam: No.
Orion: You're leaving?
Marisha: Gonna see if I can figure out what's making the trees move.
Liam: Now that I understand the--
Laura: Come on in the temple.
Liam: But do I still get shut in my face? So.
Marisha: I'm flying! I'm fine.
Liam: It's a big solid building, doors are shut, that's it?
Matt: Yeah, I mean, the temple, would you like to enter the temple with the rest of the group?
Laura: Yeah, you would.
Ashley: Yeah, do it.
Matt: All right.
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: So just as the doors are closing, you rush out of your subtle following pattern and, wait, and put your hands up and manage to make your way into the temple right before the doors close, catching up with the rest of the group. Keyleth, make a perception check.
Marisha: I have advantage because I'm an eagle. Ooh, natural 20!
Sam: Nice!
Travis: Nice!
Taliesin: On the shiny die.
Matt: All right.
Orion: It is on the shiny die.
Matt: It's hard to see much of anything because the canopy of this forest is so dense and so thick, and the snowfall itself, which is getting stronger through the air, and is kind of obscuring some of your vision, but you glance down and you see another set of trees shift suddenly about a quarter-mile away from the city's walls. And you can see on the edge of the city wall a number of guards are beginning to swarm up to the ballista and starting to load them and prepare them. You glance down, and all you see are something fast-moving beneath the canopy, something large. Something you can swear you see it looks serpentine-like. But multiple serpentine-like bodies or forms. And then it's gone in a second.
Laura: Hydra! You think it's a hydra?
Orion: I don't want it to be a hydra.
Liam: Stop gasping, I don't see shit, Laura.
Orion: Oh, that's right.
Laura: Shut up!
Matt: You see a couple ballista set loose. The bolts go flying through the air, entering the forest. You can hear a loud screeching sound, and a few dozen forests now begin to shake to the side as the creature makes its way away from the city before going still in the distance.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: You get the sensation that this is a--
Marisha: A common occurrence.
Matt: -- a common occurrence.
Marisha: Okay. Good to know. I'm going to loop back around. Is there like an open window in the temple that I can just fly through--
Orion: Ooh. Is there a super clear one that she could try to go through first?
Marisha: Be like that Windex commercial, back in the day.
Matt: The temple--
Orion: (crashing sounds) Dammit!
Matt: You make your way--
Marisha: I break my neck, I die.
Orion: No.
Matt: There are small-- they are not windows, more than they are slits for arrow defense.
Travis: Right.
Matt: You as Keyleth could squeeze through. It would be one of those things where you have to careen in, transform, and then squeeze through.
Marisha: Okay, I'll do that.
Matt: Which you do, and as you do, you come right into the face of a spear right there--
Laura: (gasps) You should have transformed into a fly.
Matt: -- as another one of the Platinum Dragon guards says, "Who goes there?"
Sam: Oh boy.
Marisha: Hi. Hi.
Matt: Another guard begins to approach from the side.
Marisha: I am with Vox Machina. I'm pretty sure they just came through the front door. It's cool. I was just doing-- just like aerial support. I'm just going to go and reconnect with my group. It's fine.
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Marisha: I'm Keyleth.
Travis: (whispers) Mention the Scalebearer.
Marisha: I'm not good at this shit.
Matt: You're not there, Grog.
Marisha: What am I doing? A persuasion check?
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: Christ.
Orion: You're going to roll a one.
Matt: Sorry, Miss Charisma.
Marisha: Shut up.
Taliesin: Oh, wow.
Marisha: Oh, wait. I don't know why I'm rolling two.
Taliesin: That's real funny.
Marisha: Six?
Laura: Oh no!
Sam: Keyleth's dead.
Orion: (whispers) No, they'll probably just put her in prison.
Matt: The guy holding the spear to you keeps it there. The other guy walks up behind and says, "Let me see your hands."
Laura: (gasps)
Liam: Shit.
Marisha: Why?
Matt: "Let me see your hands." He takes your hands, pulls out a set of shackles--
Laura: (gasps)
Ashley: Oh no.
Matt: -- and locks them on.
Laura: This is the second time you've been arrested!
Marisha: Yeah, it is.
Matt: The guy with spear turns behind you and just holds it to your back as the gentleman who just cuffed you grabs the chain between and starts pulling you towards the main chamber.
Marisha: You know, can we just buzz by the front foyer, and then we'll find my friends, and then we'll all be like, hey, those are my-- It'll be fine.
Orion: I think that's where you're going.
Matt: He leads you down the stairway to an area where it opens up into a small courtyard, takes you to the right of the courtyard into a central chamber, where the rest of Vox Machina is currently being led.
Laura: Keyleth!
Orion: Do I see her?
Matt: Yeah, you guys all see her being led in, in cuffs, essentially.
Orion: Seriously? Again?
Travis: What did you do?
Laura: Again, Keyleth?
Orion: Your Highness, what is your problem?
Ashley: Oh. She's with us. She's with us, she was just outside, we got in before.
Travis: No, we don't know who she is.
Taliesin: Actually, can we have a few minutes to discuss this?
Marisha: Shut up, Grog!
Matt: At this point, Kima turns and says, "She's with me."
Laura: Oh.
Matt: And both the Scalebearers go, "Lady Kima, I am so sorry." And they go ahead and take the cuffs off real fast and pull the spear back and step back.
Ashley: Wow.
Laura: Yeah, you listen to Lady Kima.
Orion: The classic.
Marisha: The classic.
Orion: The classic handcuff wrist twist.
Marisha: Ouch.
Liam: Hardass. (laughter)
Marisha: Yeah, I'm with her.
Matt: They back off and bow deeply and escort themselves off, embarrassed.
Marisha: Did you guys see that?
Ashley: That was cool.
Orion: I nudge Grog.
Travis: That was cool. You were arrested.
Orion: Grog, Grog, I'm nudging you.
Travis: You hadn't done anything.
Taliesin: I knew you had it in you.
Marisha: I'm starting to feel so hardcore.
Orion: I'm just nudging you.
Travis: Oh, okay.
Orion: Because Kima did something super hot.
Taliesin: You need a tattoo.
Marisha: I do need a tattoo.
Travis: I know, I noticed. She doesn't love me, though.
Laura: She does, Grog.
Travis: No, not yet.
Matt: All right. Scalebearer Yonn continues to lead you through this main chamber. And this chamber, like I said, it's the temple. It's strange, because most temples you've seen to Bahamut or many other deities are extravagant or are, you know, built with a modern-day sense of architecture. This is a very plain, simple stone fortress. It's hard to grasp what time it was built, but just the smell itself seems very ancient. There's a scent of dust and age, and functionality to its construct. But there's still a sense of power to it. Especially you, Pike, where you're sensitive to divine energy. This whole place is humming with it. Even though it's not the kind you're used to connecting with. This is-- When they say this is a holy place, you can feel it.
Laura: Is everything okay, Pike?
Ashley: It's just-- there's a lot of holiness here. (laughter)
Orion: I would imagine.
Marisha: Oh.
Sam: On a scale from one to five, five being super holy--
Ashley: Probably six.
Sam: Whoa.
Laura: Whoa.
Marisha: (gasps)
Orion: That's extra holy.
Marisha: This temple goes to six.
Ashley: This temple, I mean this--
Orion: (laughs) This temple goes to six.
Ashley: Just this whole land in particular. I mean there's a lot, there's a lot here, but--
Orion: That is good, though.
Ashley: Yes, good.
Sam: Do you need a moment? Do you need to sit down? Do you need me to hold you?
Ashley: I think I'm okay to keep going.
Laura: All right.
Ashley: But maybe later. We'll see. If I get a little tired.
Matt: At which you feel a nudge at your side and it's an armored elbow from Kima, saying, "If you wouldn't mind holding off on the fraternizing in the temple of Bahamut, I would really appreciate it."
Marisha: Oh, that's right.
Sam: Message understood.
Matt: At which point Scalebearer Yonn is now at the second set of double doors and he presents his holy symbol above his chest, it glows a second, and what was originally just smooth stone doors, you see a divine glow and the symbol of Bahamut you saw at the front of the temple appear for a moment, and then as it vanishes the two doors open on their own into a central worship chamber. This is a much larger domed room. It looks like it goes up about 80 feet to the top of the ceiling, and the dome itself has what looks like an extremely ancient, detailed drawing, like Sistine Chapel-style, the tale of the entirety of creation. You see all the elemental planes represented in the corners, the theoretical corners, where corners would be in a domed room. You can see a crude representation of how all the planes lay over each other, you can see the Astral Plane, you can see where the Nine Hells would exist, and the Abyss itself, and in the center there's the Prime Material Plane, and across it you see a giant image of the great platinum dragon Bahamut drawn in all of his glory, currently snapping down on one of the throats of a multi-headed dragon. This other dragon, with five different heads of five different chromatic colors, and this struggle between what you know to be Bahamut and Tiamat.
Travis: Tiamat?
Matt: Tiamat.
Laura: Is that the bad one?
Matt: You gather.
Liam: That is the baddest one.
Laura: I mean, I know that because I know a lot about dragons.
Matt: Indeed.
Marisha: Whoa. Do I see or learn anything about the elemental planes that I didn't know before?
Matt: Not from the artwork. It's very pretty.
Marisha: Ah, so pretty.
Orion: I take it all in and I'm reminded of one of the museums at home.
Matt: And actually, you've seen this art piece in a book. It's been a long time, but you know that this has been studied before and exists somewhere in Draconia, the tome that talks about this exact temple.
Travis: A book?
Marisha: We just made cave drawings, I don't--
Sam: That's those square things.
Orion: The square things with all the paper leaves in them and squiggles.
Travis: Right.
Laura: Is Tiamat still alive? Is he still around?
Orion: I read a lot of those. Can't put my finger on it.
Matt: At which point both Yonn and Kima and the Scalebearers kind of turn to you with a look of-- kind of understanding that you don't quite know, but also the fear and the knowledge that-- they don't say anything, they just give you a look that says, yes, very much so.
Laura: Oh. I mean. (nervous laugh) Tiamat's still around, huh?
Orion: Unfortunately, yes.
Matt: They continue walking.
Laura: Oh.
Matt: Now, the floor of this chamber, which is a very simple stone, you can see there are small sculptures, each one representing some sort of a humanoid entity dressed in similar robes to the other envoys and members of this temple that you've encountered thus far. Some of them are in full armor, some are wearing just robes, and they're very, very old. Some of them seem a little more recent, and you gather these each have some sort of cultural or religious significance to this temple. However, one of these is not a statue. In the center of this worship chamber, which is strangely, eerily quiet, there is one humanoid that turns to the rest of you. What you see before you is a slender, elven male draped in long, white robes that drag a few feet behind his form across the ground. He has jet-- not jet, stark-white hair that is slicked back against his head, no facial hair, frail but very handsome features. Elves, when they age, they age very gracefully--
Laura: Yeah we do.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: -- and from the look of most elves you've seen, this is a very old elf that has aged very gracefully. He turns to the rest of you and you see across his neck a very, very well-crafted, intricate series of draconic symbols that finishes with a giant emblem of Bahamut himself. His voice rings out and echoes throughout the hallway as you approach, each footstep echoing as you get closer. "Welcome, everyone, to the Platinum Sanctuary. I am called Highbearer Vord."
Laura: Oh, right.
Matt: "Keeper of this most holy of places. I received word from a disciple of mine--" At which Kima has now stepped forward, and bows, kneels before him and says, "Your holiness." At which he looks down with a smile. "Ah, Kima. I am pleased to see you. It has been a long time, my disciple." He looks up to the rest of the group. "I understand you carry something of terrible omen. Let us discuss how to be rid of it. Please. Present the container."
Laura: Right here?
Matt: The Scalebearers step forward and set the container on the ground. They go to reach for it and he goes, "No no no. Do not open it." And he kind of takes a second and holds his symbol to his chest and closes his eyes, and you can see this kind of divine glow pulse off of him for a second.
Marisha: Kima, what's happening?
Matt: She goes, "Shh, shh."
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: The box begins to pulse with the divine light as well, and then suddenly vanishes and he kind of (gasps) catches his breath. "It is as you said. This must be sealed immediately."
Orion: Well, yes.
Marisha: Yeah-huh. We could have just told you that.
Matt: He gives a look to the rest of the group here, and you can see there's a noticeable bead of sweat he kind of wipes off his forehead. "I just needed to confirm that this was not some haphazardly constructed fake or some other artifact mistaken for such a horn, but we indeed have within our presence one of the Horns of Orcus, and this does not bode well."
Laura: (whistles)
Matt: "Thankfully--"
Laura: Are you guys-- oh, sorry.
Matt: "No, please. What do you want to say?"
Laura: I was just wondering. You've had one of these before, yes?
Matt: "No, but we know that these exist. A few of us do; the knowledge itself has been lost to time intentionally. It was brought to my attention, and through discussions with the Council that sent you on this journey, that this would be the safest place to seal such an artifact, and amongst all our other options, as of this time, I see no other choice. So. What's been proposed. Allow me to explain to you the plan. One of our most divine relics of our most beloved protector Bahamut was kept deep beneath this temple, within the mountain we rest against. The Star of Exaltation, a crystal born from the tear Bahamut shed for the sacrifices his first devoted made in the Great War of the Beginnings, the Dawn War. This item was unfortunately lost nearly 300 years ago, giving the last of its power to protect this very Vasselheim. The intervention it brought from our great deity expended and left the artifact destroyed. Since the chamber that held this Star, a blessed and ever-watched nexus beneath the gaze of the Great Platinum Dragon Himself, has gone empty, we've tended to it. We've kept it fairly well-watched and in the state it was originally constructed for. And we think no greater location to seal such a deeply-rooted evil exists within our spheres of influence or any other. Unfortunately, the last time the chamber was cleansed and prepared was some 15 years ago. Our curate tasked one of our own Scalebearers--" And he looks over towards Yonn, who sheepishly backs away. "-- was tasked with preparing it for your arrival, and the artifact's, and it was found that the lower chambers have been infested with some manner of foul subterranean spider creature."
Marisha: Oh, man.
Matt: "Our Scalebearer fled." At which point Yonn leaves the entire conversation and exits the room.
Ashley: (quietly) Excuse me.
Sam: Yonn.
Matt: You hear Kima kind of give a spit in his direction.
Matt: "But not before initiating the vault's defenses." (sighs) "So thus, I ask you to complete your journey into the Hall of the Exalt below, clear out these meager beasts, and guide your reliquary into the vault chamber to seal it for good."
Orion: Will we have to contend with the defense systems as well?
Matt: "Not all of them, but apparently in his haste to escape and defend himself, he set a few of them to aid his escape."
Laura: Great. (shouts) Good job, Yonn!
Marisha: Thanks, Yonn.
Matt: You hear no response other than the pitter-patter of steps.
Sam: Why does he still work here?
Travis: (laughs) Right?
Orion: (laughs) Very good question.
Taliesin: Would you like to speak to his manager?
Sam: Does he have tenure or something? Is it a union thing?
Matt: "He's been with us for many, many years, and he has great heart and devotion. Though addled may be his mind, he does bring much to the temple."
Marisha: He has seniority.
Sam: All right.
Marisha: So wait, you said you lost the Crystal of Exaltation during the War of--
Matt: "It was destroyed during a siege of the city."
Marisha: During the War of what? Beginnings?
Matt: "The War of the Beginnings."
Marisha: The War of the Beginnings.
Taliesin: That was close.
Marisha: And how long ago was this War of the Beginnings?
Matt: "Well that, oh, I'm sorry. It was created in the War of the Beginnings."
Marisha: It was created then?
Matt: "It was lost in a battle, a siege of the city of Vasselheim 300 years ago."
Laura: 300 years?
Marisha: Called what? During what war?
Taliesin: The Siege of the Metal Champions.
Matt: "That had no particular name."
Marisha: Oh.
Laura: Oh.
Marisha: Just a siege.
Laura: It was just a thing?
Matt: "It was one of the sieges and there was--"
Sam: The Battle Where the Thing Was Lost.
Matt: Yes. There it is.
Orion: Right. (laughter)
Liam: Vord. Hi. Question, please. We'll clear out your basement, that's not a problem. I'd like to understand how you plan to protect this horn, how you plan to keep it out of the hands of entities who would use it for ill--
Laura: That big scary creature living out in the woods. Sorry, brother.
Liam: Then how-- that's fine.
Matt: He glances towards you and says, "Oh, that is but one of many."
Laura: Huh.
Matt: "Let it be known that this temple is extremely well-guarded. It is continuously under the gaze of our patron deity and while some of the defenses have been put in place for your arrival, if the entirety of the vault is triggered, there is nothing that will make its way there unannounced."
Travis: Good sell.
Sam: Are we to carry the box down as we journey into the dungeons below, or are we to leave it here while we go clear out the basement?
Matt: "The Scalebearers will bring it with you."
Sam: Okay.
Matt: "Keep them safe."
Sam: Keep them safe? Oh. All right. We've got enough to worry about keeping ourselves safe.
Marisha: So just to get one thing clear, and I mean no (clears throat) disrespect, but how was the crystal lost 300 years ago, if it was in this chamber? So this chamber has been broken into before?
Matt: "We can enter the chamber under very specific circumstances. We, at the time, requested the use of the Star of Exaltation as a divine focus--"
Marisha: Oh.
Matt: "-- a ritual that required the intervention of Bahamut to keep the city safe."
Marisha: Oh, so someone brought it out and then was clumsy and lost it.
Laura: And then it was lost.
Sam: And you know what--
Matt: "It wasn't clumsy and lost. It was used as a focus in the ritual."
Marisha: Oh.
Matt: "It was by the will of Bahamut Himself that the Star no longer was required to exist on this plane."
Orion: She gets it. She gets it.
Matt: "It served its purpose."
Marisha: So it was destroyed.
Laura: Lost, as in--
Orion: Like not around.
Marisha: You should change your verbage here.
Taliesin: Charisma of ten, ladies and gentlemen. Charisma of ten.
Laura: While everybody's been talking, can I have used my Primeval Awareness to see within six miles if there's any dragons around us?
Sam: (sings) Primeval Awareness, yeah.
Matt: So you take a moment and kind of zone out for a second. You do not sense any dragons in the immediate vicinity of the six-mile radius of the city, no.
Laura: Oh, okay. All right. That's all I wanted to know.
Sam: (sings) Primeval Awareness, over.
Travis: Can we drop off this box, or what? I want to go see the fire dancers.
Sam: Yeah, let's go.
Laura: No, we need to go-- we also need to-- are we going to do that now?
Sam: Let's just go.
Laura: Go clear out the basement?
Sam: Yeah, it's the morning, still. Okay? Let's go.
Orion: Are we all potioned up, are we all--
Marisha: Yeah, we're good.
Ashley: We're all healed.
Orion: We're good?
Laura: Let's clear out the basement.
Travis: There's nothing down there, right?
Laura: Yeah? I mean, you want us to do it now, yeah?
Taliesin: I'm not-- I haven't been paying attention.
Matt: "Lest this artifact be left longer in the open, which I would not be comfortable with."
Laura: No, neither would I.
Matt: "I would prefer this be taken care of immediately."
Travis: Yeah, we'll do it now.
Sam: Let's go do it.
Taliesin: We've got a bear.
Laura: I mean, obviously we want the Horn taken care of, but--
Travis: Here we go.
Laura: -- you know, we're taking care of a problem for you, too.
Sam: Oh, here it goes.
Travis: Here it comes.
Sam: Here it goes.
Ashley: Get it, girl.
Travis: Son of a bitch.
Ashley: Get it, girl. Get it.
Liam: The holiest place on the map.
Ashley: Yeah. (laughs)
Laura: The holiest place?
Sam: Haggle with the pope.
Taliesin: Shaking down the pope.
Matt: "You want a monetary reward--"
Laura: I was just wondering.
Matt: "-- for your aid."
Laura: I'm not asking.
Matt: "The temple can provide a sum of three thousand gold pieces."
Laura: Per party member, yes?
Matt: "Entirely. Three thousand gold pieces for your trouble on this journey." At which Kima steps forward and says, "Highbearer, we do not need to take money from--"
Laura: We don't want money, of course not. I mean, I--
Sam: But think of the good we could do with that money, giving alms to the poor back home where we are.
Laura: Yes, spreading the word of Bahamut where we go.
Ashley: Are we going to return for it?
Sam: We do a lot of charity work and it would be well-received back home. (under his breath) In our Keep.
Matt: You make a persuasion roll. You make a deception roll.
Sam: Deception?
Laura: It's not a deception, we really will--
Travis: No, no. Only one of you.
Matt: (laughs) No, he won't.
Taliesin: The ladies of the evening really, really do need the money, apparently.
Marisha: (laughs) No, he won't.
Travis: What did you roll, Sam?
Sam: A 30.
Orion: (laughs)
Laura: Oh. That's really good because I rolled a 19. Wait!
Marisha: A 30?
Ashley: No, you didn't.
Laura: Yeah, I did.
Liam: Three-zero?
Sam: Three-zero! I have a +13 for deception. (laughs)
Travis: Really? (laughter)
Taliesin: That explains so much.
Travis: We've got to get you deceiving more.
Marisha: (laughs) We've got to get you deceiving more.
Travis: Oh my god.
Marisha: You should lie more. It's good.
Taliesin: Lie to me, Pinocchio. Lie to me.
Matt: "Three thousand gold, at your disposal, to bring about and to share in the prosperity of your people back home."
Sam: Amen. (laughter)
Matt: "Once the artifact is delivered and sealed."
Sam: From one holy man to another, I think we've struck a deal. Let's go.
Orion: Burt Reynolds, you've done it again.
Travis: Amen. (laughter)
Matt: As you all turn, Kima goes, "I'll show you to the vault room."
Laura: Are you going to come with us, Kima?
Matt: "Yes, I'm coming with you."
Laura: Oh, good.
Matt: She glances over at you. (sarcastically) "Shall we, holy man?" (laughter)
Sam: Why yes, my sister, lead the way.
Marisha: Sister. (laughter)
Matt: As you guys are walking out of the chamber, the doors close behind, she turns to you and says, "Is that why you were blessed with such a temporarily swollen appendage before?"
Sam: I don't know how the lord works, it's mysterious. (laughter)
Matt: "Let us be on our way." She kind of walks off, flustered and frustrated. You guys are led down two layers. This actual temple recedes further and further into the mountain, until you're led into what seems to almost be a storage basement. It's a very musty smell. It's old earth--
Orion: It's dank down here.
Matt: Yeah, it kind of has that moldy scent to it. There are five guards stationed in this storage vicinity, and as you approach, they all stand up. They're all still wearing ceremonial armor, two of which you can see are really well-armed, one with a greatsword and one with a longsword at the side. They look pretty prestigious to be assigned to a basement this terrible.
Laura: At ease, soldiers.
Matt: "Of course, of course."
Matt: And they step aside. Kima steps forward and takes her holy symbol and removes it from around her neck. She looks at the wall for a second, then places it into what you didn't see before was some sort of a slight recess in the wood. It flashes with divine energy, and suddenly the wood illusion is dispelled and what you see before you is a stone doorway that begins to slowly shift to the side and open up into a staircase.
Laura: Are we going to find any of these defenses right away, or what?
Matt: Kima kind of gives you a look, shrugs, and, "To be perfectly honest, I have not been within the vault."
Taliesin: Well.
Ashley: Okay.
Marisha: Huh. Is there a blueprint somewhere?
Travis: Liam, you're up. I mean, (clears throat) Vax.
Sam: I thought he was Vex.
Liam: Sorry, my communication earring was a little low there. What was said?
Laura: Check for some traps, brother.
Liam: You got it. You got it. I'm glad to get out of upstairs, I mutter to my sister, because the decor up there was shit.
Marisha: (laughs)
Liam: That is... high. That was a 26.
Matt: 26 for?
Laura: Traps in the stairway.
Liam: Just traps.
Matt: Perception for traps? All right. As you slowly begin to descend the stairway, you keep an eye out across the staircase itself and any of the surrounding walls. The stonework here is also extremely ancient, marking probably a similarity to the most ancient of buildings you've seen in this city. This subterranean structure is probably one of the older parts of this temple. You don't see anything trap-wise. The stairway eventually comes to an end into a chamber about 50 feet by 50 feet. It's very, very low light. There appear to be--
Orion: Oh! Light!
Matt: Okay. The brief moment of light, before your eyes can really focus in, there's a flash of light at the end of Tiberius's staff, and the room actually gets harder to see. You see there is a thick white mist that just kind of hangs in the air throughout the entirety of this room.
Orion: Oh! (fssh)
Marisha: It's like having your high-beams on when it's foggy.
Orion: I de-cast Light.
Matt: Okay. You dispel the Light.
Orion: What is all of this poppycock?
Matt: Your eyes adjust a little bit, and you can see what looks like-- this room, for the most part, doesn't have any sort of details. There are a couple of sconces with low, flickering light that are embedded in the side of the walls of this 50 foot by 50 foot room. It's about 20 feet high.
Marisha: I go ahead and I do a little Wind Gust and I go, (blows air).
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Down the hall, to clear out the fog.
Matt: Which spell is this?
Marisha: Gust of Wind.
Matt: Okay, so you cast Gust of Wind. The mist that was filling this room blows out the other side and you can see, the room is a little more visible now.
Orion: Oh, very good. Light!
Matt: There's still a light mist on the sides, but the center of the walkway is clear for a second. You see now in the center of the room what were initially just dark spots in the mist, there are two pillars that are attached from ceiling to floor, roughly about 20 feet apart from each other, kind of in the center of each side of the room. Each pillar is solid gray stone with what looks like intricately carved small dragons almost curling and wrapping around the statues. Each one of their heads kind of turned, mouth opened kind of angrily in different directions.
Laura: Can I check for traps or see if there's anything--
Travis: You should re-cast that.
Matt: You guys, both of you guys make perception checks.
Laura: Yeah.
Liam: That's a 19.
Laura: Oh, he already rolled. Look at him.
Liam: Yeah.
Laura: Perception?
Matt: Mm-hm.
Laura: 25.
Matt: So looking about, Liam-- Sorry, Vax. You notice the base of each one of these pillars is not flush with the floor. There is a slight gap, meaning there is some sort of a rotation or a pivot to these pillars.
Laura: Hm.
Matt: You notice that these mouths of the dragons seem to be what's creating this white mist, and as time progresses, the mist begins to refill up the room rather quickly.
Laura: All right. Do I notice any-- does it seem-- Well, without touching it. Any kind of poisonous in nature, anything like that?
Matt: Looks like mist.
Ashley: Should we run through?
Orion: While we're standing around, I'd like to reassign the earrings to Vax, Grog, and Scanlan.
Laura: I don't get one anymore? You're taking it off of me right now?
Travis: Yeah, he's giving it to me. (laughs)
Orion: Because we're always together, we're always kind of in the back together, and they're always kind of like up in the fray, so--
Travis: That's true, I do wander off easily.
Sam: Oh, is that you, Grog?
Travis: (laughs) Hi. I know.
Orion: She's always kind of like in the middle. She's the wild card. He's always in the back with us also because we're the ranged dudes.
Laura: All right.
Marisha: Wait, do I still have one?
Taliesin: I'm putting down my mask, just in case this is awful.
Matt: Okay. You guys are still at the stairway. The mist has now filled the room again in front of you.
Laura: Ugh. Should we try breathing it and see what happens?
Sam: Yeah, sure.
Marisha: My Gust of Wind--
Laura: I just reach my arm into the mist and just see--
Marisha: My Gust of Wind lasts up to one minute, by the way, so I can keep--
Laura: Oh, maybe we should just not touch the mist and go straight through the room.
Marisha: I'm just airbending.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: You've been wanting to say that.
Laura: So you can blow it and we just walk through?
Matt: As this conversation has continued-- let's say about 30 or 40 seconds has gone by in transferring the earrings and the discussion, so there's still a little bit of-- there is a clear pathway in the center there.
Marisha: Not much time.
Sam: Let's go.
Laura: Should we go?
Sam: Let's go through.
Laura: Let's go before it gets back.
Travis: Yeah.
Ashley: I start running.
Taliesin: Yes, go, run.
Liam: Hustle, hustle.
Laura: Go, go, go.
Matt: Okay. You all start running through. You're running through with them and keeping concentration on your spell.
Orion: Vax, check for traps!
Sam: Vorak, Desona, come!
Laura: I perception-checked the room. It didn't seem like there was anything.
Orion: Oh, are we good? Okay.
Liam: I'm running ten feet ahead of everybody. I rolled a big old one. (laughter)
Sam: He tripped.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Wow.
Matt: You continue forward, and as you're rushing through the group, not paying attention, you gently hit the edge of the mist barrier with your shoulder, as you're rushing to the side instinctually to stealth along the wall. As your shoulder breaks the mist--
Liam: Bring it.
Matt: All of the dragon mouths burst into bright fiery flame and begin spinning rapidly in the room. The people that are in the center running through right now, which include Keyleth, Scanlan, Tiberius, and Pike, all of you guys make dexterity saving throws.
Ashley: What?!
Sam: Whoa!
Marisha: Son of a bitch.
Laura: Vax!
Sam: Way to go, Vax.
Taliesin: Teacher, teacher, did I have time to finish my book?
Matt: You have.
Taliesin: Yes!
Ashley: Dexterity check?
Liam: You said dex save? Dex save?
Matt: Dex save, yes.
Orion: 18.
Marisha: It's all right.
Matt: 18?
Orion: Mm-hm.
Matt: All right. Hmm. Scanlan?
Sam: Oh! 13.
Matt: 13.
Ashley: Three.
Matt: All right.
Liam: 26.
Matt: All right.
Marisha: Also 13.
Ashley: But I'm short! I'm so short. They would--
Laura: Super duper short.
Travis: Just going to hit you in the face.
Ashley: They would just flow right over me.
Matt: Okay. As the flames just burst out throughout the room, tearing into the air with this reddish-white flame, both Vax and Tiberius manage to try and dodge out of the way as best they can, only receiving, each of them--
Laura: Well, all Vax has to do is roll, because he's already on the freaking ground.
Matt: 12 points of fire damage to each of you.
Marisha: To who?
Liam: Well, rogue with Uncanny Dodge, for a successful save gets zero damage.
Matt: You take none.
Orion: And I take half.
Matt: So you take zero damage, you take 12.
Orion: So I take half. Is it 24 total?
Matt: No, 24 total. You take half.
Orion: Oh.
Marisha: The rest of us?
Matt: Scanlan, Keyleth, and Pike all take 24 points of fire damage.
Sam: Ugh.
Ashley: I got 24 points.
Marisha: Ouch.
Orion: Oh! My robe.
Sam: Ow. Are we still moving?
Liam: Tuck and roll.
Orion: Are you getting used to your new foot, Vax?
Liam: I'm back!
Matt: You guys move through-- that's the four of you guys. Percy, Grog, and Vex and Trinket are all behind, as they watch the flames burst out and they all kind of stop their inertia, and now the mist slowly fills up the room.
Travis: Whoa.
Matt: About the time that your spell wears off for the first minute.
Marisha: Okay. (weak chuckle) Let's move?
Travis: It fills up the room?
Laura: We're still in the room.
Sam: The three of us, you're still back.
Matt: You guys are split right now, with the bearers, the Scalebearers.
Laura: Oh, they're coming with us, they're like coming with us through the whole thing?
Matt: They're with you, yeah.
Marisha: Wait, hang on.
Laura: Keyleth, blow the smoke again. Blow the mist away. If you can.
Marisha: Burning another spell slot. All right, here we go.
Matt: Oh, no.
Ashley: We run through it.
Laura: And now we run.
Marisha: Oh, no. He doesn't care.
Travis: He doesn't care.
Taliesin: No, we walk gently through.
Matt: Burning the second spell slot. (wind noise) The mist clears itself. Now that you're aware of what it does, you're very careful to direct it towards the center and leave an open path. The rest of you rush through, including the Scalebearers, in the minute you have. The wind is blowing in your face from Keyleth's position. It's kind of like stepping into the force of a hurricane. You have to put your hand in front of you to see--
Laura: (shouts) Your breath smells pretty good, though, Keyleth.
Marisha: Thanks, I tried to get a little of a sage thing.
Ashley: Sagey rosemary?
Travis: Very minty.
Marisha: A little orange blossom. It's nice.
Orion: I'm going to Prestidigitate a tiny air shield in front of me.
Liam: When I bite into a York Peppermint Patty--
Marisha: It's also pure oxygen, so we could get a little buzz.
Matt: It's a very, very tiny shield. It protects this much of your face.
Orion: That's what I'm doing.
Matt: Your eyes are fine. The rest of your robes are still (windblown cloth sounds).
Orion: Yeah.
Matt: You guys all make your way across the room. You then finish your spell and the mist immediately fills up and completely obfuscates that room behind you once more.
Sam: One down!
Marisha: We made it!
Sam: 20 rooms to go.
Matt: You're now in what is a ten-foot-wide chamber for an additional-- a tunnel or hallway-- for another 20 feet before it opens up into another room, but there is no light source in there whatsoever. You, with Light on your staff again, you kind of step ahead to--
Laura: Do you want to shoot an arrow in?
Orion: Oh, would you like to see?
Laura: Yeah, let's do it.
Orion: Yeah, very good. Light.
Matt: All right, so as Vex releases her arrow, light bursts forth from the wooden shaft as it arcs across the room. As it does, you can see the room. As compared to the previous one that was square in shape, this one is circular. It is almost a cylinder in its design. Go ahead and make a perception check.
Laura: 16.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: 29.
Laura: He's better.
Matt: Okay. You notice that across this floor of the circular room, there are these circles marked across the entirety of the surface here.
Laura: Great. Those are probably traps.
Travis: I bet those are fun.
Laura: Pressure plates, maybe?
Orion: Okay, or sigils or-- maybe we have to activate them or not activate them?
Travis: I have darkvision, now with a range of 60 feet.
Sam: Can we see to the other side of the room?
Matt: Hm?
Sam: Can we see all the way to the other side of the room?
Matt: Opposite side, there is actually a much larger opening and what looks to be another staircase that descends. This one is 20 feet wide. It's a very wide staircase from what you're used to seeing, especially in these structures.
Sam: And I'm hoping there's no door.
Matt: No doorway. It's open. It just descends down below. And the only way you can tell is that the arrow arcs across--
Liam: Everybody stand back. I'm going to click my Boots of Haste--
Laura: What? Shouldn't we throw something onto one of the pressure plates first and see what it does?
Liam: Yeah, me. I'm going to click my Boots of Haste, I'm going to run, I'm going to do a sort of a running roll, land on the closest circle and wait for half a tick and then roll off of it.
Laura: Are you kidding me?!
Orion: What are you doing?
Travis: No, no, let him do it! Let him do it.
Matt: So as you guys are about to go, "Wait!", Vax is already off. Clicks the boots. The arcane magic of the Boots of Haste kick into his body. He leaps forward. Make an acrobatics check.
Liam: Okay. 22.
Travis: I hope you get your eyebrows burned off.
Matt: All right. You leap forward. Your hand touches the first circle in the room. As it does, there's suddenly a large shift in the room. All of a sudden, the hand which you had purchase on slides out from underneath you. You catch yourself on your feet, but now suddenly there's a loud grinding sound and the entire room seems to be shifting, moving, spinning in its own right, and you instinctually feel something moving towards you very quickly. Make a dexterity saving throw, Liam.
Sam: Oh, boy.
Laura: Vax!
Orion: I click my earring. You're an idiot, Vax.
Liam: I'm going to use Luck because that blew. And that's a natural 20.
Sam: Oh!
Marisha: Oh!
Ashley: Oh snap.
Orion: Yeah, 20!
Ashley: Yeah, 20.
Marisha: Yeah!
Matt: So. You barely manage to move out of the way before that circular portion of the ground skyrockets up like a pillar-- one very similar to the one that you created for your spell-- slams into the ceiling with a heavy thud, retracts, and continues again. In fact, looking around you, all of them in the room are now, at different levels, pistoning into the ceiling. (repeated crashing rock noises) This entire room is slowly rotating and there's just a series of pillars mashing into the ceiling.
Marisha: Oh, it's like a mini-game.
Matt: You have to make an acrobatics check to try and get through this now because you have very little space to move.
Liam: Okay. (laughter)
Liam: I'm going to use Luck again.
Matt: (laughs)
Liam: That is 18.
Matt: 18. You manage to make your way halfway across the room, dodging out of the way as these pillars are slamming and retracting. Kind of use the pattern of when they're pulling down from the ceiling, but they're moving very fast. One of them manages to catch you underneath your ankle. Go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw again.
Liam: That is 15.
Matt: 15. All right.
Travis: Uh-oh.
Ashley: You're going to hurt your foot again, Vax.
Matt: It catches you, takes you off of your balance, and it rockets you towards the ceiling. You manage to pull most of your body out of the way in time, but it still catches the back of your shoulder blade. You take 40 points of crushing damage.
Travis: Yes! (cackles)
Sam: Ohhh!
Marisha: Holy shit.
Matt: As you are slammed into the ceiling. And as the pillar retracts, you roll off with a heavy wheeze of pain. (groan) Catching onto your feet again. Make one more acrobatics check.
Marisha: Oh my god. If you get crushed to death--
Travis: (laughs) On Skype.
Liam: That's a 23.
Matt: What was that?
Travis: 23.
Matt: 23.
Liam: I'm like an acrobatic cheetah. 23.
Matt: 23. You manage to-- in the severe pain you're feeling, you can tell there's probably some serious bruising in there and you probably broke a couple of ribs, but you manage to just barely dodge and leap out of the way, making your way across the room to where the staircase descends, out of the immediate danger.
Sam: Ah.
Laura: Jeez.
Matt: The rest of you now are standing on the opposite side of this room, which is currently a rotating grinding mill.
Travis: That was great.
Liam: I'd like to check if there's any kind of device or anything on this side--
Orion: Okay, hold on a second, Vax, just chill out for a minute. We all just took a little damage this last time.
Liam: I'm just trying a perception check.
Sam: He's checking. He's checking.
Matt: All right, make a perception check.
Marisha: For a lever or something.
Travis: For a switch.
Liam: 25.
Sam: 25.
Matt: 25. You can see, in the ceiling, in the very, very center of the room, precariously placed right where one of the pillars in the center slams into the ceiling, there appears to be a small quarter-sized hole, gold piece-sized hole in the ceiling.
Ashley: Yeah, come on, Vex.
Taliesin: Race you for it.
Matt: It's in the middle of the room. In the ceiling, where--
Liam: Is there a clear shot of it or is there (bang bang bang) going on?
Matt: Oh, no, it's still going. The pillars are still slamming into the roof. And that one hole you see is right where one of the pillars slams into the roof. You only see it intermittently when the pillar retracts.
Marisha: Go, sharpshooters, go.
Taliesin: You first, or me?
Laura: Well, let's try this first because you might just break it down completely.
Taliesin: Oh, very well.
Laura: You are much more powerful than I am, Percy.
Travis: Yeah, ladies first, perhaps.
Taliesin: Ladies first.
Laura: All right, can I try to shoot an arrow into the little hole?
Matt: You can. This is a hard shot because it's at an angle now. We're talking, this is Robin Hood-level split-the-arrow. Because you have to hit it and then ricochet upward to see if it'll have any effect.
Laura: Oh, jeez Louise.
Travis: Well, get up there.
Marisha: I place my hands on her shoulders--
Travis: Can you inspire?
Sam: I can inspire her.
Marisha: And I give her Enhance Ability.
Sam: Ooh, Enhance Ability.
Laura: Okay, what does that mean?
Marisha: You have advantage on-- oh, ability checks. It's just ability checks.
Matt: Ability checks. It's not going to help for an attack.
Laura: This is, what, an attack?
Marisha: Never mind.
Matt: This would be an attack.
Travis: I would like to offer my beard for a rub of good luck.
Laura: Thanks, Grog.
Matt: As you offer the beard, it tears off.
Travis: What?
Ashley: Oh, no!
Travis: What did you do?!
Laura: You know what, I'm going to tie this to the arrow. It's going to give it really good luck.
Sam: That seems like it's aerodynamically--
Laura: I'm not actually going to tie it to the arrow.
Taliesin: Okay!
Laura: I'm just going to tuck it--
Matt: Mark in your inventory, you now have Fake Grog Rope Beard.
Travis: Is that a -1 to my confidence now?
Matt: (laughs) It will come into play.
Travis: (cries)
Orion: So the goal is to shoot an arrow into this-- like the Death Star?
Matt: Essentially, yeah.
Laura: Yeah.
Orion: Okay, cool. As I see her ready, I'm going to hold up my hand with my ring and point it right at that hole.
Matt: To do--
Laura: So you can deflect it if I--
Orion: I got your back.
Laura: All right, thanks, Tiberius.
Orion: Get it, Vex.
Matt: All right, and you're going to--
Sam: I'm going to inspire her. With inspiration. I'll sing, (sings) Ooh ooh, shut up and shoot that hole! Your arrow is my destiny, yeah I said,
All: (sings) Ooh ooh, shut up and shoot that hole! (laughs)
Matt: And with that, you feel your focus, you wait, you breathe in, you breathe out, you breathe in, you breathe out in pattern with the slamming of the piston against the ceiling.
Laura: Oh, I'm so nervous.
Ashley: Get it, get it, get it, you're going to do it.
Matt: You let out all your breath and you hold, hold, hold, waiting between heartbeats, and then (twwt), release. Go ahead and make your attack roll.
Laura: I'm going to roll the fancy one we got last week.
Liam: Get it, girl. Get it.
Laura: All right. (laughs) Oh, no. Okay. I add my attack bonus?
Matt: Yes, you do.
Sam: Plus an inspiration.
Laura: Plus an inspiration dice?
Matt: Plus a d10.
Orion: Oh, shit.
Marisha: (whispering) It's so quiet.
Orion: I know.
Laura: Oh, that's awesome! Okay. 35. (yelling)
Travis: Good inspiration.
Matt: As you release the arrow, you see the pillars slamming. The pillar comes down just as the arrow crests over it, past another pillar that just barely manages to miss it by a segment.
Orion: I cast Telekinesis to swoop it up. (whoosh)
Sam: Oh, god.
Orion: Just to help and guide it.
Ashley: No, but it's already gone in.
Travis: We don't need it! We don't need it!
Laura: Oh, let me just see if I got it first!
Liam: She rolled a 35, we don't need shit.
Orion: It's going in there, anyway. I don't even have to roll.
Matt: So. As the pillar pulls down, the arrow goes cascading forward. Go ahead and make a d20 roll with the +5 modifier.
Orion: Sweet. That's 17.
Matt: 17? Okay. So as the arrow makes its way, it ricochets off the bottom edge of the actual hole and immediately bends itself upward, the shaft bending. As it begins to start heading up the hole, there's a sudden force of arcane energy that slams it even harder up into the top of this tiny little slit.
Travis: Yeah, good.
Matt: As it goes up there, you hear what sounds like a splintering of wood and metal. Then you hear metal grinding. You start seeing bits and chunks of grinding metal begin to pour out of the hole and the pillars begin to (scraping stone).
Laura: Hey.
Ashley: Yeah.
Travis: Nice shot!
Ashley: Yeah, Vex!
Matt: Eventually coming to a halt.
Marisha: A wrench in the machine.
Taliesin: I could have done it.
Laura: You totally could have done that.
Taliesin: I could have made that shot.
Sam: Next room's yours.
Taliesin: Yes, next room, next room's all mine.
Orion: That was one of those impossible things, right?
Matt: Pretty damn close to impossible.
Orion: I knew it.
Laura: Nice.
Marisha: (laughs) Pretty damn close to impossible.
Sam: All right, let's go across and heal our rogue.
Travis: Yeah, we walk across.
Laura: Yeah, all right.
Liam: As they come to the other side, I clutch my broken rib and injuredly hold a hand up and give a half-assed high-five to my sister. (grunts)
Laura: Good job getting slammed into the roof like that.
Liam: Yeah, you're welcome.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: All right.
Marisha: So can we take a short rest to heal up and then also a short rest to take a short rest in real life?
Matt: You can. We're going to go ahead and stop here. You're now taking a short rest.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: You guys take a moment. If you want to go ahead and heal up using any of your hit dice, you're able to, Vax.
Marisha: I'm going to do that.
Sam: Me, too.
Matt: And on that note, we're going to go ahead and take our five-minute break here, guys.
Travis: Cool.
Sam: Five.
Matt: While the party takes a short rest, we're taking a five-minute rest. We've got to be done by ten tonight with the stream, so.
Sam: Let's do it.
Laura: Woo.
Matt: So we're going to take a five-minute break.
Sam: True five. True five.
Matt: Orion, if you want to go ahead and come over, we're going to go ahead and give you guys-- yes, sir?
Zac: Bring them on up.
Matt: Okay, yeah, so we're going to go ahead and introduce our guests and give them an overview of the charity that we have currently on the stream tonight.
Travis: That was great work, though.
Laura: Yes.
Marisha: Oh my god, I rolled two eights in a row.
Taliesin: Nice!
Marisha: That's awesome.
Matt: I'm going to pass this over to Orion.
Orion: Okay.
Matt: Come on over. Gonna enjoy my chickens.
Sam: Don't forget to go to Teespring and buy our T-shirts.
Laura: Oh, let-- no! We haven't even talked about it at all!
Matt: Yes! By the way, our T-shirts are on Teespring. We'll have six more days.
Sam: Six more days.
Marisha: They also just went up on our website, on critrole.com. So you can go to our website and find the link.
Matt: All right, guys, we'll see you in a little bit. Meanwhile, take it away.
Sam: I'm going to tweet the Teespring link right now.
Zac: Lucas, go fullscreen.
Marisha: Sam is tweeting it.
Orion: Give me that chair.
Zac: Cool. Are you good, man?
Orion: Yeah.
Zac: Sweet.
Orion: We had points. We had points. Are we standing for this?
Taylor: Yeah.
Orion: Tell me that for the chat thing. Hi, everybody! Orion Acaba here and Taylor Carol. This is our special guest. And he's with GameChanger, and he has a couple of things to say for this particular awesome charity that we are working with today with SquareEnix and the Deus Ex anniversary.
Taylor: Yeah.
Marisha: Taylor!
Taylor: Well, first of all, on behalf of GameChanger, I just want to say what a blast it is to be with you guys. Personally, I've never watched D&D before. You guys have made me a huge fan.
Orion: Yes.
Taylor: And, yeah. So a little bit of backstory about GameChanger. About nine years ago, I was diagnosed terminal form of cancer. I was given about two weeks left to live, but thankfully it's been a long two weeks. I'm totally healthy now. (cheers)
Taylor: Thank you. But when I was sick, the most incredible thing that I saw was the impact that video games had on the people and on the children that were fighting cancer and other rare diseases. And witnessing the incredible good of the game community of video games. My dad and I resolved to make an organization that used and capitalized on that incredible good of the video games, of the gaming community, to help those suffering from rare diseases. And so one year later, GameChanger charity was born, and we started out just collecting games from the incredible gaming community, giving them back to kids suffering from rare diseases. And seven years later it evolved into what we have now. Now we're sponsored with some incredible gaming organizations like Square. A huge thanks to them for partnering with us for this awesome campaign. But yeah, today we go into hospitals and do things called GameChanger days where we go and we bring food for the staff, for the families, for the kids suffering from rare diseases. We bring them gaming packages so they can bond together. We provide college scholarships, and we really just try and provide hope and inspiration-- the same hope and inspiration that games really provided me when I was sick.
Orion: Yeah. That's awesome. And we here at--
Taylor: Oh, thank you. No, thank you guys.
Orion: And we here at Critical Role really love organizations like yours, which is why when we started talking, it was such a nice partnership for you to come on and tell us about this organization. Tell everybody where they can find to help, if they wanted to send to GameChanger.
Taylor: Yeah, GameChanger. Yeah.
Orion: Yeah, where would they go for that, to check it out?
Taylor: To support GameChanger, to learn more about what we do, you can visit www.gamechangercharity.org, and if you go to our website, you can see our campaign with Deus Ex. You can go online and if you donate anything more than a dollar, you get a free copy, a director's cut--
Orion: Oh! Well, awesome. That's cool. I'll probably do that too. It sounds like it's pretty sweet. And I want to thank you, the rest, with all of us. I'm doing this because I'm currently fighting cancer. I have-- I don't have that bad of a trek to go through, but it is very inconvenient and painful, but hearing stories like you. I mean, you're 20. He has a beautiful singing voice. He's a singer. And you're going to Harvard, is that what's going on?
Taylor: I am, yeah, I'm a rising junior.
Orion: Stupid doctors, they don't know shit. But people like you inspire me, because up until a few months ago, I didn't need any of that kind of inspiration. So it's great, and your organization's great, so we just wanted to thank you for coming on and speaking with everybody and letting everybody know, and we'll be working together in the future, too, and we'll be doing lots of fun stuff, so yeah. Check these guys out, please.
Laura: Donate, donate.
Ashley: What are you studying at Harvard?
Taylor: I am an English concentrator.
Orion: Whoa.
Marisha: Nice.
Taylor: Yeah, yeah.
Laura: I don't even know what that means.
Orion: Hold on a second. Do you mean like you concentrate on English?
Taylor: (English accent) English primarily.
Orion: Oh, very good. Okay, cool. That's like my second language.
Taylor: You guys have to teach me better accents. I love all of your accents.
Orion: (laughs) Any other questions for our guest, guys?
Zac: I'd like to let everybody know, the mods all have access to the GameChanger command in the chatroom, so if you guys are watching and are not in the chat, just join the chat really quick and you guys will be able to get that link for the donation link to get Deus Ex and anything over a dollar and you get a copy of the game. We're going to go ahead and let that run all the way throughout the rebroadcast and throughout the weekend, so mods, just keep spamming that throughout the chat.
Laura: So donations tonight are going to GameChanger, yeah?
Orion: Yeah.
Zac: It's up to you guys whether or not you want 826LA to go to GameChanger because the link right now just goes to Critical Role, so it's up to you guys for where it goes from there.
Orion: So we can do that.
Laura: Awesome. I think donations tonight will definitely go to GameChanger, yeah.
Orion: Yeah, so that's what we'll do. Awesome!
Taylor: Thank you all.
Orion: Right now. That's the decision.
Taylor: Go team.
Marisha: Tell them it's the last day.
Orion: And this is our last day. Is that right?
Taylor: Yes, so this is the last day to get your copy--
Orion: For the Deus Ex thing.
Zac: Okay, then I will not let it run over the weekend.
Orion: Yeah. But again, dude, thank you for coming on.
Taylor: Hey, thank you.
Orion: And we'll break because I have to pee really bad. But thank you so much.
Taylor: Thank you.
Zac: So guys, just to be clear, all of your donations tonight will go towards GameChanger, but if you want a copy of the game, just go and donate a dollar on the link that we have access to in the chatroom. And just so you guys know, there will not be time for them to read messages tonight after the show. Lucas and I both have to catch a flight, so sorry. We'll get to them next time.
Taylor: Anything more than a dollar.
Zac: Anything more than a dollar, to be clear. Anything more than a dollar.
Ashley: Go donate. Just do it!
Zac: Listen to Ashley. We're also really close to another giveaway, guys. If you guys subscribe, I think we're only like ten away from another giveaway, a large giveaway, which is a signed Player's Handbook and a signed photo of the cast. And every 50 we'll do a giveaway until the show's over tonight. We will not be going late, so just keep in mind, guys, don't send Geek & Sundry messages upset that your message wasn't read. We'll get to it next time. We appreciate you guys donating and Lucas, go ahead and go to drop cam. Yeah, go drop cam. [break]
Matt: Welcome back.
Zac: I had a really quick announcement before we get back into the game. The winner is Paula Konito, so congratulations--
Marisha: Paula Konito!
Matt: Paula Konito, congrats!
Marisha: Paula Konito!
Zac: -- and I understand that we crashed their website for donations--
Matt: (laughs)
Ashley: What?
Zac: So congratulations, guys, for crashing the website, but what is not crashed is our donation link, so if you scroll down and click on the 826LA link, all of the donations that are made tonight they've said will go to GameChanger
Laura: Yeah, the portion of the donations that would normally go to 826LA tonight are going to go to GameChanger.
Zac: So just scroll down on the channel page, click on 826LA or the donate link that's being spammed in the chat room, and all of those donations will go to GameChanger. And they let us know before they left, they just got 10,000 more Deus Ex keys, so we will let that run throughout the weekend.
Travis: That's amazing.
Laura: Oh, awesome.
Orion: Nice!
Zac: So the mods will keep spamming that throughout the weekend and you guys can donate throughout the rebroadcast and things like that for a one-dollar Deus Ex code.
Laura: Anything over a dollar.
Zac: Anything over a dollar, yeah.
Matt: That's so awesome.
Zac: One-oh-one! Enjoy Deus Ex.
Matt: Yeah! Thank you guys so much.
Laura: It would be good if you donated more than one dollar, if you want.
Taliesin: It's still needed.
Matt: The Critters are strong. The Critters are legion.
Travis: It is. They are.
Matt: It's amazing the things we can do.
Orion: It is on. YES.
Taliesin: There are Critters in the walls.
Marisha: They're in the god--
Marisha: -- damn walls!
Taliesin: -- damn walls!
Taliesin: Thank you for being there with me on that.
Matt: All righty, so! Back into the fray.
Laura: Oh, god, okay.
Matt: You guys, after finishing your short rest, healing up various wounds in that circumstance--
Sam: (plays note on flute) (laughter)
Matt: You make your way, playing a fancy little ditty on the flute. You make your way down this long, long staircase. You continue down for, I'd say, probably a good hundred feet or so before you start encountering, I'll say, a mild change in the scenery, at least. What was normally just a musty hallway is becoming thicker and thicker coated with large spiderwebs.
Laura: Ugh.
Travis: Awesome.
Orion: Everything's so sticky.
Ashley: Spiders!
Matt: You manage to push through and cut through, but it gets to the point where it's just so matted you guys are having to bushwhack your way through as if you had a machete.
Taliesin: I'm not taking off my mask.
Travis: Can I turn to one of those (clears throat) Scalebearers and ask if they've ever dealt with any umber-hulks in this region.
Matt: Scalebearer Vorak gives kind of a curious look to your question. Scalebearer Desona looks to you and says, "No, I don't believe they exist in this region. Nor this close to the surface, as far as I know."
Travis: Right. That's important, isn't it.
Orion: Are the spiderwebs-- are they becoming more as we traverse--
Matt: Yes, they're getting thicker and thicker.
Orion: Okay, so I'm going to make my way towards the front of the group because I'm noticing this and I'm going to do a Fire Breath, and I'm going to instantly cast Control Flame and catch as much as I can of it, and start spinning it, burning the webs as we go.
Matt: Okay. Very cool. So, Tiberius steps forward and breathes a heating breath of dragon fire out of his mouth. As it cascades forward, burning through the nearby webs, he casts a secondary spell and captures it and begins to shape it, almost like it's a fiery clay in the middle of the air. And he utilizes it in a very similar way to how he uses Telekinesis and begins to use that rolling fire to burn through the webbing as you guys continue down the stairway.
Laura: Nice.
Taliesin: That's convenient.
Marisha: At least it'll be disinfected.
Orion: Mm-hm-hm. Fire cleans all.
Matt: It also leaves a terrible stench. Burning web has this awful kind of--
Travis: Burnt hair?
Matt: It's similar. Burnt hair with burnt plastic, if you can think of it-- it's awful.
Laura: What's plastic?
Matt: This is more for your own player knowledge, sensory knowledge. (laughter)
Matt: The sound of crackling of the nearby webbing that's slowly retracting and burning and melting is immediately joined by the sound of a low clicking. (groaning)
Laura: I stealth immediately.
Marisha: Oh, that frickin' sound. Do we-- I can try to cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us, if we want to sneak through here.
Laura: Oh, yeah, that would be good!
Marisha: Do you want to try to sneak through?
Travis: Yeah, do it.
Marisha: I cast Pass Without a Trace.
Travis: Now let's vogue. This changes every time!
Orion: Sweet!
Matt: All right, so Pass Without a Trace is cast, while you two both make stealth rolls.
Laura: So, with the Pass Without a Trace?
Matt: With the Pass Without a Trace, yes.
Laura: 31.
Orion: (quietly, to Marisha) Is my magic on stealth, too?
Liam: 24.
Matt: With the plus ten?
Liam: Plus ten from what? Say again?
Laura: Pass Without a Trace.
Matt: Keyleth cast Pass Without a Trace.
Liam: Oh, 34.
Matt: All right. You guys dart off to the side, kind of using the remnants of the web to block your physical forms. The boiling fire that has been placed ahead of you is starting to reflect small little points of reflected light throughout the shadows in the distance that are moving towards you as you see giant hairy arachnid legs.
Orion: I back up! I have my cloak on. And I'm going to go ahead and cast Stoneskin. That's what I do right now.
Matt: You cast Stoneskin? I'm going to go ahead and ask--
Marisha: I'm also going to cast Stoneskin.
Laura: Can I cast, while they're coming-- where did I write it down?
Sam: I'm going to go invisible.
Laura: Never mind, I can't find my spell.
Sam: This is exciting, guys. There's a board of some sort.
Laura: I cast Entangle on the ground.
Matt: In front?
Laura: Yeah.
Sam: You have-- you can cast things?
Laura: (quickly) Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Orion: (quietly) Yeah, she's a ranger, she can cast stuff.
Travis: Apparently.
Taliesin: As long as it's at range.
Sam: Grog, you've got a beard spell.
Travis: I do.
Taliesin: That was my terrible joke and I wish I hadn't. Now I'm embarrassed.
Travis: I can also cast Flatulence.
Sam: And you have Frenzied Rage.
Matt: All right. You can now see skittering off to the side what appear to be a series of large arachnid-like creatures. As you cast Entanglement, you can--
Laura: I'm reading it now.
Matt: Go ahead and read the spell.
Orion: Did I manage to catch with the Control Flame my entire Fire Breath when I did that? And I'm controlling it still?
Matt: Currently you are.
Laura: Oh, that's not what it was. That's the wrong spell. Sorry, sorry, it's Spike Growth, is the spell.
Sam: Spikes growth?
Laura: I cast Spike Growth.
Matt: Spike Growth, okay, that is different.
Laura: Yes, which is-- the ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range twists and sprouts hard spikes and thorns. It's difficult terrain for the duration, but anybody that can see me casting it doesn't take damage to it, it's only the people that don't see me casting it.
Marisha: Dope.
Sam: Really?
Matt: All right.
Laura: Yeah. Any creature that can't see the area at the time the spell is cast must make a wisdom check.
Orion: Cool.
Sam: All right, but can they see the area?
Matt: They can see the area.
Laura: Oh. Well, that's not quite the same thing, then, what I saw. (yells) Forget it, my spell is stupid!
Sam: No, no!
Orion: It's fine, just not in a hallway with stairs.
Laura: I know!
Sam: It's fine, just stick to arrows, really.
Ashley: She can do so much more than just arrows!
Orion: As I see this, can I release my Control Flame and let the Fire Breath just happen, and not control it anymore?
Matt: Looking into your spell now. Oh, Control Flames is a cantrip. You are able to control just enough fire to burn away the things. It wouldn't actually do any damage if released. Control Fire kind of like captures an element of it.
Orion: Okay. So that's what I was using, the element of what I did.
Matt: Yeah.
Orion: So I used it so I could have the fire.
Matt: Exactly.
Orion: Got it.
Matt: You set it as a catalyst to it.
Laura: They can see the ground.
Matt: They can.
Laura: Then no, don't cast it.
Travis: Doesn't it mess up the ground if we try to walk through it?
Laura: Not you guys, but they--
Marisha: But they're spiders. They're probably not that wise.
Orion: Can I cast something else?
Matt: No. Right now everyone rolls initiative.
Orion: Damn it!
Ashley: Ugh.
Matt: There are only so many things you can do here, Tiberius.
Orion: I know, but I like doing lots of things.
Matt: I know you do.
Marisha: That's not bad! I'll take that.
Sam: I lost my dice.
Laura: That's my punishment.
Travis: Fuck, yeah.
Taliesin: I love my new stats.
Laura: I don't think that should count.
Taliesin: I rolled terribly this time but my stats are good.
Sam: Every time, every time.
Orion: What?
Sam: I've never rolled a double digit initiative roll, ever.
Matt: Oh, Scanlan, but you roll when it counts.
Travis: Just Wil Wheaton roll every time you do initiative.
Taliesin: Is that what we're calling it? Wheatoning?
Travis: Yeah, Wheatoning.
Laura: Wheatoning? Yeah.
Taliesin: All right.
Travis: Wheatoning.
Sam: (announcer voice) Wha-Wha-Wheaton.
Matt: All right, so. 25-20.
Ashley: Natural 20. (yelling)
Ashley: I don't think that ever happens when it's like damage or something.
Matt: That's okay.
Laura: 23.
Ashley: I'm gonna go with it.
Matt: Okay, so 23. Grog, what have you got?
Travis: 21.
Matt: Okay, so we've got Vex, Grog, and Pike, what's your dex? What's your initiative bonus?
Ashley: Nothing.
Matt: Nothing, so 20. All right. 20 to 15?
Marisha: 17.
Matt: 17, Keyleth.
Orion: 15.
Taliesin: 16.
Matt: All right, Percy. Tiberius. Vax?
Laura: He's gone.
Matt: Has left the screen.
Travis: Oh, really?
Sam: Great.
Ashley: Last.
Matt: I'm going to consider that a low initiative.
Marisha: Oh-ho-ho-ho.
Orion: He just went to go poop.
Sam: Seven!
Matt: Seven for Scanlan.
Orion: Or deal with--
Matt: All right, we'll get to his turn when we get to it.
Ashley: (yells) Vax!
Matt: It's okay. All right, Vex.
Marisha: Wait, there he is.
Sam: He's holding a cat.
Orion: He has a cat.
Sam: It's Trinket! It's Trinket!
Matt: What did you roll for initiative?
Liam: That is a 16.
Matt: 16?
Orion: Okay.
Travis: Get your head out of your ass.
Sam: He's Dr. Evil. (laughter)
Matt: All right, Vex.
Laura: Me?
Matt: Yes.
Laura: Oh! I'm going to cast Conjure Barrage at all of the spiders coming at us.
Matt: All righty.
Laura: I'm going to Hunter's Mark whatever one looks the biggest.
Matt: Okay, from this position you will also hit Tiberius to hit all the spiders.
Laura: Oh, where am I?
Matt: You're right here.
Laura: Oh.
Travis: You gotta do what you gotta do. (laughs) Sorry.
Matt: I mean, you could--
Laura: I'm going to move to where I'm in the middle of them. I'm still kind of stuck.
Matt: Right there?
Marisha: Get it!
Laura: Yeah, and then I'll Conjure Barrage from there.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: (quietly) Don't encourage it.
Laura: I cast Hunter's Mark on the biggest one I see.
Matt: Okay, this one here is one of the larger ones.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: So I'm going to go ahead and mark that one. So go ahead and-- Conjure Barrage does what damage?
Travis: (quietly) Hate it.
Laura: It does 3d8 on all creatures.
Matt: Do they get a saving throw?
Laura: They get-- yes, they do. They get half-damage if they save.
Matt: Mmkay. What's the DC on your spells?
Laura: (in a funny gruff voice) My DC is 14.
Orion: (laughs)
Matt: All righty.
Orion: (mimicking Laura's gruff voice) MemememememeME.
Marisha: What's your DC, girl?
Laura: Okay.
Marisha: What's yo digits? Gimme those stats.
Matt: Okay, all you need--
Laura: Do I need to roll for attack?
Matt: Only this one makes it.
Laura: Oh, sweet!
Matt: No, the barrage just happens. They're all caught in it.
Laura: Okay, cool.
Matt: So all of them take full damage, except for this one takes half damage, so go ahead and roll the damage on that.
Laura: Okay. 3d8. 15, and then 20 for the big one with the Hunter's Mark.
Matt: All righty. So. So you moved, did that. Do you want to move Trinket as well?
Laura: Can I have Trinket attack?
Matt: Trinket--
Laura: Oh, that's a lot of them.
Matt: Well, that, and the spell you cast was an action. Trinket can attack as part of your attack round.
Laura: Okay, so I get a second attack?
Matt: Well, no, your spell was an action. So that's your turn. You do Conjure Barrage instead of your attack.
Laura: Cool, I'm going to step back against the wall.
Matt: All right, so you step back there. Do you want to move Trinket anywhere in particular?
Laura: Nah, he can't really get anywhere, it's fine.
Matt: All right, Trinket is there and-- (bear noises)
Laura: It's good times, guys.
Matt: Angrily, a growl in the distance. Grog, you're up.
Travis: I'd like to hold my turn.
Sam: What?
Orion: Ooh, yeah!
Matt: All right, Grog holds initiative.
Orion: Strategy.
Marisha: Must be something good.
Matt: Pike, you're up.
Ashley: Okay, how far can I move up to use a Spiritual Weapon? I can't tell where I'm at. I'm sorry, I didn't wear my glasses.
Matt: I mean, you can move through your allies without an issue. You can shift through your own guys without a problem.
Ashley: Okay, so I would like to cast a golden spiderweb of thorns.
Sam: Ooh.
Laura: (gasps) What?
Marisha: Ooh.
Orion: (laughs) Nice!
Taliesin: Fancy.
Matt: All right. Okay.
Ashley: And encase the spiders.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: That's cool.
Matt: Okay. (laughter)
Ashley: Like a thorny net.
Matt: This would be considered a net, if we are considering a weapon that you are conjuring for this.
Ashley: I'm just making it look really pretty.
Matt: Right.
Ashley: Basically.
Travis: (quietly) It looks so pretty.
Matt: So the effect of this-- I'm letting you hit multiple guys with this. It would not do any damage.
Ashley: It wouldn't do any damage, it would just contain them?
Matt: It would possibly have an effect on their ability--
Ashley: Even if they're thorny? Even like holy thorns? Oh.
Matt: It would be very itchy for them.
Ashley: All right, you know what?
Orion: Oh. Well, I mean, that's not out of--
Laura: I think you should stick with it, it's awesome.
Sam: Yeah, man, commit.
Ashley: Okay. Contain them.
Orion: Yeah, it's thematic.
Ashley: Contain them and then somebody could just--
Laura: Fireball.
Ashley: Throw fire, a fireball at them.
Matt: All right, go ahead and roll a d20 and then add five to it.
Ashley: Okay. 12.
Matt: 12? Okay. These four in the immediate front, right there, as you bring back your mace in the air, you kind of hang onto the side with the leather strap around your wrist. You reach up and grab your holy symbol. As you release the holy symbol to hold your hand up, divine energy streaks out from your fingertips and forms into this kind of gold and silver net. As your arm is doing this kind of throwing animation in the air like that, the net shoots out from the front and spreads down onto the spiders and contracts around. You can see it catches them and they start scrambling inside. These front four are considered grappled. (cheering)
Ashley: All right, all right!
Matt: The one in the back managed to avoid it.
Orion: Cool.
Laura: Nice!
Marisha: Nice!
Matt: That's it? That brings it to Keyleth.
Marisha: Okay, with that new development--
Orion: Wait. Can you do lightning?
Marisha: I can. I'm going to do Poison Spray, though. Where am I right now?
Matt: You're right here. Behind Pike as she threw her giant golden net.
Marisha: I'm going to be like, 'scuse me, 'scuse me, Pike, 'scuse me. Sorry, sorry.
Ashley: Yes? Oh, go through, go through, go go go!
Marisha: Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Ashley: Tag you in! Tag you in!
Marisha: (whoosh) Poison Spray! It's a ten-foot cone.
Matt: Ten-foot cone. If you want to get right up in here you could get these three there.
Marisha: I'll do that.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: (whoosh) So, it's a constitution saving throw.
Matt: Okay. This one succeeds, this one fails, this one fails.
Sam: (singing along with the battle music) It's the music that means we're having a fight.
Matt: All right. So, this one succeeds, so no damage, but these two take damage. Go ahead and roll it.
Marisha: Okay, so they take 2d12. Six. Ugh. Seven damage.
Matt: Seven damage to each.
Marisha: It's not great. I think he takes half damage, though, even though he fails.
Matt: Does he? I think Poison Mist--
Marisha: Poison Spray.
Matt: Oh, Poison Spray. It's a cantrip. I think it's damage or nothing.
Marisha: Oh, yeah, I guess so.
Matt: All right. It's your move, do you want to keep moving or do you want to stay where you are?
Marisha: Can I get out of everyone's way?
Matt: You're currently-- actually, down from where you cast it, you would be able to move out, yeah.
Marisha: Can I back up a little bit? Yeah.
Matt: You can, they're still grappled.
Marisha: I just kind of want to-- yeah.
Matt: To there. All right.
Marisha: Your turn!
Matt: That ends your turn. Vax, Percy.
Taliesin: Please, be my guest.
Liam: Did you say Vax, Percy?
Matt: Yes.
Travis: Yep.
Liam: I'm doing my best seeing from where I can see here. Keyleth is right in front of me?
Matt: She was. She just pulled behind you.
Marisha: I moved behind.
Laura: Now you're in front of the spiders.
Marisha: You're good, you're in front.
Liam: Okay, there's a little bit of distance, so I'm just going to start hucking daggers at them. I'm going to start with dagger of life stealing.
Marisha: You're only two squares away.
Liam: That is a 16 to hit.
Matt: 16 to hit? Hits.
Liam: Okay, so that is four, six, is ten of damage.
Matt: All right.
Liam: Then the keen dagger follows. That is a 27.
Matt: That hits.
Liam: That hits for ten damage, and then--
Laura: You're killing them!
Liam: And then the flametongue dagger.
Matt: You're not Hasted anymore, by the way.
Liam: You're right, forget it, yeah, forget that last. That's right, two.
Matt: So as you're off to the side hiding among the slowly burning webbing, you move around, huck both daggers. One strikes a spider right in the center of where its eyes are and it screeches for a second before it curls up, its legs kind of pulling into its torso. The other one begins to pull out of the net that Pike set, and as it does you throw the secondary dagger. It strikes it in its abdomen, and the blade retracts and returns to your belt, and as it does, it leaves this streak of greenish liquid. And you have a better view of these spiders now. Go ahead and make a nature check, both Keyleth and Vex.
Marisha: Dope.
Orion: By the way, I'm here, but I'm also there.
Marisha: Natural 20. (yelling)
Matt: You're also there?
Orion: Cloak of Displacement.
Laura: Good, because I rolled an eight.
Matt: Oh.
Orion: There's like two of me.
Matt: All right. So, Keyleth
Sam: (whistles with the battle music)
Matt: You notice as most spider-like creatures go, you're used to like the darker, furry, wolf-spider types. These have a different color. Their physical bodies are more white and blue. Their coloration is mostly white but with a kind of bluish hue to it and their eyes are almost pink-white in color.
Laura: Ugh.
Ashley: Because they live underground. There's no sunlight.
Matt: They're a very strange, different kind of spider.
Liam: I don't like this.
Marisha: Is that all I know, with my natural 20?
Matt: You haven't encountered too many types of arachnids, but there's something about them that seems loosely themed in the ethereal.
Laura: Oh.
Marisha: Hm.
Matt: You in your experience, you've heard of certain spiders that can travel through the planes rapidly.
Orion: Now damn plane spiders?
Travis: Maybe we don't have to kill it, maybe they just (pfft).
Marisha: Gotcha. Hey, guys, I think these are like magical bamf-ing spiders.
Orion: Oh.
Taliesin: Okay.
Sam: Cool, bro, let's kill them.
Marisha: Yeah, let's kill them.
Taliesin: There's one spider that's not caught?
Laura: There's what, there's three spiders left?
Matt: Yes, one back here.
Taliesin: All right, I'm going to take a couple of shots at it with my Sharpshooter, so let's start with 24 to hit?
Matt: What was it?
Taliesin: 24 to hit?
Matt: That hits.
Taliesin: And let's do this. My first shot--
Sam: Ka-pew!
Taliesin: That's depressing. Well, I get the bonus, so that's 18 points of damage.
Matt: 18 points of damage? All righty.
Marisha: That's not too depressing.
Ashley: That's not depressing at all.
Travis: That's not depressing.
Taliesin: That's not too depressing. It's because I'm taking a negative five to hit.
Laura: Oh.
Taliesin: And that's-- oh, that's not bad. I have new numbers. 16 to hit.
Matt: 16 does also hit, yeah.
Taliesin: Aha!
Matt: Same target?
Taliesin: Same target, with an added fire bonus. Three fire damage and 17 as well.
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: 17 plus three fire damage.
Ashley: That bonus is awesome.
Laura: He is so dead.
Matt: (gunshot noise) That spider gets splattered. You see there's a burst of flame and a (explosion noise) as its body is knocked in the air, torn asunder, and then consumed by the flame burst at the same time. You see what looks like a scattering of ash across the ground and the steps beneath it.
Marisha: It looks like flash paper?
Matt: Essentially, yeah.
Taliesin: And I duck back behind Grog. (laughter)
Travis: Where are you going?
Matt: All right. These two spiders that are currently caught in the net both (whoosh) vanish and the net falls flat.
Laura: Oh, bamf-ing spiders.
Matt: (teleportation noise)
Taliesin: Oh, shit.
Matt: One is striking at you.
Laura: Me?
Matt: That is a 21 to hit.
Laura: It hits me.
Matt: And against Percy, that is a 25.
Taliesin: Oh my god, that hits.
Matt: All right. You both take 13 points of piercing damage
Taliesin: Ow!
Matt: And I need you both to make a constitution saving throw. (groaning)
Taliesin: Oh, bugger.
Marisha: That can't be good.
Taliesin: 13 points of piercing damage?
Matt: Mm-hm.
Marisha: They poofed. Poofers.
Laura: 17? Oh, wait. 19.
Matt: 19 constitution saving throw.
Taliesin: Constitution saving throw. (blows raspberry)
Marisha: Oh, no, Percy!
Taliesin: Rolled a one.
Matt: So as all of a sudden, the strange (teleportation noise) sound streaks behind you, you turn over your shoulder just in time to see the spiders pop out of seemingly nowhere and strike into you. The fangs sink into your side and you knock them off with your elbow.
Laura: (grunts in pain)
Matt: You feel the venom extract itself from the fangs, but just as you pull it out of the side, so it actually does not envenom your body. Percy, you're not so lucky. The venom pulses into the side of your shoulder.
Taliesin: (groans in pain)
Matt: And you feel this burning sensation ripple through your entire upper right torso. You take 21 points of poison damage.
Marisha: Oh, shit!
Liam: What was that number, again?
All: 21.
Sam: He's fine, he's fine.
Marisha: Is that all it does, just poison him?
Matt: Yep.
Taliesin: I am poisoned, though.
Matt: You are not considered poisoned. It's the damage that's poison.
Laura: Oh, it's straight-up damage.
Marisha: Okay, that's not too bad.
Taliesin: It could be worse.
Matt: That ends their turn. Tiberius? You're still holding your turn, Grog?
Travis: Mm-hm.
Marisha: I did take Protection From Poison.
Laura: I should cast that on us.
Marisha: If that's necessary.
Matt: All right, Tiberius?
Orion: So we're in a hallway, a stairwell?
Matt: Yes, it's a stairway heading down, essentially, right here, and then it evens out at the bottom point there.
Marisha: Fighting on the stairs.
Orion: Is it like a big--
Matt: It's about 15 feet up to the ceiling. Ten, 15.
Orion: Oh. Very well. How many are left, two?
Matt: Two.
Laura: Yeah.
Orion: Obelisk of Stone.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Squishy spiders.
Orion: Yeah, these squishy spiders.
Matt: So as both the spiders are knocked off both Percy and Vex, you guys kind of rear back, ready to defend yourselves. Suddenly the stairwell shakes for a second and pillars of stone go (stone crushing noises) from underneath. Similar to the trap room you encountered earlier.
Orion: That's it. 21.
Matt: 21? And what's the DC on your spell?
Orion: 17.
Matt: 17? Both spiders get mashed pretty horribly into the ceiling. You see where the pillars are slammed into the ceiling permanently. You can see the legs kind of dangling out for a second and then slowly curl in towards where the edge of the stone pillars are at the ceiling.
Laura: Eat it.
Marisha: Are there any corpses that are more accessible than the one that got torched and the ones that are squished?
Travis: Yeah, are there any spider fangs we can put in the bag?
Marisha: Yeah, because I have that book that helps me do that now.
Taliesin: There's the one I shot.
Matt: You can, actually, there are-- there's one that you shot. No, actually, the one that you killed is the one that burst into flame.
Taliesin: Yes, the one that burst into flame.
Matt: That one's not going to be salvageable. There's a few that you and Vex killed. Vex and Vax both just kind of wiped out a few of the spiders. Go ahead and make an herbalism roll.
Laura: Ooh, I bet we can get some of that poison. Dip the arrows in it.
Marisha: What did the book do again, gave me a plus or an advantage? Did it give me an advantage on rolls or like a plus something?
Matt: I asked you to write that down. I will say advantage.
Marisha: Oh, wait, you did ask me to write it down and I think I did.
Matt: Advantage or a bonus, which of the two is it?
Marisha: Oh, no, I didn't write it down, I just wrote that I have the books.
Matt: Ah. I don't remember what I did for that. I will say advantage. That's the easiest to remember.
Marisha: That's better. 24.
Matt: 24. You managed to extract two poison glands from one of the spiders. The other ones were too damaged beyond repair.
Laura: Ooh.
Orion: Sweet.
Marisha: Two poison glands.
Matt: Two small venom glands.
Orion: Nice.
Marisha: I give them to the twins.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Oh, we can just use them?
Matt: You don't know.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: She hands you two nasty-looking glands that are still wet with spider ichor.
Marisha: I got this for you guys.
Laura: Oh, thank you, Keyleth.
Travis: Do you want me to hold onto them?
Liam: That's very... that's sweet. I love it.
Laura: Tiberius, would you happen to have a little glass vial or something I could put this in?
Orion: I think I have two left.
Laura: Oh!
Orion: I need to get more.
Travis: I have them.
Orion: Oh, here we go. (pop)
Laura: Thank you.
Taliesin: (laughs) Well.
Travis: I'm like a Wal-Mart over here. You could have asked me, but that's cool.
Marisha: Your book helps.
Sam: I'm ready to make my attack turn.
Matt: All right. There is nothing there. (laughter)
Sam: I sheath my sword.
Matt: There you go. (laughter)
Taliesin: A little help here, please? Would be nice.
Ashley: Yes.
Laura: Oh. Oh, wait, I thought you weren't poisoned-- oh, you need healing because you are--
Ashley: What are you at?
Taliesin: I'm at 47.
Laura: Okay.
Ashley: Okay.
Sam: Eh, you're fine. Suck it up.
Ashley: I guess we all need some-- what's everybody else at?
Liam: Ah, that's what I was at after I healed myself with a handful of hit dice after getting crushed into the ceiling.
Laura: Yeah, but we took a short break and we're not doing that now.
Sam: Use your hit dice, you'll be fine.
Taliesin: I could just use my-- oh.
Ashley: Um, hold on.
Matt: Are you guys taking a short rest, is that what you're doing?
Laura: No.
Travis: No, no.
Marisha: No, we're good.
Ashley: Let me heal you up, Percy, hold on.
Laura: Can I ask a question while she's healing Percy?
Orion: We've taken a short rest already, right?
Marisha: Yeah.
Laura: The grappling arrow I used on the little halfling, I can get that back, right?
Matt: Yeah, you retrieved it.
Laura: Just making sure.
Sam: I'll continue on down the hallway.
Travis: I join him.
Matt: Keyleth, are you still using Pass Without a Trace?
Marisha: No.
Laura: No?
Sam: She had to break it to use Stoneskin.
Matt: It's a concentration spell, isn't it?
Marisha: Yeah, but I cast Stoneskin on myself.
Matt: You did. All right. So go ahead and make a stealth roll.
Marisha: Sorry.
Sam: Not good. Nine.
Travis: I'm with you.
Matt: Nine. All right.
Sam: (nasal voice) Nine.
Ashley: Nine, Percy.
Liam: I would like to continue to stealth ahead of the group and also continue checking for traps.
Sam: We already went.
Travis: Scanlan's already ahead of you.
Laura: Sam already said it.
Liam: Oh, he is?
Matt: As you stealthily move along the side of the wall, Scanlan comes pattering down the stonework.
Sam: Skipping.
Ashley: Percy, 18.
Taliesin: 18? Thank you.
Laura: Scanlan, no. (groans)
Matt: Into what is a large central chamber. You can see webbing scattered throughout the entirety of the stone room. It's about 60 feet up. There is very low light from the flickering sconces that are on the walls of this towards the base of the actual room. The building in the center, it looks almost like an ancient mausoleum structure, how it's placed in the center of the room. Closed stone doors. But what catches your eye is that the entirety of the structure seems to be crafted of the same platinum-like material as the container that you guys are carrying the horn in.
Laura: Oh, wow.
Sam: Oh, we made it.
Laura: Are there sapphires all over the walls in here, then?
Matt: Not the walls of the actual chamber itself, just this central building right there.
Orion: We're not stealing from this place.
Matt: Go ahead and make a perception check, anyone who wishes to look for traps.
Sam: While we're out there, I'm going to check--
Laura: (gasps) Oh no, that was my big fancy one.
Orion: Nice. I'm going to check for any arcane stuff and I got--
Liam: 14.
Matt: 14 perception.
Liam: Yeah, 14.
Orion: I'm going to check for 25.
Taliesin: 21.
Matt: Perception?
Taliesin: Perception, 21.
Matt: Okay. 25 for arcane?
Orion: Yeah.
Matt: Best you can gather, as far as the presence of any arcane in this room, the scrolling on the structure in front of you, there are elements of the scrolling that you can see are based in the arcane runes that are used for ritual inscribing, but there's nothing of any magic that you've ever been familiar with that is utilized in this structure. What did you roll?
Laura: Really, really high. Eight.
Matt: All right. So, who is moving in? Who wants to--
Sam: I moved in with Grog.
Travis: I move in as well.
Liam: I'm moving in.
Laura: Can I try to stealth and move alongside just kind of keep to the edge?
Ashley: Going in.
Travis: We're all going in.
Liam: Ditto, kiddo.
Matt: All right, you move off to the side, kind of pushing through some of the webs and there's still webs on the side of the room.
Orion: I'll keep close to the guards and the box.
Ashley: Yeah, I'll go in.
Laura: Okay, I rolled 18 on the stealth.
Matt: All righty.
Ashley: I'll go in close to Grog.
Matt: All righty.
Travis: Yeah.
Liam: I'm going to tail my sister, actually.
Matt: All right. (whoosh) You move around over here with your sister.
Laura: And Trinket's going to stay next to Keyleth.
Matt: All righty.
Marisha: Come here, Trinket.
Matt: So they'll go back to this point.
Sam: I'm going to go invisible.
Taliesin: Wait. I'm furry, but I'm not Trinket. Jesus Christ.
Marisha: (laughs)
Matt: All right, you are currently marked as invisible, Scanlan.
Laura: Can we see a spider in here, like a big spider?
Matt: You don't.
Marisha: There's always a big mama spider.
Laura: Okay, can I-- it's dark?
Matt: It's very low light.
Sam: No one's cast Light yet.
Orion: I know.
Laura: I'm going to use my Primeval Awareness and see if I can sense any spiders in the area.
Matt: Okay. You take a moment to concentrate and you sense-- while not in visible range, on the opposite side of this room, a whole bunch of tiny little life sources and one rather large one.
Laura: Good to know.
Travis: Shit.
Ashley: Ugh.
Laura: (whispers) Lots of spiders. Lots. I'm going to cast Protection From Poison on myself.
Matt: All right.
Travis: I cast Terminix.
Taliesin: (laughs)
Liam: I'm drinking a healing potion right now.
Matt: All righty.
Ashley: I'm going to do the same thing.
Marisha: Also, I'll go ahead and-- nah, nah, it's fine.
Taliesin: What does a level two healing potion do, again?
Marisha: I'm going to keep my Stoneskin up.
Ashley: Yeah, what's the level two?
Matt: Level two healing potion does 4d4 + 4.
Orion: I'm going to go use Greater Invisibility, as well.
Matt: Okay. All right. You are also considered invisible.
Sam: Why greater?
Orion: Because I can cast and still stay invisible.
Matt: All right, Kima pushes ahead through the group while you guys are doing this, walks up to the front of the chamber, and you see she takes the holy symbol around from her neck, the symbol of Bahamut, and much like she did to the doorway at the bottom of the temple earlier to find this initial passageway, she feels around in the scrolling and eventually finds a section of it and rotates what looks like a circular part of it that shifts and then pulls out. When she pulls it out, you can see there is a kind of engraving, there is a recessed engraving of the same shape as her holy symbol.
Laura: Before she touches anything, can I let her know that there's a whole lot of spiders on the other side of the room.
Matt: You may do that.
Sam: Wait, what? You didn't tell any of us that.
Travis: Can I shift to her right flank, just at the corner of the mausoleum structure? Right there.
Laura: Just so everybody's aware, those things we just fought? There's a ton more of them on the other side of this little chamber.
Sam: Oh, thanks for telling us.
Laura: No problem.
Matt: Grog, make a stealth check.
Marisha: (whispers) Be very quiet.
Travis: Oh, shit. Natural 20. (cheering)
Taliesin: Spiderman.
Laura: Good thing you took that beard off because it had bells and shit in it.
Travis: Oh, the beard is still there.
Sam: No, no, it fell off.
Travis: Its most majestic part fell off.
Sam: Oh.
Matt: Yeah. There's still some goliath peach fuzz there.
Travis: Substantial Viking-ness happening.
Matt: Grog, for a moment there, you recess into your old hunter training when you were traveling with your barbarian tribe and you take in the darkness around you and walk, fleet of foot, to the edge of it, not making a single sound. You're damn proud of yourself.
Travis: I am.
Taliesin: (whispers) Quietly.
Matt: So as you tell this to Kima, she goes, (whispers) "What? Spiders?"
Laura: (whispers) Lots and lots of spiders. Is that going to make noise?
Matt: (whispers) "I don't know. I haven't been in this chamber before."
Laura: Perhaps we should deal with the spiders before we make noise, or maybe just be prepared. In fact, you know what? I'm going to cast Spike Growth on the ground in between where they're going to have to walk through.
Marisha: Ooh, good. Smarty-pants.
Laura: Because they can't freaking see it right now, can they?
Matt: Which way?
Laura: Yeah, there, yeah.
Ashley: Both sides?
Matt: You said Spike Growth. How much does it affect?
Laura: It affects-- damn it-- I didn't put it in my thingy because I'm dumb. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Matt: That's okay.
Orion: You're not dumb. You're a strong, smart person.
Ashley: While she's looking, could I--
Laura: Spike Growth!
Ashley: You found it.
Taliesin: Way more than arrows.
Laura: It is a 20-foot radius. That's not that much.
Matt: Okay, cool. So you can do this whole area right here is all spiky growth.
Laura: And it's hard spikes. Hard spikes and thorns.
Matt: Good to know.
Taliesin: Briar.
Sam: All right, well, I'm going to follow suit and go to the other side and cast Stinking Cloud. No, over--
Matt: Over here?
Sam: Over there, yeah.
Travis: Our side's the best! (laughter)
Matt: Go ahead and make another stealth check.
Sam: Okay. 15. 17!
Matt: 17.
Sam: That's the best stealth I've ever done.
Ashley: Well done.
Travis: Yeah, buddy.
Matt: You quietly come by and mutter under your breath your arcane ritual and all of a sudden (quiet whoosh). And what was the size of the cloud on that one?
Sam: 30 feet, I think? I think it's 30 feet. Hold on, hold on, hold on. 90 feet! Oh, that's the range.
Matt: What's the radius?
Sam: It's a 20-foot radius.
Orion: Oh, your cards are cool!
Matt: 20-foot radius, which would be-- Actually, a 20-foot radius for this would be...
Orion: Nice, they have little bard thingies.
Marisha: Oh, they're purple. Mine has like a--
Orion: Nice color diversity!
Matt: This whole area here--
Laura: Oh, nice!
Orion: (laughs) Oh, I did see this.
Matt: This whole area here is done.
Marisha: I've got like a scythe.
Taliesin: A sickle.
Matt: And you also now make a very nasty cloud in this vicinity as well. This whole area is completely marked off on both sides now.
Orion: I'd like to walk up as I see this going on. I'm going to take out my deck of illusions. I'm going to toss two cards both ways, two cards on each side. So I'm going to do this, real quick.
Laura: Question. That chamber in the center of the room, does it go all the way to the ceiling, or is it--
Matt: No, there is a gap.
Orion: Deck of illusions, everyone.
Laura: So there's a huge-- so technically, the spiders could crawl up the ceiling and drop down on us?
Travis: Yes.
Matt: In theory?
Taliesin: Why would you give him ideas like that? Just feed him irony!
Travis: Let's go.
Orion: Ten of Hearts, Yes! Joker, Queen of Hearts, and another Joker! What?!
Sam: What does that mean?
Matt: Wait, you threw--
Orion: I put two on each side.
Matt: Oh, two on each side.
Orion: Yeah. So, like, two over in the spot before all that mess over there and two are in the other mess.
Ashley: Do you want to go one up top, just in case?
Laura: Yeah.
Travis: Yeah.
Orion: So the Jokers--
Matt: Are you.
Orion: And a female version of me.
Laura: Ooh, that's awesome.
Matt: All right, so a secondary Tiberius appears right there.
Orion: (falsetto) Hello, everyone.
Marisha: You know, you make a good woman.
Orion: (falsetto) Tiberiosa.
Matt: Female Tiberius appears over on that side.
Marisha: Tiberiosa.
Orion: And then whichever side you decide, a Queen of Hearts and Ten of Hearts.
Matt: Queen of Hearts-- oh, interesting.
Travis: (falsetto) Levi-O-sa, not levio-SA.
Matt: A succubus appears over here. Winged.
Marisha: Well, that's fun.
Matt: Sorry, what was the other one that you said?
Orion: Queen of Hearts and a Ten of Hearts.
Matt: Ten of Hearts. A cloud giant on this side of the room.
Laura: What?
Orion: (explosion noise)
Ashley: Rad.
Matt: We'll use that mini for now, it's fine. All of a sudden appear, kind of translucent, their image flickering. It's not a great illusion, but it's enough where it catches some attention.
Orion: And they're positioned right before the messes of each side.
Matt: Like right there.
Orion: Yeah.
Matt: All righty. Kima's now sitting there like, (whispers) "Put the key in now?"
Sam: No, no, do it.
Taliesin: Yes, yes, go.
Marisha: Okay, you're good. Go for it, yeah.
Matt: She puts her symbol into the recess. As it does, the stone doors shift and there's a dull kind of creaking of the stone as it slides not open, but into the walls, revealing an interior that is, as the light filters in, the entirety of the wall, floor, and ceiling of this room is of the same scrolling, the same platinum/sapphire material as the outside of the building and the box that's there, except for the design seems to all filter in towards the center, like the center of a spiderweb. All the design coalesces to the center point.
Laura: Had to be a spiderweb.
Matt: It's not an actual spiderweb. There's a raised dais up in the center there, about four feet wide, about a half-foot thick. Kima kind of takes her symbol and puts it back around her neck and kind of motions like this. The two Scalebearers begin to move down, carrying the case, looking about the rest of you like--
Orion: I invisibly follow right behind the box, still keeping my illusions in check.
Matt: All right.
Ashley: Same, same, same.
Matt: Everyone holds in place?
Marisha: Yeah, I'm not going to move far away.
Ashley: Following.
Travis: As you will.
Marisha: No, no, no, no.
Matt: You're staying right there?
Marisha: Yeah, yeah, if I held-- let me shift one over, just so I'm not in Trinket's way. The other way. Yeah.
Matt: There you go. All right, so. As they enter the chamber, Kima enters as well, you guys filing in behind them, I need you all to make stealth checks.
Travis: Everybody?
Laura: Everybody?
Matt: No, Tiberius, with advantage, because you're invisible.
Liam: What kind of check?
Sam: Stealth!
Travis: Not you.
Matt: Not you, don't worry about it.
Ashley: I don't?
Matt: You do.
Orion: 17.
Ashley: Three. (laughter)
Sam: Clang, clang, clang.
Matt: So you step into the chamber, losing your footing for a moment on the smooth, kind of platinum-like ridges across the ground, and you kind of catch yourself, your plate hitting the ground with a loud (ting) sound, at which point the two Scalebearers kind of look at you--
Ashley: (whispers) Sorry! Sorry!
Matt: With a heavy sigh, and Kima goes, "Go, go, go!" They both step forward and take and place the box into the center of the room on top of the dais. As they both release the chains, the box seems to levitate on its own to the center of the room, much like how the Horn itself ascended and was kept aloft in the center of the box. The box lifts up and slowly begins to rotate on its own. As it does, you can see the sapphire bits that are ingrained on this box flash with a bright blue light and all of a sudden the blue energy spreads into the ceiling and the floor of this room and all of the blue and silver veins that are carved into this begin to glow with a similar blue light.
Sam: Cool.
Marisha: Cool.
Orion: I love light.
Matt: At which point, the doors begin to--
Sam: Which doors?
Matt: The doors you guys entered this room through begin to close.
Sam: Ah, we should leave.
Orion: I'm going to scootch.
Matt: Yeah, you guys immediately scootch out of the way. Kima darts off. Both of them turn around and start running back.
Sam: (whispers) They're going to die.
Matt: They both make it out.
Ashley: Oh! That's good.
Matt: They both manage to just squeeze through real fast as the doors slam behind.
Marisha: That would be terrifying.
Matt: At which point, you see a series of spiders beginning to try to cut around-- these here, what's the DC on your--
Sam: My spell?
Matt: Your spell, yeah.
Sam: 17, because I didn't do it through the hand cone.
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: (whispers) Why?
Marisha: Should we run?
Matt: Both of these spiders get disoriented and try to find their way through the Stinking Cloud, kind of like (choking, clicking noises).
Marisha: Yeah, who's going to be back down here, theoretically.
Orion: The guards could come back.
Matt: None of them make their way through. The rest of these begin coming forward-- what's the roll they have to make for the Spiky Growth?
Laura: 14.
Taliesin: To repair the room that we broke, anyway.
Matt: 14. Both missed their save. What's the damage on that?
Laura: That's 2d4 for every five feet crossed.
Matt: They would probably be skittering around here halfway through before they changed trajectory, so-- 1d4, 2d4?
Laura: 2d4 for every five feet.
Matt: So 10d4 each.
Marisha: Nice!
Matt: They come charging around the corner rapidly (skittering noises).
Marisha: 10d4? That's cool.
Orion: Oh, nice, what?
Marisha: For her thorns.
Orion: (whispers) Sweet, thorns.
Marisha: My little sister once fell into a rose bush.
Sam: Good story.
Marisha: It was very painful.
Orion: Good story? (laughs) I once fell into a fire ant hill.
Marisha: That sucks, too.
Orion: It was very painful. I was riding my bike. It sucked.
Laura: 22.
Matt: 22. Both of these spiders stop in place, looking severely messed up and damaged and just kind of hold their ground, looking very confused. You see, crawling up over the top of this structure, one large white and bluish spider that leaps up. As this is happening, you guys are noticing that blue energy is cracking through the floor and now following the pattern across the entirety of the structure. It crawls up the walls--
Marisha: Oh.
Matt: -- and that blue energy reaches to the ceiling and illuminates it. And what you missed when you entered the room is you can see, recessed into the ceiling of this room, four large humanoid entities that are just currently held aloft, buried in the ceiling, of platinum armor.
Orion: Go.
Travis: We've got to go. We've got to go.
Matt: One of them suddenly flashes, dislodges, and (whoosh, thud), squashing the spider in the process. (yelling)
Marisha: What is that?
Matt: Just (spider screech, croak) screeching sound, the spider slowly tries to curl in place, the giant platinum golem now slamming on top and squishing on top. You see as it slowly comes to stand, each hand holding these giant platinum cleavers. You suddenly hear a voice ringing through your heads collectively: "Get out."
Laura: (whispers) We should get out!
Orion: You heard the man! You heard him! You heard him! The earrings, everybody heard him.
Sam: Wait, can we just leave the thing here with the golem?
Laura: Golems are meant to protect.
Orion: It's going to kill everything there.
Sam: Oh, then let's go.
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: All right, so all of you guys start bolting out. I want everyone to go ahead and make a dexterity check.
Marisha: Okay. Yeah, sure.
Orion: 13.
Matt: All right, anyone lower than a ten?
Travis: What about on a ten?
Marisha: No.
Matt: Lower than a ten?
Orion: (quietly) We all got above ten?
Matt: Anyone? All right. You as well?
Ashley: 14.
Matt: Awesome. (laughter)
Orion: Even Pike!
Matt: You guys all come darting out of the room, except for Kima, who rolls a one. So all of you guys come running out of the room--
Sam: Kima's dead.
Marisha: Kima?
Matt: The rest of the Scalebearers come rushing out, they're no longer encumbered by the box. Kima's kind of helping everyone get by, trying to keep everyone at bay, being the hero. As she turns around, the first one comes leaping off of the structure, runs towards her and gives one giant sweep with one of its blades. Ooh, yeah, that'll hit. You see the blade streak across the front of her silver armor. She takes 24 points of slashing damage. It sends her flying back ten feet with the sheer force of it, but she manages to roll out of it, yeah! With an acrobatics check, catching herself to her feet and just keeps bolting behind the rest of you guys.
Laura: Can I see?
Matt: You now see behind two more (crash, crash) dislodging from the ceiling as the one that's charging after you is coming up the stairway. Through this, we're now going into a skill challenge as you guys are rushing out.
Laura: Oh, god.
Travis: Must go faster. Must go faster.
Sam: Skill challenge.
Marisha: Skill challenge!
Ashley: Ah, go, go!
Orion: Yeah, all right. Run for your life.
Marisha: We haven't done this in a while.
Matt: Now, as you're running to get through, there's still bits of webbing still in the way. I need everyone to go ahead and make another dexterity check.
Sam: All right, doing good.
Orion: Yes!
Taliesin: Yeah!
Marisha: Oh, okay, yeah, yeah, sure.
Orion: 21!
Laura: 25.
Taliesin: 22.
Travis: 21.
Liam: 26.
Ashley: 17?
Marisha: 11?
Taliesin: 22.
Matt: All right.
Sam: 19.
Matt: All right, as you guys are all charging up, kind of helping each other but also clamoring to get through, Kima is rushing up and you can see where one of the Scalebearers has now tripped and fallen on the stairs.
Sam: Oh, no!
Matt: She runs past, leans back to reach her hand out as the golem comes up behind--
Marisha: No!
Matt: -- with two hands, swings down with both blades.
Sam: Against Kima again?
Matt: No, this is against one of the Scalebearers.
Sam: Oh, okay.
Taliesin: Oh no.
Laura: Should I be rolling for Trinket?
Matt: I'm considering Trinket with you, so no.
Marisha: Too late, just leave them.
Laura: Okay, thank you.
Matt: We'll do that next round because I forgot. There's a lot of things to consider. One of them hits the stone and just streaks off, sparks flying through the air, illuminating the space secondarily. However, the other Scalebearer takes 28 points of slashing damage from the blow. As it reaches up again for a second blow, Kima reaches down and grabs Desona's arm and lifts her up off her feet and they both go charging forward. You guys make your way up the stairway as you see now the golem pushing its way through.
Orion: I'm going to dissipate my card illusion and I'm going to cast Fly on myself, so I'm hovering.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: How much of a gap is there between the last trailing-behind Scalebearer and the golem?
Matt: Well, now that Kima's got them, they're rushing up and there's about a ten-foot, 15-foot gap now.
Laura: Okay.
Marisha: I'm going to turn around and do Wall of Stone. Boof!
Matt: Okay. As they rush past, a wall of stone slams up as the golem goes smashing into it--
Orion: I'll do support. I'll do Obelisk right behind it, too.
Matt: All right. So as you guys come rushing up to the top of this, you guys are just doing the stone wall, obelisk, obelisk, obelisk. We'll say you cast it twice to go ahead and reinforce.
Marisha: Boof!
Matt: All right, you hear the impact from behind. You hear stone crack and break and you see two of the pillars that you put up impact, dust and bits of rock shoot out, but it settles. Apparently it's holding strong and you start hearing slamming of some sort of heavy weight behind it.
Marisha: Right, run.
Matt: As well as the following of additional giant heavy footsteps. It's now got its reinforcements caught up to it. You guys charge into the room with the broken trap, which now has partially raised platforms. You're rushing around and trying to find your way through. You get to the other side of the room. There's now an entirety-- a room filled with mist in front of you.
Laura: (gasps) Oh no.
Marisha: I still have it. I can Gust of Wind. That's my last 3rd-level spell.
Matt: Okay. All right, Gust of Wind. I'm going to ask all of you guys to make a wisdom check as you rush through.
Marisha: Including me?
Matt: Everyone.
Sam: Wisdom check or saving throw?
Matt: This is a wisdom check.
Marisha: Just adding your wisdom?
Ashley: Natural 20!
Laura: What what!
Matt: Nice!
Ashley: 24.
Marisha: Saving throw or just your ability modifier?
Orion: 12.
Matt: Ability modifier.
Taliesin: Oh.
Marisha: Okay, 16.
Orion: I thought it was negative three.
Sam: Ten. Ten for me.
Taliesin: 14.
Laura: 13.
Liam: Nine.
Travis: Two.
Sam: Nine, wow.
Matt: All of you guys are pushing through. So, as you guys come rushing in you're like, go go! You see Keyleth's focusing and getting the wind to escape, Keyleth rushes up, Kima comes through with the two Scalebearers, everyone comes through, Grog's bringing up the back. You can see now, in the back behind him, a giant blade-wielding fist as the golem comes smashing through the wall. The rest of you guys, ushering Grog along, Grog comes running, hears the sound, looks over his shoulder and in the chaos of it, his trajectory is off and he ends up brushing into the side of the mist.
Laura: Oh, no!
Matt: Grog, go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw.
Travis: 12.
Matt: You end up taking 24 points of fire damage as the pillars spin, unleashing a torrent of flame.
Travis: No, bad car wash, bad car wash!
Marisha: (laughs) Bad car wash.
Laura: Oh, no, Grog, your beard has been singed.
Orion: Oh!
Travis: What? (laughter)
Matt: You reach up instinctively, you feel it's as smooth as a baby goliath's face. (laughter)
Orion: All that work!
Matt: As you guys charge up the rest of the staircase--
Orion: Is Grog behind us now, like the furthest away?
Matt: He's just caught up to you guys as you're rushing up the staircase. You get to the final door. You exit. As Kima rushes everyone through, she brings out her holy symbol real fast, and as she pulls it off her neck, you see the first golem reach the bottom of the staircase. It begins looming up--
Orion: We're leaving! What are you doing?!
Marisha: Yeah, go home! Go home! Bad golem.
Taliesin: I take a--
Matt: Kima takes out her holy symbol and holds it aloft in front of her and says under her breath (murmurs), at which point it begins to glow with this extremely vibrant glow. As it does, you see a symbol emblazoned on the front of the golem and it flashes with light as it stops and just kind of holds its place-- and waits. And Kima looks at the symbol like "I wasn't sure that was going to work." She takes--
Orion: Tell it to go kill the spider.
Matt: She takes the symbol and puts it back in the side of the stone door that originally was closed. The doors slowly seal shut once again. She pulls the symbol out-- and she falls to her knees, breathing heavily.
Sam: Oh, Kima.
Marisha: We did it!
Travis: Next time, lead with that.
Orion: I agree, Grog. Very well said.
Matt: "It kind of happened very quickly, I'm sorry."
Ashley: All right, do some people need to be healed?
Taliesin: Oh, dear.
Laura: Yeah.
Sam: Kima, for sure.
Orion: I'm actually okay.
Marisha: I'm all right. I'm all right.
Taliesin: I'm fine.
Sam: Oh, Grog's got a burnt face.
Travis: No, I want to wear this pain as a remembrance of my beard.
Laura: You can grow it back, Grog.
Orion: It's okay, big fella.
Matt: You make your way back up to the main chamber, where High Bearer Vord is currently waiting for you.
Sam: Oh, this guy.
Matt: He turns to you as you enter. "So I am to assume that your journey was a success?"
Orion: Yes, surprisingly so. It went off without a hitch. Well, no.
Laura: You've got some good security down there.
Marisha: Very good.
Matt: "I told you. Once it's instilled, it will be safe."
Laura: A little warning next time would be great.
Ashley: 25 points of healing.
Matt: There you go.
Orion: You're really a girl on fire now.
Marisha: That really heals me up, then.
Taliesin: That will top me off very nicely.
Marisha: I'll take that.
Orion: Well done, everyone, by the way.
Laura: Yeah.
Taliesin: That could've gone worse.
Marisha: It could have gone worse.
Matt: At which point, the High Bearer Vord kind of raises his hand. "Yonn, if you do not mind." And Yonn kind of shuffles forward.
Sam: Yonn.
Orion: Such a bore.
Marisha: Yawn.
Matt: "Excuse me, I'm right here."
Orion: It was a play on words. Your name also means something that you do when you're tired.
Marisha: Yeah!
Matt: "I don't like you." (laughter)
Matt: He reaches out and puts a big old sack of coins in your hands.
Laura: Oh! I'll hold onto that.
Orion: Of course.
Taliesin: We should mention, you may have to have one of the rooms repaired.
Orion: I take a couple out.
Taliesin: The spinning column--
Sam: Circle of death.
Laura: Yeah.
Taliesin: May have gotten--
Laura: A little broken. We thought were maybe just disarming it but I think we probably broke it.
Taliesin: We put an arrow into it.
Travis: (tearfully) If you find the remnants of a glorious beard, preserve it.
Laura: Oh, Grog, actually--
Travis: What?
Laura: I've got some remnants of a lovely beard. And I try to smush it onto his chin.
Travis: It is not the same.
Matt: It is not the same.
Laura: It looks pretty good.
Matt: It is not the same.
Laura: Dang it.
Matt: At which point, the High Bearer turns to you, Pike. "Mighty cleric, I see this meeting, though it escaped my vision before, that you bear the holy sigil of the Dawnflower, the Lady of Redemption Herself. While we may walk under different stars, I offer these words that caught my ear naught but a week ago. In an excavation beneath the toppled tower of Syrac, the long-cursed ruin that sat like a blemish upon this city for hundreds of years, it was revealed that perhaps the five holy paths that began here at Vasselheim, there may indeed now be a sixth."
Sam: What?
Matt: "A forgotten temple to Sarenrae has been uncovered. Crumbled, lost, and without light, it sat, forever and a day, and few are around in this city of her guiding flame to recover and restore its glory. Perhaps you should look into it."
Ashley: I will gladly look into it.
Matt: "The ruin lies to the west of here, at the base of the city's mountain. Look for the dark stone ruin. Nevertheless, I thank you for your time. Kima, if you wouldn't mind, we have some things to discuss as well."
Marisha: Oh, quick, Vorg--
Matt: "Vord. High Bearer Vord."
Marisha: Vord.
Taliesin: Vord.
Laura: Highbearer Vord.
Matt: "Was that so hard? Yes?"
Marisha: Vord? You wouldn't have happened to hear of maybe a druid tribe called the Fire Ashari? They call their little hometown Pyrah. Do you happen to know, maybe?
Matt: He gives you a keen look and says, "There has been talk of a rogue band of druids, not more than two day's travel, in the-- let's see, where did I put the maps here?" He thinks to himself for a moment, considering it. "Towards the Sunder Peak Mountain Range. Dangerous territory, fraught with volcanic activity. Yet these folks seem to call it home."
Marisha: Is Sunder Peak like west or east to where we--
Matt: "Southwest of the city. It's hard to miss."
Marisha: Southwest.
Matt: "Look for the plumes of sulfurous smoke."
Laura: Is the temple to Sarenrae on the way to the--
Matt: "The temple to Sarenrae is on the same mountain that this temple is built on."
Laura: Oh.
Matt: "To the west of here. Follow the mountain base."
Marisha: Oh. So we can stop there first?
Orion: Yes, it's close, it seems.
Laura: All of us can--
Orion: Before we part, you seem to be quite learned about many things that I am not. Have you ever heard of anything called the God's Hammer or the Pale Stone? Or any particular artifact, Ropes of Mercy, perhaps?
Matt: "I can't say I have, unfortunately."
Orion: Of course.
Matt: "But I shall keep this in mind, should the information come my way."
Orion: Thank you. I bow.
Matt: He gives you a look, a quick glance, and notes: "For the record, while your color is not what it was when you first entered, know that the great Platinum Dragon sees through this guise to the heart beneath."
Orion: Yes, thank you for noticing. I agree with the same sentiment. And I bow in the Draconic fashion.
Matt: "Well, Kima. Business. Thank you all very much." And he kind of lends his hands out. As he extends his hand, the doors on the opposite side of the room open up.
Laura: Magic. Thought it was banned.
Matt: For the sake of brevity, because we have people who have to leave on this, very soon, it doesn't take you long to find your way across the city. You find some of the city's Bastions standing guard on the outskirts of this crumpled tower ruin. It's like, black and soot-covered stone that looks like a plot of land that has been left untouched. Like, once it fell, no one wanted anything to do with it. You speak with the Bastions and they eventually let you through, especially given the aid of those you've walked with since arrival. You come to the ruin and you can see there's about a 40-foot gap in this pile of stone that is a recess in the ground, almost like a small sinkhole. It looks like there is some sort of excavation that has been set here. Very haphazard. There is very simple wood boards that have been placed into the side of this small sinkhole to allow relatively comfortable, though a bit rickety, descent into the structure. As you make your way down, your eyes adjust to the little bit of daylight that spills into this dark subterranean cavern. There before you, you see a surprisingly glorious sight: a simple structure of brass and polished limestone, ancient as the day is long. One of the walls has partially collapsed, and you see what looks like three figures rummaging through the debris. An older human woman, who is being helped by two others: a young man of blond hair and simple clothes and an older gnome that's carrying a crutch under his arm. They're all in the process of collecting and setting aside and cleaning up various things that have been recovered from this temple. You immediately see against the brass structure the very simplified symbol of the wings of Sarenrae, multiple times across the structure in various incarnations. This is very much indeed a lost temple of Sarenrae.
Laura: (whispers) Wow, Pike.
Ashley: (whispers) Wow.
Sam: So, when you've fully excavated it, you can come back and check it out.
Ashley: Yes...
Orion: Or you can stay here and restore it.
Matt: At which point, the older woman sees you guys walk down and says, "Please! There's nothing to take. Nothing but history and rock, I guarantee you. Bandits are not welcome here."
Ashley: No no no! I take out my symbol and I say, no no no, I'm here to help.
Matt: You can hear an audible gasp from her. She says, "My eyes don't deceive. Oh my, I am sorry. My name is Gesyra, a simple painter, but one of, as far as I know, the three devoted to the Lady of the Everlight here in Vasselheim. And now a fourth. I don't know where you came from, but would you stay with us for a bit and help us rebuild? Bring her name into the light amongst the others here in Vasselheim? Restore it to its glory?"
Ashley: (tearfully) Yes. Oh, man, I don't want to leave you guys.
Matt: "It shouldn't take long, especially with your help. And we can bring the light into the heart of others." And you can see the two other kind of joined her at the side and they all look at you with this look of hope that you can probably tell from the crinkles in their face they haven't had in quite some time. And they look up to you in their simple clothes as the first true strong bastion for Sarenrae that they've seen in a long time. With that, Pike, you get to turn to the rest of the group.
Ashley: Well, I think this is a pilgrimage I have to take. So, Vox Machina, keep your eyes out. I will contact you every once in a while if I can, and we will meet up once this is completed. All in.
Travis: Right.
Ashley: Vox Machina on three. One, two, three.
All: Vox Machina.
Orion: (tearfully) You will be missed very much, Pike.
Ashley: I'm going to miss you guys very much.
Matt: And on that note, we have to close because people are in a rush. Yeah, Ashley will be leaving us for a time. She's going to New York for a few months to shoot a web-- a television series. (laughter)
Sam: A little web series.
Matt: A wonderful television series she has recurring. We're really happy and proud of her-- we're just a jumble of emotions under the circumstances.
Ashley: You guys have been so amazing and have made this experience even better for us, and thank you so much for going with us on our journey. It will keep going, but I will be back when I can.
Orion: You will be back.
Laura: You'll be back.
Taliesin: You'll be back.
Orion: She will be back.
Ashley: But it might be a long time.
Matt: Yeah, she'll pop in and out if she can, and there will eventually be a return of Pike, but for the time being she feels the calling to stay and help rebuild this temple of Sarenrae.
Marisha: We're going to miss you, Pike.
Ashley: I'm going to miss you guys.
Marisha: But we understand personal journeys.
Ashley: Personal journey.
Travis: You have a good time.
Ashley: I will.
Sam: Pike, I, Scanlan, will not physically wait for you, but emotionally-- (laughter)
Sam: Emotionally I will wait for you, and I will not stray emotionally. I will always be there for you emotionally.
Ashley: Okay, Scanlan.
Sam: But physically, I mean, come on, it's going to be months.
Matt: Thank you so much, Ash. We're going to miss you but we'll tabs and we'll have you back soon.
Ashley: Okay.
Matt: All right. Thank you all so much for watching. Everyone give Ashley love on the Twitter, on the internet.
Travis: Good going, Ashley!
Matt: And we'll see you guys at Comic-Con next week. Those that'll be at Anime Expo, I'll be there tomorrow for a couple of panels.
Zac: Buy those shirts!
Sam: Oh, yeah, buy the shirts.
Matt: Six more days for the Critical Role shirts before they go away.
Laura: Hey, it's still got Pike on it, you gotta get it now.
All: Yeah.
Sam: Collector's edition.
Ashley: Definitely limited edition.
Matt: All right, guys, thank you and have a wonderful evening, we've got to let these guys go. We'll see you-- me and Marisha will see you in three weeks.
Orion: See us at Comic-Con.
Marisha: We'll see you at Comic-Con.
Matt: The others will see you in two. All right. Have a wonderful night, guys.

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello everyone! Welcome to Critical Role. After a two-week hiatus of our usual gaming schedule at Comic Con and then a fun-filled crazy week with half the party playing games and having fun while me and Marisha were in New Zealand, we're happy to be back. We're happy you guys are here as we continue our adventure going forward. We'll have a lot of really cool things to announce here in a moment, but let's go ahead and get that intro video started. [dramatic music]
Matt: Welcome back. All right, this is Critical Role: a show where a bunch of voice actors play Dungeons and Dragons. Fun crazy nerds rolling dice and good times. With the adventures of Vox Machina. You're doing all right Travis. Couple quick things: Me and Marisha wanted to say a quick shout out to all of our Critters who came to visit us in Wellington, New Zealand at Armageddon Expo. We had a strong showing of Critters that was really amazing from across the world. And Australia. People could fly over from Australia just to get us to sign their books, so there's a lot of really awesome fan love out there. So you guys are great.
Marisha: Maybe next time all of us could go? You guys should tell them.
Matt: Oh man, a Down Under Kiwi trip for all Critical Role would be a lot of fun. Send your local-- I guess you don't have a congressman, because you're a different country.
Orion: Your "Con-gressman."
Matt: Oh there you go. Orion saved it. Thank you.
Orion: It was there the whole time, Matt. (laughter)
Matt: Disadvantage. All right, so first and foremost, couple things I want to get up here. We had our sub giveaways this evening. For every 50 subs, we give away a signed player's handbook by the cast of Critical Role, a signed photo of the cast. And tonight especially we're also giving away in that package Espionage nail packs, specifically with our fantastic gamer dice on the tips. Espionage Cosmetics were gracious to give these to us, and we will give them to you. Every 50 subs.
Marisha: Awesome. Go follow them on Twitter; I think they're @espionagemakeup. Just look it up. They're awesome.
Matt: Google it. However, we already have a winner, before the show started. That's explodingiggy. So congratulations to explodingiggy. You already got one more to come. The fun and interesting challenge for this evening as we've been made aware, you guys, being the ridiculously amazing people you are. One of you crafted a challenge for yourself. That if we can manage to somehow get to 5,000 subscribers before the end of the show tonight, they will create and send an eight-foot Trinket. Like eight-foot-tall Trinket bear.
Marisha: Yeah which is vague. A little. What's it made out of?
Zac: It's a teddy bear. It's a giant teddy bear.
Laura: And maybe his little paws can be on my shoulder the whole time I play?
Matt: Oh, he would be a perpetual staple of the set. That would be behind you at all times.
Zac: Cool, not difficult at all, guys! Totally not difficult at all!
Marisha: Yes, but we have to get to 5,000 subscribers.
Taliesin: Trojan horse and a suit that they wear. They could sneak themselves onto the stage that way.
Matt: I'll get inside the teddy bear, and I'll act out Trinket during the game. Perfect. That's not going to happen. It might happen. That's if we hit 5000 subscribers, so all your friends you know that watch the show who don't subscribe yet, tell them to. If you know anyone that hasn't seen the show yet, get them on, because a giant eight-foot bear would be pretty much the most ridiculous thing ever.
Marisha: Yeah, I already tweeted #8ftTrinket.
Laura: I saw something subs for bears.
Orion: Nope. Bad idea.
Matt: (laughs) Yeah, subs for bears is a whole section of Craigslist you don't want to go to. Or you do, if that's your thing. All right, so. Happy to be back from Comic Con. We had a great panel and great turnout there. Thank you for those who came and those who watched the panel. If you haven't seen it yet, the panel is available on the Geek and Sundry website. You can watch it. And as we all know, last episode we said goodbye temporarily to our fantastic gnome cleric, Pike. She's off in New York shooting awesome television shows, but she's here in spirit.
Liam: It's going to be great.
Laura: It's going to be a good show.
Matt: Also, as a reminder, our charity that we run here for the show is to 826LA. 826LA is a fantastic charity that promotes and teaches creative writing to younger kids between the ages of 8 and 16, I think it was. Somewhere in that range?
Marisha: K through High School.
Matt: K through High School. Fantastic program, and anything you can do to help is much appreciated and awesome. And, Marisha, if you want to go ahead and take this away. We have a new addition to our set coming next week.
Marisha: It's so awesome! I had the absolute pleasure of joining Felicia on the latest episode of The Flog. Go check it out. It's back. I love that show. She wanted to make a neon sign, and she was like, "Let's do a Critical Role sign." Because she's a fan of our show, which is awesome. She's probably watching right now. Love you, Felicia. So this was it, unfortunately. Yes, are we ready to do the honors? Ready? For Vox Machina! (cheering)
Marisha: So yeah, that's probably going to be up on our set next week, blessing us with its rose-colored glow. Go watch, if you want to see how we made it. We got this awesome tutorial. It's cool. You can go and learn how to make neon signs yourself.
Orion: And it's all science-y too.
Marisha: It's all science-y. It's totally nerdy awesome. Yeah, krypton. But yes. Here we go. All right, say bye-bye to the sign for now.
Matt: It'll be back.
Zac: Hey, Matt. We already have another 50 winner. (laughter)
Zac: It was SonicaMoto.
Matt: SonicaMoto is our new winner, already. Congratulations, SonicaMoto.
Liam: We need less than 300 subs for that bear. I think we can do that. I think that's pretty likely.
Marisha: You get nail wraps.
Matt: You get a bear behind us for the rest of the show.
Marisha: You get a player's handbook signed by us.
Taliesin: Encourage this. Oh no, encourage this. (laughs) I encourage bear.
Orion: (laughing) I do encourage... Nope. Okay. I am a trained comedian. That is not a thing.
Matt: Last but not least, before we get started, we do have one guest in the studio who's been watching for a bit tonight. Our good friend, Joré is over here from quite a distance. We met him at Comic Con.
Travis: Put your head right here.
Matt: A fantastically talented artist. For those of you who have seen my profile picture on Twitter or Facebook, the really amazing artwork of me as a dungeon master, this is the man that did it. Where can they see your work online?
Jore: I have a Facebook--
Marisha: Drop down.
Orion: Drop down.
Jore: There's a Facebook page. You can search J-O-R-E on Facebook, and that's probably me. If you see Matt's picture, then that's me.
Travis: And my Grog raging one with blood covering his face. (growls)
Matt: Go ahead and have a seat.
Marisha: Speaking of amazing artists. We want to do a shout out.
Orion: There's a couple more announcements. This one.
Marisha: This one, yes.
Orion: Our wonderful artists. Kit Buss and...
Marisha: Kit Buss and Wendy Doodles. Wendy Green. They're awesome friends of ours and fans of the show. They do amazing work. They've done a lot of the character work that you've seen, and they're going to be doing a lot more, and we just wanted to really appreciate them and show them some love, so yes. Go follow.
Orion: Our artists. As Laura would say.
Laura: That's good. That's very see-able.
Marisha: Okay. Is it see-able now? I want to make sure. Go follow them. They deserve it.
Matt: They've been really amazing. I know many of you have asked about what's the backstory to Vox Machina? What's that history before the stream started? We're working on something. It may take a little bit, but one or more of those artists may be involved. But when we do have that available to you, it should be really cool, and I hope you'll enjoy it. Anyway.
Orion: Oh, also, since this is fantasy, I'd like to announce that my show went pretty well that's on Mondays, 7-10 on this channel.
Taliesin: You have a show? What kind of show is it?
Orion: Ooh, I'm glad you asked, Taliesin. It is me and Jessica Merizan playing Final Fantasy XIV. We just found each other in the same world. There's a free company we're going to start. You can come on and join if you're already subscribing. We do giveaways for subscribers who are watching and active in the chat during the show for stuff with Square Enix. It's all good times. I'm happy to say that Taliesin, man, Thancred is still in this version of Final Fantasy XIV, so you can check his work out too, and he's awesome. The funny thing is I didn't know your character was like a badass. So I was listening to him and I was like "Oh fuck". Yeah, he's great. So check it out. Every Monday 7-10 on the channel.
Matt: There you go. Also all you League fans out there, I hope you're enjoying your new Bilgewater update. Anyone else have any announcements they want to make?
Laura: Oh we're going to be at Otakon this weekend in Baltimore. Come say hi! We're leaving right after this.
Taliesin: I've got a tiny announcement, which is Ant-Man the movie is really good. If you like Ant-Man the movie, you can hear me as Ant-Man, being not nearly as funny, in the pinball game. I'm not nearly as funny as Paul Rudd.
Orion: Oh pish posh.
Zac: Matt? We've got another giveaway.
Taliesin: Yeah!
Marisha: (singing) Eight-foot Trinket, here we come!
Zac: OhGreatLampShade.
Matt: OhGreatLampShade is the winner of our next giveaway.
Liam: OhGreatLampShade, we thank thee for thy mercy.
Matt: Congratulations. Player's Handbook signed, picture signed, and nail wraps. And a step closer to giant eight-foot Trinket.
Travis: Don't do it. No more.
Liam: Are you sad that you will no longer be the tallest member of our group?
Laura: I feel like we're just delaying starting because we're going to have to face that fact that Pike isn't with us as soon as we start.
Travis: And Scanlan's still in the pooper. He's not really.
Marisha: Yeah, where is Scanlan?
Liam: He's shitting on a bed somewhere. It's his thing.
Matt: Is he on his way?
Laura: He's on his way, yeah.
Matt: Well when he arrives... In the meantime--
Travis: Where are you going?
Orion: I'm going to get something to drink.
Laura: He's getting a drink.
Matt: Okay. As Tiberius has an aneurysm and falls to the ground--
Travis: Yes! I go over and provide very vigorous CPR. No mouth to mouth, just that hand part.
Matt: Yeah. All right, make a death save.
Orion: What? Ow! (cheering)
Orion: And I brought Scanlan with me.
Marisha: (laughs) Like a trailing fart.
Travis: (laughing) "Like a trailing fart."
Orion: That couldn't have worked out better.
Sam: Oh really?
Laura: What is he wearing?
Travis: "Asp Hole?" What does it say? "Where you" what?
Sam: It's the Asp Hole.
Liam: Asp. Hole.
Sam: It's just a bar that I like to go to. Down at the Asp Hole.
Liam: And I got shit for talking about bears today.
Matt: No, I'm pretty sure that's somewhere in Emon. (laughter)
Travis: And we'll find it.
Sam: Yeah, we'll find the Asp Hole.
Matt: Yeah, so let's actually start this game, guys. Thank you for being patient with our intro here. We've been gone for two weeks. We have a lot to talk about, so thank you for letting us get that out. So picking up where we left off, the party completed the venture of taking the horn of Orcus to a place of safety and sealing it away, hopefully for eternity, with the help of Lady Kima, to the scalebearers. After heading to the basement of the Platinum Sanctuary in the city of Vasselheim, they've succeeded to do so. Vasselheim, which is a distant city to the far northwest of the continent they're used to. This city is a very devout, religion-based city, and currently considered the oldest bastion of civilization in the known civilized world. After taking a skyship across the ocean to get there, sealing the Horn, you guys also discover upon doing so that the ruins, long-forgotten ruins, of what appears to be an ancient temple to Sarenrae were recently discovered. While Sarenrae does not have a strong following in this city, the few that are trying to raise it ask for Pike's help to stay back and help build it and bring it to its former glory. Hopefully to re-establish a basis of worship in this city, and she decided to help these folks. The party then steps away from the ruins of the tower, sad but understanding of the circumstance.
Liam: Perhaps we could sit on a nearby rooftop and watch Pike work.
Laura: Just for the next eight months?
Travis: I'd be all right with that.
Marisha: That's not creepy at all.
Matt: Critical Role all of a sudden becomes the greatest grass-watching game of all time. As you all stand there, you have to decide your next course of action. You stand in the muddy road, taking in the cold dusk air as the sun slowly sets to the west. Now, this area of the city has a vastly different feel than the Platinum Sanctuary. In the haste to make it to the ruin, you've passed out of the section that seems to be under Bahamut's watch and into a different area. In this area, most of the buildings are reinforced with ruddy iron plates. Plumes of smoke rise up from a handful of heavy smokestacks. You can see over the rooftops in the distance toward the center of this section what looks like a massive dark red statue of a muscular bearded man.
Liam: The beauty of this game is I have no idea what the shit we're going to do right now.
Sam: So we're standing outside the place where we just left Pike?
Matt: Yeah, the ruins of the tower.
Marisha: So we're essentially standing in the middle of a town being like, now what?
Laura: Should we go look at that statue, then?
Taliesin: I want to see if there's an inscription.
Matt: If you'd like to.
Taliesin: Yes, that would be lovely.
Sam: While he's doing that, Scanlan is feeling still terribly sad about leaving Pike. So overcome with emotion that he must step into the ruins one last time, just to see the place where she's going to be for the next several months, years. And before I do so, I drink one of my potions that I bought from what's-his-butt. Gilmore, the glorious Gilmore. Yes.
Matt: All right.
Sam: I don't know how it works, but I'm going to drink it anyway.
Matt: Okay, you drink it.
Sam: Okay, I drink it. I go inside the ruins and look around and touch some of the walls and look at the stonework and everything. I want to see where she's going to be so I know she's safe. Overcome with a little bit of verklempt emotion, I shed a single tear.
Matt: As you quietly take this moment to yourself amongst the ruins, you can hear the clattering of stonework as the small band of Sarenrae worshipers are now being helped by Pike, who's gathered them into a plan as to how to remove and restore portions of the building that are currently visible from the dirt and earth that it's embedded in. Hearing her voice echo through the hallway, it's a very comforting sense. You feel a rumbling in your stomach.
Sam: I feel uncomfortable. It must be the emotion.
Matt: It's probably the emotion.
Sam: I find a side chamber or a little nook. Somewhere where I can have some privacy.
Matt: Okay. You find your way back towards the makeshift wooden plank stairway and there was a small alcove not far from there within the earth wall that looks to be relatively private. There's little to no light, and it does have a view of the current ruin.
Sam: I say a little prayer, and I take a big dump on the floor.
Travis: (laughing) No you do not!
Sam: Well, my stomach was rumbling.
Travis: (laughing) You're in a temple, man!
Laura: Pike's probably going to have to be the one to clean that up!
Sam: Sometimes it just affects me. I have weak nerves. And as I'm squatting, I hum to myself. (singing) How do I say goodbye to what we almost had?
Orion: This is not romantic at all, you know that, right?
Matt: Welcome back, guys.
Marisha: I've missed you guys so much.
Matt: As you finish your business, you step away from the alcove back to the stairway. The contents of the potion seem to have had some effect, as the remnants of what you leave behind have a very soft blue glowing hue to them.
Sam: I left a magic dump.
Travis: Do we need to collect the dump?
Sam: Nope. We should leave the dump.
Laura: Are you going to be able to see through the dump?
Travis: He's covering his face. I think we need the blue shit.
Marisha: Can you cast Detect Magic on the poo?
Sam: It's already magical poo.
Orion: Are we there? We're not there.
Laura: We're not there. It's just Scanlan.
Orion: Okay. So he's just shitting.
Laura: He's just leaving it.
Sam: So I leave and rejoin my fellows, wiping the tear from my eye and the poo from my bottom.
Orion: Well, I love you Ashley. I do.
Marisha: This is what happens when we don't have any direction.
Travis: But what's the purpose of the potion? To make your poo blue?
Sam: I took a potion that will let me see through my poo and check in on Pike from time to time.
Laura: Will she realize you can see her through the poop?
Sam: I certainly hope not.
Laura: Wouldn't that be great if she could just talk to you through the poo?
Liam: Why aren't the priests going to shovel that shit up?
Sam: As long as some of my cellular remains are there, I might be able to see a little bit into the room.
Liam: What's "cellular?"
Sam: (laughs) It's poo.
Liam: Oh, you mean little flakes of poo.
Matt: For the sake of brevity in story progression here, and to dissuade a 30-minute conversation about Scanlan's excrement. After you've rejoined the party, the sun is now set. The cold air is beginning to really sweep in through the streets. The clouds overhead begin to slowly rumble and you can hear distant thunder, and you get the feeling due to the moisture in the air, you're not too far away from a rain.
Laura: Should we bunk for the night before we head out in the morning?
Taliesin: I say we head to the ship.
Travis: Wasn't there a guy with a red beard we were supposed to go see?
Laura: I wanted to wander over to the statue while Scanlan was dumping.
Sam: I feel great right now, by the way.
Taliesin: Finding some relief in the situation.
Orion: Damn it. Just when I was starting to like you, gnome.
Liam: Moving on. Let's go take a look at this statue.
Matt: (chuckling) All right.
Sam: It's magic poo!
Liam: Don't change, Scanlan.
Matt: As you guys make your way through the center of this district--
Laura: I feel like it's dark now.
Matt: Yeah. You get the sense that this area, most of the people that live in this area are more rough-and-tumble than the already-rough people who live in Vasselheim, from what you've encountered. The buildings themselves all seem to be reinforced with iron plates and it looks like there is a very heavy trade in metalwork, and a lot of the construction of anything metallic appears to be coming through or from this portion of the town. As you approach closer to this statue, it's not just a statue. You see it is actually sitting atop what looks to be a large, blocky fortress-like temple. Unlike the Platinum Sanctuary, which is a very beautiful but simple array, this one has a crenellated top to each of these walled structures. You can see braziers blasting flame every 20 or so feet along the top of it. You can see, as you approach the front of this, there are two giant stone doorways with steps that look up to it and what looks to be two gargantuan war horns that spiral along the sides and then open up outward towards the entire city in front of it. I'm going to ask you guys to make a religion check, if you could.
Travis: Oh, I got this.
Orion: Natural 20!
Taliesin: Yeah! Natural 20.
Taliesin: Boom!
Orion: Boom!
Orion: That's so cool.
Travis: Natural four.
Taliesin: Because we know our shit.
Matt: As you guys begin your approach, even in the darkness, you can see the figure, this human-like man. Barrel-chested. Massive muscles. What looks almost like iron bracers around his wrists. He is carved or sculpted from solid iron or plates that have been put together from some sort of iron initial structure. The beard is long and goes to about mid-chest. He carries in one hand this long, thick shortsword and has furs and leathers about his legs and midsection. You recognize this to be a very hefty depiction of the deity Kord.
Laura: Kord?
Sam: Kord?
Travis: Kord?
Travis: I admire his beard.
Matt: It is a beard worth admiring.
Marisha: How might one spell Kord?
Matt: K-O-R-D.
Marisha: Simple. I like that.
Sam: He's a god of some sort?
Matt: He is, indeed.
Taliesin: Tell us of this Kord. Try to find your notes of this Kord.
Laura: He's a dwarven god?
Matt: Not dwarven.
Liam: A man. Human.
Matt: Kord is essentially a deity of warfare, combat, and storms. A god that has been long-worshipped by tribal cultures from long past that enjoyed the essence of battle and challenge and combat.
Liam: Did you say storms, Tiberius? War and combat and storms?
Orion: Storms, yes. Storms and winds.
Matt: And quickly, the motif of this section of the town comes into play. This, you assume, is the portion of the city that is dedicated to the temple of Kord, this being the structure before you.
Marisha: Does it seem to be a central theme across the whole town? This town worships Kord?
Matt: No. You've only really been to two sections. The first one you were brought to was primarily under the worship of Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon.
Marisha: Okay. (giggles)
Taliesin: Getting the giggles out.
Travis: Did you look at it? Did you use your fancy eyes to look at it?
Taliesin: Well, my question is, is this a temple? If it is a temple to Kord, is this a place of battle? Is this somewhere where people go watch battles and fighting?
Matt: From the exterior, and it is a closed-off temple, it looks like a large, blocky, obstinate fortress that is nearly impenetrable from the way it's constructed and reinforced. You don't know what's inside of it.
Liam: There's a big gate or door at the front?
Matt: Two large iron doors about 20 feet tall that are currently shut. It's about five or six steps getting up to it.
Laura: And it's nighttime?
Matt: It is nighttime currently, yes.
Liam: Are there any citizens out right now, or are we alone in the dark?
Matt: As it has gotten to dusk, it's thinned out a little bit, but there are a few individuals walking by, carrying pickaxes over one shoulder and passing by.
Liam: I'd like to walk over to the nearest one and ask.
Sam: To who?
Liam: To a passerby.
Matt: The two gentlemen, one's in his mid-20s. The one that turns to you initially probably looks a little older than that. Late 30s, grizzled. Shaven, but the five-o'clock shadow has definitely kicked in. Longer, tousled hair, dirt on the face. Simple clothing, pickaxe over his shoulder and what looks like a leather belt that carries other tools.
Sam: These are dwarves?
Matt: These are human. "Yes? I heard you calling."
Liam: Excuse me, good sir. My friend over here, the dragonborn. He seems to think that this is some sort of temple or edifice to the god Kord. I just want to know, is he correct?
Matt: "Is this your first time in the Braving Grounds?"
Orion: In Dwarvish, I say--
Sam: They're not dwarves.
Matt: You can still say it, though. (laughter)
Liam: Yes, absolutely! This is our first time. We literally just rolled into Vasselheim. What can you tell us of this? It's an impressive structure.
Matt: The younger gentleman next to him, similarly dressed, begins to speak up. He puts his hand up and goes, "The Braving Grounds is the area of this city that is built around the worship of the great god Kord. His protection and strength he bestows upon those who live for the sake of challenge. To prove oneself better with each passing day, that is the basis of the Braving Grounds."
Laura: So it's like a battleground?
Matt: "It's a community that when called to battle can definitely defend itself. What you see before you--" He looks up at the giant structure. "This is called the Trial Forge. It is the oldest known temple to Kord and has been built and rebuilt for many, many hundreds of years."
Orion: (chuckles) Hence forge, right?
Liam: And does one need to be a priest or cleric of this faith to challenge oneself? Or can anyone--
Travis: Worship?
Matt: "Anyone is able to worship what deity they wish in this town. We have an understanding. If you're looking for a tussle, what you're looking for is the Crucible."
Travis: Yes. What else can you tell us about this Crucible?
Matt: "The Crucible is a fighting pit. I mean, there is a sacred arena within the temple, but that's reserved for very, very special occasions. If you're looking to just get your fight on and punch someone in the face, the Crucible is what you're looking for." He spits off to the side and points a little ways down the roadway.
Marisha: I think Grog wants to go.
Matt: "Beyond that way, you'll see a tavern known as the Bellows' Respite."
Sam: Bellows' Respite.
Matt: "One of the finer inns you'll find in the Braving Grounds proper, but I take it if you walk that direction, you'll see the Crucible before too long."
Laura: Have you ever fought in the Crucible?
Matt: "Me? No. Too busy. Too many people better fighters than me in there. I'll just stick to the mines."
Marisha: Are these battles to the death?
Matt: "Nah. These are battles of honor. Death belongs in a true war. Mind you, there have been some folks unfortunately who may have fallen to a hit on the head too hard, and that's understandable. But the purpose of Kord is not necessarily to smite your foes unless they've given you damn good reason. Other than that, contest of strength is how we live."
Orion: A friendly sparring match is what we're about.
Liam: That's this neighborhood of Vasselheim, not the city as a whole, just in these parts?
Matt: "For the most part. I mean, we have members of our community that are Bastions and guard the whole city, but we tend to keep our own--" (off-screen crash)
Matt: "Pardon my friend. He's clumsy." And the other gentleman picks up his tools and is like, "Sorry."
Travis: Have you been to this Crucible often, and if so, is there a champion or a favorite that you've seen or know of?
Matt: "We have some people come in and out. Probably best to ask around the Crucible, to be honest. I've seen some people take some serious beatings down there. I haven't kept much attention to it. I haven't the money to sling around it."
Laura: The money? Wait, it costs money?
Matt: "What, you think there's going to be fights in a pit and no one's betting on it? Welcome to Vasselheim, my dear."
Travis: We're going to be rich!
Orion: What if there are two people fighting the town does not know?
Matt: "I don't know. Take it up at the Crucible."
Travis: How far is the Crucible from here?
Matt: "Keep walking. You'll see it."
Laura: Keep walking? Thank you, friend.
Matt: "My pleasure. Kord's strength to you." And he keeps on walking.
Travis: Kord's strength.
Sam: Kord's strength to you.
Matt: No, core strength.
Laura: Sit-ups. Crunches.
Travis: Core strength to you. Namaste.
Matt: You guys walk beyond the Trial Forge, back towards the path where you came off to the side on the left and you can see most of the buildings, their internal lighting is very low; you can see most folks either go to bed at this evening or at least keep a very low visual profile from their abodes. However, lights are blazing from the interior of this three-story inn. The Bellows' Respite is definitely a rowdy place. You can hear already the shouts and music streaming from the interior of it. You gather that, while there are a lot of people inside you can see at the windows and openings to the inside of the tavern, there is a large group gathered in the middle of the thoroughfare just outside of it. Looks like a circle of individuals that are all shouting and screaming over each other, big fist-pumps to the air, some folks are angrily throwing their coin purses to the ground.
Travis: Like a kid getting too close to an amusement park, I take off running.
Matt: Grog starts running up, bounding up the way, you can see the actual--
Marisha: Grog? Grog, not too far ahead!
Travis: Okay!
Liam: I don't start running, but I'm following behind him and I take out my Keen Dagger and just start sort of dancing it across my hand as I follow after him.
Matt: David Bowie and the glass orb.
Liam: Yes, exactly.
Orion: Is there a registry or something like that?
Matt: Actually, as you approach you can see there is no registry, there is quite literally a pit in the ground. It's a 15, 20-foot dip. It is a carved-out pit, maybe no more than I'd say 25, 30 feet across. And there is no ladder, there is no step going down, there's just two people in there beating the ever-living crap out of each other and a crowd of people gathering around. You do see what looks to be two very well-dressed gentlemen that are in the process of collecting and paying out, and you approach just as the final hit takes to this gentleman's jaw, this tattooed individual, you can see bloodied in the face, nose broken, teeth knocked out, this poor, poor human fellow gets knocked clean onto the ground. You can see standing over his body this extremely built, aggressive, looks like another human female with her hair pulled back in a very tight ponytail just spits on his body, turns around and wipes the blood from the front of her face. Snaps her fingers, and you can see folks bring a ladder and lean it over the side and she climbs up the ladder as everyone cheers on her way up.
Marisha: Before we get up to the crowd, I transform into Minxie. I'm going Minxie. And I catch up to Grog. Going Minxie.
Travis: Oh, they don't like magic.
Marisha: Did they see me? I'm trying to do it stealthily before it happens.
Matt: You can make a stealth check if you like. You do know through the discussions that it's arcane magic that seems to be the shunned element in this town. As it is a town of worship, divine magic for the most part seems okay.
Marisha: Everyone saw me. It's fine.
Matt: Everyone would've seen you if they weren't currently enraptured by the chaos. Those who did notice probably didn't seem to care much other than a giant tiger now walks up to them.
Travis: Can I grab the nearest person near me, turn whoever's shoulder that is, and go, who is she?
Matt: As you pull the shoulder around, you can see a rather portly human fellow, balding on top with long Benjamin Franklin-looking hair. Very nice robes, turns. "Are you new to this town, then, is it?"
Travis: Yeah, very new.
Matt: "That's the Siren. The Siren."
Orion: I approach and saunter next to Grog.
Travis: The Siren?
Matt: "She's the one you bet on. Trust me on that." As he walks over to, you can see another one of these gentlemen, very well-dressed, hair slicked back. Tall, thin human in very, very fine purple robes, collects some people's money, begins giving out a few things, pulls out a notebook with a little charter he's in the middle of putting notes in.
Laura: Hello. How would we enter a new fighter into this pit?
Matt: "Well, actually, that was the last fighter scheduled for the evening."
Travis: Be a pity not to have one more.
Matt: "You wish to fight?"
Travis: Wish? It's more like an itch. A need.
Matt: He puts his arm out and the crowd steps back a bit and he takes a good, long head-to-toe up-and-down look at you, walks around from side to side inspecting you. He gets a little bit close and reaches out, not even asking, he starts grabbing the side of your arms.
Marisha: I start growling a little bit.
Travis: Oh yeah, watch out.
Matt: "Calm down, kitty, calm down." Steps back. "Well, it's not too late. What caliber of fighter do you consider yourself?"
Travis: Caliber?
Matt: "Who do you want to fight?"
Sam: Who are the options?
Orion: Could he fight anyone?
Travis: This is my friend, Scanlan.
Sam: I'm more of his manager than his friend, actually. Hi, I'm Scanlan.
Matt: "Pleasure."
Sam: Pleasure's all mine. My brute over here, who can he battle, what are his options?
Matt: "This late in the evening--"
Liam: I'll fight him.
Sam: Excuse me?
Liam: I said I'll fight him.
Matt: "I apologize. If you're going to have someone enter the arena worth betting on, they have to go up against one of our proven fighters first. However, once your friend here gets his face beaten in, you're more than welcome to join him in the ring thereafter."
Travis: I haven't laughed so hard in my entire life. Face beaten, he says. Face beaten!
Matt: "You're mighty confident, aren't you?"
Travis: It's my middle-- I only have one name. (laughter)
Travis: If I did.
Sam: It would be that.
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: "Well, first and foremost, all bets begin at 100 gold pieces."
Laura: 100 gold? Is that all?
Matt: "You can increase the bet, if you'd like."
Laura: I'd love to.
Matt: "What would you like to bet?"
Laura: 500 gold on this one right here.
Matt: "Is she the only one betting?"
Sam: She bets for all of us.
Liam: I'll put a thousand down right now that I can beat the big guy.
Sam: You mean Grog?
Liam: Of my own money. Yes.
Laura: You can't fight him yet!
Liam: I can't? Rules are meant to be bent and stretched. Am I right?
Matt: "You're going to put your money down between your friends to fight your friends."
Liam: It's a contentious relationship.
Matt: His eyes have already wandered from your face, he says, "500 gold on the goliath. Do we hear anything else?" A few other individuals step up and start telling him like, "50 gold down." "It's a hundred-gold minimum." "100 gold."
Sam: Who is he fighting?
Travis: We don't know yet.
Sam: We have to bet before we see the meat?
Matt: "Unproven fighters with a grandiose sense of self-ability enjoy the surprise."
Taliesin: So what sort of odds are we talking about, then?
Matt: "For this one, based on your height, reach, strength and arrogance, I'd put you at four-to-one against."
Laura: Four-to-one.
Travis: Okay.
Orion: It's okay, Grog. He doesn't know that you've beaten up a lot of people.
Sam: Don't tell him.
Orion: Oh, right.
Travis: I've got this scar here. How does he think I got it?
Sam: Those are fair odds, we'll take that.
Matt: "All right. 500 gold. Is this all I'm hearing?"
Travis: A hundred of my own gold on me.
Matt: "600 gold."
Taliesin: Hold on.
Sam: I'll bet 50 gold against him. We have to hedge!
Matt: "100 gold is the minimum bet."
Sam: Well then, I can't afford it. I'm sorry. We have to hedge.
Laura: You're going to get it, Grog. You're going to do it. I have faith in you.
Orion: I'll put 500 gold on the goliath.
Laura: Oh my god. We're going to lose all our money on Grog. No we're not.
Matt: "All right. Last bets, last bets!" Everyone starts putting in their cash. A couple folks frenzy over, you see a couple guys--
Liam: I put a thousand on the goliath.
Sam: What?
Liam: 1,000 gold on the goliath.
Laura: Sing a song. Do you use arcane magic or do you use divine magic? Just sing a song, Scanlan.
Matt: "It seems your friends are confident in your ability. Let's hope we can put their money where your mouth is."
Travis: In my mouth?
Sam: It's an expression.
Matt: "All right."
Marisha: I brush against Grog. And I cast Stoneskin on him.
Sam: Will that show?
Marisha: Does that show?
Matt: You cannot cast a spell when you're in beast form.
Liam: Plus, kitty, you did that once and it didn't work out so well.
Orion: As I notice what the cat's doing, I'm standing right next to him, so I do it with my hand instead.
Liam: You got caught with your hand in the cookie jar.
Matt: As you begin casting the spell, immediately the guy says, "You do that one more time and you're all disqualified from ever competing."
Orion: Okay. I'm sorry, I just thought I'd give my friend an advantage.
Taliesin: He'll be fine. Look at him. He'll be fine.
Orion: Yes, I have two eyes.
Matt: At which point, the other individual whispers into the initial bookie's ear. "Yes. Retrieve him, please."
Travis: Him?
Matt: "For this fight, we have a newcomer. A newcomer who is named--"
Travis: Should I have a fancy name?
Sam: Yeah, you should have a fancy fighting name.
Orion: Grog the Destroyer.
Travis: Phillip. (laughter)
Orion: No, that's like the opposite of what I said.
Matt: "Phillip, the newcomer, has decided to hedge his and his friends' savings that he, upon what I can only imagine is his first arrival into Vasselheim, to get his face pummeled by our current standing champion: Kern the Hammer." At this point, the crowd immediately goes quiet and whispering, you can see a few individuals now walking over, ushering this man, looks like he just stepped out of the nearby mines, he's got coal dirt on his face. When I say man, it is a six-foot-six, very visibly half-orc gentleman, built like some sort of thick-ass building you've walked past coming through here. Bald head, big, bristly mustache, and a face that's obviously taken a beating over the years. He walks up nonchalantly, just wearing a simple tattered tunic, leather pants and boots. You can see him like cracking his fingers. He looks over to the side at one of the guys. "They better have pulled me out of work for a good reason. Who am I up against?"
Travis: I envy your facial hair.
Matt: "I envy your currently unbroken face. Currently."
Travis: I'm going to kill him. That's a rule, right? I'm not supposed to kill him?
Laura: You're not supposed to kill him. No killing allowed in this?
Matt: The bookie steps forward. "No killing. Fighting until one falls."
Travis: What happens if they start to cry?
Matt: "Then you keep punching."
Travis: I like it.
Matt: "No weapons. No armor. Fists against fists until one of them falls. Lower the ladder." As they put the ladder down into the arena. You can see the orc gentleman pulls out a small, enclosed, almost like a wineskin, like an iron wineskin, unscrews it and drinks it all down.
Travis: Kern the Shithead does?
Matt: Yeah. Puts it down, throws it to the ground, with a ting-ting-ting.
Laura: Wait, what was in that? Was that wine?
Matt: "It is customary to drink before a fight."
Travis: Can I have my cask of ale, real fast?
Laura: Wait, does anybody have a Potion of Stoneskin or anything good?
Matt: As everyone gathers around, you can now see people are coming back out of the tavern to gather around the outskirts of the Crucible. Grog gets lowered down the ladder.
Sam: Oh, he's already down?
Matt: Well, Grog, what else do you want to do before you prepare?
Travis: What do I want to do to prepare?
Matt: Well, if you haven't gone down yet. The other guy has come down the ladder.
Travis: I took a drink from the cask of ale--
Sam: Wait, I come over to Grog and I just look in his eyes and I say, listen, you've got this, I can't give you anything else, but you've got this, man. And I also very quickly take out my Potion of Fire Giant Strength and I slip it to him before he takes a drink of his ale. I don't know if I hand it to him.
Matt: Make a stealth check.
Sam: Okay. (squeaks) Nope.
Matt: What did you roll?
Sam: Oh, that's a six. So eight.
Matt: All right. As you walk towards him and begin looking in his eyes, as you begin to pull out the flask, a hand grasps your wrist. And you glance over and you can see one of the burly human gentlemen that escorted Kern the Hammer in is currently grasping your arm and says, "I'm watching you. One more try and I'll throw you in there. We'll go down ourselves."
Sam: It's for my asthma. I promise.
Matt: Shoves you back away, still clutching it. Looks to you, Grog, up into your eyes. "You going to climb down and fight or you going to be a pussy about it?"
Travis: That's a really good question. I would like to rage. And I jump in the fucking pit.
Matt: You leap over the side, completely avoiding the ladder, both feet hitting the ground with a heavy thud sound. The packed dust kicks up around your feet.
Sam: Come on, Phillip! Kick his ass!
Matt: At which point, the other orc's finished cracking his knuckles, just kind of wipes the spit off the edge of his chin, gives you a look (growls) and you see a bit of foam toss from the side of his mouth.
Liam: Nobody fucks with Phil.
Laura: I can smell you from here, Kern!
Matt: Go ahead and roll initiative.
Travis: 20.
Matt: 20! All righty.
Orion: Oh shit, you got a 20?
Matt: All right. You actually probably would've landed there from the run. First round starts. You're up.
Travis: I would like to cast Intimidating Presence on Fern the Fucknut.
Matt: Kern. But it's better if Grog gets it wrong.
Travis: He never gets it right. Phillip, thank you.
Matt: Phillip. All right, so. Use your action to use Intimidating Presence? All right, so what's the DC on that?
Travis: Saving throw, 13.
Matt: 13. That will unfortunately not succeed. As you glare at him with an angry Phillip glare, your bellow echoing through the bottom of this Crucible, which in itself forms a very interesting acoustic amplifying of your yell, you can see Kern on the other side is looking at you with the same intense, burning rage.
Sam: Wait, that's your whole move?
Matt: And you can move if you like.
Travis: I'll let him come to me.
Matt: Okay. All right. So as you stand there waiting with fists at your side, Kern takes his turn. You can see he begins to circle a little bit around you as he begins to spiral about with an unnerving speed, dashes forward, fists come swinging, one, two. Both strikes coming towards you. That is a 19.
Travis: Misses.
Matt: This is all fisticuffs. That is a 24.
Travis: That hits.
Matt: And as a bonus action, using his rage, a third attack. That is a 21.
Travis: That definitely hits.
Matt: All righty.
Liam: Would you like to use my spiky die?
Sam: Don't do it. You got this, Phillip.
Matt: The first one does eight points of damage. The second one does seven points of damage. As one fist clips you across the chin, the other one goes right into your abdominals. You're still tensing and you feel the impact but you just take the sheer weight of the force and flex and angrily stare him down in return.
Sam: Phillip, do that thing where you move your pecs up and down! (laughter)
Matt: That's going to be a gif. And as you now see Kern prepares for a second bout, it's your turn, Grog. What are you doing?
Travis: I would like to go into a frenzied rage. I would like to start with a giant front-kick forward and then hammer him down.
Matt: All right. Go for the first strike.
Travis: Shit, that misses. Two.
Matt: That's probably going to miss.
Travis: Yep. That's a 19.
Matt: 19 is going to hit.
Travis: And also 19.
Matt: Both hit, yep. So you go to kick with the front kick, and he dodges to the side. However, you still, using your giant haymaker, the inertia clips him across the face. Go ahead and roll damage.
Travis: That is a 16.
Matt: You're not fighting with your axe. This is with your fists. So rolling 1d4 and then half that.
Sam: Half that?
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: You only get half damage of a d4?
Matt: Yep. But you still add your strength modifier.
Liam: So these guys both potentially have like a hundred hit points.
Travis: Six. It was four, and then half of that is two, plus my modifier, which is four, so six.
Matt: Correct, so six damage. All righty.
Travis: And then four.
Matt: All righty.
Travis: This is what I use? For my fists? I got big-ass fists! I got tattoos and shit on them. I never shower, they fucking stink!
Taliesin: You could do more damage if you hit him with the die, because it's sharp, so you'd actually get more damage with the d4.
Matt: All right. So your modifier is plus-- it's plus three for the modifier?
Travis: No, my modifier's plus four.
Matt: Okay, and then what did you roll on that?
Travis: Two. Minus two.
Matt: Two, then five total.
Travis: Oh, five, yeah.
Matt: There you go. All righty, cool. So you hit him across the face and you hit him to the other side. He comes back, aligns his chin, and you can see he's now stooping in for some sort of an uppercut as he slips to the side a little bit with a sidestep. That will be a 25. A 20. And a one. So what's your AC?
Travis: 20.
Matt: All right, so both the first two hit. As he comes low for a full-on uppercut, hitting you for, that would be six points of damage (whack) under the chin. As you're currently reeling from the impact, he crouches down and is going to go for a knee to the middle of your groin. That is another six points of damage (whack) right in the Phillip junk. You instinctively give out a (grunts) from the impact. After that point, he comes up and it looks like he tries to go for some sort of a pile-drive grapple, and you instinctively kick off of him and his third attack is completely wasted. It's now your go.
Travis: No one fucks with Phillip Jr. I would like to bull rush and try and tackle him, and if it succeeds, I'd like to headbutt him on the ground.
Matt: Okay, okay. It's an action to do that, so you can use your bonus action to attempt--
Travis: And I would only get two attacks, right?
Matt: You only get one with this, technically. It's an action to grapple.
Travis: Okay.
Sam: Do it.
Travis: All right.
Matt: So go ahead and roll an athletics check.
Travis: No, that's even better. 22.
Matt: 22. Yeah, you slam into him, knock him to the ground, and you're now on top of him. He's currently considered grappled, and you can go ahead and attempt your headbutt.
Travis: Say hi! (boosh) That's a lot. 24.
Matt: 24? Yeah, definitely. So go ahead and roll damage on the same 1d4.
Travis: 1d4? It's my head!
Matt: Yep.
Sam: Your head is so puny.
Travis: It's got tattoos on it. One and a half. Oh. One and a half plus my strength, right?
Matt: So if it's three or four it's considered two. So six? All right. So as you tackle him to the ground and he's trying to pull you off, you reach up, (wham) just slam your forehead directly into the center of his face. As you pull back you can already see the blood streak off the front of your head as his nose is smushed even further into his gnarled facade. As you pull back, instead of pain, he's laughing. (laughs) As it comes to his turn, he's not attempting to break grapple. He's going to reach up and grab you and attempt to headbutt you in return.
Travis: I like it.
Matt: That's going to be a 21. A 23. And a 19. All right, that's a six, seven damage. So total of 13 damage. As he reaches up and slams you, slams you again. And as you start backing up, he goes to slam you a third time, and you catch his head in the middle of your mitt, and he's now face-to-face with you, just like (snarls). You guys are both snarling at each other like two rabid beasts. It's your go.
Travis: I would like to keep his head right where I have it and take my elbow and drive it down into the bridge of his nose. So that's 25?
Matt: 25 hits.
Travis: 22?
Matt: Hits.
Travis: And 17.
Matt: 17 does miss. All right. So go ahead and roll damage for the next two strikes.
Travis: With this thing again? Six.
Matt: Six, all righty.
Travis: It's hard to get above a six. And six.
Matt: Six, nice. So as you hold him down, his face, (wham). Head goes, cracks against the ground of the Crucible. As he starts picking his head up again, you drill back again, (wham) hit him a second time. This time, you can see now. His nose was already busted before. Now it's nearly concave. It's like he didn't have a nose before and there's just a bloody void where it once was. He's still smiling in a weird, twisted way. He seems to be enjoying this almost as much as you. You go down for the third one, and this time he reaches up and grabs your elbow. He's going to take his turn to attempt to break your grapple as his action. Go ahead and roll either an athletics or an acrobatics check.
Travis: 12.
Matt: 12? All right. He kicks you up back onto your feet, and as he does, he kip-ups onto his feet, as well. Looks at you with a smile, wipes the snot and blood from the front of his face, licks it off his hand, and with that same hand he rears back, almost like he's winding up for a punch, and then just kicks you right in the center of your stomach.
Travis: I like the feint, I like the feint.
Matt: That's 22. Yeah, that'll hit. That is eight points of damage.
Orion: He's fucking strong.
Laura: You suck, Korn!
Matt: That ends his turn now, you're up, Grog. You're both now standing face-to-face again, you're reeling from the kick to the breadbasket.
Travis: You hit me with the knuckle you fucking licked. So I'd like to jump forward and throw my knee forward and at the last minute pull it back and throw my fist in a Superman punch.
Matt: All right, go ahead and roll.
Travis: Yes, fuck you, 19.
Matt: 19 just barely hits.
Travis: And I'll follow it over with a left-right. (boom, boom)
Matt: Go for it.
Sam: Are you still raging?
Travis: 21. Oh yeah, frenzied, so I get three. And 22.
Matt: All hit.
Travis: Outstanding. Watch me roll a six.
Sam: (whispers) Should we do something?
Liam: Have an ale. And collect the money.
Sam: I feel like we should do something.
Travis: 16, total.
Matt: Nice. (whack, whack) You first jumped, hit him in the face. As he stumbles backward, use the inertia to slam him again with the same fist in the face and then turn around with a full-on haymaker to the side of the temple. (whack) As you can see, there's a spray of blood and spittle across the, you guys are starting to push towards the back wall of the Crucible, and he actually staggers back a little bit towards the wall from the impact. (cackles) And he charges towards you, putting his head right towards the stomach that he kicked before, going for that same soft spot he's opened for himself. That's going to be a 20. Yeah, that hits. 21. And 21. Comes in, slams you into the middle of your abdomen for seven damage.
Sam: Should I sing?
Matt: Eight damage. And then an additional seven. So that'd be 15, 22 points of damage. As he slams his head into your midsection, picks you up over his head, slams you onto the ground, and as you're on the ground, he runs up and soccer-ball kicks you in the side of your ribs, just (whack). You hear a crack as the impact hits and you can feel that surging, shooting, burning pain begin to fill the side of your torso. It's your go.
Travis: What else do I have? What can I do?
Laura: You can throw some dirt in his face!
Sam: From the stands, I turn to a portly gentleman next to me and I say, sir, do you see what that fucking little elf said about your mother? He called her a name I can't even repeat. I'm so sorry.
Matt: Go ahead and make a deception check.
Laura: Was he pointing at you?
Sam: Yes.
Laura: Oh god.
Sam: 18.
Matt: He looks down at you and looks over at the elf and he says, "I'll deal with him after the fight. I've got too much money on this right now."
Liam: What an asp-hole.
Travis: I roll up off of my side and I start to go, oh, I don't know, it might be too much. And I grab a handful of dirt and I throw it up into his face.
Matt: All right. Riki-oh style. I like it. All right. So. As you go ahead, go ahead and just roll a basic attack.
Travis: Fuck. Thank you, god. 26.
Matt: 26. Make a dexterity save on his end-- no, that won't work. So you throw the dirt up. As he's rushing towards you to follow up on the attack, the dirt goes streaming into his eyes and for a second he stumbles and starts trying to wipe his face. As he does, he has the blood on his hands that's also getting in his eyes, the blood's starting to cake up a bit, and he's just reaching out in the area. So that's your first attack.
Travis: Because I feel like we have a kinship, I take my foot and I throw it right up into his grundle, just soccer-kick the shit out of his nuts. (laughter)
Matt: Go ahead and roll an attack. You have advantage on this currently, because he can't see it coming.
Travis: That's even better! 25.
Matt: 25. Go ahead and roll damage.
Travis: Oh no, I only have two, right? Ten.
Laura: How was that ten, baby? That was 11. The first one was a five.
Travis: Halved. Six.
Laura: That's 11.
Travis: 11.
Matt: 11.
Sam: Baby!
Matt: If you're going to do grundle damage. So as he's reeling and tries to reach out, swiping a back-fist into open air, you rush up and (whack) hit him with sheer force that you hear a unanimous (groans) in the crowd all around echo down. His knees immediately bend in towards each other, and you can see the sound escape instinctively from him, it's like, (wheezes). As you reel for your second strike, which is going to be? What's the second one you do?
Travis: Well, did he drop to his knees?
Matt: No, he's still standing, but barely.
Travis: Oh, really? Yeah, same place.
Matt: You pull back and (whack) a second time in the same spot, this sending him onto the ground from behind. He is currently prone. Okay, that's rough.
Travis: Literally trying to see him cough a testicle. (laughter)
Matt: Well, regardless of what happens, there's going to be a search. (laughter)
Matt: You're going to need a scouting party to find where one of them went. So at the top of his turn, gets up and wipes dirt crust from his eyes, reeling from the impact. Uses half his movement to get up and staggers toward you as you're just welcoming it. Looks up at you for a second and says, "You shouldn't have done that, tall guy." At which point, he goes and lunges for your midsection a second time. Misses with that strike, as you dodge out of the way he spins around and attempts to back-kick you to the torso. That will hit. A 26. And that one is going to-- That's going to be six points of damage to you from the back-kick, and as his foot comes down, he's still reaching for his groin from the sheer pain, he just rushes forward and attempts to bite into your shoulder. That's going to be a 20.
Travis: He rolled a 20?
Matt: Not a natural 20. Just a total of 20. He's rolled a lot of 20s. That's going to be seven damage as he sinks his teeth into the side of your shoulder and neck area. And tears a chunk of your flesh out of the sides of his mouth, now, in the muscle. So you reel back in pain and you're both clutched in this gladiatorial grip. It's your go.
Travis: Oh, amazing. Since we're clutched in that grip, I'll grab him back and I'm going to try and bite his nose off.
Sam: Wait, doesn't he have no nose?
Travis: Oh, he's missing a hollow, right?
Matt: It's mashed in.
Travis: How about I just aim for this area and if I catch lip I'll take it as a victory.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and roll.
Travis: Yes! Okay, 21.
Matt: That hits.
Travis: 20. And 24.
Matt: All hit. So as you reach forward, you use the yell of pain to turn it into an attack, reach forward and bite into the front of his face. You don't get any nose, but you do catch the top of his lip. As you pull back with a snapping sound, part of his upper lip just comes off in your mouth. How much damage does that do?
Marisha: It's a souvenir.
Travis: The first one is six.
Matt: Six damage. All right. What's your follow-up attack?
Travis: Would you say that he reaches back for his face like that in pain?
Matt: Oh yeah, he rears up with his hand right there and is like, (yelps).
Travis: Fantastic. I'd like to just drive my fist into his throat as his head's arched back.
Matt: All right, go ahead and roll damage on that.
Travis: Yes! Five.
Matt: Five, all right.
Sam: You know what I love about these fights? They're beautiful. The beauty of the human body.
Matt: The blood's pouring down the front of his face and his throat. You clip him right in the center of his throat. You hear the coughing sound as he, with his other hand, reaches up and grabs his throat. You can now see his front teeth visible through the lip that's no longer there. And what's your third strike?
Travis: Would you say that he bends forward, then, because he's grabbing his throat like that?
Matt: He's tough. He's bending forward, but he's not completely incapacitated. He's in pain.
Travis: Right, I would say I go up next to him and invoke a fabled hero that I heard about in the woods named Macho Man Randy Savage, and I double-tap my elbow and drive it down on top of his head.
Matt: (laughs) All right. Go ahead and roll damage on this one.
Travis: Thank you. Six.
Matt: Six. So as you leap up, using the goliath weight coming down, you double-tap the elbow and you bring it down on top of his head. He, from the sheer force of it (wham) slams down face-first into the dirt, just like that. Onto the ground. As he's getting up, he's looking kind of rough.
Liam: I believe that's pronounced Ma-choman Rand'Savage.
Matt: There you are. A gracious warrior of the woods. While on the ground, he reaches forward and attempts to sweep your legs out from under you. Go ahead and make-- this would be an acrobatics-- no, we'll make this a dexterity saving throw. Why not?
Travis: Ten.
Matt: Ten. (whoosh) Pulls your legs out from under you, slams you onto your back. As he leaps up on top of you immediately and with both of his fists in the air slams them down towards your face. That's going to be a 22.
Travis: What?
Matt: 22 to hit. You take six points of damage.
Travis: Oh, good. (laughs) I was thinking 22 points of damage!
Matt: And a 23 to hit, it's going to be an additional eight points of damage. Just once down on your face, and again with a second slam, right down onto the front of the face again. You can taste all the irony blood and liquid pouring through your sinuses down into the back of your throat as you're currently on the ground with him on top of you. You're both looking pretty rough. Where are you at, hit point-wise?
Travis: I say, tastes like home. And I spit in his face and reach up and thunderclap both of his ears.
Matt: (laughs) All right, go ahead and roll for attack.
Travis: 24.
Matt: Hits.
Travis: 17.
Matt: 17 does not hit.
Travis: 22.
Matt: 22 does hit. So you reach up. Go ahead and roll damage.
Travis: Oh yeah, right.
Matt: (whack) Thunderclap to the side of both his ears.
Travis: Six.
Matt: Six points of damage. As he rears back and instinctively his hands go up and try and grab at your wrists, you pull the wrists back, and he's holding you from that point. You attempt to go for another strike, but he just redirects it with his own arms. You manage to pull out of the grip with a third strike. What are you doing for that one?
Travis: He pulled away from my wrists, and I'll give him a little of the same. Put my fists together and just swing straight down into his solar plexus since he's sitting on top of me.
Matt: Roll damage.
Travis: That's a five.
Matt: Five. (wham) You hit and you hear the wind out of him from the impact, (wheezes) and he's trying to get the wind back.
Travis: I can't hear you. What?
Matt: He pushes off of your chest to stand up for a second and (gasps) gets one big inhale of air, and as he does, he reaches up his leg and then tries to curb-stomp kick you right in the stomach while you're still on the ground. That will be 18.
Travis: Misses!
Matt: All right. A 19.
Travis: Misses!
Matt: And that will be a 24.
Travis: You son of a bitch!
Matt: All right. So he goes to kick you once, and you dodge out of the way. Kick a second time. This time, you catch the foot and hold it in place. He then lifts up with his other foot to a point where now you're holding him in the air. As he puts all of his weight in the air, he comes down and slams his elbow right into the center of your chest, in the way you did to his head earlier. That's going to be for a total of eight points of damage.
Travis: Okay.
Liam: I take the flagon of ale that I've been drinking all this time. I slam it down on the ground and push my sister out of the way and yell at the top of my lungs, Grog! Your father was an undead piece of shit and your cousin's going to make you his bitch!
Taliesin: There's not enough popcorn in the world for this.
Laura: I know.
Travis: (growls) I would like to reach forward with both of my thumbs and shove them into his fucking eye sockets.
Matt: Roll an attack.
Travis: Fuck!
Laura: Oh, no. You distracted him.
Travis: 12. That's better. 22.
Matt: Okay, so as you reach up to try to get his eyes, he grasps your hands and instead begins pulling back on the wrists. You can feel the tension of the bone beginning to bend from the sheer strength and force of it. As you pull back your arms, you attempt to headbutt him again and he dodges his head out of the way, and he knows he has you at an advantageous position. What do you want the third attack to be?
Travis: He's still on top of me, isn't he?
Matt: Yeah. Where are you at hit point-wise, by the way?
Travis: 18.
Matt: He's looking pretty rough, too. So what do you want the third attack to be?
Travis: Would you say he's on my chest?
Matt: He's currently on your chest and waist area right now, like (grunts) holding you down.
Travis: I was going to grapple him, but if he's on my chest, I'll use my thighs to shove him up towards the upper part of my body and I'll drive down my elbow at the same time. Into that whole bloody target area.
Matt: (laughs) Okay. As you shift upward, you bring your elbow forward. Roll for attack.
Sam: No, he rolled three already.
Matt: Oh, that's right.
Travis: I got at least a six.
Matt: So six damage? Okay, as you position him up, (whack) the elbow hits, and you can feel it sink in. What bones are there are mostly splintered and broken, and you get a good inch into his face with your elbow. As you pull back, he's looking really rough, and one of his eyes is beginning to swell entirely shut.
Travis: We look like a Rocky movie right now.
Matt: Yeah. This is a full-on, drag-out fight.
Travis: I must break you!
Matt: He angrily looks down at you, (snarls) and he reaches both of his hands up again in a giant hammer fashion. That's going to be a 17?
Travis: Misses.
Matt: A 20.
Travis: Hits.
Matt: And a 15.
Travis: Misses!
Matt: So he brings it down. (wham) As it hits, you manage to take the brunt of it in the shoulder. The second hit comes down and slams you for eight points of damage. (wham) This one, you can feel the sternum crack. As he brings up his fists a third time, attempting to end this, you use the leverage you had when you pushed him up to actually spring your entire body upward and force him off you. He manages to get to his feet and you just get up and you both are bleeding from all over your faces with giant bruises, and both of you are barely holding yourselves up, breathing heavily. It's your go.
Travis: I'm going to rush at him, spit on my knuckles, swing back, and at the last second, take my right foot and drive it right through his kneecap.
Matt: Roll for attack.
Travis: Fuck you! Yes! 24.
Matt: 24 hits.
Travis: 22.
Matt: 22.
Travis: 19?
Matt: 19 just barely hits. (cheering)
Matt: All right, so as you run forward, bring the leg up, (whack) you hit the side of the knee. Roll damage.
Sam: Come on, roll good.
Travis: Five. Six. Six.
Matt: All right, and what are the attacks you do?
Travis: I want to drive my foot through his kneecap.
Matt: It snaps. He's still standing on the other leg, but the knee is cracked behind.
Travis: Oh, that's amazing. I'll just put my foot through his other knee.
Matt: As you jump off the other one, (whack) it catches the knee. It doesn't snap, but you can see there is a bend to it, and then he falls to the ground, on both of his busted knees now, looking up at you. And with the third strike, what are you going to do?
Travis: I would like to grab his head, since he's probably kneeling on the ground at this point, right? And say, there's only room for one to rage in this pit. And I take it, and I just smash into the top of his jaw, hopefully dislocating the bloody, lipless face that I see.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: Wait, is he an orc?
Matt: He's a half-orc.
Travis: As a half-orc, does he got those big teeth?
Matt: There are little tusks there, yeah.
Travis: I'll grab onto those.
Matt: They're small to pull. You slam down on his face. (crunch) You can see the jaw crack open. The tongue instinctively moves around a little, but the jaw is definitely broken from the impact.
Sam: It's like a dance! It's like a beautiful dance.
Matt: You can see, that blow should have taken him out, because there was nothing left.
Travis: He's like the Black Knight in Monty Python! He's got no knees!
Matt: His body goes limp for a brief second. You can see the half-orc rage kicks in. That half-orc's blood. You can see him now rally up for one final round of vengeance against you, Grog. Reaches up and grabs you by the throat and brings you up to slam into his head. This is going to be a 21. A 17.
Sam: Miss.
Matt: And a 22. So grabs you, slams into your head with the first strike. That is going to be six points of damage. (boom) Into the face. You can feel like the shock, the white light in your eyes as the impact smashes into you. He goes to do it a second time. This time you instinctively reach down with your hands and push his face away. You can feel the fading just from the sheer impact as he pushes you up onto your feet again and you step back. And he takes a moment to look at you with his missing lip, his bashed-in nose, eye swollen shut, both knees messed up. (pants) "Respect." And then he runs forward and with one heaping haymaker just takes you in the face with a cracking sound for six points of damage. (groaning)
Matt: With a resounding crack Grog's head spins, his body turning. He stumbles a couple of steps, falls to one knee, face-down in the dirt, unconscious. The whole crowd raises and cheers, (cheering) as the mostly broken half-orc raises one of its fists to the air, walks around, looks over to your body, reaches into his pocket and flicks a gold coin onto your back. Walks over to the ladder and begins very painfully making his way up to the edge of the Crucible.
Laura: Yeah, he's only using his arms because he's got no knees! Douche.
Matt: Getting up to the top, the crowd cheers. You can now see one of the bookies reveals a holy symbol, one that you recognize as the symbol of Kord, and he goes down and immediately begins administering, healing to our recently unconscious Grog. You can see the other bookie, who is dressed similarly in the purplish robes you saw before, also begins to heal our good fighting half-orc friend as he lumps over and takes his sack of coins from him. The clerics of Kord are the ones actually running this, it looks like. You come to in the pit, Grog, beaten, wearied, and fatigued because of your frenzied rage. However, you have been defeated in the Crucible.
Laura: That was painful.
Matt: That was so close.
Sam: I go down and nurse him, nurse his head, hold him, and just tell him, Grog, you won! You did it, buddy!
Matt: Make a deception roll.
Sam: 16.
Matt: I would say given the circumstances, it's nice that he's trying, but it's been a while since you've been bested in one-on-one combat, and a part of you is deeply hurt by it. But at the same time, there is that burning fire, that need to come back and vengefully tear him down from his precipice when you're ready.
Travis: I say nothing.
Orion: It's okay, buddy. This isn't the first time you've been knocked unconscious.
Laura: It's too bad Pike didn't cast Death Ward on him before she left, though. That would've been great.
Marisha: I go up and rub on him and (meows).
Matt: As you're being tended to by your party, the same bookie that brought you in comes over and taps you on the shoulder and says, "Not going to lie, no one has taken a beating from the Hammer like that and brought him so close. I don't think he's going to be able to take another round with you for at least a few days. But you're welcome to fight in my ring any time you wish."
Laura: We'll need to earn our money back.
Matt: "There is that, yes."
Orion: Or you could just give it to us.
Travis: I walk away.
Laura: Is there a whorehouse here in Vasselheim?
Orion: You're asking this question?
Matt: A curious laugh comes across the bookie's face and he says, "The third floor of the Bellows'--" What did I call it, again?
Sam: The Bellows' Respite.
Matt: The Bellows' Respite. Sorry, I was in the moment. "The third floor of the Bellows' Respite does itself run as a brothel, if that's what you're inquiring."
Laura: That is what I was inquiring.
Taliesin: Come on, Grog, we'll get you ice cream.
Laura: We'll get you ice cream, Grog, and a whore. How's that sound?
Liam: Coldstone?
Orion: Grog, you can eat the ice cream from the whore.
Laura: Tiberius, really?
Orion: I'm trying to be creative here. Make him feel good. Fireworks. Prestidigitation.
Matt: All right. Grog, as you make your way into the tavern, there is, though in your solemn state you can see a number of the patrons who were watching from the inside who were part of the crowd all give a round of applause to you as you enter. The barkeep who turns to you, a human fellow who's missing one eye, has a tufted, spotty beard and happily extends a large tankard of ale and says, "On the house for you, friend! You fought well tonight."
Travis: I like your beard.
Liam: I take five of my remaining gold and slide it over to that bartender and say, just keep it coming. All night, please. Thanks.
Matt: "I'll deliver it to the room. By the way, what room are you staying in?"
Sam: Do we have a room?
Laura: We would love one of those.
Liam: The third floor, I believe.
Laura: For some of us, not all of us.
Sam: I don't think he's going to want to... partake tonight.
Liam: Might have problems.
Sam: Aw, he's chugging. He's sadness-chugging.
Matt: "The rest of you, how many rooms you taking? Three amongst you?"
Sam: Three.
Matt: "Three rooms for the night."
Sam: Plus a stable for our bear.
Laura: No. Our bear will stay in the room with us girls.
Travis: It looked like rain, right? I'll be out there with the pigs.
Laura: No, Grog.
Sam: No, it's okay, he needs to stew in this for a while.
Matt: "Your room's on the house, friend. The rest of you, that'll be six gold for the evening."
Orion: I'll stay in your room, Grog.
Sam: I don't think he wants company tonight.
Orion: No, he can sleep with the pigs. I'll stay in the free room.
Matt: So that's six gold for them. All right, so mark off your losses for the money you put in for the pot.
Travis: Where do I mark off my loss of pride?
Matt: That would be under additional notes.
Sam: I almost won.
Taliesin: Damn it.
Laura: Almost.
Travis: What did he have, that orc piece of shit, he had what that made him come back?
Matt: It's a half-orc racial ability that the first time they're dropped to zero hit points, they can instead choose to be at one hit point. They can only do it once per day.
Travis: He had one left?!
Matt: You brought him to negative five on that final hit, but that half-orc racial ability...
Travis: That's even worse!
Liam: Grog, if it's any consolation--
Travis: What's that mean?
Taliesin: It's a grouping of stars in the sky.
Liam: As I had no idea that weapons weren't allowed in there, if you and I had fought, you would've beaten me to a bloody paste.
Travis: Oh, you weren't serious, were you? I thought you were being funny. (laughter)
Travis: Oh.
Sam: There's a lot of injured pride tonight.
Marisha: Guys, we've had a really emotional day. Can we just sleep?
Orion: I found it to be very entertaining.
Sam: Hey, does anyone want to come to my room and look through my shit to see how Pike's doing?
Laura: Okay, yeah!
Orion: Let's look through your shit. Scanlan.
Liam: Pike would have been proud of you, Grog.
Travis: Thank you. And if there had been weapons I'd be in deep shit. I'll be at the bar.
Laura: Oh, Grog, come on.
Sam: That's not even chicken, that's just a piece of wood. (laughter)
Matt: And yet it doesn't stop him as he, bite by bite, makes his way through the piece of driftwood he found by the bar.
Liam: I slap down another five gold to the bartender and say, that's for that barstool.
Matt: "Thank you." Which, the barstools, by the way, have a thick, crusty wool on them, so there's a unique flavor to the piece you've chewed through.
Travis: The frying on this chicken is exquisite.
Matt: As you all take your evening of rest in your respective groups, Grog, eating and drinking away your worries until eventually you are unable to make conversation, you sloppily make your way to the third floor to a room in the brothel that has been prepared and awaiting for you, paid for by the Bellows' Respite, and you find yourself sloppily disappointing a woman until you pass out in your own sorrow. (laughter)
Matt: And with that, we're going to take a quick break, but we'll be back here in about ten minutes, guys, right after Overlord has a few.
Travis: Fuck!
Laura: He's so upset. He's really upset.
Marisha: I've never seen him this upset.
Orion: Yeah, isn't it weird when other people get upset?
Zac: He's definitely not a challenge for Overlord status, that's for sure. Guys, so in case you're wondering what all of this 5k hype is that you keep seeing, if you're watching from home and you tuned in after we started. Megiyama in the chatroom has challenged you guys, the audience, if we get up to 5,000 subscribers tonight, he will buy a very large, and by very large I mean eight feet tall. It is massive. He sent me a picture; it is massive, I don't know where we will put it. We'll figure it out somehow. He will buy that for us and ship it to us, it's a very, very generous thing to help get us to 5,000 subscribers, and I was told from some people in the chat that I should also contribute in some way, shape, or form, so I have agreed to dress up as Pengulord tomorrow all day if we reach this goal. And for those who don't know, there was a very large war this morning in team No Stream, the chatroom, while we were offline. Someone thought it would be funny to put my face on a penguin. I did not think it was funny, and I timed out and banned every single person that referenced it, and exalted all of my power as Overlord, so it pains me to agree to do this, very much so, because it completely diminishes everything I've strived so hard for in world domination. Penguins are the least-threatening animals on the planet, and I despise them.
Matt: Wow, that is an intensity. Pengulord, guys.
Zac: Good for you guys.
Matt: Pengulord, I like the sound of that.
Marisha: They like to snuggle.
Zac: Well, good for them. No.
Matt: We could fit Pengulord on a license plate, right?
Zac: No. Too many letters.
Taliesin: If we get you in this outfit, will you waddle? That's really the question.
Zac: I said 5,000 subs, not my dignity and everything. I will put on the damn outfit at 5,000. That's all I have to offer. I'm already still working on a damn music video, so all I have left to offer is my dignity and every ounce of pride I have in anything.
Matt: So if we somehow get to 5,000 subscribers, we get an eight-foot Trinket and Pengulord gets to rule the stream tomorrow. We'll be back in about five, ten minutes, guys, please stick around, we have more interesting things to see.
Marisha: Oh wait, before we log off, we have this ready to go. Follow our amazing artists. Also, follow Espionage Cosmetics because they're amazing supporters of the show. Tweet at them and be like, thank you so much for supporting Critical Role. Because they're awesome. Okay. [dramatic music]
Travis: Right, listen up! If you have ale, then you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw. A goliath of towering height and size, this barbarian has an appetite for the two great loves in his life: combat, women, and ale! (chuckle) (record scratch) Wait. Easily the brains of the group, Grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes, colors, and (chuckle) shiny things! Also ale. In his early years, armed with his two-handed great axe, Grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst the ranks of his family's wandering herd. But after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly gnome in the woods, he objected to the killing of such an innocent life. A creature of impulse, Grog felt only pity for this-- well, this terrified little thing. And his disobedience cost him dearly. Beaten bloody and banished by the herd leader, his uncle Kevdak, Grog was abandoned and left to die, exiled from his herd. It was then that the relative of the very gnome he fought to save, saved him. It was the kindness of a gnome cleric named Pike that healed Grog, bringing him back from death's edge. And they have remained close friends ever since. Most nights, Grog can be found challenging entire taverns to wrestling matches! Ha! Or accompanying Scanlan to the nearest house where you pay for lady favors. Also ale!
Marisha: A first impression of Keyleth would leave you with little information on the half-elven druid. You might even think that her social awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is kind of sweet. (chuckle) Of course, it would be unwise to underestimate her based on first impressions. (thunder) Under that unintimidating petite frame is a vicious beast waiting to be unleashed, whose natural powers have made even the fiercest of champions pee their pants, literally! (soft chuckle) Born to the Air Tribe of the Ashari people, Keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and the elemental magics. It is her people's inherent duty to protect the delicate areas in Tal'Dorei where the four elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm. Since she was a little girl, she had quite a knack for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities. Well, if you consider kittens and flying squirrels to be little beasts. Which, I do. (clears throat) Anyways, it wasn't long before the headmaster of the tribe, her father, Korren, realized her true prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster. Just like that, her jovial childhood was stripped and replaced with endless spell memorization, teachings from ancient traditions, and exceedingly high expectations. Every druid leader to be must embark on a journey to seek out the sister tribes in order to introduce and establish respect amongst the fellow headmasters. They call this the Aramente, or Noble Odyssey. When her father felt she was ready, he set her on the path to truly discovering herself, not knowing when, or if, she will ever return. As she hiked down the mountain towards Stillben, she meditated on the task ahead. Part of the Aramente is proving yourself a strong warrior, a valiant protector, and a wise and compassionate leader. With this knowledge, one thought plays on repeat in her mind: Is she even worthy?
Taliesin: Percy was the third of seven children, born to a noble family who lived far to the north in the ancient castle of Whitestone. With so many siblings to share the burdens of lordship, Percy turned his attentions to the sciences, engineering, and naturalism. One day, a mysterious couple named Lord and Lady Briarwood came to court. During a feast held in their honor, the Briarwoods violently took control of the castle, killing or imprisoning everyone who would stand in their way. Percy awoke chained in the dungeon, only to be freed by his younger sister. Together they fled, chased by the Briarwoods' men. As they ran, Percy's sister took several arrows to the chest and fell. Percy kept running, eventually jumping into a freezing river and floating unconscious to freedom. He did not remember waking up on a fishing boat. He barely remembered the next two years, as he slowly made his way as far south as possible. Then one night, Percy had a dream. A roaring cloud of smoke offered him vengeance against those who destroyed his family. When he awoke, Percy began to design his first gun. (gunshot)
Ashley: Pike grew up on the outskirts of town, near the Bramblewood. Her ancestors were a family of deep gnomes with quite an unfavorable reputation. Thievery, destruction, and trickery left them with the curse of the last name Trickfoot. Sarenrae, the goddess of healing and redemption, had other plans for Pike's great-great-grandfather Wilhand, who left his family at a young age after a dream: a dream that changed the course of the Trickfoot family. Wilhand devoted his life to Sarenrae and pledged from then on that him and his family would live a life of service and devotion. As a child, Pike seemed to have an affinity to heal. Whether it was animals, people, or even flowers, she felt she had a purpose in making things whole that had once been broken. She studied and learned the ways to heal though divine magic. She lived a peaceful life, quiet and simple, until one day, Wilhand was captured and almost killed by a group of goliath barbarians. One of the goliaths took a stand against the murder of the innocent gnome and he himself was beaten, bloodied, and left for dead, abandoned by his herd. Wilhand went to Pike for help. She prayed and healed this barbarian as best she could, bringing him back to life. When he awoke, she discovered his name was Grog Strongjaw. After that, they were the best of friends, a rather unlikely pair. Little did she know that in a few years' time, Grog would soon return the favor and bring her back from the clutches of death. (roar, crunch) After being killed in battle, Pike felt angry. She wanted to be stronger so that it would never happen again. She spent four months at sea training with the men and women aboard a ship called the Broken Howl. Gripping her holy symbol in one hand and her morningstar in the other, this time, Pike is ready.
Sam: Oh, you haven't heard of Scanlan Shorthalt? Well, gird your loins, ladies, because he has his eye on you. A talented musician, master of disguise, and dashingly handsome in his own mind, Scanlan sings songs almost as much as he sings his own praises. Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used his endless charm and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and support his single mother. One day he was discovered by a half-orc promoter and joined Dr. Dranzel's Spectacular Traveling Troupe, where he learned the ways of the world and honed his skills as a bard extraordinaire. A loner much of his life, Scanlan has never quite come to terms with the violent death of his mother at the hands of a goblin invasion. While his years on the road provided many, shall we say, educational experiences with the opposite sex, deep down, Scanlan yearns for the one thing he's never known: the true love of a fellow gnome. Still, Scanlan considers himself a lover first, performer second, and fighter distant third. On the battlefield, he'll support his allies, but rarely draws blood, unless it's to protect fellow gnome, Pike. Count on Scanlan for a hearty laugh, a rollicking song, and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts and makes the females swoon.
Orion: Greetings and salutations. I am Tiberius Stormwind. I hail from a town called Ty'rex, located in the heart of Draconia. From a politically respected family, at the age of 15, I succeeded in passing the Sorcerer's Rite, showing prodigy-like control of my magic. The judges and the Draconian high council were amazed at how powerful my spells were for how long I had been training. At 20 years old, I was the youngest appointed member of the magic guild in Draconian history. For the next few years, I almost went mad from the malaise of being a guild member, as it's rather boring. However, one day I happened upon a chamber, unused for quite some time. In the room were stacks of books and maps of the surrounding cities and areas around the known world. For months, I would frequent the chamber, and learned of artifacts from legend. After a long period of research, I made a list of artifacts that caught my eye. I brought these findings to the high council and was told that all of the information in the chamber I had stumbled upon was either believed to be fiction, or unsolvable mysteries, and hence were lost forever. I found those answers to be unacceptable. A year later, I devised a ruse and managed to convince the city council to lend support in me leaving Draconia on a mission of peace and diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms, going from town to town and making friends and allies, in and for the name of Draconia. Being a red dragonborn, I had quite the task on my hands in that respect, but it was exactly what I needed so I could explore the world and find these artifacts, as I felt the truth was out there. Some may describe me as buffoonish, but I say poppycock to all that. I am much sharper than most give me credit for. I just don't pay attention to things sometimes. I've also been known to be rather cunning, loyal, happy-go-lucky, and well, dangerous. I can't help but show my true scales every now and then. But overall, I think I'm quite friendly for a dragonborn!
Liam: Never entirely welcome in the company of elves or men, Vax'ildan learned at a young age to skip past formality, preferring instead to invite himself in your door. Along with twin sister Vex'ahlia, Vax was born by a chance encounter between elven royalty and human peasantry. Raised by their mother in their early years, the twins were eventually sent off to their father in the elven capital of Syngorn. But their cool reception among the elves--
Matt: Welcome back, guys. All right, so we had a little break here. Remember to follow our awesome artists on the Twitter. So, let's go ahead and get back to the game so we can-- we have a lot to do tonight. All right. As morning comes to, the rest of you wake up, the first thought, of course, being the heartache for your friend Grog, who is not in any of the rooms.
Laura: The heartache for our lost money.
Matt: Yeah, more the money probably for Vex-- but as you wake up, Grog is nowhere to be found in your rooms, of course. He wandered off to presumably the third floor.
Taliesin: Is that a euphemism?
Matt: It can be.
Marisha: I'm still in Minxie form. I slept in Minxie form. I'm going to go look for him, see if I can find him in any of the rooms on the third floor.
Matt: Okay. A giant white saber-toothed tiger wandering the interior does set off a few minds. I mean, an armored bear being escorted is one thing, but a lone saber-toothed tiger? As soon as you make your way through the hallway, you can see one of the patrons comes out of the room and goes, (startled sound) and goes and pulls his blade out, like, "Help! Help, there's a tiger! There's a tiger in the inn!"
Marisha: Why does this always happen to me?
Liam: Hearing yelling, I run up the stairs and say, hey, has anyone seen a-- oh, there you are. Come on, Snibbles, come on. We've got to go back downstairs.
Matt: "Hey, keep that thing on a leash, sir."
Liam: I'm really sorry.
Matt: "Liable to kill someone!"
Liam: Chews through her rope all the time. Come on, Snibbles.
Marisha: I roll over on my back, and I'm like those cats you see on YouTube who hate being on leashes. Just dragging.
Liam: I start going, on the tummy.
Matt: Goes back in his room and closes the door.
Laura: I'm pretty sure you just groped her.
Matt: At about this time, you hear a heavy footfall. A second heavy footfall. A third heavy footfall. And from around the corner of the staircase, descending from the third floor, you see a very hungover and expressionless Grog squinting and making his way down.
Liam: Morning, big guy. Have fun last night?
Marisha: God. You're not going to puke, are you?
Matt: You hear (meowing).
Travis: I never puke.
Laura: Do you need some breakfast or ale?
Travis: What, food? I think I'm good.
Laura: All right.
Liam: I think you need an ale.
Laura: Little hair of the dog? Yeah?
Travis: Now that sounds like a plan.
Laura: All right.
Matt: You guys head down. The rest of you manage to eventually wake and make your way down to the tavern, where Grog is already in the process of consuming his liquid breakfast.
Orion: Hold on, I haven't come out of the room yet, right?
Matt: Not until you want to.
Orion: So I do, I see Grog going there, drinking his thing, I use my Mage Hand and I whack the ale out of his hand.
Matt: Your tankard goes flying out of your hand, on the ground, it spills across the front--
Orion: I make my way down to the thing and I tell the bartender, give this warrior water. This might be your problem, Grog. You lost for a reason, and you're a warrior.
Liam: Yes, but he's named after beer. (laughter)
Orion: Yes, I know that, Vax. I'm just saying.
Taliesin: And you are what you eat.
Orion: I cast Invisibility.
Matt: Okay. Tiberius vanishes. The barkeep hands over a big mug of clear water and sets it in front of Grog.
Laura: Oh, this is the very special beer.
Matt: "It's the water that was requested by your friend. Who disappeared."
Travis: Water?
Laura: It'll get you super drunk.
Liam: Can you feel it? You can feel it, right? You can totally feel it.
Travis: It's pretty smooth. (laughter)
Travis: Keep it coming.
Matt: Meals are ordered, you guys are fed as per your purchase of the evening's inn stay. Your meal's still covered by the tavern. Eventually, you find yourselves full and about, I'll say roughly ten, 11 in the morning it would be.
Marisha: I'm no longer Minxie to eat breakfast with my friends.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Hi, good to see you, Keyleth.
Liam: Are you a dwarf again?
Marisha: No. I should to talk to more dwarves before I try to... yeah.
Taliesin: That was a little racist.
Marisha: It was a little racist.
Sam: Remind me, what was on our plate? What's on our plate?
Laura: Well, we have multiple things we can be doing. We can go meet Keyleth's druid family in the mountains, right? Fire, brimstone, stuff like that. We have a lot of money waiting for us.
Travis: I think we have to go back on the airship to go get it.
Laura: In Kraghammer, yes, but there is 25,000 gold waiting for us, so that's always an option.
Travis: The Braving Grounds, we could see if they need any-- since we-- I lost us a lot of (tearing up) money.
Laura: Here, Grog. Have some clear beer.
Travis: Some more? Okay. We can see if they need anyone for hire, go and have a... (tearing up again) being strong.
Liam: I would feel it very hard to leave Pike behind in the city. Are we really going to leave and go to Kraghammer?
Marisha: Well, we don't have to. I don't want to go yet. We traveled several days here. While we're in this side of the country, I should probably go, you know. Do the things I was set out to do.
Travis: Plus we have the poo cell phone.
Laura: Good job, Scanlan.
Sam: It's more of a poo walkie-talkie.
Liam: I don't know what either of those things are.
Sam: Just know that there's poo involved.
Liam: Does the poop talk like my earring? Because that I understand.
Laura: Yes, it's like a poop earring.
Liam: It's like a poop earring. Why didn't you say that in the first place? You talk through it? You talk to poo?
Sam: You see through it.
Matt: Hashtag poop earring.
Laura: So yes. There's multiple things.
Sam: Well, multiple things. There's just go back to Kraghammer and get money, or go where Keyleth wants to go.
Laura: We can look for work here, we can go back to Bahamut, see if they want--
Taliesin: Keyleth's got family. We can visit her family.
Laura: That's what I'm talking about, yes. Fire, brimstone, volcanoes. Druids.
Travis: Keyleth, do you have an opinion?
Marisha: I mean... I guess if you guys don't have anything else to do, yeah.
Liam: How far are they from here?
Marisha: I'm not sure. We'd have to start asking around. They're remote. We're secluded people.
Laura: Secrety.
Marisha: We're a little secrety, yeah, and we haven't heard-- I just want to clarify, you know. I haven't talked to them in a long time, so I hope they're nice. And I'm sure they're--
Liam: Family stuff can be tricky.
Taliesin: It seems a shame to have a family and not take advantage of it.
Sam: What's family for other to take advantage of?
Travis: To hit. To kiss.
Laura: To kiss? You kiss your family?
Travis: Yeah, I'm a goliath. What about it?
Laura: There are things about goliaths I did not want to know. That water has a good effect on him.
Liam: Do you feel drawn to your parents, though? Do you want to go?
Marisha: I have to go. I don't have a choice.
Liam: Then we should go.
Marisha: Okay. I just don't want to inconvenience anybody.
Laura: Inconvenience, schminconvenience.
Sam: Oh, is that Dwarvish?
Laura: Yes. It's actually Underdark. I'm fluent.
Marisha: Oh wait, that was Dwarvish? Inconschmenience.
Taliesin: Your accent's amazing.
Marisha: I'm trying to work on learning more Dwarvish. Okay.
Travis: I have a question for you, Vax. The Braving Grounds that are here, would it be to our benefit to collect maybe some coin and practice our (gets choked up) fighting before we go to the maybe-friendly fire jugglers' village?
Liam: You want to go back in there? It's awfully fresh.
Travis: Not the Crucible. Don't rub my face in it. Not in the Crucible, to the Braving Grounds.
Liam: The Braving Grounds. We were just in the pub. I mean, that was just a backyard brawl, basically. He's talking about going to the temple.
Travis: Was that the Crucible I was in?
Matt: The Crucible was the pit you were in. The temple you were at is the Trial Forge. The whole area you guys are in, this district of Vasselheim, is known as the Braving Grounds.
Liam: This is what I think, Grog. It's too fresh. You need some time away from it. We should absolutely come back and you should break that guy's fucking face, no question.
Travis: (choked up) I could've. Totally could've.
Liam: You almost did.
Laura: Yeah. Next time, bite his nose off right away before it's concave.
Travis: I saved it for too late. I did it too late. But then in the balls...
Laura: The balls-- good effort.
Liam: We've come a very long way. Keyleth is near her family. She needs to see where that road lies.
Taliesin: We should take care of each other.
Liam: And once we do, we'll come back and fucking kill that guy.
Travis: And we can use weapons if they suck, right?
Liam: Yes.
Laura: Speaking of weapons, aren't we in a perfect weapons-buying district?
Sam: Is that true?
Travis: Yes! Can we go find an armory or somewhere that sells pointy things?
Matt: You can certainly try. Yeah. As a note, too, as you're having this conversation, you reach into your pocket, Grog. As you're feeling around in your pocket, you realize that you saved in your drunken state the upper lip. It's rubbery and dry, but it's there.
Travis: I tuck that inside of my belt-beard. Just so it's nice there. One little part of it just flapping out.
Laura: What about your beard? Is he growing his beard?
Travis: Oh, it is a new day.
Matt: You get to go ahead and roll a percentage dice.
Travis: Nine, 90.
Matt: 99. No beard this morning. It goes the other way.
Travis: It goes the other way?!
Matt: Lower percentage.
Travis: My life is shit! I can't do anything!
Matt: It's a rough day for Grog.
Travis: I'm hanging myself. Where's the bridge?
Sam: There's no bridge here.
Laura: Actually, I don't know about anybody else, but I'm incredibly low on funds at the moment.
Taliesin: Perhaps shopping is not the best path.
Marisha: We did just do a lot of shopping.
Sam: Yeah, let's go adventuring.
Taliesin: We haven't had an awkward parental confrontation in what feels like months.
Marisha: Okay. You guys, I'm so nervous.
Travis: You really are?
Marisha: Well, I mean, it's a big thing.
Travis: Have you seen them, ever?
Marisha: The first time I left home was when I met up with you guys.
Matt: (impact) You guys suddenly hear this slamming sound that echoes throughout the nearby city. You hear this impact, like this distant crashing of stone against stone. A few seconds later, you hear this low (horn sound), this horn that's just bellowing out, this deep echoing horn. The rest of the tavern looks around, confused. A couple of individuals step outside to look.
Orion: I'm at the dock, right?
Matt: You've been walking away for a while, and you get about roughly ten minutes away before you hear this impact and these horns going off in the distance.
Sam: I turn to the barkeep and say, well, what was that? Do you know? Have you heard that before? What is that?
Matt: "It's the horn of the Trial. Means there's some sort of attack."
Sam: Attack? Where? How do we know where?
Matt: "I don't know, but I'm getting ready." And he starts going to the back room.
Laura: Getting ready where? What are we doing?
Orion: I'm going to cast Fly on myself and see what's going on.
Matt: Okay, so you become visible and begin lifting up into the air--
Orion: No, I'm still invisible for a round.
Matt: Oh, because the-- okay. So you lift into the air and then appear as the concentration spell wears off. You got your crown. Looking over, you can see immediately there appears to be some commotion, like some dust has scattered up from the forest on the far side of the Braving Grounds, outside of the major wall of the city.
Orion: I'm going to do a (whoosh) to where they are.
Matt: Okay, you start gliding over. As you guys rush out, you can see now a bunch of the Bastions that are set across the top of the wall are gathering and loading in bolts, and you see two of them fire. You hear this now guttural roaring sound, but multiple ones, like a chorus of large bestial screams echo and then (wham) a second slamming sound of stone into stone, and you can see at the very distant wall, right below where those two Bastions would have fired those giant dragon-headed bolt-throwers, both get thrown off the top, falling a good 40 feet out of view beyond the distant rooftops. You can see a small crack beginning to form at the top of the wall. Two other Bastions now begin to rush in and take the place of those two bolt-throwers.
Liam: I yank two daggers out, flip them, catch them, and just start running.
Laura: Can I grab the flying carpet out of the Bag of Holding before you take off?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: Sure. You grab it. You guys start running. You're gliding in.
Sam: I'm ambling behind them.
Orion: I'm going to where the attack is, not to them.
Taliesin: I'm going to hop on the carpet with you.
Marisha: I'm going.
Laura: I swing down and pick up my brother.
Taliesin: I'm hopping on, as well.
Matt: You hop on.
Liam: Come along, Percival.
Matt: At which point, two more bolts are let loose, and you hear the creature once again scream (screech) in pain, and then the footfalls.
Liam: We don't see them yet?
Matt: No, you just hear it. It's on the other side of the wall. You see what looks like a toothy maw streak across the top of the tower for a moment, and then the tree line shift, and the footfalls get quieter and quieter.
Travis: Go ask one of the Bastion guys what it was.
Laura: Yeah, we fly up next to one of the shooter guys and say, what was it? What is it?
Matt: Okay, you glide up to it, and as you look down, you can see the two Bastions that fell. They're currently being tended to. One of them looks unconscious and rough from the impact of the fall, the other one's walking with a limp, trying to find its way back towards the interior of the wall that leads up to the top of his post. The one you come by has sweat beading down his face and you see he's loaded another bolt and he's looking out, wide-eyed, towards the forest. He goes, "It came back."
Laura: What came back?
Matt: "We've had this blasted thing seen on and off again for the past few weeks. Maybe it's hungry or it's bored, but either way, this multi-headed thing, this hydra-like creature keeps coming in and I don't know, I think it's testing the wall."
Laura: Like a raptor.
Travis: They remember.
Laura: Clever girl. (laughter)
Liam: Clever girl. (laughter)
Sam: Should we go kill it?
Liam: I don't see it anymore. I think it's gone back into the woods.
Matt: "It's fled. Got a few hits in, but it went and... we can never seem to get enough to take it down."
Liam: How frequently are these attacks coming?
Sam: Of course we can track it.
Matt: "I mean, you're welcome to try. It's only been maybe two or three times this past week, but it's come once or twice a week for the past month, hitting different areas of the city. Not just this beast, a few different ones, but mostly this abomination. It's a nuisance more than anything, although it did get a good hit on the wall." And he looks over and you can see there's a crack in the stone. He looks nervously over it and, "I'll get to fixing that right quick. It keeps slinking off back into the Vesper Timberlands. Kord help us if there's more than one of these."
Laura: Kord help us. Good old Kord. Okay.
Travis: I grab my earring and I say, Tiberius, where are you?
Orion: I'm flying around.
Matt: You just now glide over, seeing the flying carpet towards the top of the wall.
Orion: I'm above you.
Travis: Where?
Orion: Here!
Matt: He is visible, just gliding by. You guys have run up to the edge of the wall. You're beneath looking up at the flying carpet and they're having this conversation at such a distance where you can't really hear them talking. Percy, Vex, and Vax, you're up on the flying carpet currently, conversing with the Bastion.
Laura: Can we float up a little bit and see if we can see movement in the trees where it is?
Matt: You glance over and you can see the canopy shifting slightly. It's about a quarter-mile off and disappearing before it's eventually a little bit out of sight. You figure a creature that large can't be too difficult to track.
Laura: Okay.
Sam: Go kill it?
Laura: Well, here's the thing. I bring the carpet back down and say, I see where it went, if you guys want to fight it. What do you think?
Orion: I'd like to go get my money at Kraghammer.
Sam: I thought we'd decided to go to Keyleth's.
Matt: The individuals are now, they're currently--
Marisha: You left during the family meeting.
Liam: That money's not going anywhere.
Orion: I suppose you're right.
Liam: Let's help the city out, then we'll go on to see Keyleth's parents.
Sam: Help the city out by going to track the hydra first?
Travis: I run back to the tavern real fast. People have left, right?
Matt: Yeah, there are people outside looking at what happened.
Travis: Barkeep still there?
Matt: He's there, and he's currently putting on armor by himself.
Travis: It's okay, it left. Big crack in the wall. Might think about leaving. Before you do, the Siren. Where might I find her?
Matt: He thinks to himself, says, "She's a slippery one. She only shows up when she wants to start a fight. I gather your best bet would be to ask around. I hear she runs at times with the-- what are they called? The Slayer's Take. The Slayer's Take." As you guys are talking about this, the Bastion that was talking to you guys is now coming down the wall, and he's like, "Are you seriously thinking about going after that thing?"
Sam: Only if there's money involved.
Matt: "Oh, I can guarantee a beast of that size and that much of a problem's got a hell of a price on its head."
Laura: From who? (laughter)
Sam: From who? (laughter)
Matt: "I gather anyone you take it to at that point. Probably take just one or more of its heads back, or some proof it's dead, and I'm sure there will be a few people that will fight hand over fist to pay for that."
Liam: We could easily get a head. Let's go right now. Grog's doing something. Let's go.
Sam: Hey, Grog. Grog, come in. We're going to go kill something. We need you.
Liam: How? We're on the carpet, he's flying. Scanlan's riding on an eagle.
Marisha: I can try a Locate Creature spell.
Taliesin: You can do a what?
Marisha: I can cast Locate Creature.
Taliesin: She can cast Locate Creature.
Sam: Let's leave Trinket behind. Just for now, it's so hard to keep track of Trinket, Jesus.
Liam: Grog's been fighting for a long time, he needs rest. Let's go!
Matt: Trinket is there behind you.
Laura: Polymorph him, please.
Marisha: I didn't learn Polymorph. You're going to have to ask Scanlan about that one.
Laura: Scanlan, please. Polymorph him.
Sam: What, me? Do I know Polymorph?
Liam: Whatever that thing is, it's getting away. We're losing time.
Laura: We can track him. I'm a ranger.
Marisha: I drop to my knees and I cast Locate Creature.
Travis: I can only come if Tiberius lets me.
Sam: Oh, to fly.
Liam: Yes, exactly. Let's keep twiddling our thumbs.
Orion: I'm going to cast Fly out of my ring on Grog.
Matt: All right. Grog.
Sam: I guess we're going. Hold on!
Marisha: Do you want to use your ranger tracking skills, or should I try and cast the spell?
Laura: I can definitely use my ranger skills.
Orion: I'm going to cast it at 5th level, and I'm going to cast it on myself, I'll keep it on him, Grog, and Trinket.
Matt: Okay. So Trinket once again-- (distressed bear noises)
Orion: Like last time, remember, Trinket?
Matt: Trinket seems to be a little less perturbed by the circumstance.
Travis: I grab Trinket's paw like in Superman 1, and we fly.
Matt: Grog and Trinket, coasting through the air, arm in paw.
Travis: Thank you, Tiberius.
Liam: Peter Pan and Wendy.
Taliesin: Can you read my mind?
Matt: All right. So as you guys all drift up over the town, you can immediately see the Bastion that was talking to you is looking very, very curiously at Tiberius.
Laura: Oh, don't worry, he's really nice!
Sam: Sorry, there was just a little magic so we could go kill the hydra, sorry... (laughter)
Matt: As you guys vanish over the wall, you can now see before you the entirety of the Vesper Timberlands.
Liam: Most people just say thank you! Dick.
Matt: Below you, the landscape is entirely consumed by what looks like the densest forest you've ever encountered. The cold air seems to be growing colder as the day progresses on and the clouds themselves are choked dark grey. The rain never fell last night, but the storms seem, or at least the storm front that seems to push its way is still ominously looking overhead the entirety of this landscape. Looking down across the Vesper Timberland, you can see the thick canopy, the occasional mountain or hill that's jutting through the top of it, but there is no movement. There is no current sign of the creature.
Travis: Let's use some bait.
Sam: Wait no, we saw the direction it went in, right?
Laura: Yeah.
Liam: Don't worry, my sister's a ranger. She can track anything.
Laura: Why are you being an asshole to me today?
Liam: I don't know, why am I?
Laura: I don't know! (laughter)
Laura: I judged him, apparently, but I don't remember doing it.
Liam: The Critters will figure it out.
Laura: Yeah, can I go low to the ground and track it?
Matt: You can. So you take the carpet down, and as it hits the canopy, it's a very slow, arduous process to weave between the thick network of branches and vines and other bits of growth that have completely covered the top of this forest. Eventually, the carpet comes down into the floor. The rest of you guys who are flying coming along, as well?
Sam: I'm coming along.
Matt: You all come down behind the carpet, eventually breaking through the top of the canopy and reaching the interior of the Vesper Timberland itself.
Laura: This is my other favored terrain.
Matt: Good to know. This forest, incredibly lush, presses up against the city walls itself, nearly oppressively with the impact. It grows up right against the city wall. And it's almost like the wall itself is constantly keeping it at bay in the way that the growth that's pushing inward. The tree trunks you see, now that you've hit the interior, vary in size, some only a few feet in diameter. You come across a couple that are 20, 30 feet or more, giant trees. Also, even though it's midday at this point in time, the light into the forest is choked so thin it's almost like it's dusk, near dark, inside the forest. The air hits you with the smell of wet earth, moss. Vines and branches dangle from and reach from every direction, and you can see there are, you can walk through the path here, but nearing trees themselves, the roots are so large and so twisted where they enter the ground. You're definitely going to have to keep up with your ranger friend here.
Liam: Just like the old days.
Orion: Now we've touched down and we're traveling?
Matt: You guys are in the forest pushing through various walkways. Go ahead and make a survival check with advantage.
Sam: Survival check? Is that for her?
Matt: Yep. She's tracking the creature.
Laura: Oh, natural 20! (cheering)
Matt: All right. Following its path, you see that there are tracks going both ways, meaning the creature as it came through towards the city, it turned its path about and then exited the same pathway. So as you're following it along for a good 15 minutes or so, you come across a small opening in the forest where you can see what looks to be a very messily partially devoured carcass of something.
Laura: Is it big?
Matt: It looks like it was pretty big, it's definitely spread out over this area.
Laura: I think it ate something here, you guys.
Sam: Good ranging.
Laura: Thank you.
Taliesin: I'd like to try and identify the animal that it ate.
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Taliesin: 13?
Matt: 13? You look at it, it appears to be some sort of furred beast. Huge in size at one point, it is long-dead for at least--
Taliesin: Like moose-big or bigger?
Matt: No, as big as some of the umber hulks you've fought. But it looks humanoid-ish, more primate-like. The more you look at it, it looks like it may have been at one point a large, massive ape of some kind. But it has been torn open, limbs scattered all across this small clearing. You can see there are a series of bite and scratch marks across it, and most of its internal organs are missing.
Taliesin: I don't know what we're tracking, but I think it's friendly.
Marisha: Can I do a nature check to see if I can figure anything out about the nature of the attack?
Matt: Sure.
Marisha: That's going to be 21.
Matt: 21. As you look down at it and you take close inspection on the attack, you look, a creature like this, when it destroys and bites, especially the creature that you saw earlier briefly, it appeared through the canopy when you first arrived. Many heads, gnashing teeth. The bite marks and the attack on this carcass are definitely in line with that creature. However, you do notice that there are other marks and attacks across it, as well. Some of the wounds across its body appear to be made by weapons. There are gash marks and slashes. And the more and more you inspect the body, you can see the blood that has been scattered about by this was thick and congealed by the time that it was tossed amongst this opening.
Marisha: Does it look like the wounds from the weapons happened post-mortem? Or at the same time?
Matt: Actually, the wounds from the weapons appear to have occurred fresh, whereas the wounds from being killed and eaten, or being eaten by the creature, appear to be post-mortem by quite some time.
Liam: So it was killed by civilized folks and then torn apart by this thing.
Travis: Maybe the Slayer's Take.
Marisha: Can I figure out what kind, was it some bird creature? Is all Percy could--
Matt: Ape creature. It's essentially a massive, for lack of a better term, a dire-sized ape.
Taliesin: Dire-ape. It's possible somebody was feeding it.
Laura: Should we continue on, keep tracking?
Liam: My sister and I are going to check and see if there's any sign of it in the area.
Laura: Yeah, perception check around. Oh, that looks good.
Liam: Yes, it was. 21 for me.
Laura: Yeah, only 18 for me. But wait, advantage. That's way better! 25.
Matt: 25. Looking ahead, this carcass was eaten before the creature attacked the city. You can see from the time difference that this happened. But it has torn through this space recently. You can see part of the body has been shoved aside and crushed under some giant clawed foot. It continues weaving between the trees in this small pathway that looks well-worn, like there are some portions of the forest that are well-overgrown and mostly untouched. There is a specific path along the floor of this forest that looks like it's been used often by large footsteps and small ones.
Laura: Should we follow along that path? But maybe off to the side a bit, like in the trees but next to the path?
Sam: No, let's just go down the middle. What, did it leave traps? It's a hydra.
Liam: I'll go down in the bushes, thanks.
Orion: Is it like a thicket? Is this rough terrain we're going through?
Matt: There are many portions of this that come across as rough terrain. At certain times it's okay, especially on the worn path, any off that can be a little more difficult to traverse.
Orion: Is it plant life?
Matt: Plant life, tree roots, heavy thick branches that have fallen or have grown out and interwoven. Occasional rocks or natural formations that are jutting out of the earth.
Sam: Let's continue on as fast as possible.
Matt: Make another tracking check, with advantage.
Laura: Oh man, another one?
Matt: (singing) Advantage.
Laura: 16.
Sam: I'm going to inspire her with a little song of inspiration. (singing) And the ranger's going to range, range, range, range, range. And the tracker's going to track, track, track, track, track. I'm just going to watch, watch, watch, watch, watch. Watch her range.
All: (singing) Watch her range.
Laura: What do I need to add?
Matt: A d10.
Laura: Okay, so 19.
Sam: Oh good. Three points.
Matt: All right. You continue moving forward off the track for another ten minutes or so before you see some movement ahead.
Laura: Perception?
Matt: Perception check.
Taliesin: I'll join in that. 21.
Travis: 12.
Laura: 18.
Orion: How far away are we from each other?
Matt: You guys are keeping a pretty close view, you're a little behind them, but you're letting them push forward unless you choose to do anything otherwise.
Liam: I'm going stealth.
Matt: All right. Make a stealth check. You and Percy go ahead and you look forward, and you notice there are a couple small pools of water that have just coalesced through the recent storms or just a natural small pool of water that exists in this portion, but you can see the back of a large, scaled creature with a tan dark-brown hide, long tail, currently stooped down and drinking from the waters in the pool. You can hear the distant (lapping) sound of water dripping out of its jaws, and you can see now, there are multiple heads taking drinks out of this pool here.
Sam: Is the foliage around us green? Brown? Standard foliage color?
Matt: In this area, because of the nature of the rich earth, most of the foliage here is a deep green.
Sam: I'm going to turn us all deep green. With Seeming.
Liam: With what now?
Sam: Seeming. Yes with Seeming. I spread my Seeming all over us, turning us green. With Seeming all over us.
Taliesin: There's nothing you can't ruin.
Matt: As the hue of your garments begin to shift to the color of the surrounding forest, I'd like everybody to make a stealth check who hasn't already, with advantage.
Liam: Oh, 30.
Orion: I cast Stoneskin right now.
Sam: We're rolling for stealth? With advantage?
Laura: Natural 20!
Taliesin: 15.
Sam: 16.
Marisha: 25 total.
Matt: These are trees. There, looming at the edge of the water--
Laura: Whoa. Is that a dragon?
Matt: That is a massive hydra.
Laura: So it's not technically in the dragon school?
Matt: No. It is considered a monstrosity, technically. You guys are all hidden off to the side here.
Liam: I'm scooting forward quietly.
Taliesin: Hail, hydra.
Marisha: Where do you hail from, hydra?
Matt: All right, we'll put that as your guys' current placement. Stealth scores are?
Liam: 30.
Sam: 16.
Orion: 18.
Marisha: 25.
Taliesin: 15.
Travis: 15.
Laura: It was a natural 20. Do I add anything?
Matt: No, you don't have to worry about that.
Sam: So we're all good.
Matt: Okay. The creature keeps drinking. Occasionally, a head will come up and look around. Another head will come up and snap at it, and snap back, and then both go down and they start drinking on their own. You apparently are not currently noticed.
Laura: Should I have rolled for Trinket?
Matt: Go ahead and roll for Trinket.
Laura: I rolled an 18 for Trinket.
Matt: Okay, Trinket's fine. Trinket with his deep green fur, at the moment. So what would you like to do?
Liam: I'm pulling out my Dagger of Venom.
Travis: Set a really good trap. Let's think about this.
Marisha: I can box him in with my Wall of Stone.
Laura: I can cast the spike-growth thing again.
Sam: Should we try to push him in the water?
Travis: We could lightning the water.
Laura: In the water, then lightning the water? That's good.
Orion: I have all kinds of things.
Travis: Suggestions?
Liam: If you box it in, we can't get inside.
Orion: If we can nudge it into where he's drinking, then box him in.
Laura: Drown him?
Travis: Or lightning the water?
Laura: Yeah. Box him in the water and then lightning the water.
Travis: Keyleth, you're up.
Liam: Keyleth, when you shape the stone, can you make it lean towards him in a ramp? I can run up. It would still box him in. I could just traverse it.
Marisha: Yeah, I see what you're saying. I'm going to pyramid him in, essentially. I'm going to try and make almost behind him is an auditorium and the front of him is a jabby ramp. Does that make sense? Auditorium?
Sam: Let's do this.
Matt: Okay. The wall of stone has to be connected to itself, so it would have to be like--
Marisha: Okay, I'll do a spiral. Like a spiraly ramp that traps him in.
Taliesin: We're going to take the carpet and make our way to the other pond.
Laura: Do you want to go from either side? You take the carpet, go to the other side, and I'll walk over with Trinket to the other. What is he looking for?
Matt: Our carpet got moved. We have flying carpets from fans here I want to use, but it got moved.
Marisha: Are they in our magic box?
Matt: We'll find them. We've got carpets from you guys to use. We'll get that in just a second. It's fine. We've got to move. So Percy?
Taliesin: I have the carpet, I'm going to head towards that small--
Matt: You have the laser pointer. Show me.
Taliesin: What is that?
Matt: That is a rock.
Taliesin: I'm going to move just to the other side of that.
Matt: Okay, you coast through here, unseen.
Laura: I'm going to do the same to the other side, actually.
Matt: Around and behind to this side, here?
Laura: Would I be able to shoot him from behind the one further back?
Matt: From here, right now? No.
Laura: Well then I'll go behind the big tree. There, yeah. Totally hidden!
Matt: Yes. Anyone else, placement?
Sam: I'm going to move closer.
Matt: Okay. Right there.
Marisha: Hey, Matt? Instead of Wall of Stone, I'm actually going to cast my one 6th-level spell, which is Move Earth.
Matt: Have you read Move Earth?
Marisha: Yeah. A few weeks ago.
Matt: You can move large chunks of earth over a small period of time. It's not an attack spell, it's more of you can dig a cave.
Marisha: Never mind. I'll stick with the original plan. I can't dome him up and go ahead and push him in the water really quick at this point?
Matt: Probably not with that one.
Marisha: All right, I'll stick with Wall of Stone, which I know I can do. Make a hydra pyramid!
Liam: I rolled a 30. I want to get down in a crouch and just run right there.
Matt: Okay. Keyleth, where are you going? To have line of sight on the creature, where are you going?
Marisha: Right there is fine.
Matt: You don't have line of sight on the creature. There's a tree blocking.
Marisha: Oh. No, let me move towards Scanlan.
Matt: All right, so over here?
Marisha: Yep.
Orion: I'd like to do an investigation on his-- oh yes! I rolled a 21.
Matt: What are you trying to do?
Orion: Guess how much he weighs.
Matt: A creature of this size, probably close to two tons. More than three tons, maybe? 5,000 pounds.
Orion: Damn it. Too big.
Matt: It's a big creature. Grog, where are you going?
Travis: I'm going to post up on, where's my laser pointer?
Sam: In your eye! God, you're having the worst day!
Liam: Just headbutt a tree or something.
Matt: Tiberius, you're staying right there?
Orion: Keeping within 100 feet of it.
Matt: Okay, that's well within a hundred feet.
Orion: Well, Vax can move. Is that my best POV?
Matt: To see it, yeah. Otherwise, you would be blocked.
Orion: Okay.
Matt: All right.
Orion: Actually, we can move anywhere right now, right?
Matt: All right, is everyone set? Who's taking first initiative on this?
Marisha: I am.
Laura: Can you move Trinket next to Grog?
Matt: Trinket moves around next to Grog.
Marisha: Okay, I want to try and do a little pushy-shovery at the same time.
Matt: All right. There you are.
Laura: There we go, look at us all. Strategized.
Sam: Yeah, that's going to come in handy when he just kills all of us in one shot.
Marisha: Okay. As he gets in that corner of that puddle, I'm going to Fibonacci circle and starting here, push him in a bit and wrap him up.
Matt: Okay, so you create from the earth a wall of stone that comes jutting out. That way?
Marisha: Yeah, I want him to be tight in the circle here, and if I can get it to push him towards the water.
Matt: The force of the wall of stone slams into him and through the physical form, it's not enough to actually move a creature of its size and weight, but it does form around it and hold it in place, currently.
Liam: As soon as Vax sees that, he starts running through the grass, up the slope of the stone.
Matt: It's currently surrounded by a ramp of stone. The heads start reaching out and biting at the stone.
Orion: You're running up the stone?
Liam: Yeah, and I'm clicking one boot against the other as I run up it, so I'm going faster, run up, and I'm going to jump and I'm going to start stabbing into that head.
Matt: All righty. Go for it.
Liam: Okay, 17. Shit. And 27.
Matt: Second one hits.
Liam: The final one hits?
Matt: Oh sorry, the first one was?
Liam: 17. One.
Matt: One misses, the final one hits, yes.
Liam: Okay. So does this count as sneak attack? All right, so I roll a nine for damage, plus eight, 12, 14, 15, 17 of sneak attack damage, with the first attack, that's poison. And the poison is DC 15.
Matt: DC 15. Misses. Does not make its save.
Liam: With 11 points of poison damage to its head. That's just the first attack that hits. And then I take my keen dagger and I jab for the eye, and that is a ten of damage.
Matt: Nice. It is considered a sneak attack because this is a surprise round.
Liam: Both attacks?
Matt: The first attack that hits is considered a sneak attack.
Liam: First attack I gave you was sneak attack.
Matt: No, I mean the first attack that hits it. You missed, missed, and then you hit.
Liam: Oh, I thought I hit and missed and hit.
Matt: Missed, missed, and hit.
Liam: All right, well then erase the first numbers I told you. It's just ten plus-- it was 17, so 27.
Matt: All right. 27 damage. You leap, run up the stonework, click the heels, rush down and then slam, and the dagger slips into the front of its torso, the actual blade pulsing as the magical energy expels itself, the poison rocketing through its body. All of a sudden, the heads turn around and now you have five heads looking at you.
Liam: Add 15 of poison to that. Add 15 of poison.
Matt: Awesome. Is he poisoned? Or just takes 15 additional points of damage?
Liam: It gets poisoned, and it takes damage on the first hit and every round I think it takes that poison.
Matt: No, it just means it's poisoned, which means it has disadvantage.
Liam: Oh, yes. DC 15, plus damage on the hit.
Matt: There's the flying carpet. (cheering)
Orion: Is any part of the creature still in the water?
Matt: One of its feet is currently off to the side in the water.
Orion: Cool. I'm going to cast Invisibility. And I can see it, because I'm on the other side of the ramp, right? I'm going to cast Chain Lightning right at the foot.
Sam: Chain Lightning? You have Chain Lightning?
Marisha: It's new.
Orion: Yes, it is. It's a 150 foot range, and I do 10d8 damage.
Sam: I know, I used it at the fight that you didn't want to fight in.
Matt: Yeah, what's the DC?
Orion: 17.
Matt: 17. All right, it does make its save, so half damage.
Orion: How do I count these? There's a bunch of sevens. Stupid ones.
Sam: 28.
Orion: All together?
Sam: No, that's 28.
Orion: Oh. 38. 43.
Matt: 43. Awesome. So a total of 22 points of damage from a save. So as it's stepping into the water, it takes an additional, I'll say, additional 2d8 from being in the water. I'll roll them here. Additional nine damage to that. As it pulls back, the stone around it, the rogue leaps up and slams it with a blade, its heads turn around, and as it does, you turn around, vanish from sight, and then... you cast Greater Invisibility or just Invisibility?
Orion: Greater.
Matt: Okay. Release your hands and a torrent of blue electrical energy rockets forth from your hands, streaking out, some parts leaving arcs that hit the nearby forests and then slamming into its body, its exposed heads. You can see the arcs now shooting through between the various necks and bodies. It writhes and streaks about, slamming its body into part of the stone that cracks and heaves from the impact, still holding it in place. Well done. You want to move, or is that your turn?
Orion: I'm going, what are the big lumps, are those trees?
Matt: These are trees. Anywhere walking on the trunk around it is difficult terrain, you cannot pass.
Orion: I'm just going to go right behind that tree.
Matt: All right. That ends your turn. Who else wants to do anything this round?
Laura: I want to shoot him.
Matt: You all get a free round, and then we roll initiative.
Laura: Okay, I'm going to cast Hunter's Mark on it.
Matt: Hunter's Mark on it.
Liam: Oh, I'm sorry, DM? This is after the fact. Assassinate, on any attack before the enemy's had a chance to take a turn yet, any hit on surprise is a crit.
Matt: Good to know, so that's 54 damage from your initial strike.
Liam: Thank you. That's all I get. That's all I do.
Laura: So I'm going to cast Hail of Thorns at 3rd level. I'm going to roll for that. Jesus. That's only 16. That doesn't hit, does it?
Matt: For Hail of Thorns? 16 does not hit, unfortunately.
Marisha: Even though he's trapped?
Matt: No, it's against the armor. It actually ricochets off the hide of the creature and disappears. It explodes against a tree trunk in the distance, and you can see a smattering of magical thorns shoot out into one of the canopies.
Laura: Okay. Then I'm going to try just doing a regular attack through the magical bow of fire. And that is 17.
Matt: Hail of Thorns is an action to cast, though, isn't it? You've already used your bonus action to cast Hunter's Mark.
Laura: Then never mind, I don't do anything. I just fucking fucked that up.
Matt: It's okay, it's a surprise round. Do you want to do anything with your self-placement or Trinket-wise?
Laura: Yeah, I want to climb a tree that I'm next to.
Matt: Okay. Using your movement. Go ahead and make, we'll say an athletics check to climb the tree.
Laura: What was that, athletics or acrobatics?
Matt: Athletics.
Laura: Why?
Matt: Because there's no branches nearby, you have to--
Laura: Six! I'm going to stay on the ground.
Matt: You slide back to the trunk, turn around and grab your bow and prepare yourself. Trinket, anything?
Laura: Trinket's going to stay right there.
Sam: I'll move and do Lightning. Why not? Just try to get as much as possible. Just so I won't hit whoever that is.
Matt: That would probably be right there. All right, so you unleash a Lightning Bolt?
Sam: Yes, I do.
Matt: Go ahead and roll damage, 8d6. Does not make its save. Rolled a five.
Liam: By the way, we need seven more subs, which is ironically the same number of heads the hydra has.
Taliesin: Seven more subs?
Marisha: Seven more subs?
Orion: Seven more subs?
Matt: Seven more subs?
Taliesin: We're going to get a bear!
Sam: 19.
Matt: 19?
Sam: 19.
Matt: All right, gotcha. That was the total 8d6?
Sam: That was 6d6.
Matt: 8d6 for Lightning Bolt. Roll two more.
Sam: Ten more!
Matt: All right, 29. You turn around the corner, the energy still crackling around it from the Chain Lightning. You unleash your own Lightning Bolt that hits it from the side, slamming into the side of one of the heads. The head actually pops from the impact. It's now got four heads.
Sam: Oh, hey. I got a head!
Taliesin: What's my distance? Is this Pepperbox distance or Bad News distance, at the moment?
Matt: Right now, you can't see because there's a tree in the way, but you're Pepperbox distance from here. You could try Bad News, but you'd have to set up in place.
Taliesin: All right, I'm going to start curling around the tree I'm near. I'm going to take some movement to fly over the pond back here. And while I'm making my little round, I'm going to take two shots with the Pepperbox.
Matt: Okay, so as the carpet's gliding past, you're basically strafing it and (gunshots). Go ahead and fire.
Liam: You have a bear.
Marisha: She has a bear? We got a bear!
Matt: Oh my god, there's going to be a giant Trinket. That's so stupid.
Taliesin: Full-on misfire. (cackles) Yeah, I misfire. I don't care; we got a bear.
Matt: All right. We got a bear. As you strafe past, you pull your Pepperbox and go to fire. Suddenly there's a dull sound, and as you look at your gun, it explodes for a second in your face. You barely manage to get your visage out of the way as the barrel itself is heated up and you have to shake it off. Yeah, your Pepperbox is looking a bit rough right now.
Taliesin: It's fine; I'm putting it away.
Matt: Okay. So everyone else has gone but Grog.
Travis: Me? Can I run all the way up and try and pull a Vax, like he did?
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: Hey, I want to try that! And I rage as I attack it!
Matt: All right, as you rush up, axe in your hand, you rush up the side of the stone ramp that she's created and it's right in slamming distance. Go ahead.
Travis: I swing away. 24.
Matt: 24 hits.
Travis: Yes, and the second. 16.
Matt: 16, no. 16 misses. And then?
Travis: That's it, just the two. I'm not frenzied. Yes. 17.
Matt: 17 points of damage as you hack once again, slamming into the side of one of the necks, causing a gout of purplish blood to spray over the right side of your body. That ends the combat round for the surprise round. The creature is now aware that you're definitely there. Everyone roll initiative. All right, so 25 to 20?
Orion: 22.
Matt: 20 to 15?
Laura: 19.
Sam: 16. First good roll I've ever had.
Matt: For initiative, yeah. 15 to ten?
Taliesin: 13.
Travis: 13.
Matt: Both of you guys 13. All right.
Marisha: Four.
Liam: 12.
Orion: That's what you usually get.
Taliesin: You got a four?
Marisha: Yeah, I did.
Matt: All right. Top of the round, Tiberius. As you start to see the head that got blown off, two heads sprout out of the--
Sam: Out of the wound.
Matt: It now has six heads.
Sam: It had five when we started!
Matt: Yep. And when you blew off the head, two more grew in its place.
Laura: Wait, but when Hercules defeated him, he just cut off so many that they started attacking themselves and they got tangled up.
Matt: Regardless, Tiberius, it's your turn.
Orion: It's still on the same position it was, though, right? When we started? Right?
Matt: Yep. It did seem to heal a bit of its wounds as the heads pull out of it. It has a sense of regeneration.
Orion: And I go, oh no you don't. And I stick out my ring and Chain Lightning him again.
Matt: Chain Lightning is a 6th-level spell.
Orion: Yeah, I know, and I had one stored in my ring.
Matt: Your ring can only store up to a 3rd-level spell. We went over this last time. It's okay.
Orion: No, I thought that was the Ioun Stone. We all learned something today, kids. I don't do that. Instead, fine. I'm going to cast Telekinesis once. And I'm instantly going to do quicken spell and do five sorcerer points to cast it immediately again. Cast it on one head and another head and (bashing, tying sounds). To try and wrap them all and choke them.
Matt: Go ahead and roll an arcana check for the first one.
Orion: Wasn't terrible. What is that?
Sam: 14.
Matt: Okay, and for the second one?
Orion: Natural 20.
Matt: Okay, so it rolled a 17 on its second save. The first one, it did not resist because it rolled a three. So what you do as you cast Telekinesis once, you use the sorcery points to cast it again. You can't get all the heads, but you can grab two of them, one focus for each telekinetic thing. You take both heads and (whack, whack) slam them three times into each other and then twist the necks around at the point where both of them are biting onto their own necks after they've torn into a second. For that, they're both going to take 2d8 impact damage. That's nine plus five. 14 points of impact damage to each head. Both of those heads are currently grappling each other, so they will not be able to attack on its turn.
Orion: And then I go back against the tree. That is my turn.
Matt: All right. It is now the hydra's turn. It rolled a really high initiative. The two heads are going to untangle themselves. That's their attack. Now it only has four strikes this turn, two of which are going to be against you and two of which are going to be against you. All right, so. Two of the heads rear back, lunging at Vax over here. That's going to be a 29. Second one is going to be a 19.
Liam: Yes.
Matt: All right. So you take... 17 and 15. 17 and 15, so 32 points of piercing damage. One of the heads snaps down on your torso and lifts you up for a second as the other grabs the side of your body, and it feels like it's about to tear you apart for a second until you manage to elbow it in the nose and manage to get free of one head and shake off the other. Grog, another head comes at you. First one comes at a 24.
Travis: Hits.
Matt: And a natural 20 for the second.
Travis: Yeah, I guess so. Phillip's a fucking douche today.
Matt: 14 points from the first one. You are raging, so it's halved to seven. The other one that is a critical, that does come to 24, so 12 points of piercing damage. All right. That ends its turn. Vex, you're up.
Laura: Can I see its body at all?
Matt: Yeah, you can see its body, it's pretty large, mainly just the heads are visible, the ramp is blocking the lower half of it. So you can't see its legs and its main part of its torso, but you can see the necks and the heads.
Laura: So I can't see its body.
Matt: Currently, no. It is blocked by her stone.
Laura: Okay, I'm going to shoot towards where-- is this bad? Oh no! I'm going to shoot towards where all of the heads are joined together.
Matt: It managed to unravel itself during its turn, but it used its attacks to do so.
Laura: Yeah, down where all these heads are connected. Right here.
Matt: Oh, okay. You can sort of see that area. Best you can, yeah.
Laura: I'm going to shoot my fancy exploding arrow.
Taliesin: The untested?
Matt: The one that you rolled.
Taliesin: The one that has the little mark beside it?
Matt: You pull out of your quiver the exploding arrow, which you can see it, it's heavily weighted in the front so you know you have to fire it at a slight arc against most of your arrows that you shoot. So go ahead and roll an attack on this one.
Laura: Oh god.
Matt: What did you roll? Are you serious? As you pull back on your bow, you go to release it, and the string ignites for a second, the arcane fire behind it that you absentmindedly trigger, and as you do you realize at the last minute, the arrow doesn't fire. You actually freak out for a second and release the bow. The arrow falls, the flame hitting the edge of it, and it explodes and detonates right in front of you. Make a reflex saving throw. Sorry, a dexterity saving throw. Oh, Pathfinder. You squeak in every now and then.
Laura: Natural 20!
Taliesin: Now?!
Marisha: Fuck you, dice gods.
Matt: What would have been an explosively painful 38 points of damage is halved.
Taliesin: Well, we know it works.
Matt: So you take 19 points of fire damage, and you're knocked prone.
Taliesin: Now, if only I could have attached that to a donkey, at some point.
Laura: You said 19? Jesus.
Matt: You're knocked flat on your ass.
Liam: That was all of Dungeons and Dragons contained in 30 seconds. (laughter)
Taliesin: For a year, he tried to get me to design an exploding donkey.
Sam: I did.
Matt: That was a little unfortunate. Trinket can still move and finish off the round, if you'd like. That was only one of your attacks.
Laura: All right. Can Trinket run up and fight alongside Grog? All right, he's going to do that.
Matt: Trinket runs up, runs up the ramp, claws out (roars).
Laura: Gets two attacks because of bestial fury. Jeez. Okay, I'm going to roll my Trinket dice now. Don't kill me now. Okay. I don't even know. 16.
Matt: 16 does not hit.
Laura: Cool. 19.
Matt: 19 does hit.
Laura: All right. (fake-cries) Okay. 13.
Matt: 13.
Laura: Does he get Hunter's Mark?
Matt: I would say yes, because he is your bear, I'll let that happen.
Laura: Yes he does! That's another five.
Matt: Nice, so 18 points of damage from Trinket. As Trinket runs up, one claw swings through the air, and as the head rears back, seeing this new bear that's joined the fray, reaches out and clamps onto its throat with its jaws, tearing a chunk of its flesh out.
Travis: Yeah, Trinket!
Matt: All righty. That brings us to Scanlan.
Sam: I'm going to punch it with Bigby's Hand. I'm going to do Bigby's Hand. And punch it. That's it. Punch. That's my move. Punch.
Matt: (laughs) Good, let me open the spell real fast.
Sam: (singing) It's Bigby's Hand! Bigby's Hand. You know it. Shamone.
Matt: So go ahead and roll a d20 and add your spell attack.
Sam: Add my spell attack?
Matt: Yeah, it should be at the top of your spell page.
Sam: This? Spell attack. 21.
Matt: 21 hits. Go ahead and roll 4d8 points of force damage as the fist slams, clocking one of the hydras in the face.
Sam: 23.
Matt: 23. And with that, you actually punch one of the heads off the hydra. It goes spinning off into the forest.
Laura: Oh, you don't want to punch heads off.
Sam: Hey guys, I got rid of another head! Hey guys, I'm on a roll! Who still hasn't gone? Keyleth, you haven't gone?
Taliesin: I haven't gone and Grog hasn't gone.
Sam: Okay, I'm going to inspire Grog with my bonus action.
Matt: Okay, what do you inspire him with?
Sam: Oh, I'm going to inspire him. (singing) Come on Grog, yeah, you know what I mean. It's time to rage on this hydra...
Matt: A half-hearted d10 to you. (laughs) All right, so. As that finishes your turn. At this point, you see a series of blurs in the nearby bushes.
Sam: Blurs in the bushes!
Laura: Blurs from the bush? What?
Matt: A voice rings out, saying, "Hey! What are you doing?!" And you now see an armored individual come rushing out from behind this tree here, another armored individual rushing from there, a female with a large sword rushing from this side, another character with leather armor, and a robed female coming from behind here. "This is our mark! You're not supposed to take that from us!"
Laura: Well, maybe you should've fought it before we got here!
Matt: "This is against the rules, you skag!"
Orion: Wait, what rules? We don't know the rules!
Marisha: We got here first! Warcraft rules!
Orion: I don't know what that means!
Matt: So this guy runs forward. He can't quite get all the way there, so he's going to sit there. Mage moves out this way and is going to look over at you as you're getting the gun, looks over and reaches out her hand. Go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw.
Taliesin: Oh my god, for the love of-- no!
Travis: What did you roll? Say it!
Taliesin: One.
Orion: Hold on. Wait no, hold on. I peek over and Counterspell.
Matt: You do not have visual on her at all. The trees are in between, unfortunately. As you're on the flying carpet, you see over the shoulder. You go to get your gun-- you're trying to pull out Bad News-- and then your muscles seize and you find yourself held in place.
Sam: Hold Person. Hold Percy.
Matt: The cleric character you see comes forward, holding aloft a holy symbol, and reaches up and suddenly you see the canopy above the hydra begin to glow with a bright orange light before a column of fire slams down into the ground from the heavens.
Sam: On the hydra?
Matt: On the hydra.
Laura: Wait, what about the people that are near the hydra?
Matt: It appears to only be affecting the hydra.
Laura: Ooh.
Sam: Ooh.
Sam: What is that?
Matt: The hydra takes 48 points of damage.
Travis: Four-eight?
Sam: While you were gone, everything happened, by the way. Everything happened.
Travis: We're apparently taking someone's bounty.
Matt: This character runs up, dressed in leather armor, hood, cloak. Runs back, pulling two longswords from underneath the cloak and swings up to strike multiple times. You can see a hawk gliding over, heading in the canopy. Does 12 points of damage with the first strike. The second one, goes to swing and hits the hide and flanks off of it.
Laura: And it explodes in his face and he's knocked prone.
Matt: Sorry. This woman, as she rushes forward, you can see the skin has a pink-reddish tint, these blackened twin horns curl to the back of her head, and she carries a giant greatsword in her hands as she runs in a blur, yelling out this angry war cry. "It's ours!" Runs up and swings towards one of the hydra's heads. First one misses. Second one misses. (whoosh) In her fury and anger and the frustration of currently having apparently a targeted bounty of theirs taken, she swings wildly into the air, missing both strikes. That's going to end their round. All right, that brings us to Grog and Percy. Percy, make a wisdom saving throw.
Taliesin: This is a wisdom modifier plus d20?
Matt: It's whatever your wisdom save is.
Taliesin: Natural 20.
Matt: Ones and twenties tonight. So you manage to shrug the effect, but that's your turn. Grog.
Travis: I would like to look to the woman that swung and missed and go, oh, I think you meant to do this. And I'll swing for the body of the hydra.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: 24.
Matt: 24 hits.
Travis: And 20.
Matt: 20 hits.
Travis: Why didn't I use the stupid dice, but that's okay. 19?
Matt: 19 damage.
Travis: And 11.
Matt: All right. (whack) You hit once again, almost like you're cutting down a tree. You're hitting the same mark you hit last turn, carving a large chunk of the throat out. You can now see the exposed bone underneath, and it's starting to gurgle through its hissing. You bring the axe around with the inertia on the backswing and slam it into the base of another one of the necks. As it slams into it and gets wedged in there, you have to pull it out with a giant spray of blood that actually spatters across the female tiefling, which you now see. Who, as it sprays across her, she licks it off her pointed teeth, and you can see she brings her sword up, ready to go ahead and attack it again. She's glaring at you now with a this-is-mine type expression. Vax.
Liam: All right, so am I still up on the elevated part of the stone?
Matt: You are, yes.
Liam: The one that's occupied with Grog, I'm going to jump on it and cling my legs to the side and try to slice down as I go, over the side wall. Okay. First is a 28. I'll just do that. And it's a sneak attack because it's occupied with Grog, obviously. So that is a two-- this is my Keen Dagger. That's a nine plus... nine, 13, 16, 19, 24. Nine plus 24 is 33, and then the second dagger, Flametongue, nine, ten, 19.
Matt: All right, that does hit.
Liam: Okay, that's a regular old four plus six is ten, and then out comes the Venom Dagger, which has already spit its poison, and that is a 26, which also hits, and that is a four plus six is ten. So (dagger noises) down its neck.
Matt: All right. As you spin over and arc down onto the opposite side there, nice. Well done. I forgot to roll for-- it does resist the poison at the end of its turn, by the way. Though even with the disadvantage it still managed to hit you last turn. All right, cool, so you flip over, arc yourself down after the series of dagger blades, carving these two long, ragged wounds down the side of its body. As you hit on the opposite side, where the stonework is starting to crack a little bit from the impact and swishing about of its physical body.
Liam: Can I ask, do I have a bonus action at this point? I'm hasted, and I've done three attacks. Is there time for a bonus action? I don't know.
Matt: You have an attack, bonus action attack, and then the haste attack.
Liam: Okay, I'm good.
Matt: All right. Keyleth.
Marisha: Should I try and get these fuckers off, or should I just kill the damn thing?
Laura: Attack the hydra.
Marisha: I cast Call Lightning and bring a lightning bolt right down on its head.
Matt: In the same space, you can see there's a burnt hole in the top of the canopy where that fire column came through, there's a slight sizzle of ozone before a giant hammering blow of lightning streaks from the heavens down into the body. You feel a jolt of energy in the daggers. You pull them out instinctively before it manages to make its way to your body. Go ahead and roll damage.
Marisha: (whoops) Nine, eight, bringing us to 17. 21 damage.
Matt: 21 damage, nice. All righty. That ends the round. At the top, where the secondary head you blew off was, two more heads sprout out. It now has seven heads.
Sam: Hey guys! There's more heads for me to knock off!
Laura: Hey, that's the best thing ever!
Sam: We get to keep doing it!
Laura: I bet if we keep doing it though, I mean, eventually the heads will outweigh the body and it'll just have to fall over.
Orion: Okay, well. He's 20 feet in radius himself, isn't he? Sweet! I'm going to-- oh, there's a lot of people, though. Who are they? I put my ring out and I'm going to do instantly, quicken spell, do five more SP will bring me down to one sorcerer point, and I'm going to huck two Fireballs right in the center of the hydra.
Matt: Okay. All right.
Orion: But you're off to the side. You're not on it. Are you on it?
Matt: So you're drifting over here? Oh. No, you're just aiming at it. Okay. So. Back-to-back, you used the last of the sorcerer points to fire two Fireballs that explode, one after another. Go ahead and roll damage on both of them.
Orion: 20-- what is that?-- 29, 31, 35, 36, so that's 41.
Matt: 41 for the first one. That's almost straight sixes and fives. That's awesome.
Orion: 34, so that's 39.
Matt: 39. Were you adding five to each of those?
Orion: Yes.
Matt: I don't think you're supposed to do that for Fireball.
Orion: It's any fire attack.
Matt: Oh, that's right, because you have the-- never mind. You do. Yes, that's right. I need a reflex save from Grog and from you, Vax.
Liam: I'm going to do rogue's evasion. I'm going to use Matt Colville's die made of iron from a meteorite.
Sam: From a meteorite?
Liam: Hopefully not die.
Sam: Wait, from a meteorite?!
Taliesin: To be fair, the die didn't dodge the earth.
Liam: What kind of roll is this? Saving throw. I've rolled a 17.
Matt: This is a 20-foot radius.
Laura: So everything in that area?
Liam: Everything in the area. It's done. I rolled a 17. Is that a success or a failure?
Matt: What is the, what's your spell difficulty?
Orion: Spell save? 17.
Matt: 17, so that just makes it for the first one, yes.
Liam: Just makes it. For the first Fireball?
Matt: For the first Fireball, yeah. You avoid that entirely.
Liam: Do I need to roll again? We're all going to roll again in a moment?
Matt: Yep. Roll for the second one now. Because two exploded in a row.
Liam: Oh, now. That is less.
Orion: Oh, hold on a second. Wait. I want to put a pause on this real quick.
Laura: You can't. You already did it!
Orion: I asked the question before I cast the spell. Is the hydra itself 20-foot radius? And I got a nod, so I figured my spell--
Matt: The hydra itself, the creature, it's a 15-foot diameter.
Orion: Diameter.
Matt: A radius is from the outside of it, from the middle.
Orion: Radius is different from diameter? Okay.
Sam: Geometry, kids.
Orion: Well then, it's fine, I'll shift it closer--
Liam: It's done. This is why this is interesting. So I succeeded the first time. I failed the second time, which means I halve whatever the damage is, which is high.
Matt: Okay, you take 18 points of fire damage.
Liam: That's okay.
Matt: Grog? Two saves.
Travis: What am I rolling, sorry?
Sam: You're trying to beat 17.
Travis: Oh, I rolled a 14, plus anything?
Sam: Yeah, you've got inspiration, friend.
Travis: Yeah, I do!
Orion: Plus his what?
Travis: Proficiency or what?
Matt: It's whatever your dex saving throw is.
Travis: Oh. Two. So 16, plus--
Laura: So 18 for the first one.
Travis: 18 for the first one.
Matt: 18. So you take 22 points of fire damage.
Liam: Where did all that math go from the last game?
Travis: Nine.
Sam: Nine?
Travis: Nine.
Taliesin: You can take it.
Travis: Yeah, I got it. I'm all good.
Matt: Here's the other side of it, though. We'll get to it in a second. Nine? You take 39 points of fire damage.
Laura: I don't want to say it, but Trinket's right there.
Matt: Oh yeah. Roll a saving throw for Trinket.
Sam: No, remember? I said leave Trinket behind?
Laura: Yeah, I know you said that, but he also attacked him already.
Matt: Roll a saving throw for Trinket.
Liam: Come on, Trinket die. Oh my god. Okay.
Laura: Don't say it.
Liam: No, it's good.
Laura: 17 for the first one.
Matt: Okay, that just makes it. So Trinket takes 22 fire damage. All right, and then the second one?
Marisha: I'm eating so much sugar, compulsively, out of nerves.
Laura: It's stuck in there.
Liam: Oh wow, it's not either, it's really on an angle.
Laura: It was really on an angle. That's unfortunate because one of them was good, and one of them sucked.
Matt: So what did you roll?
Laura: Seven.
Matt: Seven, all right. So with the explosion, both explode out of the way. You both manage to avoid the brunt of the damage. Trinket falls unconscious on the ground, the smell of burnt hair. The hydra looks rough. However, the individuals also nearby that came in are also blasted back by the Fireball. Everyone but the cleric and the mage in there are hit with the double explosions. Everyone taking full damage except for him, who takes half on the first one. They all of a sudden look around, dazed and frustrated.
Sam: Yeah, we just set off a nuke on the thing.
Matt: The hydra, due to the fiery impact, collapses inside the stone structure.
Sam: Dead?
Marisha: Dead?
Matt: Dead. So how do you want to do this?
Marisha: Our kill!
Orion: Oh my god.
Liam: With casualties.
Orion: Before the last one reaches it, I actually cast really hard Control Flame. It totally doesn't work this way, but I do it anyway. You bastard, I didn't mean to do this! And I'm going to hammer like I did with Flaming Sphere when we were playing in private.
Matt: I'll say you do this. You set off the first Fireball. As it explodes and damages everyone in the radius, it blows one of the throats of the hydra apart. The heads are now caught on fire. As you take the second Fireball, you set it off, shouting that outward. You use Control Flame at the same time as the Telekinesis you're still maintaining to envelop the explosion of the Fireball and contain it in the center. You slam it and let it detonate as part of the impact into the torso, where the heads are currently attached. You end up blowing half the heads off the hydra in the process. The rest of its body's trying to keep itself standing up. However, the explosion itself sent the stone wall around you guys broken into pieces and shards now sticking upward. The hydra backs up and falls onto its side, impaling itself on the shattered stone wall that you had kept up as it slowly slides down on the wound and gurgles out its last life breath, the rest of its body on fire, slowly sinking to the base of the stone wall.
Orion: That was really cool.
Travis: Who can heal really a lot really fast?
Laura: Trinket! I get up and run over to Trinket and hold his little head in my hands.
Marisha: Who's bad?
Travis: Trinket's unconscious.
Taliesin: Trinket's unconscious.
Marisha: I run up to Trinket and I cast Cure Wounds on Trinket in a 3rd-level spell slot.
Matt: All right.
Laura: Help him!
Travis: He's going to be fine.
Matt: As you guys rush up--
Liam: Yeah, Vax is rolling down the corpse of the hydra to stand in front of these strangers.
Travis: I've rushed to Trinket's side, too, from where I'm at.
Matt: All right. You're right at Trinket's side. You're flying in here.
Sam: I get closer and do the Superbowl shuffle in front of our new visitors, like, yeah, that's what we did.
Marisha: Trinket heals for 21 damage.
Matt: Trinket gets up, charred but okay.
Marisha: Who else is bad?
Matt: Trinket looks over at Tiberius and gives you a glare.
Marisha: I use it again for Vax. Ooh, that's better.
Travis: I rolled two hit dice--
Matt: Well, you aren't at a short rest yet. Because right now, as you guys are just standing there, the rest of the other party is now stepping up to you. The main human you now see in armor. He has dirty blond short hair, little bit of stubble on the chin, very well-armored, and the armor itself looks like it's taken a beating. He steps up and says, "All right. I'm going to ask you a question. What the fuck are you doing?!"
Liam: I think we're killing a hydra. What are you doing today?
Matt: "Fulfilling my contract."
Sam: Oh, by not killing the hydra? Because that's what you just did.
Liam: Listen, we don't know what the fuck you're doing. Take the hydra. We're not here for a bounty; we're trying to help the city.
Laura: Well, no, give us the money.
Marisha: We did want some proof.
Matt: He looks back to the rest of the group and the cleric steps forward and touches his shoulder for a second. Shrugs it off and says, "No! No. Skags that wander these lands, taking creatures from underneath those who are lawfully permitted to hunt these beasts and take that bounty, and that makes you breakers of the law of Vasselheim."
Sam: What's your name, sir?
Matt: Turns over and looks toward you, takes a couple steps forward, leaping off of the broken stonework on this side. "Aldor. And I work for the Slayer's Take, those of us that are empowered to hunt contracted bounty-given beasts and creatures in this land. You have gone out and laid claim to a beast that you had no lawful right to."
Laura: Well, the Bastion up on the wall said we could, so that's why we did it.
Marisha: While all of this is going down, I'm going to casually walk over and open my little harvesting book and start harvesting some hydra blood.
Matt: As you attempt to do that, the mage walks up and goes, "I wouldn't recommend that." You can see her elven face, there is a glare of frustration and standoffishness that is very sincere. "Do not step closer."
Travis: I'd put your hand down. You see, I had a horrible day yesterday, and unless you want to end up like puppy-dog here, we'll all end up in a big pile of blood, unless you find a way to split your take with us, and maybe let us go on our way. You see, we're new in these parts, and we have a habit for killing.
Matt: "Who would pay you?"
Laura: What do you mean?
Matt: "Where were you going to take this creature for the bounty you keep speaking of?"
Liam: Which one is talking?
Matt: This is Aldor, the same human fighter.
Laura: Aldor, they told us we could kill it and then give the heads and then bring it in and then they would give us money...
Sam: We didn't think this through. Listen. Let's level with you. This whole escapade was not very well thought out. We're new in town. We don't want to step on any toes. We did you a solid; we killed your thing. Let's calm it down a notch and let's just talk, shall we?
Laura: Why don't you just tell people you killed it, we helped, you get the money, you give us half of it, and we call it even?
Liam: Otherwise, we're going to go right now.
Matt: He laughs to himself and looks back at the rest of them and says, "You have to understand. The Slayer's Take's contracts are binding. Magically. If we don't take this creature in after dealing the killing blow, we're at an impasse with the Slayer's Take."
Laura: Oh. Can you stab it right now? Maybe it's still breathing?
Liam: Can anybody heal it? Can you kill it again?
Matt: The cleric steps forward, this human cleric, older, whitish hair. Steps forward, his mace at his side, armor currently spattered with hydra blood, looking a little charred, but for the most part okay. He says, "Okay. Before this gets out of hand, perhaps if you come with us to the Slayer's Take, there would be a possibility of us still enacting this contract if we find a way to magically bind you to it. Now, mind you, I don't know how the funds would be legally distributed; however, if you talked to the leader of our order, perhaps there could be some sort of a resolution to this."
Sam: What funds are we talking about, here? What was the contract that you had been binded by?
Matt: They look at each other and take a step back defensively and say, "We don't discuss money matters out in the open where it's so easy for bodies to be hidden."
Travis: Who is this leader of yours?
Matt: "The one that you're looking for... is on the other page." (laughter)
Sam: Aldor is no longer talking, right?
Laura: No, Sean Connery's talking now. I'm sorry.
Matt: "The Huntmaster." (laughter)
Sam: That's your leader?
Liam: I suddenly remembered my Charlemagne.
Matt: "Are you taunting me?"
Liam: I'm sorry. Not at all. Listen, we were about to come to blows. You and I are going to work this out. Words are mightier than the sword, right?
Sam: Don't ever do that again.
Travis: What if we return, saying that you had acquired our services in the killing of this beast?
Sam: We were subcontracted to you, yes.
Matt: "The only way that would work is if you were contracted to the Slayer's Take beforehand, which if you were to agree to be inducted, perhaps that would alleviate the concern. We could then write you into the contract magically, share the funds, even, and you would be free to accept contracts to kill creatures at your leisure."
Travis: I'm sorry, a little clarification. We get paid to kill?
Matt: "We're not out here for fun." At which point the tiefling female behind him says, "Hah, say that yourself. I'm out here for both." She flicks her sword and the blood across the ground.
Travis: Are you in the company or know of Siren?
Matt: They all look at each other. "She's been known to do work with the Slayer's Take, yes."
Travis: Yeah, I'm definitely in.
Sam: Introduce yourselves, if you don't mind.
Matt: "Let's do that as we walk." At which point the cleric says, "Take the heads, cleave them off. We'll take them back as trophies to prove the contract is sealed." The leader, Aldor, says, "Very well. Clean your weapons. No funny business. A single moment of your eyes wandering to your blade. I don't want it to have to come to blows. Let's carve up this creature."
Sam: Oh, what will you do to us? What you did to the hydra? Oh no! Not kill us.
Matt: "I really, really don't like you."
Sam: Few people do.
Liam: You don't have to worry about that. We're out here helping the city for the sake of good, not earning a paycheck.
Laura: I mean, I was going to ask them for a paycheck immediately after we'd gone back to the city, but you know.
Liam: That's how you roll.
Matt: "There's a very lucrative trade on monster-hunting in these woods, but you have to make sure that you're certified. Otherwise, you're taking money and food out of the mouths of us and our families."
Liam: Certification is key.
Matt: "Come on. Gather up the creature's bits." And they all go to start carving into the body of the hydra.
Laura: Ooh, can we help?
Marisha: Now I start doing my thing.
Liam: I've got the naughty bits.
Marisha: Do I need to roll for this?
Matt: You don't have to, actually. The group are very well trained, and as you go to try to, the tiefling puts her hand down and starts tearing pieces out. There's a dominance, a standoff here.
Laura: Can I have a scale? Just one more scale?
Marisha: I want some stuff.
Sam: It's all right. We'll get it and we'll figure it out when we get there.
Matt: There seems to be a general feel here that you've already broken the law enough. If you really want to fight for it, you can.
Liam: Let's quit while we're ahead.
Sam: Yeah, let's deal with the naughty bits later.
Matt: It takes about half an hour or so to reap the bits and pieces, then again making your way back, after you've pushed the remainder of the body into the pool itself, letting it slowly sink to the bottom. You all make your way back the path you came in an awkward, quiet march.
Laura: Oh, you guys set that bait out. You guys killed that ape, didn't you?
Matt: Aldor gives you a look. "Good to know we aren't the only trackers in this town."
Taliesin: That's so clever. Clever girl.
Matt: Eventually make your way back to town, skirt around the outer wall to one of the three main gates, this one right on the outskirts of the Braving (stutters). Too many creatures. Braving Grounds. The gates open. You're all led in, first question at the sight of you guys, but Aldor raises his hand and says, "No, they're with us; it's fine." You all walk in, leads you to the outskirts of the Braving Grounds to a new area of the town you have yet to travel to. At which point, he introduces, "Welcome to the Quad Roads. This is where the Slayer's Take makes its place. This is also where the Erathis's Crown is. Best you pay an homage to the deity of civilization while here." He pulls out a small gem around his neck with a small symbol on it, kisses it, and puts it back in his shirt. You guys continue walking to what is now, you can see these large roads that streak across. You've seen them join with the other sections. This is the most central of all the various districts of the city of Vasselheim. There is a very large trade bazaar structure not that far out of the main gate that leads to the center of this district. You can see barkers shouting out left and right to you, various phrases dealing with food and various crops, and creature fresh meat. "Fresh meat out of the Abundance! Takers of the Abundance!" And people yelling out for general goods, packs, leathers, large carts being wheeled past you, until eventually you make your way to what looks like a very old, dark-wood lodge, about three stories high, decorated with dozens of tusks and claws and other trophies that look as old as the building itself. A carved wooden sign stands bolted to the top of the porch that says "Slayer's Take Guildhall" in the common tongue. Approaching the door, still that awkward quiet keeping over the group, there is an engraving into the doorway-- it's pushed into the wood-- that reads, "Here is where the hunters gather, keen eyes and blades at ready. We cease the unknown's cackling laughter. Our will is strong, our members plenty. We stand against the tide of darkness. We do the deeds few men can handle. Reap forth a trophy from the carcass. We are your strength, we are your candle." Aldor does a knock on the door. The door opens, an eye looks through, and the door swiftly opens as another individual who's dressed in a makeshift leather and hide armor steps aside. You're all let in, carrying the large hydra heads through that have been gathering looks from the individuals watching you charge through the streets. To the center of the room, you see what looks to be amongst the loose cast-iron candelabras that are affixed to the rafters, small candles flicker for the interior light, you see a long desk where a halfling male of muscular build sits eagerly rubbing his hands together, his harsh features and light scars dotting his face and hands, his red hair showing tinges of grey. His shifting smile belies a youthful vigor as you approach with the trophies. "Aldor! Welcome back. How goes that bleeding mess-headed beast? I see you seem to have dropped it before you." Aldor takes the first head that he's carrying and chucks it to the ground. As it rolls across with two large thuds, the rest of the congealed liquid seeping into the wood. "Aye, that's true, but we bring a bit of an obstruction in the way." Glances to the rest of you. "Obstruction, you say. Okay. Well, this is a curious phrase. Please explain to me what has occurred in your outing on this contract." Aldor scratches the side of his face. "Well, it seems that we have a group of skags."
Laura: Not intentional. Skags.
Matt: "Not intentional skags out of the forest, intending to hunt and managed to deal the killing blow to our mark."
Orion: Actually, I did that.
Matt: "This one did it." He wipes some of the soot off his face. "Amongst other issues."
Orion: Sorry. My aim was off.
Liam: We've come from Emon. We're not exactly familiar with the customs and traditions of your city. We were merely trying to help. My friend may have slaughtered the hydra-- unintentionally, of course. We're hoping to somehow fit into your society. Not sure how that works. Maybe you can help?
Matt: The halfling walks from behind his desk with his hands behind his back. (laughs) "You come from Emon. You are not familiar with Vasselheim, yet the first thing you do upon arriving is leap down to the Vesper Timberland, fighting a freaking hydra."
Laura: It was attacking the wall. We were protecting you.
Liam: A hydra attacking your city. We were merely following our conscience.
Matt: "No, this is okay. I like the balls you all have. This is ridiculous, what you've done."
Laura: I have enormous balls.
Marisha: Yep, we both do.
Liam: See? They're massive.
Matt: He steps away. "Lady. I appreciate your brashness, but I would hope that you also act like a lady."
Marisha: Oh.
Laura: Oh.
Marisha: That's a high standard.
Liam: Careful where you're walking, little man.
Matt: "All I say is I appreciate-- yes, your bear is quite fierce."
Laura: He's got giant balls, as well.
Matt: He reaches past and looks to the wall and you see there are two dire bear heads affixed to the wall of various ancient degrees.
Marisha: Don't look, Trinket. Don't look.
Matt: "Well. I can see that you may have breached the contract here, and there may be ways of perhaps rectifying this, should you take the pledge. The pledge itself is a process, one that I myself cannot specifically judge upon. This would have to go to my boss, the Headmaster. My wife." (laughter)
Liam: I feel you.
Travis: Respect.
Matt: "I will see if she is available. One moment." And the halfling patters off down a hallway.
Liam: That is fucking awesome.
Laura: That would be amazing.
Matt: Came back a few moments later. "She would like to see the skags now."
Sam: What is with skags? Just call us people, please?
Travis: We have a name. Vox Machina.
Liam: Perhaps you've heard of us.
Laura: Remember it.
Matt: "I have heard of it not before. I will call you this upon you making the pledge. Until then, you are a group of forest-walking skags."
Sam: All right.
Matt: You follow him into the back hallway, down past a series of doors, some of which are half-open and ajar. You see what appear to be bunks or rooms for rest. There are some shields and various old weapons set up as decor against the wooden hallways. Down to a large, heavy door that looks like it's actually, the red leather stretched across it, nailed across all parts of the doorway, with a branded symbol in the center. The same symbol that you saw adorning the, almost like a relief behind the Slayer's Take lodge entranceway sign. As the door opens, the halfling pushing it aside. "Please, enter. She would like to talk to you." As you guys all step inside, the interior, a soft, glowing magical torch lights the room from the ceiling. The entire room is a large office or study. There are books and meticulously kept scrolls. At a glance, you can see they break down various creature types, that talk about indigenous bestial creatures, some talk about the anatomy of mythical and mystical beasts. This is a research facility for the hunting of any such creature that would find its way near or in the vicinity of Vasselheim. There, waiting for you, not at her desk, but leaning against it, with her hands also at her back, similar to her husband, you see before you in very finely crafted dark brown and black studded leather armor, a small shoulder cloak fixed and tossed over one shoulder, tousled short brown hair, deep purple skin. The second tiefling you've seen today. This woman stands with bright white eyes, no pupil. Her tongue flickers out of her mouth like a snake a little bit as you enter. And she looks about the rest of the party. "Please. It would be my pleasure to talk with you for a moment about what you have done this day. Thank you, husband." The door slams shut behind him.
Laura: You two make an adorable couple.
Sam: Yeah, he's a peach. Good find.
Matt: "Welcome, skags. You seem to not be liking this title. A skag is an affectionate term we use for those who break our rules and will go to prison, perhaps beneath the Amaranthine Oubliette."
Sam: Well, as long as it's affectionate.
Liam: We understand we've broken the letter of your law, but perhaps not the spirit of your law, which is maybe more important.
Matt: "Which is why you are here and not currently being taken for the hall of judgment."
Liam: We're very grateful.
Matt: "Now. My husband said you have interfered with a contract that has already been enacted."
Sam: We didn't know we were interfering with it at the time. We thought we were just doing good, and we're here to make right by that.
Liam: We're tourists, basically.
Matt: "Which is also why you are not at the hall yet. He also said you showed interest in joining our ranks to avoid this prosecution, which I think is a very smart move." And she walks behind her desk and sits down. "Should you be cut out for our work, that is. You have proven to have slain this hydra with the accompaniment of one of our roving bands of monster hunters."
Laura: They didn't do much, but yes.
Sam: We're quite capable fighters. Grog here almost won in his fight the other night. Sorry, Grog.
Matt: "You're the one that nearly felled the Hammer."
Travis: I am.
Marisha: So you have heard of us.
Matt: "I've heard of this one."
Sam: Show her the lip.
Travis: I kept a keepsake.
Matt: (laughs) "A fine trophy. Do not show him you still have that. I don't think it would go over too well. Now. Most applicants for our humble family make it maybe a month or two before the Vesper Timberlands take them. Those that remain, well. They prove worthy of our business contracts. You are all on trial by deed, under my claim and authority. Should you agree and fulfill my request, indeed, you will be absolved of your infractions against the Slayer's Take and be given membership to our age-old tradition. With membership comes with access to our lodge, food, room and board, and training facilities. Simple arms can also be provided. Those that bear our insignia may also get a discount of supplies at most of Vasselheim's merchants. Most importantly, though, you will then have access to our bounty contracts. To specify, we don't just hunt beasts and creatures. A large part of what we do is harvest from our marks' requested components. Blood, eyes, teeth, organs. We receive orders from all across Exandria, from as far as even the city Emon, which you apparently hail from."
Laura: We have a keep there.
Matt: "How nice for you."
Sam: Greyskull.
Matt: "I will make a note of it." And she reaches over and grabs a quill and not even looking at the paper, just scribbles.
Liam: We're friends with the emperor, thank you.
Matt: "Well, perhaps this emperor and many of these scholars or seers or mages you've encountered have ordered from us specifically required components, for you see, the most powerful of magics within nations require a focus or sacrifice of some kind. Many of these require pieces of these creatures. So many contracts are from very high-paying clients that have better things to do with their time than wander skulking about the forest, seeking such things as a hydra. There's a lot of money to be gained should you be up for it. I would ask you to take a contract, complete it, and return. That is all. You would have three days to do so. Do you accept?"
Sam: What is involved in signing or binding this contract?
Matt: "There is a small ritual that binds you to the contract. Within this time it must be completed. Should you fail, the contract is absolved, and your membership is revoked."
Sam: Oh, it's a trial just to bind the contract?
Matt: "Your trial is to take the contract and you have three days to complete it."
Taliesin: Is there a payout on this contract?
Matt: "Oh yes, you will still receive the money for it, and with membership, from what I have been told by my husband, possibly even share in the bounty for this hydra you helped slay earlier on this day."
Laura: That's good, because otherwise they didn't get any credit, right? Because it was like, magically--
Matt: "Precisely. Also a part of the three-day contract, with three days before it is null and void."
Liam: We've taken out a beholder and a handful of illithid. We're not really worried about your contract. Give us your contract; we'll sign it.
Matt: She chuckles under her breath. "That is good to know," she says disbelievingly.
Sam: There's an insignia that we get? Is it given to us on some sort of jacket for members only? (laughter)
Matt: She reaches to part of her shoulder pauldron, lifts it up, and you can see there's a brand on the side of her arm.
Sam: My body's a temple. I don't like that.
Matt: "Then perhaps you'd like the judgment."
Sam: The judgment? Oh no, no. Do I have to get branded?
Matt: "It does not hurt much."
Sam: (whimpers) I'm really wimpy.
Matt: "Gnomes... Three days. Will you accept?"
Laura: Yeah, let's do it. We're totally tough.
Sam: Could you do mine in henna? (laughter)
Matt: "I will take that as an acceptance on your part, as well."
Sam: Thank you. Yes. I'm with my group.
Matt: "Good, good. Now, I trust you work well as a team, but I am curious how well you work with others. As this is a test, I will be dividing your band between two contracts."
Liam: Ex-squeeze me?
Matt: "Two teams."
Sam: Do we get to pick the teams?
Matt: "You, gnome. Giant. Ranger. Tinkerer. You will form the first team."
Laura: What?
Liam: That is bullshit.
Matt: "You will be taking your contract with a couple of other hopeful possible members, as well. Three days to fulfill. Now, cutthroat. Dragonborn. Vine-speaker. You will form the other team."
Laura: Does my bear get to come with me?
Matt: "Your bear is allowed, yes. I shall now look over our extending contracts to decide your test for tomorrow. Go. Return in the morning fed, armed, and ready to set out. And hopefully get affiliated with your journeymen members. Now, be gone. I have business to do."
Laura: Wait, no. We work as a pair. Maybe you don't know that about us.
Matt: "Oh, then this should prove a very interesting test."
Liam: You don't understand, we haven't been apart in about--
Laura: Ever.
Matt: "Life is hard here in Vasselheim. Deal with disappointment."
Liam: Oh, I'm sorry. What was your name again?
Matt: "I am known as the Huntmaster around these parts. But should you wish the name in its full, Huntmaster Vanessa Cyndrial."
Liam: Thank you. Vanessa... Shitmaster...
Travis: Don't. I grab him and I start walking out of the room.
Sam: Vanessa?
Matt: "Cyndrial. C-Y-N-D-R-I-A-L."
Sam: I am not going to spell that right.
Matt: "In the morning  fed, armed, and ready." Knocks the desk twice. Her husband closes the door behind you. You take a deep breath and realize this will be a very interesting challenge.
Marisha: Husband? Do you have a name other than husband?
Matt: (laughs) "They call me Mertin, yes."
Marisha: Mertin?
Matt: "Mertin Cyndrial, yes."
Sam: Mertin Cyndrial... Well, this should be interesting. We'll set off on our journey right away, then.
Travis: When do we get our brand?
Sam: After we complete the task.
Matt: Taps his nose and points. "You catch on quick. This bodes very well for you, possibly."
Sam: Have a good three days.
Travis: Can we stay in the guildhall while we're waiting?
Matt: "You are not members. Soon, though. When one's brand is achieved, as much as you like."
Sam: All right, Grog. Let's go.
Laura: Question, husband. Is there a way to change those little pairings that she made? Perhaps get my brother and I on the same team?
Matt: (laughs) "Trust me, there's no way to change my wife's mind. I've tried." (laughter)
Matt: He walks off. And we'll conclude the session for the evening there.
Liam: Eat a bag of dicks. [end of transcript]

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Welcome, everybody, to Critical Role! Our Thursday night show where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors play Dungeons and Dragons and roll dice and all that fun stuff in between! So for all you new folks, welcome to our chaos. For all you old folks, thanks and welcome back. We have a number of announcements to get through. I'll try and cruise through them as fast as humanly possible. Pardon my phone as a reminder. Google docs are a delightful thing. Starting off, I wanted to direct all you Critters to our official Twitter, @CriticalRole, for official news and announcements. You're welcome to still tweet at us for individual cast fun but we do have our official source for all official announcements, times, and our appearances. That would be the one to pay attention to. Go to @CriticalRole, follow it and any important stuff that comes in the future will be available via that Twitter. Awesome. Next up this weekend we're all going to be at New York Comic Con, which is going to be awesome. We have a two hour block from noon to 2:00 PM Saturday, October 12th. Where is it at? What's the room?
Liam: It's a weird word, the Winga Stage?
Matt: It's not on the Google Doc. Curse you, Google doc! But Saturday from noon to 2:00 PM, and then on Sunday, for those who can't make the actual convention, we're having an off-site gathering of Critters at the wonderful and illustrious comic book store Forbidden Planet. That will be from 2:30 to 4:30. Our time block shifted a little later in the day. 2:30 to 4:30, Forbidden Planet, we'll be there. We'll be signing autographs, meeting you guys, chatting it up, and we'll be debuting our brand new awesome poster here, exclusively for the New York Comic Con. Our Critical Role poster! We're super excited about it. This was wonderfully designed by one of our fellow Critters Joma Cueto. Joma did the art and Kim Davis did the actual layout and design. Both did an amazing job. We're going to have a bunch of these available. We'll be signing them for you guys, and we'll hope to see you there.
Liam: I love it.
Travis: They are pretty sexy.
Liam: We're going to be on the Wikia stage.
Matt: The Wikia stage on Saturday, near hall 1A, the Wikia stage at noon to 2:00 PM. Come find us on Saturday, we're going to be there. Also, a ton of mail was recently received just after Critmas. If your gifts weren't seen this last Critmas, they're probably in this batch. So next Critmas is probably going to be a long haul. It's going to be a doozy! But we're excited about that. That'll be the first Thursday of November, so look forward to that happening then. Next update. If you haven't been paying attention, we've been having occasional interviews once a week of our cast going up on Geek and Sundry's website. Today we had Travis's go up and if you haven't checked them out you should. It's a little step into our mindset, our crazy history and background of how this whole thing got started. Silly things ensue. So go read them if you have the chance, if you haven't yet. Or wait until after the show. Also, as of today we now have in the Geek and Sundry store Critical Role key chains and necklaces.
Laura: They look so cool.
Matt: Pretty rad. I'm really excited. They're metal and awesome. They're of our logo and if you feel like being as nerdy as we are and want to adorn your key chains with them, they are there available for your purchase.
Laura: They're custom order, so they make them when you order them. It takes a few weeks to get them once you order them, but it's worth it.
Liam: They have to come all the way from Kraghammer.
Matt: Mithril's hard to sculpt properly. Takes a while. Couple of other things, LARP: the Series, one of the live action series here in Geek and Sundry. Season two just premiered today. It's a really cool series that both has moments of drama and comedy that plays into the whole world and lifestyle of the LARPing game systems and the people. It's a really cool series. Check it out if that's your kind of bag. It's good stuff, really funny. Next Monday starts a new show called TPK Monday Nights, where our illustrious Ivan, who hosts many wonderful things here, will be running for the rest of October a group of other individuals through the RPG Outbreak Undead, which is actually a really cool RPG that Ivan actually designed and was in the whole process for, so it's Monday nights, check that out the rest of October! To keep the Halloween theme, we will probably be getting dead repeatedly at the hands of Ivan, so look forward to that. This is the last week you can buy the #NoShaveTil10k shirts. We have people who are keeping it up. I had to shave for Vin Diesel, but the rest of the month is straight on this now, largely for my Halloween costume and for this wonderful event. 20% of all proceeds from those shirts goes to the Extra Life charity we've been supporting, it helps out good people.
Zac: I drew that shirt, by the way. I had to look at his face for 12 hours.
Travis: You're welcome.
Zac: We've already hit 9,100. Protocol95, you are the first winner of the night!
Matt: Protocol95, congratulations. You will be winning the first bundle. Every 100 subscribers there will be another giveaway within the chat room. You have to be active in the chat to be up for it. It includes a cast photo signed by the cast of Critical Role, possibly signed while he's wearing that awesome beard. And a wonderful piece of art from our main artist Kit Buss, also signed by the cast of Critical Role. So every 100 subscribers, that giveaway goes out in the chatroom. Be active and bring your friends on to subscribe so you can win one. Last thing I want to mention, this has been a question that's come up quite a bit, some people are definitely eager to hear the information, so I had the pleasure on Monday this week of designing and running a very quick game of Dungeons and Dragons for Vin Diesel.
Liam: What? (laughs)
Matt: Let's just cross that bucket list item off immediately. That was ridiculous. So it was a lot of fun. He was fantastic, super awesome, genuine, and was really excited--
Laura: He rolled this die. It's sacred.
Taliesin: It was literally bucket list! That was one of the things we discussed when this game started; it could lead to a game with Vin Diesel.
Marisha: I bet if you go back and look at the Q and A session we had, someone asked our dream game crew--
Matt: Vin Diesel was one of our bucket list players. So we've already knocked one off on the show.
Taliesin: It's like a group mass suicide at this point.
Matt: Get matching tennis shoes, and it'll be great.
Liam: You didn't seem that excited, though.
Zac: We can already announce that next Thursday at the midpoint--
Matt: Next Thursday at the midpoint of next week's Critical Role, we are going to show a mostly complete video of that game. The full one will be released shortly thereafter, but next week, on Critical Role during the midpoint, we're going to show you the majority of that game session with him. Don't miss that.
Orion: Can I get a teaser? What did he smell like?
Liam: Iron.
Travis: Quarry.
Laura: Muscle.
Taliesin: Antifreeze and lilac.
Matt: All of those answers at once. A majestic scent. It was delightful. We'll have interviews going up throughout the week, exclusively next week here on Thursday you'll be seeing most of that game here and then more stuff's coming out for the week thereafter. Really excited about that, and I custom-made a witchhunter class for him that I tailored for that level, and there's been such a wide response for everyone asking about the class that I've now spent a lot of my free time that I'm not preparing for this game now customizing a homebrew witchhunter class for all of you to partake in. So that'll be fun and probably coming out sometime next week. It'll probably be broken. You're welcome to homebrew my homebrew, I'm not perfect, but it should be fun and a cool guide for some people to give it a shot as a player class, so look forward to that. Liam, you got a couple things to announce?
Liam: Yeah, just two things. I wanted to thank every Critter who helped out with Joe Madureira's Kickstarter with Airship Syndicate's Kickstarter for Battle Chasers: Nightwar. They crushed it. They got to almost every rung of their ladder. Maybe you guys could help them raise 100k tonight. But Joe told me that they saw a little bit of a bump every Thursday, and that our roleplaying power had some effect, so thank you guys, thank you very much.
Travis: Because we are many.
Matt: We are legion.
Liam: The other thing is tomorrow is Sam Riegel's birthday.
Travis: Nipples, is it really?
Liam: I have a birthday present for him tonight. Something I commissioned the lovely Kit Buss to make for you.
Sam: What? It's Vaxmas?
Liam: It's Vaxmas. Here it is. I'm going to send it across and then I'll tweet it out. You guys can look, but I made this just for you.
Sam: I'm not looking.
Marisha: I made this just for you.
Sam: Oh wow, that's really nice! I thought it was going to be vulgar. Wow. That's so sweet.
Travis: Kit Buss, why are you the best?
Sam: Thank you, Kit Buss. Me and two ladies, what could be better? Right?
Travis: I guess three ladies.
Sam: I don't know how to put this up, but thank you. That's so sweet. Aw. I won't kill you tonight.
Orion: Fun fact  Sam shares a birthday with my mom. That's why I'll never forget your birthday, ever.
Sam: And John Lennon.
Marisha: Happy birthday, Orion's mom.
Laura: Yeah. Happy birthday, Sam.
Matt: Happy unbirthday to Sam's mom, who is also a Critter. You should go follow her on Twitter.
Marisha: Momlan.
Liam: She's not effing around, either.
Matt: Any other announcements? Or shall we dive in?
Laura: I have one. I got nominated for a Golden Joystick award.
Matt: Really?
Laura: Yeah, for Fiona in Tales from the Borderlands.
Matt: That's awesome! (cheering)
Sam: Hey Travis, you didn't know this?
Laura: I didn't tell him. I think there's a week left of voting, so you can go and help out.
Orion: They can vote for you?
Laura: Yes, they can vote for me.
Sam: Can they vote many times?
Laura: I think you have to register your email address, so I don't know how many times you can vote, but you have to vote in all the categories in order to vote for the one category.
Travis: Congratulations, Laura.
Laura: Thanks, baby!
Marisha: As Orion says, release the Critters.
Matt: That's awesome. Go show your support for Fiona, and awesome! Let's go ahead and bring the mood back to our realm of imagination and fantasy and be back here in just a minute with the beginning of this night's Critical Role. [dramatic music]
Matt: So to get you guys caught up on what happened recently, the group, having heard that the Briarwoods, a couple who had taken power in the town of Whitestone far to the northeast, apparently responsible for the destruction of Percy's entire family and his escape into the wilds of Tal'Dorei, were going to be coming to Emon to bridge a political handshake with Sovereign Uriel and all of Tal'Dorei proper to build a bridge across the channel that separates this continent from Wildemount across the sea. Upon hearing this, the party was planning to gather information, and in doing so Vax got himself caught by sneaking into their bedroom and was nearly killed in the process. The group managed to aid him, pull him out from the jaws of death, and the Briarwoods escaped through arcane means, leaving a shattered carriage, a mostly beaten driver of their carriage. Through the scuffle, a number of guards were hurt or killed, and the party, upon meeting an individual named Lilith, a tiefling, leading her back to the Keep, they were attacked, or seemingly attacked, by a series of bounty hunters that were after her. There was some intense violence displayed against a few of them, and this all got back to the Council. The Council called Vox Machina to the central palace and began a trial to see if they were responsible for attacking guests of the Council, ruining what could've been a very lucrative union between the two towns and possibly murdering an old woman. They had their membership revoked, and during this sequence, apparently the charmed Seeker Asum was restored, seemingly to little effect. The group then left, realizing that perhaps the moral ramifications of their actions are having a bigger impact due to their visibility and their heroic status in the kingdom at large. When they returned to the keep, they found two representatives of the northern farmers of Emon that required aid; their livestock had been stolen over the past few weeks and was putting them in dire straits when it came to the necessary amount of meat they had to raise. The group, trying to turn their morality on its head, decided to aid, waited out in the center of the cow pasture at night, masquerading, through illusionary magic, as cows themselves. The giant roc, a gargantuan bird, swooped down and grabbed Cow-leth, Keyleth, here. Swept her away. The rest of the party, Tiberius enabled to fly through arcane means, and thus we had a squadron of evening cows chasing after the roc, which then got turned into a cow, to crash into a mountain. They chased it back to its perch up in the Cliffside Mountains to the northwest of Emon.
Liam: Such an old trope in fantasy.
Matt: Isn't it, though? "Cow-mouflage." And engaged a guardian of this roc, a gnome druid who had been removed from society for quite some time. After some rather roundabout and at some points on-the-edge-of-conflict conversation, they managed to convince him to instead take the bird and flee across the Ozmit Sea, to the northwest, towards Vasselheim, where it would be a much better landscape for the creature to thrive and grow. After that, the party is making their way back. Right around the beginning of daybreak, towards the keep. So that is where we left off. Percy.
Taliesin: Yes? Hello.
Matt: Darkness. Cold, lonely darkness. A flicker of light. It swells, bright, white, blinding, then flashes of your family, screaming. Julius, silenced by a bolt to the throat. Vesper, thrown from a tower wall. Your younger brothers' lifeless bodies tossed in a pile. The smell of death filling your cell. Your father Frederick, a blade jutting from his chest, slick with crimson. Your mother, Johanna, burned with irons, screaming. Cassandra, running towards you, calling your name into the night, begging you to help. One, two, three arrows. She falls. Darkness once more. Darkness and red. Red of blood. Red of burning fire. The sky is fire. The world burns with flame and iron. The smoke rises from the cinders, coalescing into a face, black as soot with eyes as burning coals, and a wicked grin. It speaks with a raspy, rumbling bass, like a slow-moving landslide. "You hold your vengeance, Percival. You made it. You only need to take it for yourself. Make the world right. My gift is yours, and your gift shall bring justice. Our bargain stands eager to close." You suddenly come to consciousness, gasping loudly against the air. You feel the warmth of the forge across the side of the workshop crawling across your face. You are sitting at your workbench, having fallen asleep amidst a pile of contraptions in mid-construction. As you look around, you can see your leather gloves are still on, apron on, blackened soot spread across your face, and a series of things you were in mid-build on broken before you on your workshop table.
Taliesin: (sighs) How long have I been here?
Matt: There's nobody in the room, and you have no idea. You're underground in the workshop. You haven't seen the sun probably for a good day and a half.
Orion: It's a new day. I didn't waste it at all.
Matt: You have no idea quite how long you've been down here, and you've been left alone for quite some time.
Taliesin: I'm going to head upstairs.
Matt: You go and open the metallic door that leads into your workshop and come around the corner, and there's a chair set in the corner, where Jarett would be sitting, one of the head guards at your facility. Jarett, however, is standing, hands up to his throat, going (choking sounds) with no visible assailant.
Taliesin: (shouting) Help!
Sam: Are we there? No, we're not even there.
Matt: I want you to go ahead and roll initiative.
Sam: Oh shit, it's already started!
Laura: Trinket was down there.
Sam: Was?
Laura: Don't say that!
Sam: Just saying that Trinket died already.
Laura: Don't say it.
Taliesin: Natural 20. 28. (cheering)
Matt: And that's how Percy does it.
Travis: What is with that dice and you, man?
Liam: You are the yin to Wil Wheaton's yang.
Taliesin: He was sitting here 20 minutes ago. I rubbed him for luck when he was leaving the building.
Marisha: No, we have him. It's balance.
Matt: All right. So what's your total?
Taliesin: 28.
Matt: 28. (laughs) You are definitely-- Okay. You are up first. What do you want to do? As you come around the corner and you see this visual in front of you. If you want to go ahead and roll for Trinket, too.
Laura: (worried noises) Oh no!
Taliesin: So I just see him up like this?
Laura: 19.
Matt: 19? Nice.
Taliesin: Just for some reference, does it look like he's possessed, or does it look like he's trying to remove something?
Matt: It looks like he's trying to remove something from around his neck, and looking down, you can see his feet are actually off the ground, kicking. It looks like there's a little bit of air wisping around behind him.
Taliesin: How insane would it be to try and make a shot beneath his legs?
Matt: You can certainly go for it and try.
Taliesin: I'm going to drop down. Can I make an aimed shot against something I can't see?
Matt: You can try, it'll be with disadvantage, but you can definitely make it.
Orion: He's in the kitchen?
Laura: No, he's downstairs.
Sam: Can I request that the rest of us do the sounds of the ricocheting bullets in case he misses?
Taliesin: Okay, I want 5.1; start here and make it all the way down.
Laura: But you're not going to miss, so it doesn't matter.
Taliesin: I'm going to take an aimed shot for my first shot, and then start firing blindly.
Matt: This will be disadvantage against an invisible assailant.
Travis: It misses?
Taliesin: It missed. I'm just making sure I didn't misfire. No, I didn't! Thank god.
Matt: So what's the total?
Taliesin: 15.
Matt: Total of 15? Still hits.
Taliesin: Still hits? 15 hits? Oh, that's 16 points of damage, and he has to make a constitution saving throw to not be knocked prone.
Matt: Okay. What's the DC on that?
Taliesin: Where is my DC? DC of eight plus my proficiency mod, plus my dexterity mod, so 19.
Matt: Sure enough. You see all of a sudden the air go (gasp) and Jaret falls to his knees (coughs).
Taliesin: I'm going to take two more shots right above his head.
Matt: Go for it.
Sam: Don't hit Jarett.
Matt: Jarett's on his knees, prone, essentially.
Sam: He could still hit Jarett! He's our best guy.
Matt: You still have disadvantage on these.
Taliesin: I don't?
Matt: No, you still have disadvantage on these. It is still an invisible creature.
Taliesin: 20.
Matt: 20 hits.
Taliesin: That's 13.
Matt: 13 does not hit.
Taliesin: No, 13 points of damage.
Matt: Oh. Yes.
Taliesin: And then 20 again.
Matt: 20 hits.
Taliesin: Nine points of damage.
Matt: Nine points of damage. (gunshots) The gunshots are echoing through the hallway. Whatever this weird entity is, you can see some of the nearby cloth and dust swirl up from its movement, you hear this (gasping sound), this angry sucking sound in the air around you. Do you want to move, or are you staying where you are?
Taliesin: I'm going to stay where I am. And I'm going to keep yelling. Help! I don't think I have an earring.
Matt: You see some sort of shimmer of wind come around the corner towards you. This one turns around and (whooshing sound) over to the bars, and you can see in the distance, it's moving over towards where your captive currently is.
Orion: How far away are we from the keep?
Matt: I'm getting to that. At the end of this combat round, all of you guys are right toward the outskirts of the keep, and you hear the muffled ringing of gunshots from the inside of the keep.
Orion: We do hear that.
Matt: You do hear this as you're just getting to the outer gates.
Orion: As soon as I hear that, I cast Fly on myself and (whoosh).
Laura: Are you wearing an earring, Percy?
Matt: No, he is not. The entity swooshes down the stairs and comes at you. That's going to be a 22.
Taliesin: That hits.
Matt: And a 12.
Taliesin: That does not.
Matt: It swings towards you, and a giant slam of extremely condensed air with a raking claw impact hits you in the torso, doing 15 points of bludgeoning damage. The other one swings out, same direction. This time you actually pull off to the side and knock it out of the way with your Pepperbox. The one back there is going to attempt to grapple. Succeeds. That's its action, and you can see the driver that you had put into prison is currently being (choking) making strangling sounds in the distance. That ends it. Trinket's up.
Laura: Trinket. He can see Percy getting attacked and instinct takes over, and he runs forward and he claws him.
Matt: All right, go ahead and roll for the attack.
Laura: That does not hit. That's a natural 20.
Matt: That will hit! (laughs) It begins.
Laura: Oh, that's the wrong thing. That's a 2d4.
Matt: So roll 2d4 and then multiply those by two.
Laura: 17 damage.
Matt: 17 damage, nice. Trinket runs up, coming out of his somewhat sleepy stupor, goes for a bite attack and grabs nothing with it, and turns around and rakes a claw backwards, manages to get the back of whatever this entity is, and you hear it scream (gasping scream). You do, at least.
Taliesin: I have a technical dispute, really quickly. Could the wraith have gotten that far, since I knocked him prone?
Matt: Yes, it could've, because it uses half its movement speed to get up.
Taliesin: Oh, thank you. Never mind.
Matt: Its movement is actually 50.
Taliesin: Ignore me! 50?!
Matt: Not that you know that. But it moved far for what you think it should've been able to.
Orion: By the way, for the record, Matthew, I have no idea what we're fighting.
Travis: Nobody does.
Orion: I'm just saying, I haven't meta-gamed here.
Matt: Congrats. (laughs) I'm proud of you.
Liam: Fresh start.
Matt: Jarett then gets up, sees this happening, moves over, and pulls out the key to try and open the prison door. Spends the turn doing so. Manages to get the door open. That's the end of Jarett's turn. Okay, now, the rest of you guys roll initiative.
Travis: Okay. Come on, you giant ball-bearing. Damn.
Laura: Does that count, if I hit it into my box and it slammed into the side? Does that count, or should I let it roll naturally?
Matt: Let it roll naturally. That would normally count, but it's fine. Wherever it lands, you take it, going forward. Okay, so 25 to 20?
Sam: Oh, initiative?
Taliesin: Keep up, people! Come on.
Matt: You hear the gunshot. You're entering this intensity.
Sam: I don't think it's anything. I think it's just him tinkering.
Matt: So Scanlan stays behind. 25 to 20? 20 to 15? What are your scores?
Liam: 15.
Orion: 15.
Laura: 17.
Marisha: 16.
Travis: 16.
Taliesin: Thank you all, by the way, for leaving a bear on suicide watch. That was really cool.
Laura: You're welcome.
Matt: Vex, what'd you get again?
Travis: 17.
Laura: I got 17.
Sam: He got 15.
Matt: 15, Tiberius. And what'd you get, Vax?
Liam: 15.
Matt: 15, all right. Three 15s.
Sam: I got three.
Matt: You got three? Okay. All right, so you guys all spend your turn, if you choose to, to rush through the gates. As soon as the gunshots go off, you can see Shayne's up on top, and she sees it, gives a quick turn, and you can see the gates begin to open, and you hear this angry grunting as your half-orc guard is now pulling the doors open as fast as he can. You guys find a moment and slip through, running towards the front of the keep. You guys manage to get, with full dash and full turn, including your flight-- because you fly a little bit faster, but you have a little more of an arc to get over-- you guys get to the front of the keep this turn. So you won't get into this until next round. That brings it back to the top. Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: (sighs) There's no way I can fire at the one who's far away from me right now, is there?
Matt: It's hard to see.
Laura: But Jarett's got him.
Taliesin: I can ignore cover, though.
Matt: You can ignore cover, but you have this entity in front of you. I mean, you'll be at disadvantage regardless, because you're shooting at something invisible, and you have something that's in melee of you and you have a ranged weapon.
Taliesin: I'm going to see if there's a charge left in my glove and try and take the-- there wouldn't be a charge left in my glove, would there?
Matt: You glance down at the glove, and you see the gemstone in the center of the palm is currently dark and lifeless.
Taliesin: Okay. (sighs) Hold on, sorry.
Travis: Fan the hammer, motherfuck.
Taliesin: It gets weird when it's up close. Okay. Let's see what we do. All right. There's no way I can step back right now, is there?
Matt: Currently? I mean, you can if you want to. It'll get a free strike on you.
Taliesin: Okay, I'm going to try and take shots, then.
Matt: The one in front of you? Okay. Go for it. With disadvantage on each shot.
Taliesin: Firing with disadvantage? Screw it, I'm going to take my first one with sharpshooter to see if I can do any damage that way. Nope. Actually, that's a misfire.
Matt: So Pepperbox (explosion sound). You go to shoot, and--
Marisha: (ricochet sound)
Matt: The barrel gets clogged, and the front of it actually catches fire for a second, and you have to shake it out right now. It's completely offset, and it's going to take a moment to even get it to where you can fire again.
Taliesin: Okay. Do I have six seconds?
Matt: You do. And you've used one attack. You have two more attacks.
Taliesin: Well, it misfired.
Matt: Yeah, that weapon you have to use an action to repair.
Taliesin: Okay. I'm going to do something a little weird. I'm going to pull out Bad News. I know I can't shoot this close with it, or god only knows what would happen. I'm going to try and swing it like a pugil stick, and I'm going to try and hit him with the butt of Bad News.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and make a melee attack. This is strength-based. Add your proficiency modifier and your strength modifier.
Taliesin: 15?
Matt: You still have disadvantage on it because you can't see it. And you're not proficient.
Taliesin: 15?
Matt: 15 just barely hits. (cheering)
Matt: All right, so go ahead and roll-- with the size of Bad News, I'd say 1d6, plus your strength modifier.
Taliesin: Four.
Matt: Okay, so four points of damage, as you bludgeon it. You took a turn to get it out. Your third attack is then slamming it in the side. Whatever entity you smacked gets pushed against the wall. Go ahead and roll a d20 for me.
Taliesin: 14.
Matt: Okay. So the impact does not appear to damage Bad News in this instance. It is a fragile construct, and even doing melee attacks with it does subject it to a misfire possibility.
Taliesin: I hit it with the stock, I was careful.
Matt: I know. Okay, so that concludes your turn?
Taliesin: Yeah, I'm kind of-- yeah.
Matt: Okay, you stay there. All right. The one that's in front of you now is going to go ahead and go over this way. Trinket-- well, no, it's still in melee, so it doesn't actually get an attack. It does get two strikes on you. That is a 17.
Taliesin: Nope.
Matt: And that is 18.
Taliesin: Armor class is 18.
Matt: So it does just hit you.
Taliesin: Can I do that crazy thing?
Matt: No, I've eliminated that.
Taliesin: Oh, you've removed that. Okay, never mind. I don't have the new update, sorry. I don't have a dodge anymore, right?
Matt: No, the dodge is not there. It rarely came into play. Okay, so that puts you at another 15 points of bludgeoning damage as it just smacks you right across the head. Your eyes go dizzy for a second, and you take a minute to refocus your vision, and you can now see in the air, the shimmering expression that looks like a humanoid face stretched and ghastly going (gasps) in front of you, but it's still barely even visible, and only because of the proximity to you are you able to actually make out any sort of shape or shimmer in the air in front of you. The other one is attempting to choke out the prisoner. However, the prisoner resists through athletics, so he's currently holding back at bay the strength of the entity. That ends its turn. Trinket's up.
Laura: Trinket's up! He's going to try to jump and land on top of the ghostly thing and bite its face. I don't know how to do that.
Matt: (laughs) To do a real leap, Trinket would have to back up and then run towards it. If Trinket wants to do that. Okay. So Trinket backs up. As it does, it gets one free swipe at Trinket. That is 18 to hit.
Laura: I'm having an issue here. Because I have 18 in parentheses, and then I wrote a 20 and I circled it and I don't know why.
Matt: I don't know why, either.
Laura: 18 is probably--
Matt: Yeah, we'll say 18. So that hits. Trinket takes 15 points of bludgeoning damage as the entity swings out and backhands Trinket. However Trinket now leaps-- go ahead and make an athletics check.
Liam: He has better armor class than I do.
Sam: Does he have armor?
Laura: He does! He's got his bulette armor, man. He's a cannonball. What am I doing? A strength?
Matt: Athletics, yeah.
Laura: 17?
Matt: 17. Yeah. Trinket leaps forward, slamming this entity onto the ground and knocking it prone, and you get to go ahead and make a bite attack.
Laura: Yes! That didn't count because it slipped out of my hand. That was even worse than the other one. So 11. It slipped out of my hand. It shouldn't count if it goes like that! 20.
Matt: So Trinket manages to knock it prone, however, because it gets pushed out of the way, Trinket has a hard time, Trinket just makes a big slash and a bite out in the air where it once was and misses entirely.
Laura: But he's gone prone.
Matt: But he is knocked prone. Jarett's now going to attempt to grapple the entity.
Sam: Wait, Trinket missed? (ricochet sound) (laughter)
Matt: Jarett manages to reach out and grab onto whatever this creature is, hold onto it, just grappling, and is going to attempt to try and pull it back. For this, I will do a contested roll on that. It rolled a one. Jarett pulled it back that far, managing to let go of its quarry, and is currently holding onto some sort of angry, whirling entity at that point. That ends Jarett's turn. The rest of you guys all manage to make your way up into the armory up top. First is Vex. You rush in there, and what do you want to do?
Laura: I want to run down and shoot something.
Matt: Okay. You can get just about there.
Laura: Can I see anything? Can I ricochet an arrow to hit?
Matt: (laughs) I would say this guy has three-quarters cover, so it would be disadvantage on the attack. You already have disadvantage because it's invisible, so it's hard to hit, regardless.
Laura: That was the same one each time. 28.
Matt: 28? 28 hits.
Laura: Oh, I didn't fucking Hunter's Mark him. God damn it. Fuck. 15.
Matt: 15 points of damage. The first arrow sinks into whatever's there, and you can see it jutting out of no physical space.
Laura: Now I'm going to Hunter's Mark him and I'm going to hit him again. Can I do that?
Matt: Technically, it's part of your attack. You can do two attacks first, then you can bonus action, so you're like (arrow sounds) and then you Hunter's Mark it after.
Laura: All right. That one doesn't hit. Doesn't matter. Doesn't hit anyway. I missed it.
Sam: (ricochet sound)
Matt: Second shot shatters against the back wall of the stone. You can Hunter's Mark for your bonus.
Laura: I Hunter's Mark him.
Matt: All right. Entity is now Hunter's Marked. That ends Vex's turn. Keyleth, you now also make your way into the doorway.
Marisha: How far can I get?
Matt: About there. Nothing's in visual sight right now, unfortunately.
Marisha: Nothing's in visual sight?
Matt: No, half of that was getting to that point. You could dash and try and make your way in, but you wouldn't be able to do anything.
Marisha: Can I dash and then make a bonus action?
Matt: You could, yeah. Your call. What do you got? Grog, you're on deck.
Marisha: I'll just wait.
Matt: Okay. Keyleth waits there. Grog, you're up.
Marisha: Let me just scootch over so I can be behind Vex.
Matt: You have a little better movement, so you actually manage to get two more squares in. What's your speed again?
Travis: 50.
Matt: 50? Yeah, you manage to get up to there, and now your turn begins.
Travis: I go into a rage, and I come in, and I turn to the right, and I run up as close as I can to Jared--
Laura: Jarett.
Travis: Yeah, Jarett. And wispy fuck.
Matt: All right, so you charge in. Angry, you see Jarett's currently reaching back and trying to go for his crossbow now that this entity's in his face. He's grappled it with one arm and he's reaching back to try and grab it. You come rushing in. Go for it.
Travis: I take out a holy oil vial out of the Bag of Holding, I crush it in my hand, and I take a swing at whatever he's holding.
Matt: All right. Cool. So as you pull out (glass breaking) the pain from the glass even further angers you in your rage. You can see a mix of holy water and blood trickle down from your fist as you clench it. Go ahead and swing for a punch with disadvantage.
Travis: That's a one.
Matt: So that first strike just whiffs over. Through your anger, you're unable to focus on where this entity may be.
Travis: Not off to a good start with this. Number two. Disadvantage. Fuck.
Matt: What's the total?
Travis: 15.
Matt: 15 just barely hits. Go ahead and roll.
Travis: One of these guys?
Matt: Go ahead and roll that. Half that damage, yes.
Travis: One. Plus rage, which is--
Matt: Plus strength.
Travis: Oh, right. Eight.
Matt: So eight points of damage to it. All righty. (whack) It hits, and you hear this (yelps) sound as it takes the impact, and you can see this strange, angry face appear suddenly out of the shimmering air that just then disperses again, and you don't quite know where it is. You can make a third strike now, if you want.
Laura: Did it do any holy damage?
Matt: Did not appear to have any additional effect on the entity.
Travis: Well, hell, it was worth a shot. Oh, at disadvantage. 19.
Matt: 19 still hits. Go ahead and roll the next attack.
Travis: Eight again.
Matt: Eight damage again. (whack) You backhand it with your third strike, this time finding the edge of its face again, and you see the chair right next to it tumble as it barely manages to catch itself and keep itself aloft. Nevertheless, this strange invisible entity is still there holding its ground.
Travis: Would you say the blood from my hand is splattering Jarett behind him?
Matt: You look over at Jarett. Jarett's currently trying to grab onto the creature and keep it grappled. So yeah, it's spattering on him.
Travis: I'm a painter.
Matt: (laughs) All right, that ends Grog's turn. Vax and Tiberius. You guys both get up to the edge of this room here.
Orion: Your cape is looking really nice, Vax.
Liam: I'm clicking my Boots of Haste, and I get double movement, so I get to go 60 feet. I'm going to slink up right beside Trinket and stab the shit out of this invisible thing.
Orion: Stab him! Hey, what do they look like?
Liam: So because Trinket's right there, this is a sneak attack. That hits. That is 29 to hit.
Matt: That'll hit. (laughter)
Matt: It is prone. It is invisible but it is prone, so that evens out to no advantage or disadvantage.
Liam: (counting) 25 for the first hit.
Matt: 25, all right.
Laura: Don't you double it? You had to double 19.
Liam: No, he didn't-- that's a critical hit.
Laura: Oh, right.
Liam: One shy. So now out comes the Dagger of Life-Stealing. It misses-- well, does 15 hit?
Matt: 15 just barely hits.
Liam: Just barely hits? Oh, that's better than I thought. That is three plus six is nine for damage, and then the Keen Dagger comes back, and that gets a 27, so that also hits for nine of damage.
Matt: All right. So as you rush over, you stab downward. You hear this (gurgle) sound as your blade comes down into whatever entity's there, and your hand moves around as it struggles against the blade. You pull it out, grab your other dagger, and then throw it in the air, catch it, slam it down again for that third strike, and then pull back and stab a third time.
Liam: And Trinket is very comforting, pressed against my shoulder as I do all that. He's supple.
Matt: Supple bear. #SuppleBear. All right, that ends your turn. Tiberius, what are you doing?
Orion: How far can I get?
Matt: That's about as far as you can get with your movement. You currently do not have visual on either of them. You're flying. What's your fly speed?
Orion: 60 feet.
Matt: You said that last time, and we found out it was 40, I believe wasn't it?
Orion: Was it 40? I thought it was 60. It was double the-- shit, hold on. I have a card--
Matt: You have a card and yet I find it faster.
Orion: 60 feet.
Matt: It is 60. You're right. Yeah, so you can go double. You are now just coasting down the stairway.
Orion: I'm going to attempt something I haven't actually tried before.
Matt: All right, go for it.
Orion: Because there's one to my right and one to my left, right?
Matt: Correct. There's one over here that has Grog and Jarett flanking. The other one has Percy, Vax, and Trinket all around it. That one's actually prone on the ground. It's hard to see normally; it's very hard to see now that it's swarmed.
Orion: Do I have visual of both wraiths?
Matt: You have visual of both entities, whatever they are.
Orion: Okay, sorry. I call them wraiths. Okay, so. I'm going to cast at--
Sam: Have we rested, by the way?
Matt: No, you have not rested yet.
Sam: So we're down a bunch of spells.
Matt: Yeah, you're still where you were when you came back.
Marisha: Well, to be fair, we talked. We didn't have a battle.
Sam: Some of us used spells. Fly and stuff.
Orion: I'm going to try to do this about now. I'm going to look to my right and my left and at 6th-level I'm going to try to do Glacial Blast and split the damage and try to hit both of them. Because it does 8d8 damage--
Matt: Are you doing this single-stream?
Orion: I'm trying to split my arc. So instead of doing this, I'm trying to-- (ice sounds)
Matt: Okay. How much damage is it?
Orion: At sixth level, it's 8d8 damage.
Matt: Okay, and what's the saving throw?
Orion: 17.
Matt: 17, okay. Jarett and Vax have to make saving throws, as well. Go ahead and make that. Jarett rolled an 18 and has high dex, so yeah, Jarett makes his save. That's half-damage for Jarett.
Liam: 28 for me.
Matt: All right. So you take no damage, because you're a rogue. Go ahead and roll damage. That's 18 for one. This one fails, this one succeeds.
Orion: Cool. Right hand does-- oh, sweet.
Marisha: No. That's a d10. These are d8s.
Orion: Sorry, my bad.
Matt: It's actually not prone. They're immune to being prone.
Orion: Right hand-- that's 14 to my right, and then 18 to my left.
Matt: So how much is that?
Orion: So 14 to my right, 18 to my left.
Matt: Okay. Got you.
Orion: The one that doesn't save gets (freezing sound).
Matt: It would if it wasn't immune. However, as you arc down, the ice blast comes through. You can see Vax manages to pull down to the ground and get out of the way in time. Jarett ducks out of the way and it blasts over, hitting both these entities. Ice crackles around both their forms, but then the forms shift out of it. That ends your turn right there. Comes back to Scanlan.
Sam: Oh, where am I?
Matt: You are right there. Just entered the room behind everybody else.
Sam: Where does Percy do his tinkering?
Matt: Over here.
Sam: Because I can't see what's going on down there.
Matt: No, you just see, currently, these three down the hallway. You can just see Tiberius blast a bunch of ice, arc in the air.
Sam: Okay, so I know there's shit going on down there, but I can't really see what. So I would probably just Dimension Door into the tinkering room, because that's where I assume Percy is. And then I see what's going on, and nobody's there. Do I have line-of-sight on anybody?
Matt: Currently, you see Percy through this doorway right there.
Sam: Okay. Well, then. I can move also, can't I?
Matt: Yeah, Dimension Door is your action.
Sam: I'll move towards him. Oh, then I see a crazy thing in front of me. Shit. So I probably take a couple steps back. (laughter)
Sam: And then I'll inspire Percy. (sings) All the single Percys, all the single Percys.
All: (sing) All the single Percys, all the single Percys, put your guns up-up-up.
Matt: d10 inspiration dice to you, Percy.
Taliesin: What is that, a d10?
Matt: d10, yeah. That brings it to the top of the combat round. Percy, you're up first.
Taliesin: I'm going to use my action to try and clear my gun.
Matt: Okay. So go ahead and make your check.
Taliesin: What is that again? Did it change since last time?
Matt: That one shouldn't have changed, no.
Taliesin: Okay, so it's 11. I'm adding my bonus die. God damn it. Nine.
Matt: Nine. As you pull over your Pepperbox, you're like, (ping). The actual barrel comes off and hits the ground and rolls off toward the back of the room.
Taliesin: I'm tossing it into my room. I'm using an action surge. Actually, can I even do that? Yes, I'm going to use my action surge, and I'm going to walk over to the wraith on the ground, put the barrel of Bad News up to it, and pull the trigger.
Matt: The wraith is no longer on the ground, by the way.
Taliesin: Is he not?
Matt: The entity actually, upon looking, is immune to being prone. So we won't retcon anything, but as you go to pull the barrel up, you can see now the face is standing up before you.
Taliesin: I'm just going to try and shove it until I hit something and then pull.
Matt: Okay, so go ahead and roll with disadvantage with Bad News.
Taliesin: 22.
Matt: 22 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
Travis: Oh shit. We're all going to go deaf.
Laura: Oh man, that's going to be loud as fuck.
Taliesin: 19.
Matt: 19. (gunshot) Bad News goes off. The sound is deafening in the room, the echoing of the explosion through the stone walls. I'm going to go ahead and have you roll a constitution saving throw.
Liam: Vax or Liam?
Matt: Vax. Both, maybe.
Liam: Roll a what now?
Matt: Constitution saving throw.
Taliesin: If you fail, I get to scream in your ear.
Liam: That is a 15.
Matt: 15, okay. You don't go deaf, but your ears are ringing very hard. The entity screams and then disperses.
Taliesin: I get a grit point back.
Marisha: You do! Dope.
Matt: Okay, so two more attacks. Or you have to use one to reload.
Taliesin: I have to use one to reload. I have one more attack, but I've already-- I didn't move. I'm going to try and roll around the corner and I'm going to take another shot. 27.
Matt: 27 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
Taliesin: 19 points of damage.
Matt: Okay. This time (gunshot), the shot goes off right by your head, Tiberius. You're flying in the air and you look down and see him pull Bad News out right beneath you, and before you have a chance to react, (gunshot) the flash of the muzzle just bursting forward, a big plume of black powder smoke fills the air around you.
Orion: So I see a big flash? And what do I roll?
Matt: Make a constitution saving throw.
Taliesin: Sorry.
Orion: Seven.
Matt: Okay, you are considered deaf until the start of his next turn.
Orion: Okay, so as soon as I see the flash, I go, (yelps). That's all I do. (laughter)
Matt: So that ends your turn, Percy? All right. Next, this entity that's Hunter's Marked is going to rush forward, straight out of the grapple from Jarett. Shifts right out of his hands. Is going to run forward and take the double attack against the prisoner. That's a 19 plus six. 25 hits. And 15 hits, as well. Takes 30 points of damage. Is currently unconscious. Punches him twice, and you see the poor driver is knocked up into the ceiling, falls down onto the bed, and is half-laying off. You see blood trickling down the front of his face, his eyes open, and slowly close.
Marisha: We need him alive.
Matt: That brings us to Trinket's turn.
Marisha: Come on, Trinket!
Laura: Trinket roars, rushes forward.
Matt: Actually, we're now going to roll Trinket into your turn.
Laura: Oh, all right. Then he stays there.
Matt: Okay. Trinket stays there until it's your turn. Jarett is going to rush forward and come to this corner. The crossbow is not much aid at this point. Reaches over and pulls out a short sword and lunges forward with the short sword. Yeah, with disadvantage, nine. Oh god. Rolls a 20 and a three. Great. Sorry, Jarett. Swinging through, trying to pierce through the bars at this entity, and can't seem to get any sort of attack to hit.
Laura: So he's actually locked in the thing still?
Matt: Jarett got the door open, he came through to try and grab the creature, and as he tried to pull it back, the creature sifted through his hands again to go ahead and attack the prisoner. That ends Jarett's turn. Vex, it is now your turn.
Laura: Okay. Can I move forward so I can see?
Matt: Yeah, you can see about there; it would give you visual on the entity.
Laura: All right. Yeah, I'll do that. I'll shoot him. He's Hunter's Marked already, okay, good.
Matt: He is, yes. So both attacks at disadvantage.
Laura: 15.
Matt: 15 hits. Just hits.
Laura: 16.
Matt: 16 also hits-- oh, 16 damage. All right. Including the additional Hunter's Mark?
Laura: Yes. And then 14 doesn't hit.
Matt: 14 does not hit. The arrow disappears in the back of the cell, scattering and shattering against part of the stone wall.
Laura: And Trinket, can he get up to him? Oh, but I took all the attacks.
Matt: Correct. So Trinket rushes up, but doesn't attack.
Laura: Trinket stays in the corner, then, because he can't do shit.
Matt: Okay. Trinket just cheers you on. (bear growl) Cool, that ends your turn. Keyleth.
Marisha: Okay, I'm going to-- seeing the direction that everyone's pointing, going to walk up and reach around Vex and I'm going to cast Faerie Fire right-- oh god, wrong direction. Right in the fucking eye. (laughter)
Liam: You turn on yourself.
Marisha: Crit fail. It's a 20-foot cube, so I want to cast it right in the cell.
Matt: Okay. So as you cast that, it's going to attempt to make its save. What's the DC on that?
Marisha: Against my spell's DC? 18.
Matt: And it fails with a 14. All right, so you guys watch as she reaches her hand out. The entire cell, all of a sudden there's a burst of purplish light, and these little dust-stars of purple glowing begin to drift down from the ceiling. As they do, they cling to whatever this form is, and you can now see, very clearly, this invisible entity that is surrounded in these purple sparkles. It looks humanoid from the torso up, but its legs are shimmering and shifting around. You now have a very clear look on it. You've nullified its invisibility.
Marisha: You have advantage now.
Matt: Gives advantage, as well? Yeah. You guys now all have advantage on this entity.
Marisha: And I'm going to take my bonus action to do Healing Word on the-- it's not Jarett that's unconscious, it's the cab driver. On the cab driver.
Matt: Okay, so go ahead and roll for the Healing Word.
Sam: Desmond. Jarett and Desmond.
Matt: How much does he heal?
Marisha: Six plus my spell modifier. So ten? Is that right, is that how it works? Plus my spell level? Is that what it is with Healing Word?
Matt: I think it's plus five, whatever it is. Healing Word, yeah.
Marisha: 1d4 plus my spellcasting ability modifier.
Matt: So it's plus six.
Marisha: Six, so 12.
Matt: 12. Got you. Okay. Desmond's eyes clarify for a second and he begins to breathe heavily. Still looking very wounded, but conscious and prone across the bed, as the entity that's Hunter's Marked is still looming over it, bringing its fists up for another round to try and finish its job. That ends your turn, Keyleth. Grog, you're up.
Travis: There you are. Hold still, Casper! And I run up and I swing. (laughter)
Matt: As you rush up angrily, make your strike.
Travis: That's 28.
Matt: That hits.
Travis: That's a 27.
Matt: Hits.
Liam: Those would hit Tiamat.
Travis: 17.
Matt: 17 also hits, so roll damage three times. As you rush up, the bars open, bringing the axe down on top of this now sparkling purple entity.
Travis: Ten, so 14 on the first one, plus fire damage.
Matt: Cool.
Travis: 17 plus-- 21. No. Is that right? Did I do that right?
Laura: Yeah?
Travis: Yeah. So 21. The second one.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: And 17, 21 again!
Matt: Nice! All righty, so you run up (hammer strikes) hammer down a third time, you can see its body being beaten around by the attack. And you see the whispering of its wind around its lower body is starting to slow, and it's looking like it's getting more sluggish, but it's definitely still intent on its job. That ends your turn, Grog. Vax, you're up.
Liam: All right, in a split second I'm watching Grog take the thing apart. I size up everybody in front of me in the distance and I think I can Assassin Creed my way through the crowd because I can go 60 feet normally, so 30 feet if it's crowded, and I'm going to use Grog's proximity to take this thing apart.
Matt: Okay. I will say you would normally get advantage. Because you're attacking it through the bars, melee, it disables it, so it's just a straight attack. You're having to fight it through prison bars with daggers, which is difficult.
Liam: All right. So the first one is terrible, it's a 14.
Matt: 14 misses, unfortunately.
Liam: And that's where the sneak attack damage is, right?
Matt: Well, it's the first attack you get on it would get it. So even if you miss the first attack, you can still get it with the second and third.
Liam: All right. Third one is a 21.
Matt: That does hit.
Liam: So there's the delivery system, and that is the Keen Dagger. 26, 27, 32. 38.
Matt: All right. With that, the first blade comes through and you try and get it through the bars and it gets nothing. You pull back, take the other dagger and swing through it. Falls too wide and you have to bring your arm back. This time, you can see after Grog has slammed it with the hammer, it falls. The sparkles come towards the edge. Its slamming its back into the bars. It's right there in front of you, and you use that instance to go ahead and reach through the bars, grab it by the throat, and stab it repeatedly, at which point its form disperses into wind around you.
Liam: And I slap Grog on the back and say, you softened the shit of him. That's terrible English. You softened him up for me! Asshole.
Travis: You've been drinking?
Laura: (giggling) You softened the shit of him.
Liam: You shitted him up for me, Grog. Good job.
Matt: You guys look over. You see Desmond is still on the bed, eyes wide (panting).
Orion: I rush over to Desmond, and out of my pouch I bring out a sandwich that I had made earlier. I hand it to him and I go, Desmond, decker. Here, have it. It's a decker sandwich. You should have it.
Matt: Gets up on the bed and takes it. "What happened?"
Laura: I run up and I cast Cure Wounds on him.
Matt: Okay. So go ahead and roll for the Cure Wounds heal on that.
Travis: You casting that all over the place now aren't you, fancy-pants?
Sam: From the tinkering room I yell out, is it safe? Can I come out now?
Orion: It's safe.
Liam: There's four more of them. Stay back.
Sam: Oh! Okay. I'll stay.
Travis: I remember I have the holy oil in my hand, mixed with the blood, and I start blessing him. With bloody fist.
Laura: 17.
Matt: All right, awesome.
Laura: Do I add my wisdom to that?
Matt: You add your wisdom modifier.
Laura: Then it's 20.
Matt: That's good to know. All right, cool. All right.
Orion: How's that sandwich?
Matt: Desmond isn't eating it. He's just holding it and still taking in. "What happened? What was that?! Look, what was that thing?"
Travis: Yeah, what was that thing?
Laura: What was that thing?
Orion: I would say opaque buttholes.
Marisha: Can we do a check?
Matt: Make an arcana check.
Taliesin: I'll make an arcana check, too.
Sam: How did you get two?
Orion: I rolled one by accident.
Matt: If you rolled by accident, you have to roll intentionally to take the score. Because if you were to accidentally roll really bad, you'd be like, "That doesn't count! I didn't actually roll."
Orion: A hard 12.
Matt: Total of 12?
Liam: I rolled a 22 arcana check.
Marisha: 22?
Laura: Oh, he's faced these things before. That's what it is.
Matt: That's the thing, you've seen these. These entities are used by certain high-level arcane practitioners. They can be summoned as certain spells. They're air elemental-based in nature, but they're generally known as invisible stalkers. They're used as assassins that have a very sole, single-minded purpose.
Liam: All I know is they feel like the Briarwoods.
Matt: You get that, based on recent events, there's probably a good probability that was the source of this.
Laura: Do you know from your previous experience if there's any way to protect against them? Other than setting up walls?
Liam: Well, all I know is how to stick my face in the beehives, apparently.
Laura: Does anybody know how to protect against air stalkers?
Orion: Give me a day, I will find out.
Matt: Jarett, at which point has put his hand against the wall, and goes, "Ugh. I would recommend that next time you decide to put me on watch, let me know if we're up against things that are invisible. I apologize. I was not prepared for such a foe to show up."
Laura: We were unprepared to warn you. I'm sorry.
Matt: "It's all right. If I might ask, what exactly are we up against here?"
Travis: Fuck if we know.
Orion: Seems like we're up against either vampires or liches. Prepare the troops. There will be some changes made to the keep over the next couple of days. We shall shore up security, as well.
Matt: "I would like also to consider possibly some changes made to our income, as this suddenly turned from a general guarding job to going up against the denizens of the afterlife. It's already been a very dangerous proposition."
Orion: Of course. We shall discuss that in the-- is it the morning?
Matt: "Very well. I'm going to go ahead and make sure the rest of my team is alive."
Liam: Jarett! Are you up for it?
Matt: "If the pay is good, yes."
Laura: Jarett's up for anything.
Matt: "You understand. Ugh, okay. Talk to you in the morning. I think a bit of rest is necessary." And he makes his way up the stairs to the rest of the keep. Desmond at this point is still in shock, and he starts absentmindedly eating the sandwich that you handed him.
Orion: It's good, right? I had one yesterday.
Laura: Well. Maybe it's best not to leave him down here.
Orion: No. You should stay in the guest room. Come.
Matt: "Is it safer there?"
Orion: Yes, it is.
Matt: "I told you they'd come for me. I told you they would."
Laura: But you know what! You're still alive.
Sam: You've had the worst couple of days.
Matt: Wipes the blood from the side of his face and looks at it.
Orion: Let's take you upstairs and get you all fitted... Who do we talk to that works for us that does the actual construction to the keep?
Laura: That is one of Uriel's staff. In which case, we cannot talk to them right now.
Matt: Yeah, the individual responsible for the construction of the keep was Lord Riskel Daxio, which is an elven gentleman on the Council that helped oversee the whole construction and helped you guys design it, so.
Liam: Is he still on the bed?
Matt: Still on the bed.
Liam: I sit down next to him and say, listen. You are a victim of circumstance, we understand that. We are, to a certain degree, as well. We're not leaving your side, and really there's no other choice. I mean, you're fucked like we are. So we will do our best to protect you, I promise you.
Matt: "Okay."
Travis: I volunteer to sleep down in the room.
Liam: Oh wow.
Orion: He shall stay in my quarters.
Travis: It's better down here, isn't it?
Liam: In a locked cell with Grog? I think is pretty safe.
Laura: I think it's probably better to bring him upstairs, because if it's locked, we can't get to him very quickly.
Orion: Don't worry, we can enchant his room, as well, to have an alert thing go on if anything happens in the room at night, and it would be safer. I shall be sleeping in my laboratory for the next several nights, as well.
Marisha: I mean, I can still go ahead and do the planar bindings to an elemental that maybe I should've done beforehand. It lasts 30 days.
Liam: I like all of these things, but I think Grog as a bunkmate is a good idea.
Matt: At this point, Desmond leans into you and quietly says in your ear, Vax, he goes, "Is where I'm sleeping going to be away from him?" He looks over towards Percy.
Travis: Yeah, totally away from him.
Marisha: It's fine. You'll have him in between you and him.
Matt: You don't hear that; it's whispered to Vax.
Liam: There is a lot of history for Percy wrapped up in this and he has done you wrong, no question. But the answer is yes. You will be separate from Percival. You will be protected. And you have my word.
Matt: Make a persuasion roll.
Laura: And you have my axe!
Liam: I'm going to use some Luck. Using my Luck. Natural 20, with Luck.
Matt: Takes another bite of the sandwich and packs it away in a little piece of cloth he had in a pocket, puts it in there. And you know, you can still see as he brings his hand up, you can see the blood streak against where the fingers were on the lower half of that hand. Strokes the edge of his chin and goes, "Okay. I trust you. Please. Please don't let them kill me."
Liam: We may be fuck-ups--
Orion: Speak for yourself.
Liam: But we're not without ability. You have my word. I promise you.
Matt: "Okay. I'm very tired."
Laura: Desmond, dear. Let's go upstairs. Grog! That bed needs to go back up to the guest room.
Travis: Fucking hell. I start to take the fucking bed up the stairs.
Matt: Takes you roughly another 20 minutes or so to bring it out of there, fitting it through the door.
Orion: Erwen! Where is that old man?
Matt: As you call out, Erwen eventually comes down. "Hi. Yes, Tiberius. You called? It's quite early in the morning." He has his night cap on and he's rubbing at his eyes.
Marisha: What time is it?
Matt: Right now, it's about probably 6 30 in the morning or so. It's just after sunrise; you guys haven't even slept yet.
Orion: Oh. Shit. Never mind, I'll talk to you once we've slept. Go back to sleep. I didn't realize what time it was! I thought it was 10:00 AM, which is totally different than 6:00 AM. I didn't know that.
Matt: "It's all right. All right. In the morning then, Master Tiberius." And he goes off to his bed to sleep.
Travis: We go to sleep?
Laura: Yeah, we need to sleep.
Sam: I gently fall asleep under Percy's workbench, where I've been hiding this whole time.
Matt: Okay, make a stealth check.
Taliesin: Not going to sleep down there.
Sam: Natural 20.
Matt: All right, so. As the rest of you go to sleep--
Taliesin: I'm going to go into my workshop.
Liam: On my way up, I fall in next to Keyleth. Ask, is your hand all right?
Marisha: It's fine.
Liam: Do you need anything?
Marisha: Nope.
Travis: Since he's sleeping in the room with me, I take a few of the caltrops that I have and I put them on the inside of the doorway before I close it.
Matt: Okay. So you guys are doing your setup there. Percy, you're in your workshop. Go ahead and roll a perception check, Percy.
Taliesin: 17.
Matt: 17. Okay. You go about your work.
Taliesin: I'm fixing my gun.
Matt: Okay. The materials that it requires you to do so are expensive, you actually have to pay the cost of the gun, and go ahead and make another check.
Sam: The fuck is that sound?
Matt: So go ahead and make another tinkering check. And the cost of the Pepperbox should be at the bottom of your--
Taliesin: Is it the whole cost or half?
Matt: Should be half the cost. It should say under the repair rules for a misfire.
Taliesin: Half cost. Oh my god, that's awful. Okay, tinkering check. 12.
Matt: 12. Okay.
Taliesin: Technically, that would be a success.
Matt: Yeah. So you take the rest of the morning, unsleeping, the dark bags under your eyes. You manage to get the Pepperbox back in working order.
Taliesin: Oh, I was asleep. I wasn't with them, so I just woke up really early.
Matt: Right, right. But even so, even though you slept, it hasn't been very restful. It's been technically enough to rest, but your evening has been fraught with nightmares. Perpetually. But your Pepperbox is repaired, and does cost you half the cost of the weapon cost to repair.
Taliesin: 75 gold.
Orion: I sleep in my little nook in my laboratory.
Matt: Okay. You guys rest through the rest of the morning, waking up past noon, probably about 2:00 in the afternoon. You all gradually begin to come to consciousness. Make your way downstairs. As you come downstairs, you can already smell breakfast has been prepared. You can see Laina already has the meal set out for you, and as you guys approach, "Oh it's so nice of all of you to come down! It was very interesting. These very nice folks came by this morning and dropped off a whole bunch of food and fresh veggies and stuff. Makes for a great meal. It was very nice of them. Food is served." And she gives out the plates and gives you a smile.
Travis: I love you. (eating noises)
Liam: Is this a frittata?
Matt: "I believe that's what it's called in some circles. I'm trying a few new things!"
Travis: Can I make a beard check?
Orion: I'm going to take some food and feed it to Lockheed and roll for my animal handling for the day.
Travis: 66.
Matt: No effect, unfortunately.
Travis: Just a little tingle?
Matt: There is a slight tingle, but it's mostly a placebo. (laughter)
Matt: As you guys are having your meals and you're trying and you're feeding food, teaching this, everyone roll a perception check.
Liam: At home?
Orion: 16!
Liam: I rolled a one.
Marisha: 17.
Liam: This frittata is lovely.
Sam: Six.
Travis: Eight.
Laura: 16. But my passive is 21.
Matt: Right, understood. Good to know. Percy's down in his workshop. As you guys are in the middle of your meal, you hear, clearing the stillness and quiet of the low munching-up, (clears throat) and sitting at the table adjacent to you guys, completely unnoticed in his entry, is Seeker Asum, arms crossed.
Laura: Motherfucker, you are sneaky! I need to talk to you.
Travis: We are not cool right now.
Matt: "Well, obviously not. That's why I'm here to have a conversation with the rest of you. Please continue to eat. I don't mean to disturb you."
Orion: Oh, very well.
Laura: Help yourself to a frittata.
Matt: "I've already eaten, but I appreciate the offer."
Orion: Try this hakuna frittata. It's really good!
Travis: Hakuna matata?
Laura: Let him talk.
Matt: "What a wonderful meal. Well, things have certainly gotten sticky, haven't they? Well, first and foremost, I would like to thank you, Keyleth, for clearing my head. Lord Briarwood had locked me into some form of mental charm during my attempt to aid Vax--"
Marisha: I told you it worked! Sorry, I'm a little defensive right now. Continue.
Matt: "That's all right. Things are a bit mixed up. It's hard to explain; let's just say I have been clouded in my judgment for the past few days until you cleansed me. I'm sorry to uphold the charade back in the palace."
Liam: Apologies are mine, I think. I believe you had some sort of plan, and I thought I knew better, and for that I'm sorry.
Matt: "I cannot say that is untrue. But I accept your apology."
Laura: Can I roll for insight?
Matt: You may.
Liam: Roll high!
Laura: I know! That was a shit roll. Nine.
Matt: He's a hard person to gauge, anyway. You gathered over time that most of his work deals in a network of spies and the gathering of information across all of Tal'Dorei, so he is very well-trained to hide the essence of his true nature and the intent. Hard to read. But he seems pleasant as he's been, and given the circumstances. "Nevertheless, I accept your apology, and I apologize for having upheld the charade during the council meeting, but I had to keep up appearances so as not to cause any sort of stir at the time. I fear, based on my observations since, that our very own sovereign also fell to the same charm I did and has been clouded since the dinner the night before."
Laura: Shit! That makes sense.
Marisha: We were afraid of that.
Sam: He's fallen for that stuff before.
Matt: "He's been through quite a bit, and while he's a resolute and a very good man, I would say that he is predisposed to outer influence from those that are quite strong-willed."
Sam: And this is why you kept up our accusations against us in front of him?
Matt: "Under those conditions, the room filled with guards that were all intent against keeping you at bay. Should you have made any attempt to try and cleanse him as well during that time, I think you all would have wound up in prison. Or worse."
Marisha: So why didn't you want to show that you were also cleansed? What was the point of holding up the charade?
Matt: "Because when you're under this influence, to speak against the proposed ally of the charm is to draw a line. I wish to stay in his good graces because that would enable us a much better chance of getting you close enough to him to absolve him of this charm. If I was to reveal this instantaneously in the presence of the entire council, I fear that might have put me in the same court of disfavor as you and lost any future chance of expelling this influence."
Laura: Do you it's only Uriel, or do you think it's the rest of the council as well?
Matt: "Best I can gather, most of the council is not as well-- how do I put it? Not used to business with Vox Machina. Allura seems to be of clear mind, as she is very powerfully protected against such influences and did not have any immediate interaction with the Briarwoods during that dinner. I fear the intent was on the sovereign himself."
Sam: Wait, are you saying that the Briarwoods corrupted him?
Matt: "Same way they corrupted me."
Sam: During the dinner? While we were all sitting there?
Matt: "Apparently, it takes naught but a glance."
Laura: Oh shit! They could have gotten any of us.
Orion: Yes. They did. Me. It was rather inconvenient. I hate them. Sorry.
Matt: "I think we have something in common."
Sam: Aren't you deaf?
Liam: No, that was brief.
Orion: I mean, what?
Sam: Is that why you're talking so loud?
Orion: Yes. I was getting it back.
Matt: "There are a few options at our disposal. You could continue to work to clear your name, during his distraction southward, if you have some idea as to how we could get close enough to him to absolve him of this now, that would leave the risk of, should anything go poorly, being poked with many spear holes."
Laura: Is it possible to sneak into his room, and restore him without anybody knowing?
Matt: "If you're confident. That may be more of a mission for the quieter of your bunch, should they be a little more intelligent with their actions, going forward."
Orion: What about drawing him out to a luncheon or whatnot?
Matt: "I will say, based on recent circumstances, he is very careful and defensive."
Liam: I have fair chances of getting in, but no ability to cure him of any such thing.
Laura: What if Keyleth, who can do it, polymorphed into a fly or a very small creature, traveled on you, you snuck in, she popped out, did the thing. Money.
Sam: (laughs) Unless they're caught, in which case, you've got two of our members against the entire palace guard.
Laura: So then you go with them and Dimension Door out.
Sam: I didn't even want to face the little invisible thing downstairs!
Orion: Why don't we hold a special dinner?
Sam: He hates our fucking guts.
Travis: Why don't we let Seeker Asum finish?
Sam: Seeker Asum, in your opinion, is it safer to try and heal him or to try and clear our name through the traditional legal means?
Matt: "Honestly, I have no idea. I think this plan, if successful, is quite inspired. However, failure would probably end in the immediate incarceration and/or death of both individuals involved. Public execution does not befit the country-wide name of Vox Machina, if you were to fail. If you were to succeed, that would be the most direct route between two points."
Marisha: So are we in agreement that we have to clear Uriel's mind first?
Sam: No. No, the other option is to clear our names and not worry about clearing his mind.
Laura: Uriel, if he's got his mind controlled, it doesn't matter if we try to clear our names, he's going to find us guilty.
Sam: But during our trial, we will have a direct line of sight to him, we might be able to get through to him.
Liam: Does he still trust Allura?
Matt: "As far as I know, yes."
Travis: You know, if we kill the Briarwoods, is this even a point?
Sam: That's true. He doesn't trust Allura, she wasn't even allowed in the room to talk to us. There's definitely suspicion there, right?
Liam: He did. He did question her allegiances.
Matt: "If that's the case, then perhaps her current power is not as strong in the council when regarding you. But she is still a member of the council, should she not be immediately affiliated with you for her purposes. This is up to you. Whatever you choose to do, if it requires my aid, I will give it a day before I have to leave. My next intent is to head-- well, I wish to go past the eastern curtain set up by Whitestone into Wildemount. I have spent the better part of the past day since the cleansing seeking all records of the Briarwoods and their doings. There was a period of about eight years in which there is no public record of their goings-on. It appears that most records that deal with their involvement in Wildemount, and whatever homestead gave them their title, Lord and Lady Briarwood, has all been but erased. So I intend to go to the source, Wildemount itself, and research. This will take me some time, of course."
Orion: When do you plan on leaving?
Matt: "Sooner the better. I was thinking tomorrow."
Marisha: Is Percy here? Is Percy in the room?
Matt: Percy is not even here. Percy is down in the workshop.
Marisha: I go get Percy.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: I was going to be at the door.
Marisha: Oh. I come around the corner, and I see Percy.
Matt: As you come around the corner, Percy is currently leaning up against the side of the wall, listening in to the conversation.
Marisha: Hey! I was looking for you. You want to come and actually join the conversation for once, instead of sitting outside the door and just listening to them? Because I really feel like this is going to be your time to input and maybe really help?
Taliesin: I don't feel like doing that. Oh. Lead on.
Marisha: Okay.
Travis: Seeker Asum, we have managed to capture and keep one of the coachmen. Down in our cell. Would he be safer in our hands, or within the castle walls?
Marisha: Percy and I walk in.
Travis: I'm fucking asking.
Matt: "Well, that depends. If you have strong defenses, and the enemy has no means of entering, then he will be safer here. The palace itself is a very well-protected area; however, there currently is an open invitation into the palace, and if the essence of our enemy is as I think it is, then they can enter whenever they like."
Travis: Never mind.
Liam: I think we're really choosing between two paths here. Either we stay in town and tinker and gamble, or we're runaways.
Sam: Runaways? No, we go to the Briarwoods--
Liam: That's what I'm talking about. The minute we leave, we're outlaws. They've told us not to go.
Orion: We can leave, we just cannot flee. We can travel as we see fit. We just need to let them know where we're going.
Liam: Yeah, but we can't tell them 'we're going to check out your associates'.
Travis: Yeah, we lie.
Marisha: Wait, what's the name of the town?
Sam: Whitestone?
Marisha: Not Whitestone. Oh, I thought he was saying he was going to go to their hometown.
Matt: He's going to Wildemount, the kingdom that they're originally from. The continent to the far east.
Marisha: He's not going to Whitestone. He's going to go to Wildemount, which is on another continent. If we go to another continent, it doesn't matter if we're fleeing or not. It's going to look like fleeing.
Travis: Why are you going to Wildemount, again?
Matt: "I'm trying to find as much information to incriminate them in case whatever you're attempting does not work."
Orion: Seeker, would you mind staying for a week or so before your venture? We need time to convince the council to let us leave without conflict and to procure particular items and things that we need. Very briefly. Would just take some time.
Matt: "I have already made arrangements for travel. I could try, but depends on what you need me here for."
Travis: What do we need him here for?
Orion: Ultimately, protection or a good ear.
Marisha: Do you genuinely think they're going to let us go with permission? We're not on their good side.
Laura: No, they're not. They're not going to let us go.
Liam: We're going to be outlaws. We have to clear ourselves by ending the charm on Uriel by finishing off Sylas.
Sam: Or by killing the Briarwoods, thus ending the charm.
Liam: Sylas Briarwood.
Matt: "So that would be a way to clear your name and clear his head."
Travis: Let's do that.
Sam: Percival--
Orion: What of eight days instead of two weeks? Oh, sorry.
Sam: Percival, what do you think we should do? Go seek revenge on your family and get some blood on our hands, Briarwood blood? Or do the sneaky thing and try to--
Laura: Please, we need your input.
Marisha: You know them better than anyone.
Taliesin: I really don't. I think we're here because I wasn't prepared.
Marisha: Can I do an insight check on him? See if he knows more than what he's saying?
Matt: Sure.
Marisha: 19.
Matt: You can go ahead and roll a d20.
Marisha: Is that a nine?
Taliesin: Nine.
Matt: Is there anything you're holding back?
Taliesin: Nope.
Matt: He seems clear as day, telling the honest truth.
Liam: I don't think we're here in this city to become lords and ladies serving Uriel, as good a man he is. I think Percival's our ally, and this is a grievous wrong done to him, and we can kill two birds with one stone.
Taliesin: I think we are in the situation we're in because we now know how much we don't know. How much I don't know. I'm not prepared. If we face them now, I'm going to get you all killed.
Orion: I agree. We need proper preparation. Percy, I'm pretty sure you have a good background on vampires and what-have-you, as do I, as I've researched them in the last couple of days. There's other things that we should research, as well, and probably arm ourselves for that kind of conflict, if it comes to it. Quite frankly, I have a feeling if it's the whole town we're dealing with, we need to find out how many innocents there are to save, and if the number is low enough, we can fly in with an army ourselves, which would take some time. The Draconian Knights. I am an ambassador to Draconia, officially, after all the assistance I've sent, in giving them the Wheel of Mending, and proving my point.
Laura: You gave them the Wheel?
Orion: No, I showed it to them, proving that my quest was true, which they gave me full ambassadorship, which means that, if harm comes to a Stormwind, harm comes to all of Draconia. And a town full of vampires and liches--
Laura: I didn't know we had a whole army at our disposal. That's wonderful to hear.
Orion: If worse comes to worst.
Liam: Started on the bottom, now we're here.
Sam: Diplomatic immunity.
Orion: Even then, our relations must be strong with Emon. We need their allyship, as well. Draconia will not go into things alone. We need a union.
Marisha: I agree. While we're not serving Uriel, that's not our purpose, I also don't want to leave an enemy of the state. That's not good for me, for what I want.
Orion: I go up to Jarett. Eight days. What do you think of eight days?
Marisha: And what, go with Jarett? Not Jarett, Asum.
Sam: He's not even going where we would be going. We would be going to Whitestone, right? That's where the Briarwoods are.
Liam: But Keyleth, Uriel is the law, and the law is now corrupt.
Marisha: Then why don't we save his mind before we go?
Laura: Here's the thing. He's going to find out stuff about the Briarwoods. What's the fucking point of him going if we're just going to go attack the Briarwoods before we know what he knows? We need to let him go, find out his shit, take care of Uriel, wait until he gets back, go take out the Briarwoods--
Orion: As Vex is saying this, Tiberius is getting a half-chub.
Travis: A what?
Laura: A what?
Taliesin: Well, that's just weird.
Orion: You can't see it because it's inside.
Liam: Yes, but you said it out loud.
Matt: Anyway.
Orion: I'm just saying.
Sam: It's a strategy boner?
Liam: It's a strategy chub, all right.
Taliesin: I'm still weirded out.
Marisha: You've got to give context to those things, man.
Liam: It's an odd choice of words, but now 30 seconds later, I see what you mean
Orion: Sorry. Her brain. That's what I'm talking about.
Matt: Asum says, "My getting to Wildemount is not easy, nor is it safe. I cannot linger for long. Maybe a few days."
Taliesin: How soon will you return?
Matt: "That depends on if I even return. Every spy I've sent to seek information on the Briarwoods or to Whitestone has not come back."
Orion: (ripping noises) I'll give him two strips of Scroll of Telescription. If any harm falls upon you, write on this. I explain what it does.
Matt: Okay. How many of those do you have left, by the way?
Orion: I have 30 tickets left, so 28 now.
Liam: I have another idea. Uriel said that-- he was resistant, but he said that he would bring me in to have his people check me out. Check out my story. What if Keyleth and Scanlan rode in my pockets--
Sam: I'm not that small.
Laura: As roaches.
Liam: You're pretty small. Just as mice.
Laura: Or bugs. Roly-polies!
Liam: Magic user's choice. Can you cast magic when you're transformed?
Sam: No.
Laura: So they'd have to pop out. Can you shrink yourself and still do magic teeny-tiny?
Sam: Are you asking me?
Laura: Either of you.
Sam: No, but I can shit on things. Yes?
Orion: Can you give the Seeker an inspiration before he goes on an adventure?
Sam: It could last him 20 minutes, yes. Get him to the docks, maybe.
Laura: Seeker, what do you think? What was your goal of coming here?
Travis: Yeah, do you want us to come with you or what?
Matt: "My journey requires the utmost of silence, speed, stealth, and I mean no offense to your entourage, but I think I can do this alone, and should. However, this journey may take me two weeks, a month, many months-- I do not know. I'm doing this just in case whatever you're choosing to do fails. At least, if Vox Machina falls in this, I can come back with proof enough to try, and once the army has been gathered, perhaps we can rally all of Emon against Whitestone."
Travis: If you die, can you write a letter and sign your name saying that we were right, you were wrong, you were full of shit, the Briarwoods are assholes--
Orion: But a lot more eloquently than that.
Travis: Or not.
Matt: "I can try my best."
Laura: That would be lovely.
Marisha: I go up to his arm, and I Druidcraft a wooden armband. Make it look cool. And put that on him.
Sam: Onto Tiberius?
Marisha: No, onto Asum. Now I can scry through that. That way I can at least check in on you every once in a while. If you're okay with that?
Sam: I could've shat on him and had the same effect.
Matt: Make a persuasion roll.
Laura: What about being invisible? Can you cast spells while you're invisible?
Orion: Only with Greater Invisibility, you can.
Marisha: 21.
Sam: We've always sought out the path of the most glory, and I think that that is the Briarwoods. Going into a giant, vampire-lich-ridden castle and killing two evil bastards amid their army of protectors is the coolest thing we could ever do.
Laura: It's super-duper cool. Here's the thing it's not going to be just two, I don't think. It's going to be an entire town of people that they've controlled.
Sam: You think we can get into Sovereign Uriel without anyone detecting magic on us? He's got clerics all round him--
Laura: Yeah, but Seeker Asum knows all the ins and outs of the palace.
Liam: He's leaving town tomorrow.
Laura: We'd have to do it stat, but he knows how to get in.
Marisha: He did say it was an inspired idea. His words.
Matt: "Regardless, you have to make a choice soon. I cannot dilly-dally. I'll take your band, yes." He takes the wooden band and puts it around his arm and says, "If this will put you at ease, I'll take it."
Marisha: Don't worry. I won't abuse it, I promise. Could you potentially help us with sneaking in the castle?
Matt: "I could get you in the door, but I could not escort you to that room. That would put myself in extreme danger and the entirety of our mission."
Laura: Could you distract people?
Matt: (laughs) "I can do that quite well, yes."
Sam: We can get there, but something tells me we're still going to be fighting a big fight in a palace. I'd rather fight that big fight in the Briarwoods'.
Liam: Scanlan and I are in agreement, and here's the problem. If things go south in Uriel's palace, we are then forced to fight against people who are good and true, or give up and go to jail, which sucks.
Sam: But in the Briarwoods', we can kill every motherfucker in that place.
Orion: There are a number of innocents that we need to figure out, still.
Marisha: What if we talk to Allura?
Sam: You killed an old lady!
Orion: She attacked us! And I will not back down from that decision.
Sam: She did have an old lady smell.
Travis: All right. Can we just vote on something, please? Since Percy's being oh-so-quiet about all this.
Marisha: Percy is being very quiet about this.
Travis: Are you sure you have nothing to say?
Laura: It's fucking your family. It's the people that attacked your family. Do you have no contribution to this?
Taliesin: I still feel I owe everybody an apology. I still feel terrible about dragging you all into this and putting you in danger.
Laura: We're choosing to do it.
Matt: "Vengeance." A voice whispers in your ear, Percy. No one hears this. "Vengeance."
Taliesin: If you're with me, we can be prepared for them this time. We know enough to prepare ourselves, we can have ourselves ready this time.
Orion: How many days do we have? I would like eight days to prepare.
Marisha: Can I see if he looks like shaken or fucked up at all?
Matt: I mean, he looks shaken and fucked up, yeah. He's obviously had a horrible few days.
Taliesin: I think a week to prepare is reasonable.
Laura: And then leave.
Taliesin: And then we leave. We leave quietly.
Marisha: Wait, we're leaving to Whitestone?
Travis: Yes.
Laura: Yes.
Taliesin: I've been avoiding it for too long, and now I know too much.
Liam: The law of this land is compromised. Percival, I agree with you. I think this is the right choice.
Travis: All in favor, say aye.
All - orion: Aye.
Travis: All opposed, say nay. Nice.
Matt: "Then it is settled. I'll be on my way."
Laura: Wait! Before you go, could I talk to you?
Matt: "Certainly."
Laura: Were you going to say anything else? Because I'll talk to you in private.
Matt: "Three days and I'll be off on my side of the mission. Very well."
Laura: I'll follow you out.
Matt: Yes, and he walks out, walks with you.
Taliesin: Hold on, I'm going to hold you before you go. I just wanted to say, I'm so sorry and thank you. And thank you for doing this for me. I fear my temper before this weight is lifted from my heart. I do not wish to lose myself like that again, and I am so sorry for everything I've done.
Orion: Tiberius puts his hand on Percy's shoulder, and go, I'm sorry for the tragedy which is your family, and what these Briarwoods have befallen to them, and I will promise you, I will do my best to have you give that final blow from that barrel to the names assigned to them. But now it is a far dangerous situation, as you very well know.
Taliesin: I will do my best to maintain myself. I apologize.
Matt: And as you all scatter, Percy, as you walk out, the same voice creeps into your ear, "Yes." Now, as you step out with Seeker Asum, who now has a bit of haste to his step, arms crossed, looking around. "So you wish to speak with me?"
Laura: Yes, I do. You're a ranger.
Matt: "I am."
Laura: You're very sneaky.
Matt: "I can be."
Laura: I've only ever seen people like thieves, like my brother, do things like you've done. Can you teach me anything that you know to help me maybe be a little more stealthy, as well?
Matt: (sighs) "We'll go over what you know, and perhaps there are a few tricks that I can teach you in the three days I have. I can't guarantee that it'll be extremely changing, as that's a very short time to train over what I've learned over a lifetime, but I can certainly attempt."
Laura: I appreciate it.
Matt: "I require your concentration for those days, though, before I leave."
Laura: Utmost.
Matt: "All right. Meet me at the morrow, crack of dawn. I'll be at the front of your keep."
Laura: Okay.
Matt: "Very well." And he heads off, outside of the keep. The rest of you, what are you doing?
Orion: I go to my laboratory.
Marisha: What time is it?
Matt: About 3 00, 4 00 in the afternoon now.
Travis: That temple of Sarenrae is in the city.
Matt: It's part of the keep, yeah. Oh, you mean the actual temple you went to? That is inside the city, yes. You can go into the city; you just can't get to the Cloudtop District.
Orion: Use the earring real quick. I'm going to write a quick letter. If anybody goes shopping, let me know.
Matt: Tiberius loves shopping.
Laura: He really, really does.
Matt: All right, we'll go ahead and take a quick break. We'll be back in five minutes. Keep it a stringent break, guys.
Liam: So errands will happen after that break? Because I have some errands that I want to do.
Matt: Yes. We'll try to keep the errands pretty concise so we can keep on schedule, yeah, so it's like, use this break to conjecture exactly what you want to do. All right, guys, we'll see you back here in five minutes. [break]
Matt: Welcome back. So to try and expedite this, over the next period of time you guys want to take to prepare, what are you going to do? Percy.
Taliesin: I'm going to finish up those things that we talked about earlier, spend some time making some ammunition, and I'm going to attempt to build what we were talking about earlier.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and make a tinkering check for your ammunition.
Marisha: What we were talking about? Can I help him with that? Can I assist him?
Matt: I would say the tinkering, the mechanisms involved, would be so far beyond your understanding as a druid. Even just metalwork in general. You can cheer him on, but would not be able to assist him with it.
Marisha: Go Percy, go! That's pretty good.
Taliesin: 24.
Matt: 24? Okay. You manage to produce 25 rounds for your Pepperbox and ten rounds for the Bad News.
Laura: Ooh, that's good.
Marisha: You still have inspiration from Scanlan?
Taliesin: No, I used that.
Matt: Used that to repair his Pepperbox. Roll for the secondary construction. Smoke bombs.
Taliesin: Okay. 11.
Matt: 11. You take a better part of two days attempting to get these to work, and most of your materials are ruined, unfortunately. You manage to come out with it with, and I want you to write this down, "smoke bomb, question mark." It may function. We will see upon use. But you have one at your disposal that is questionable. However, for the cost of the ammunition and the cost of the smoke bomb's construction, already that comes to about, I'd say 75 gold pieces, so mark that off. And you're attempting to make, you're attempting to make, based on what you told me, an Archimedes death ray.
Taliesin: They're not hard. I say that as, like, knowing my actual skill level, I could make one.
Matt: You could. To be functional with the materials that are at your disposal, it's going to be very large and hard to move.
Marisha: We were talking about making it collapsible.
Taliesin: I could make a collapsible one, where it's basically a one-third dodecahedron, like an observatory.
Matt: You spend the remainder of this week of preparation. Go ahead and roll your tinkering check. This is going to cost you in materials.
Orion: Wait, hold on, can I pause real quick? You don't need to do this if you want to make more ammo and other stuff. I can do this without you making this and spending the rest of the time, if you want to make other stuff. Option.
Matt: What do you want to do?
Taliesin: Story-wise it's more amusing.
Matt: Okay, go for it. All right, so. The actual materials for this--
Taliesin: It's copper.
Matt: I know, it's copper, but the actual dodecahedron that's involved, the mirrors, the lenses, the whole thing? In order to be of the scale and quality to even make it even remotely functional, all of it for the extremely high quality and some of it custom-made within the first couple days within this, with a rush order. I'd say the total cost is going to come to about 1,200 gold pieces.
Marisha: I'll pitch in for that. How much do you have?
Taliesin: At this point I have less than 100 gold.
Marisha: You have less than 100 gold? I'll pay for it in full.
Orion: What is the diameter of this?
Matt: The actual focal lens is about this big. The whole construct can be carried by two people.
Taliesin: But it will fold.
Orion: I was just going to say, what's the radius of the actual thing's lens?
Matt: Of the lens itself? This is the radius of the lens. I mean, even when it's collapsed, it can be carried by one person, but it's still a heavy mechanism.
Orion: So it's only one foot? Two feet? Three feet?
Matt: I'd say it's about two and a half feet in diameter.
Orion: Are you sure you want to do that?
Matt: He's already agreed. Go ahead and roll.
Marisha: Why? It's fine. This is what we were talking about.
Taliesin: 22.
Matt: 22. Through the materials and the construct of it, you get partway through the final stages of it, and as you're tightening one of the sections, all of a sudden there's a (cracking) sound. Your whole body freezes as you glance over. the lens itself has a giant crack through it.
Taliesin: There shouldn't be a glass piece-- aw, man.
Matt: For the construct for this one, there was a focusing lens that is part of what the initial blast, otherwise there wouldn't be a point of actually projecting a ray from.
Orion: I thought they were all mirrors.
Matt: There's all different sorts of construction based on. This one's the one we're going on here, or if you can say the center of it is a gem, but regardless, the tinkering roll was not high enough to construct the device. Sorry.
Marisha: The whole thing's wasted? Can we try and repair the crack?
Matt: It's not something you can repair. The entire piece is constructed from a solid piece.
Taliesin: What, could we put it on the Mending Wheel?
Matt: You could attempt to.
Orion: (grunting) Let's see. Okay. (clicking noise)
Travis: I want to go to the store. I would like to get a shovel and a pickaxe.
Orion: You going to Gilmore's? We're going to Gilmore's, too. We could go together if you're doing that.
Travis: I don't give a fuck where we go. Just a shovel and a pickaxe.
Matt: Pickaxe... comes to four gold pieces for the two of those. You got them. Make a secondary tinkering check.
Taliesin: 22.
Matt: 22. This time you go back and as you're tightening it, the actual metal housing of the device ends up bending in a way that both cracks the gem and causes the frame itself to be dented to the point where the beam will be imperfect. This is a very hard thing that you've come up with in your mind that has not been constructed before, and the level of difficulty to create this is very difficult. It does not cost you additional money, thanks to the Mending Wheel, but right now the entire device looks like to continue, it's going to take more time and money to construct it.
Taliesin: (sighs) I can always use this for spare parts for other things.
Laura: You're already 1,200 in? How much more would you have to put in?
Matt: I'd say about half the cost. An additional 600.
Marisha: And how many more days?
Matt: Two more days.
Marisha: How many more days do we have?
Matt: You agreed upon eight, so we'd be pushing about seven, then.
Taliesin: I've already built a smoke bomb and some rounds of bullets. All right, I'll put a little more time in this. Can I get some inspiration for this, too, if that would be possible?
Liam: Music, you mean?
Marisha: There's nothing I can do to help him?
Matt: Unfortunately-- what's your intellect?
Marisha: My intellect? I've got plus three.
Sam: (singing) Here comes the sun--
All: (singing) It's all right. (vocalizing)
Liam: (singing) Kill the vampire.
Marisha: Come on, come on.
Taliesin: Come on, come on.
Marisha: Percy roll. Come on.
Taliesin: 23?
Matt: Working on the device a third time, you get it right to the point where you think it could work and you go to set it up, and as you do, you find that the light focuses in a way that actually slowly melts the copper on the outside of the housing of the device, and it begins to melt onto itself, and you have to pull it out of the light. This design is beyond your grasp right now. You're inventing something that takes quite a lot of time to eventually perfect.
Taliesin: Okay. I'm going to put these away for a later time, and if I have one more day, I would like to work on--
Marisha: Maybe a version of it that is not collapsible that we can at least mount?
Taliesin: We've got it taken care of.
Matt: That's been your guys' week.
Taliesin: That's my week, okay.
Matt: Okay. You bought your pickaxe and your shovel. Cool. Vex, what are you doing?
Laura: I'm training.
Matt: You're training, okay.
Liam: All right. I want to be brief. I have four things I want to do, but I'll be very brief. I promise. Okay, so first thing I want to do is I think at some point, I heard Tiberius talking about wooden stakes and vampires. So I want to go buy about ten wooden stakes.
Orion: I give him extra. Get me 20.
Liam: I'm going shopping.
Laura: Yes, get me some holy arrows.
Liam: Can I get a loaner on that? I've got about 230 gold.
Travis: I thought you said you were going to be brief. (laughs)
Liam: On my own.
Marisha: I thought we got a bit of an allowance.
Liam: It's a week, so I get some gold from these people and I go and I don't even know what they said. I'm getting ten wooden stakes for myself.
Matt: 20, technically, because Tiberius requested ten. Those will cost you a total of two gold.
Liam: That's what I thought. And what did you want?
Laura: I wanted some holy arrows.
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Laura: Or holy water. Try to get some holy water. Holy oil.
Liam: I'll get to that. Investigation, you say? That is a 13.
Matt: 13. Asking around the town  holy arrows, that is an enchantment. They're pricey and they don't appear to be anywhere in the major shops, even shops like Gilmore's, that they specialize in. It's usually a special order-type thing. Holy water flasks can be purchased at 20 gold apiece.
Liam: I'll get to that. All right, so we got wood. That was two gold, you said. All right, minus two. The next thing I want to do is go to the temple of Sarenrae and get my sister's holy oil for her. How much is that?
Matt: Holy oil? As opposed to the holy water?
Liam: I'll take both, if you've got it.
Matt: Well, holy oil is a more expensive version. Holy water is a one-use. Holy oil can be applied to a weapon.
Liam: Holy oil.
Orion: How much do the stakes weigh? Like each stake?
Matt: A cluster of ten, if that's what you wanted, would weigh about five pounds. But they're relatively light.
Orion: Tell him that he bought me 20 more.
Sam: Tell him that he bought you?
Liam: 40 stakes, four gold. Totally happened. Then I went to the temple of Sarenrae and I got two vials of holy oil. One for my sister, one for me.
Matt: Those are 100 gold apiece.
Liam: Okay. Got it. I can't. Oh, you gave me gold. I'll get four vials of that.
Laura: Yeah, I gave him gold to do it.
Liam: We'll work that out, I promise. I ask if the cleric who helped bring Pike back to life is here.
Matt: Yeah, Tristan is here.
Liam: Jesus, how do you do that?
Matt: Because I have to.
Liam: When I find him I say, you remember my friend Pike? You remember me?
Matt: "Yes, I inspected you. Is that healing well, by the way?" He inspects the wounds on the side of your neck.
Liam: It is. I'm grateful. I need a keepsake of your deity. [no audio]
Matt: And he steps away, goes back, disappears for a minute, comes back and he's holding in a chain around his neck-- It's seen some years of use, but still clean and very well kept, an identical holy symbol of Sarenrae as the one that Pike keeps around her neck. He hands it over and puts it over your head. "May she keep you safe and bring your soul to redemption."
Liam: It reminds me of my friend.
Matt: "As it should." Pats you on the cheek. "As it should."
Liam: All right, so chore number two down. I would like to go to Uriel's temple and ask the guards if anyone has seen my belt, Simon.
Matt: You are stopped at the edge of the Cloudtop District. The guards see you as you approach and block the doorway and say, "We're sorry, but Vox Machina has been given no passage into the Cloudtop District at this time."
Liam: I understand. I don't mean to go in. I understand that we caused a lot of trouble, and I am very sorry, and I don't mean to be any further trouble. There is a belt that I left inside.
Matt: "That's certainly unfortunate, isn't it?"
Liam: Have you seen a snake called Simon? Or any snake?
Matt: Both the guards look at each other and laugh for a second. "Piss off."
Liam: Okay. Chore number four. (laughter)
Liam: I go back. I give everybody their things. I would like to spend the rest of the week, because I am ready, hanging out across the road from the butcher's house that Kynan ran from, and if there are any youths his age who go there to shop, I would like to ask as they leave if they have any idea where he's gone.
Matt: Okay. Make a perception check.
Liam: Perception check. Oh, that's a seven. Thought it was a one. (laughs) That is a 17.
Matt: 17. Okay. Keeping an eye out, you do eventually come across a boy that looks about his age. Late teens, maybe early twenties. Comes by and gathers a little bit of meat and rushes off and you stop him.
Liam: Excuse me, I'm sorry to take you away from your day. I'm sorry, what is your name?
Matt: "Jameson."
Liam: Jameson.
Matt: "Yeah, can I help you? I've really got to get home with this."
Liam: I understand, I'll just take a second of your time. I owe a boy who lives here named Kynan, I owe him a few silver and I want to see that he gets it. Is he in town?
Matt: Make a deception check.
Liam: I'll use the meteorite. That's a 15.
Matt: 15, gives you a look over and goes, "I'm certain you've given him silver, but Kynan's been gone for the better part of a week."
Liam: Where would he have gone?
Matt: "I don't know. He just told us all he was off to find his destiny or some sort of bullshit like that. He's always had his head in the clouds, that one."
Liam: I agree. He ever talked about where he was going, how he meant to go about doing it?
Matt: "No, kept to himself mostly. Sorry, I wish I could be more of a service. If I see him, where should I send him?" (clattering)
Liam: I don't know who that guy is. If you see him, tell him that V. is looking for him at Greyskull Keep.
Matt: "Well, I'll pass that along."
Liam: Thank you.
Matt: "Good day," and he hurries off to continue with his errand.
Liam: Are you all right, old man?
Travis: (old-man voice) I'm fine. It's my knee. (laughter)
Matt: Is that your last errand?
Liam: That's it.
Matt: Scanlan.
Sam: I go to Gilmore's. Are we near Gilmore's?
Matt: Yeah, Gilmore's in the city. He's not in the Cloudtop, so you have access to him still.
Sam: I want to know if such a thing exists, and if so, how much. A potion or a scroll that could invoke either Hallow or Spirit Guardians.
Taliesin: Say what?
Sam: Spirit Guardians is four. Hallow is five.
Matt: Here we go. Okay. Asking around, there are no potions for it, but there is a Scroll of Hallow available, and I will say that comes to roughly 6,000 gold pieces for the Scroll of Hallow.
Marisha: It's how much?
Matt: 6,000 for the Hallow Scroll. And for the Spirit Guardian, you said it was? 4th-level?
Sam: 4th-level.
Matt: That one is 2,000 gold.
Laura: What does that do?
Sam: Spirit Guardians would make some beings around us.
Matt: Spirit Guardians is level three, actually, not level four. That makes it a lot cheaper. That is 600 gold.
Sam: It scares evil things away. It's like a Pike-y thing.
Laura: Do it.
Sam: Can I cast that if I have a scroll?
Matt: If you have a scroll you can, yeah. It has a chance of failing.
Marisha: Yeah, you have to have magic.
Sam: How much did you say?
Matt: 600 gold pieces.
Sam: I'll buy one of those.
Matt: There's only one available. So you mark that down.
Sam: Okay. Yes, I will. I would also like to find a smithy of some sort and make me a little metal choker of chainmail.
Matt: Okay, remembering that you have spoken to Karin before, which is the renowned custom blacksmith in Emon, you speak with her. A chainmail half coif around the neck there is relatively inexpensive. It's a partial piece of armor. She looks at some scrap chainmail on the side and is like: "I'd be more than happy to use that for it. It shouldn't me take more than an hour, two maybe at most."
Laura: Get one for everyone.
Travis: I think they can bite besides the neck, right?
Laura: Yeah, technically, but still!
Sam: (laughs) Sure, I'll get eight of them, or seven of them.
Matt: Okay. (laughs) All right.
Sam: How much are they?
Matt: Seven of those. I'd say for the whole seven it'd put you at 100 gold, because it's custom orders. Seven of those.
Liam: What are they?
Sam: Chainmail chokers
Marisha: Chainmail dickies.
Travis: Oh wait, do you have one more?
Sam: And a small one for my dick. (laughter)
Matt: All righty.
Sam: A tiny one.
Matt: She awkwardly judges and turns that request down. She's uncomfortable with that.
Sam: Then I bow and leave.
Matt: Okay. So you got that. Yes. Just a second there, Tiberius.
Liam: I go to Gilmore's Glorious Goods and ask at the front door if Gilmore is there.
Matt: Gilmore, unfortunately, is in Westruun currently. Still overseeing the construction of his expansion there.
Liam: Understood. Who's the most knowledgeable person next to Gilmore in this store right now?
Matt: That would be... I can't find my updated NPC sheet. Do you remember what her name was?
Marisha: Sherri.
Matt: Sherri, thank you. I was like, Shelby? No. Sherri. Sherri is there greeting you. "That would probably be me."
Liam: Oh, hi. You remember me. I have a very important question. I won't take up much of your time. I pull out a small metal skull cap. Dented in a few places, rusted a bit, from the Underdark. What can you tell me about this?
Matt: She takes it. "If you're requesting identification of a magical item, that is a service we charge."
Liam: Sis, can I borrow some money?
Laura: How much do you need?
Liam: How much would that require?
Matt: "125 gold pieces per enchantment identified."
Liam: Done.
Matt: "All right."
Laura: Talk her down.
Matt: She takes it. She steps inside, sets it on the counter. She starts going through her books and starts looking at it and holding it for a second and doing a full inspection of it. "Based on the enchantment on this device, it's very crude in construction and the enchantment is in an arcane offshoot of language I'm not very familiar with, but it appears it is a guard from some sort of a mental influence. If worn, it would give you a stronger resistance against things that would attempt to peer into your mind."
Liam: Are we talking magic?
Matt: "Yes." So essentially what it would do is it would give you advantage on wisdom saving throws against magic spells.
Liam: Against?
Matt: It would give you advantage on wisdom saving throws against magical effects.
Liam: That's fucking brilliant. I hand her the gold and say, Scanlan sends his regards.
Matt: She noticeably blushes and goes, "Well, send mine back if you wouldn't mind. I've got work to do." And she rushes off.
Liam: Thank you.
Matt: All right. Now, Tiberius.
Sam: 16 errands.
Orion: I only have eight. Just kidding, no. The real quick one is going to the Temple of Sarenrae to pick up a canteen.
Matt: Okay. Did you pay for it already? You paid up front. Okay. So you get the canteen, the explanation is: the enchantment of the actual water creation itself is separate than the holy enchantment that has been attached to it. The holy enchantment is not very powerful because it is an enchanted item. How it functions is the first burst per day that you use of the water does an additional 1d6 radiant damage. That's it. But any additional after that is just water. Basically, whatever water is immediately contained within it at the start of the day is considered blessed. Once that's expelled, all the rest that it creates-- because it's pulling it out of the elemental plane of water; that's how it's continuously projecting it. The rest of it runs straight through, so it doesn't have a chance to even absorb the blessing.
Orion: Gotcha. Okay, cool. Second thing. I drop off my Swallow, or I'll call it the surge blade, and to have that enchanted on both ends.
Matt: With?
Orion: One side fire, the other side water. So however many mages I have to hire for that to happen in ten days, I think we talked about it being eight days or something like that? Or was that only one side?
Matt: (laughs) So what enchantment do you want? Do you want to just do an additional-- What do you want it to be?
Orion: I just want it to be a magical weapon.
Matt: Just a magical weapon? Okay, just a general plus-one magical weapon. Okay. That would take about-- let me double-check the rarity here.
Sam: In the meantime, check out those Critical Role keychains available on Geek and Sundry. (laughter)
Matt: That would run you approximately 700 gold to create it as a plus-one magical item. Would take one mage a week to do it.
Orion: Okay. So I'll do that.
Matt: Okay, so for the week it takes, you pay 700 gold pieces. Your quarterstaff with a couple of daggers tied to the end is now considered a plus-one magical weapon. (laughter)
Orion: I stop at Gilmore's and I drop off my Ring of Protection. And pay whatever that is to add a plus-one to make it instead of a minor, an actual Ring of Protection.
Matt: Unfortunately, the thing is, an enchantment cannot be progressively enhanced. You would have to disenchant and then re-enchant the entire thing.
Orion: I thought Gilmore said they could do that there, before. That's why I was going to cough up the green for the Gil, as it were.
Matt: No. They can enchant the item with it, but it would be the cost of basically re-enchanting the item.
Orion: How much would that be?
Matt: That would cost approximately 25,000 gold pieces.
Sam: Oh jeez.
Matt: And it would take the better part of a year. A plus-two Ring of Protection is a very powerful item.
Sam: It's worth it. It's a good investment.
Matt: That you even acquired one earlier was great luck.
Orion: How about buffing the ring of source spelling--
Matt: The Ring of Spell Storing?
Sam: The thing that I had that I still want. That one.
Matt: The Ring of Spell Storing? That's its enchantment. There is no more powerful version of the Ring of Spell Storing. If you wanted to attempt to do that yourself on your own time, you could. That will cost you upward 60,000 gold pieces and about a year.
Orion: No, not right now.
Laura: How about we stick to the level we're at?
Orion: I didn't know all that stuff was going to be that way. That's why I asked.
Liam: How do you learn if you don't ask?
Matt: It's good to ask these things.
Orion: (laughs) So okay. While the days are going, I want to roll for animal handling to teach Lockheed stuff, which is every morning, whatever.
Matt: I'll say throughout the week, 'cause you've taught Lockheed a lot of things back to back. You can't cram everything in there in the three to four days and like: "You learn everything!" Because you've already taught Lockheed one thing this week. Roll for a second thing you want to teach Lockheed.
Orion: Like, with advantage? I'm just having fun.
Matt: Sure, I'll give you advantage on that.
Orion: That's fine, that's fine. I'll take that. That's 17.
Matt: Roll advantage. Go for it.
Orion: 17.
Travis: For the sake of brevity, can I roll one beard check?
Matt: Yeah. You can roll several beard checks.
Travis: 43.
Matt: 43. It starts filling in.
Travis: 81.
Matt: Nope.
Travis: 86.
Liam: Aw, come on Grog.
Travis: 16.
Matt: 16.
Travis: 68, 19. 58.
Matt: Okay. So by the time the week comes to an end, the other side of your beard has finally filled in and you are back to a full beard, Grog.
Laura: Good job, Grog.
Matt: So yeah, that succeeds. It takes you a few days to get it though, but what do you want to teach Lockheed?
Orion: I want to teach him to be quiet.
Matt: A very important thing to teach a creature. So Lockheed has learned to be quiet. Good. Anything else?
Orion: Yes. I got that, that. Throughout the days, I'm going to go all the shops and see how many glass mirrors-- I'm looking for mirrors, just all kinds of mirrors, every size.
Matt: There are plenty of mirrors out there. There are general stores that sell them all over.
Orion: I'm looking for five-by-five to ten-by-ten size mirrors.
Sam: Feet?!
Orion: Yeah. No, inches.
Matt: Okay. I misunderstood. Yeah. You could've had them custom made if they weren't out there, but they have mirrors of that size available.
Orion: I need about 1,500 of them. Can I get 1,500? How many can I get?
Matt: There aren't that many mirrors in the city.
Orion: Okay. All of them.
Sam: You know, if you hold two next to each other there looks like there's a million of them.
Orion: You know what, that's true.
Matt: They're five gold apiece, and of what is currently available for purchase, you may be able to acquire about 35 mirrors, and you'll clean out most of the places that will stop selling them to you.
Liam: That's cutting-edge technology in this day and age.
Orion: How many, if I laid them out on a flat surface, how many-- (laughs) How many feet would that cover?
Liam: Well, two per foot, Tibs. They're five inches apiece, right? You can fit two in a foot. So you just bought 35, so that's about--
Laura: 17 feet! 17 whole feet of mirrors!
Sam: If you're doing a square, it's three feet by three feet.
Matt: Yeah, four by four. So there you go. Four by four.
Orion: I'll take all that. How much is that?
Matt: Okay. 35 times five. So we're looking at 175 gold.
Orion: Done. And then, for timeline stuff, I'm going to do as much as I can to start enchanting my bolts, and I'm going to go work with Keyleth on stuff.
Matt: Keyleth's been working with Percy this whole time.
Marisha: The whole time?
Matt: It's taken the entire week for him, you said you were assisting him.
Marisha: No, you said I couldn't assist him. I had no intelligence to assist him.
Matt: I thought you said you were still going to help cheer him on. Okay, then no worries. Then yeah, you're available.
Orion: I'm going to try to make as many sleep bolts as I can. But the other thing with Keyleth is I would like to enchant a bolt that is a smoke screen, but it consists of holy water. So I use a pour of the day from the canteen and use that as a mist instead of a smoke.
Matt: The enchantment of an arrow to do that is the use of a Fog spell. There is no way to infuse a Fog spell with holy water.
Marisha: That's what I was saying. I don't know if you can do holy water. I can do a Fog spell.
Orion: Can we infuse a Fog spell with a Sleep spell?
Matt: No.
Orion: Can we try super hard?
Matt: Sure. Make a roll.
Orion: God damn it. Okay.
Marisha: Like, the best I could possibly do is maybe take one of these holy water things.
Orion: What am I rolling?
Matt: Plus arcana.
Travis: Do you think it matters? No.
Orion: 24.
Matt: 24. Okay. After spending approximately 500 gold in materials, the enchantment fails, both spells fizzled. You lost 500 gold. But now you know. Probably can't combine two spells into a single enchantment.
Liam: And knowing is half the battle.
Orion: Don't worry, it came out of my pocket.
Sam: I've got fog.
Orion: Okay.
Travis: How about you get nothing else, and we move on?
Orion: Last thing.
Travis: No last thing.
Orion: I stop at Allura's.
Matt: You go towards the Cloudtop District, and the guards stop you again.
Orion: I remember that as I walk up, and I go back to Greyskull Keep.
Matt: All right.
Marisha: Oh wait, I don't do that.
Orion: Oh wait, I don't do that.
Marisha: #OrionAcaba.
Orion: I realize what I'm doing, and I stop.
Liam: Also. This will just take ten seconds, at some point in the week, when Keyleth is taking a walk, I go into her garden, and I clip one flower, and I take it.
Matt: How many sleep bolts?
Liam: Go sleep in your money.
Orion: You said I could do that.
Taliesin: You're busy this week.
Sam: Can he get back to the keep and we've all left four days ago? (laughter)
Orion: Carrying groceries in, look, guys  hoagie stuff!
Sam: Dear Tiberius. We left.
Laura: We got really bored and we left.
Matt: Okay, I will say for each arrow, it will cost you 600 gold and will take you six days to do, per arrow.
Laura: Six days per arrow?
Matt: Yes. It's one day per 100 gold of an enchantment. Which is even me making it higher than the book says. It should take you four times that.
Orion: Cool. Can it cost more if I hire a mage?
Laura: (screams)
Matt: You want to hire a mage?
Marisha: I need to do shit, too. I can't be everyone's bitch.
Matt: So three and a half days and it cost you 1,200 gold for a single sleep bolt.
Orion: Sweet. And I do two of those. And I'm broke.
Liam: He's spent people, he's spent.
Matt: Okay, so you've done all of your shopping in one day and spent the rest of the week doing those. All right, so there we go. You're broke and you have two sleep bolts on your person. Keyleth.
Marisha: I got to Gilmore's and I buy an alchemy set.
Matt: Okay. That comes to--
Sam: 95,000 gold
Orion: It's going to be a lot more than you think, apparently.
Matt: Alchemist supplies? 50 gold.
Orion: Oh, come on!
Matt: Not enchanted, yo. "It's magic, give me all the magic!"
Taliesin: This is made of things.
Marisha: This is made of things. And then I go home and I make a few Cure Wounds potions. Try it out, since I've learned and I've been studying and I've been doing my research. So maybe a few level two, level three Cure Wounds potions?
Matt: A level two healing potion, a greater healing potion. The materials involved in creating that will come to, I'd say about 400 apiece, and you'd have time to create two. It's about four days per potion.
Sam: (whispered) How much do they cost?
Matt: To purchase? They cost about 500 to 600. She's getting a discount because she's making it herself.
Marisha: Wait, they cost 500 to 600 and they cost 400 for me to make them?
Matt: Yes. It's your first time doing it. They'll probably get cheaper over time as you get better at it.
Marisha: Oh, okay. Cheaper over time as I get better at it? That's funsies. Well, let me make-- What is that? A greater healing potion?
Matt: It's a greater healing. So for each one you make, roll a d20 and add five.
Marisha: Let me make one for right now.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: That's an 18. That's pretty good.
Matt: Then yeah, you successfully create the potion. No issue.
Marisha: Awesome. I had a Percy-roll! And he hates me for it. How long will it take me to make a Daylight scroll?
Matt: A Daylight scroll? What level spell is that?
Marisha: Third.
Matt: Third? That'll cost you about, I'd say, 600 gold pieces. It'll take you six days. You don't have time. You could pay more to have somebody else help you make one if you wanted to.
Marisha: Then I make two greater healing potions. Actually, no, I want to experiment. I want to take one of those holy water bottles. And I want to see if I can enchant it with my Fog spell. To make it a holy water fog grenade. When you throw it, it'll go (shatters) with my fog spell.
Matt: You know that upon throwing the holy water, it would shatter. It would create a fog, but the holy water itself would just affect the creature you threw it at. You'd be able to blend the two enchantments; they don't necessarily mix. The fog itself is not created from the water, it's created from the glass that you're enchanting.
Laura: Plus, we didn't get any holy water, we only got holy oil to put on our weapons.
Matt: You have a couple of flasks of holy water.
Marisha: What if I enchant it with Daylight? Oh wait, it still won't--
Matt: It's a whole different thing. Daylight, that's more of a scroll thing.
Marisha: I'm going to do it, anyway. I'm going to do the fog thing, because I said it. I'm going to commit.
Matt: Okay. That will cost you-- I'll put it at 500 gold pieces. And that'll take you five days.
Orion: For a fog scroll?
Marisha: No, for the fog holy water thing. It's a holy smoke grenade.
Liam: Someday, we will get out of the character creation menu, but not this day.
Taliesin: I don't like the nose yet. It's too low.
Marisha: Sure. That'll be my two things I do.
Matt: Okay, roll another d20. Plus five.
Marisha: Natural 20.
Matt: All right. You feel the fog enchantment take shape in the glass vial. It seems relatively unstable. You gather that this glass was not meant to contain an enchantment from the get-go. You somehow manage to make it function, but you have to be very careful with that vial.
Orion: Here, put it in here.
Matt: Who knows what'll happen if it actually is thrown?
Laura: Don't put it in a Bag of Holding.
Liam: Give it to Scanlan.
Marisha: Who would like a very unstable item?
Laura: Percy's used to unstable things.
Marisha: I give it to Scanlan.
Taliesin: Was that a jab at my-- No, never mind.
Matt: It's a fog-enchanted vial of holy water. You can write it down that way if you'd like.
Sam: I'll just put it on my back. I'll just hang it.
Marisha: Please be careful. Wait, I tell him. Scanlan, this is very delicate. Please be very gentle with this.
Sam: I will put it where I put all gentle things.
Marisha: That I trust. I trust that more. Fine. Good.
Orion: You do not make the wisest decisions here your Majesty, I must say.
Matt: What was once holy-- (laughter)
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: Oh god.
Sam: I give everyone the chainmail.
Matt: Okay. You give all the chainmail.
Laura: Oh. Look at this, so fancy.
Sam: I take that fancy box I bought a couple times ago, and I take the blue crystal that we found in our very first adventure and I put it in and I seal it tight. Shit. I had one more thing I wanted to do. Oh yes, I drink my Shit-Scrying Potion, shit in a jar and leave it in the kitchen. And tell the help, don't touch it.
Matt: Okay. (laughs) It takes much convincing, but nevertheless they acquiesce to your request, being the boss. All right. Anything else?
Taliesin: Yeah. Just going to let the guards know to watch our guest while we're away. Keep him under protection.
Travis: Are we leaving him here?
Taliesin: I think so.
Laura: Oh god.
Matt: The what?
Orion: The guy who built stuff, regardless, did I do that or is that just in my head?
Matt: Lord Daxio, you mean? What about him?
Orion: So I didn't do that yet.
Travis: Yeah, you going to do something on his room, Keyleth?
Laura: I go find Jarett, and I give him 200 gold. And I say, do not let-- Desmond? Leave your side. Watch him, watch for invisible anything. Protect him with everything you can.
Matt: "I will do this with my life. Do not worry."
Sam: Have we given them a raise?
Laura: I just gave him 200 fucking gold.
Travis: Double the guard on him.
Laura: And yeah, everybody-- fuck. I give a hundred--
Sam: Five of them make 100 a month, two of them make 50 a month.
Laura: I give another 200 to him and tell him to pass it out to the rest of the guard. We'll be back soon!
Matt: "Very generous, and I think they'll be very happy to find this. Thank you very much."
Laura: And add another guard to the watch.
Travis: Two to Desmond. At all times.
Matt: "Very well. I will do this. Thank you."
Laura: Thank you.
Orion: I going to tell Erwen to go and ask for court for the lord that can construct and tell him that we would like to make some changes and have the cells converted into barracks for our soldiers.
Sam: That won't do anything.
Orion: That's what I do. That's what Tiberius does.
Matt: Okay. Erwen goes, "All right, sir." And he wanders off.
Orion: Getting a good reputation does not mean holding prison cells.
Matt: About an hour later Erwen returns and says, "I'm sorry. They would not allow me into the central district. I do not have the proper papers to pass within. I mentioned that I worked for you, and they told me I was not to enter."
Orion: Oh, maybe you should have said a different name.
Sam: They would have known when they got to our keep.
Orion: That's true. (laughs)
Laura: Shall we head out?
Taliesin: Yes.
Laura: Did I learn anything from Seeker Asum?
Matt: Go ahead and roll a d20, adding your wisdom modifier.
Laura: Ah jeez, really?
Liam: Come on, Laura.
Laura: What if I roll like shit?
Liam: Then it'll be hilarious. Roll that die. Come on. Roll high and it will be amazing.
Matt: Make it with advantage, because Asum is a very good teacher.
Laura: He is. He's so good.
Sam: He's awesome.
Laura: (fake crying) No, that was terrible.
Marisha: Advantage!
Liam: You are playing DND right now! All right.
Laura: Plus my wisdom. 17.
Matt: 17, okay.
Liam: Is she an emperor now?
Matt: (laughs) Is that how this works? All right, so talking with Asum. He works with you for a bit and teaches you the ranger ability Skirmisher's Stealth.
Sam: Skirmisher's Stealth?
Matt: So if you start one of your turns hidden from a creature, you can then, as a bonus action at the end of your turn, make another stealth check to remain hidden from them. You essentially can dive between areas and still be hidden.
Laura: While I'm attacking?
Liam: That's all ranger stuff?
Laura: Cool.
Liam: (air horn noises)
Sam: (air horn noises)
Matt: So yeah. We'll go over the details of it after the game. Essentially, you learn a new ranger ability from Seeker Asum.
Marisha: Dope.
Liam: Wow. I bought some sticks.
Matt: All right.
Orion: At the end of the first day, before all of that stuff happens. Sorry, guys, this is necessary.
Travis: Is it?
Liam: Everybody shut up and let Grog go on a one man, solo kill spree.
Travis: It's bound to happen. He's going to secede.
Matt: Tiberius, what do you want to do?
Orion: I'm in my lab the first night and I write a Scroll of Telescription to my father. And I go, dear father, and I tell him about the circumstances with the vampires.
Laura: Dear diary. Sorry.
Orion: At the end of it I go  I invoke the ambassador's right of war time as of now, and moreover as your son when I provide concrete evidence, you will know. But in the meantime, I would have you gather 50 ground troops of the Draconian knights and 50 winged soldiers of the wyvern fleet. Have them at the ready for my signal. I know it will take you a few days of travel to get here, but this is a town of vampires and possibly liches, which you know need to be destroyed no matter what. Your son, with love, Tiberius.
Matt: All right.
Laura: Everyone is aware that Tiberius is the giant eagles in Lord of the Rings. Tiberius can invoke ultimate destruction at the call of whatever he wants.
Orion: I don't know what's going on over there.
Matt: All right. As the week comes to a close, eventually a note appears before you, Tiberius, within your magical room. (fluttering) It reads: "Tiberius, child. I understand your request. However, you are fresh to these political matters and as the young one prone to jump at the sight of a shadow, I would need some very heavy proof to invoke wartime. Which, if I might add, is not your jurisdiction, but my own. Should you wish to bring this to my attention, you are welcome to, but you have but one chance before I set aside this intrusion to my work time as mere poppycock." (laughter)
Matt: "Tiberius, I trust that in time you will prove yourself to this family and to this country, but for the time being, business matters of this larger scale are best left to those with experience. With love, Kruvanis Stormwind."
Liam: (whispers) Send him three more letters.
Orion: Damn it. Have to provide proof to my fucking father. Fine. He didn't say no, which is what he always says. Which is a lot better than what he always says.
Sam: I walk into Tiberius' room while he's having this conversation with himself. And I say, what are you doing in here?
Orion: I'm talking to myself, Scanlan.
Sam: Oh, okay. All right. I'm going to go get some garlic from the kitchen, and then let's go!
Laura: I write a note. Address it to Uriel, hand it to our main butler. Who I know his name.
Matt: Erwen.
Laura: Erwen. It basically says  Uriel, FYI, we didn't totally flee. We's looking for evidence. No, we didn't flee. We'll be back, how about that? We'll be back.
Matt: All right. The note is left with Erwen.
Laura: And I tell him, only give this to anybody if they come looking for us and they're angry.
Matt: "Yes, of course. Of course."
Marisha: Grog? Do you think I should do the whole elemental guardian thing?
Travis: Why not?
Marisha: All right.
Orion: How are you doing, Grog?
Travis: I'm fucking bored. (laughter)
Travis: I've been sitting here for 30 fucking minutes. I'm bored! Cast an elemental and make it smash everything around the keep.
Marisha: Give me that ruby. (ting) I catch it. Water elemental seems appropriate based on our knowledge, yeah? Water elemental. And Planar Binding. And I talk to him in my elemental speech, which I can do.
Taliesin: And you say? (gargles water during Marisha's speech)
Marisha: And I say, look, we're going to be gone for 30 days. We have a visitor here. Make sure nothing or no one brings him any harm. (laughter)
Matt: I don't have a drink.
Orion: That make you thirsty?
Taliesin: You know, you can speak English, you don't have to--
Matt: Yeah. The elemental gives you an acknowledgment and speaks back in its own tongue the equivalent of, for my time here, I serve.
Marisha: Wait, what? I'm sorry.
Matt: "For my time here, I serve" is essentially the essence of what you get from him
Marisha: For my time here, I serve?
Matt: For my time here, I serve. All right.
Sam: Onward.
Liam: I love doing this show. (laughter)
Sam: Do we know where we're going?
Taliesin: Yeah, I know where we're going.
Liam: Percival de Rolo knows where we're going to go.
Taliesin: We head to Turst Fields.
Marisha: Are we riding there by horseback? Is that what we're doing?
Sam: Do we know where we're going?
Matt: Well, Percy said the Turst Fields. The Turst Fields you do know. Some of you may have passed by them. They are to the east, northeast area of Westruun, on the eastern side of the continent. It's about four and a half days' travel horseback.
Travis: What if we purchased a carriage?
Orion: What if we went on airship instead? We have one at our disposal, do we not?
Marisha: Well, we had one at our disposal when we were friends of the city.
Laura: I think it's in the Cloudtop District, actually.
Liam: I think we need to go on the down-low.
Marisha: Yeah, let's not tell anybody that we're leaving.
Sam: Carriage. Let's go. How much do they cost?
Marisha: Do we need a carriage? We have a stable full of horses.
Liam: Rein it in. We're going to fight vampires.
Matt: You have four horses, and you technically have the teleportation sigil for Westruun.
Laura: Oh yeah!
Orion: Is Briarwood keep over there?
Matt: Westruun's most of the way across the continent. It's about a day's ride out from Westruun.
Marisha: So that would shave time?
Matt: It would shave about three days off your journey.
Liam: Matt, I'm pretty sure it's "si-google."
Taliesin: Turst Fields is just northeast of Westruun.
Laura: Let's do it!
Liam: What's in those fields?
Matt: The Turst Fields are a farming community that takes care of a lot of the eastern side. They're not really an extension of Westruun, but it's one of the closest cities. And they do a lot of food trade up into Whitestone, or did previously.
Taliesin: It's where we would make our camp.
Marisha: Let's head there and make camp. And maybe talk about a plan.
Liam: Yes. I think, Percival, you're leading the way. Use my sister as an advisor, but you're leading the way right now.
Taliesin: I'm going to draw out a crude map while we make our way so I can let you all know where we're going.
Orion: Well, then join me in my laboratory, everyone.
Sam: All right, yes. We go to Tiberius's laboratory.
Matt: Okay. Tiberius, you go ahead and cast Teleportation Circle.
Orion: Not yet. I go, hey, look at the laboratory, guys. What do you think? Scanlan, it looks like you're impressed.
Sam: (dryly) Oh, I'm very impressed.
Matt: Now you cast Circle of Teleportation.
Orion: I use my sigil there. I got it set up there.
Matt: Yep, and the circle appears. You guys rush through it. You do not have your horses with you because they would not be able to travel through the teleportation circle with you. However, you could probably procure some while you're in Westruun. In doing that, you guys, for the case of brevity on this-- we've been missing that for a lot of this session.
Liam: Let's do this in real time.
Matt: We'll say the total gold to purchase horses for the whole party--
Laura: After I haggled. Because let's be honest, I would've.
Matt: You would've. Go ahead and make a persuasion roll.
Travis: You would've.
Orion: Even in real time.
Marisha: Do it.
Laura: 21.
Matt: 21? Okay, yeah, would put you at about, we'll say because you are renowned in this area and you've helped Westruun. Helped them during the Winter's Crest Festival the year before, using that discount. You manage to procure everyone's horses, including your warhorse, for 210 gold, which is a pretty decent discount.
Laura: Yes it is. All right.
Taliesin: Can I share my map?
Matt: You can, yeah.
Laura: (gasps) You made a map?
Sam: You drew that just now?
Taliesin: You know I've forged all of our documents? You are aware of that, right? Any time we've needed papers.
Laura: Wait, where is Westruun? Oh, there's Westruun, that's where we are right now. So we have to go-- I just spit on your map, Percy. Up through the woods, into the mountains. Whitestone is mountains.
Liam: You can handle that.
Laura: Yeah, I can handle both.
Travis: We're here, and we've got to go here.
Laura: Right.
Sam: Let's set out.
Matt: You have two paths. You have the path into the center of the Parchwood Woods that leads up into the valley of the Alabaster Sierras that surround it. That is the direct route to Whitestone that leads through the main pathway. The forest to the front of the city. There's also the Alabaster Sierras themselves, which surround that peninsula that extends into the northern part of the continent. They are very tall, fjord-like, craggy mountain ranges up against the sea along the edge. They're a little more treacherous, but a little more out of the way; a backdoor route. So you guys choose which route you want to take.
Taliesin: I would prefer not the direct route.
Orion: Always go in the backdoor.
Taliesin: Can you say that anything that is not laced with sexual innuendo?
Laura: Mountain ranges are part of my favored terrain. We don't get disadvantage traveling through.
Taliesin: I would prefer taking that direction. I don't want to head straight towards them.
Laura: There probably will be mountain giants, though, remember, that throw boulders and they will be terrible.
Taliesin: The Parchwood Forests are dangerous as they are. There's really no safe way.
Sam: I trust Percy; whatever you say.
Matt: Percy, you are aware that here have been problems in the past with various mountain-faring giants that lived north of Whitestone that occasionally would wander too far south. They mostly kept to themselves, but occasionally they had some crossover, there were some scuffles here and there. So you guys are deciding to take the Alabaster Sierras?
Laura: Yes. I want to cast Pass Without a Trace on everyone.
Matt: You guys head out from Westruun; it takes about a day's worth of travel. You stop in the Turst Fields. It's a small farming community. You ask around for a bit, most of the folks there say that they haven't had much trade or communication with Whitestone like they used to. They do still provide crops and such, but they don't allow anyone past into the actual forest. They trade at the boundary created by the forest. Still pay gold, but it seems to be more enclosed scenario, but very few folks there seem to question it. Business as usual is still left within Turst Fields. Make your way northward to the bottom of the Alabaster Sierras, and as you begin heading up the outskirts of this mountain range, you do notice that the mountains are extremely high in altitude. There's a perpetual climb at nearly a 40-degree angle as you continue upward further and further and further. The drop-off at the edge of the cliff is 1,000 to 2,000 feet at times, straight down into the ocean or rocks below. There are paths worn up here; it has been used as travel before. Although you're uncertain as to how recently it may have been traversed. Occasionally, the wind picks up and you have to steel yourself, push yourself against the side. The path, thankfully, is maybe 15, 20, sometimes 30 feet in width. It's not too much where you're being forced against the edge, but it's enough to be aware of the danger of the circumstance. You guys are heading up, I'd say, about half a day's travel, it's about 2:00 in the afternoon. Also, you can tell there are slight outcroppings a few hundred feet down to the bottom, a few bits of stone that jut out from the side. You can see small nests or bushes that have taken root on those side areas. The rock itself of this mountain range is unusually, unnaturally white. The actual rock that forms this entire region is almost a glowing quartz-like texture. There are parts that are almost translucent, there are parts that are very milky white. Number one, you can now understand as to partially why the area is called Whitestone, the town nearby, and you've heard mention from Percy in the past of the large quarries here that mine the stone for various uses and export it throughout all of Tal'Dorei. That's where a large portion of the town was built around that trade at the beginning of its construction. Eventually, you come to a point where there is a falloff on the path, where the erosion or some sort of large impact of the side caused the path to fall into a scooped crevasse that is a smooth fall down the side. There is no way across other than a large sea salt air-rotted rope bridge that goes across about a hundred feet. You see it rocking (creaking) with the wind.
Travis: I don't think this looks very stable.
Laura: Man, you know what I would give for a flying fucking carpet right now?
Sam: So the bridge is out?
Matt: No, the bridge can be crossed. It looks a little rickety. It's not terrible or frightening, but it's been there for a while, and you can tell from the color of the rope--
Sam: How far is it across?
Matt: A hundred feet.
Orion: Should I go first, everyone?
Taliesin: I want to inspect it from an engineering perspective, if that's possible.
Matt: Go ahead and make an investigation check.
Taliesin: Ten.
Matt: Okay. Looking at it, I mean, the anchors are pretty solid in the stonework. There's no looseness to their element. The rope itself is taut and seems to have serviced long enough. There are no signs of extreme wear other than just time and weather.
Liam: I'm going to walk forward.
Laura: I'm going to tie the fucking rope around your waist before you do that.
Taliesin: That's quite a good idea!
Liam: Sarenrae, jeepers. I'm going to use perception, I'm going to look at it before going out. That is a 23.
Matt: All right. Are you taking your horse with you?
Liam: I leave my horse with my sister. I'm on foot; I'm on all fours, really. Spidering out.
Matt: Making your way across, you get halfway across the bridge. There's a creaking sound and slight movement as the wind picks up at times and you (creaking).
Liam: So I'm lasting. What would I make, is it an insight check to decide if I thought Grog could make it across this thing?
Matt: Make an intelligence check. Roll and add your intelligence modifier.
Taliesin: It's a ten.
Liam: Take that zero off it, and you've got it.
Matt: Best you can tell, Grog looks like a big guy.
Liam: This is fun. You swing back and forth. Grog, I think you might like this!
Marisha: How far across is the bridge? A hundred feet?
Taliesin: Once you're across, let's secure the rope that's attached to you, and we'll make ourselves a guideline that we can hang onto.
Laura: I like it.
Liam: All right, he sounds like a Debbie Downer, Grog, but I'll go across, and you can follow.
Matt: Okay, you make the rest of your way across. No issue. The rope bridge carries your weight all the way.
Laura: Tie a rope. I tie the other side.
Liam: Is there anything on the other side I could tie it to?
Matt: There's a couple of small cliffside trees that grow off in strange twisting bonsai tree-like branches that stick off. They're pretty sturdy.
Liam: I use a sailor knot.
Laura: I use a special ranger knot that's really extra strong.
Matt: Secret ranger knot. Well played. (laughter)
Matt: Who's up next?
Liam: I double-knot mine.
Sam: We've got to get the horses across.
Travis: No, they ain't coming.
Sam: They're not coming? Oh. Well, I just Dimension Door across, then.
Liam: Jeepers! Will you warn a half-elf when you're going to do that?
Matt: Spooks you for a second. You hold on and you make your way across. You guys are now on the other side. You're holding onto everyone's horses left behind.
Laura: Trinket.
Travis: I tie up all the horses to a very large tree.
Marisha: Are we going by foot now?
Laura: Looks like it. Tiberius, are you still on our side? Are you with me, still? Will you cast Fly on Trinket? I love you.
Orion: Sure. To make it across?
Laura: I can climb on him and you cast Fly and you only have to use one little spell.
Orion: If I cast it on him, I would probably jump on myself, because I'm a little bit heavier than you are, darling.
Laura: Then do it!
Liam: She's haggling you right now.
Orion: You can have him afterwards.
Laura: Yeah, you can go, and I'll just use the little rope.
Orion: Fine. Proceed.
Matt: You cast Fly on Trinket--
Orion: No, I don't. I don't do shit yet. I wait for you guys to get across, so if something happens, then I can cast it.
Laura: Okay, just protect him.
Matt: So you get on Trinket's back?
Laura: No, he hasn't cast it on him yet.
Matt: So who's going across now?
Laura: I am!
Matt: Okay, you make it across. No problem. You're light enough and able to guide the movement of the bridge.
Laura: Good thing I only had one frittata the other day!
Marisha: Here's my question. What looks shaky, the connection of the bridge or the actual, physical condition of the bridge itself?
Matt: The physical condition of the bridge. There is no actual visible point that is--
Marisha: For bonus added safety in case this bridge gives way, I'm going to cast Grasping Vine and have it loop and wrap around the edge of the bridge. Further enforce it.
Matt: The vines reach around and wrap around the edges of the wood slats and the rope handholds, and it seems to be pretty well-held on that side.
Taliesin: Clever!
Marisha: At least that side will be fine. And then I'll go across.
Matt: Cool, you make it across without a problem.
Travis: Who else needs to go across?
Laura: Just you and Tiberius and Trinket.
Travis: You want me to go first?
Orion: It's fine! I hop on Trinket and I pet Lockheed. And then I hop on Trinket and I cast Fly on him and say, Remember how to go across. And then as we start flying across, I cast Telekinesis on Grog and take him with me. Kind of like Green Lantern.
Marisha: Concentration spells.
Orion: Yeah. That should be 12 seconds to get across a bridge, right?
Matt: Yeah, that would be 12 seconds, which will be enough time. So as you're coasting over with Trinket, floating (bear sounds) you turn around and cast Telekinesis. Grog, all of a sudden, you're lifted up and held aloft. You look down over yourself, waving your hands instinctually. Looking down, you can see a 600, 700 foot drop before the rock comes to a point which would probably splinter or crush anyone who fell into it, and then is pushed out to the ocean. So it's a little scary, but you start flailing about as you're being pulled across by Tiberius. Eventually, Trinket comes, lands on the other side safely. You guide Grog over, down onto his feet. Safe and sound.
Marisha: Who's left?
Sam: No one. The horses.
Laura: Oh yeah, what do you want to do with the horses?
Travis: We tied them up.
Orion: I'm going to dispel the Fly. But I'm going to hold the Telekinesis for the ten minutes I can on Grog. I'm not going to do anything, I'm just going to keep that spell going.
Matt: Okay. Cool. All righty.
Sam: I say a prayer of thanks to the horses, who will surely die of starvation.
Laura: They were tied up in a super grassy area with a shit-ton of water around.
Liam: They'll be eaten by something long before that. It's fine.
Marisha: So what's our plan? What are we doing?
Sam: The plan is walk until we get there.
Matt: The path pinches a little bit tighter as you go across, about a ten foot width and you guys begin pulling across. There's a sudden large gust of sea air blows in as you guys go ahead and buckle down to hold on. I'd like you all to roll an athletics check.
Laura: Are we in mountains yet? So I have advantage?
Matt: You have advantage on it.
Travis: Me too, because mountains are my favorite--
Matt: That's true, yeah!
Laura: What is this, acrobatics?
Sam: Athletics.
Laura: Athletics.
Sam: Nine. ORION. 18.
Marisha: 19.
Taliesin: Ten.
Laura: 11.
Travis: 23.
Matt: All right, as you guys are holding tight, both Scanlan and Vax are trying to grab something, holding onto rocks, but before they can get enough, they're both so small, it pushes them out.
Orion: How much time has passed?
Matt: It's three seconds. Oh! Passed since the bridge? About five, six minutes.
Orion: Can I try to catch them because I still have the Telekinesis going?
Matt: You can catch one of them.
Orion: (yelling) Why, Matthew?!
Matt: Because the spell has to be directed!
Marisha: Are they flying off a cliff?
Matt: They're both being dragged by the wind off the side of the cliff. You can see them grabbing the ground. Vax is being pulled off the side as Scanlan is actually lifted off his feet.
Orion: I know Vax can't. I grab Vax!
Liam: Tell my sister I love her!
Travis: I jump and try and grab Vex.
Laura: Vax. You want to hold me?
Liam: I'm Vox.
Orion: Wait, you're grabbing him?
Laura: I'm Vex.
Travis: That's what I said!
Matt: You grab Vax and hold him in place as you reach out and grab Vax by the arms and pull him back onto--
Liam: Wait, who?
Orion: You!
Liam: Oh, he grabs me!
Travis: I grab her.
Laura: Grog grabbed me.
Matt: You were fine.
Laura: I know. But he still said he'd grabbed me.
Matt: Okay. Then you're being held aloft by Tiberius' Telekinesis concentrating. Scanlan has fallen out of view.
Marisha: I Grasping Vine him before he goes out of view.
Matt: Okay. It's all right.
Marisha: Off the side of the cliff.
Matt: Go ahead and make an attack roll with your Grasping Vine.
Orion: I can manipulate a thousand pounds.
Liam: You've got me.
Marisha: What?!
Matt: This is to aim the vine as he falls.
Marisha: 19.
Matt: 19? Not a problem! The vine grabs Scanlan and pulls him back and holds him as the wind slowly dies down.
Orion: I guide Vax back to the cliff.
Matt: The wind dies down. You guys now begin pushing yourselves close to the edge of this pathway up the side of this seaside cliff. It doesn't seem to deviate much beyond that 15-foot width now, which puts you all at general unease. As the sun's getting closer and closer to setting, you're making your way around the crest. You've been traveling this mountain range for a good number of hours now. You're at a decent height, you're on foot, a good distance inside the Alabaster Sierra mountain range. Perception check, everyone.
Taliesin: Yeah!
Travis: Five.
Sam: Four.
Matt: Three, two, one.
Marisha: 25.
Taliesin: 26.
Liam: 29.
Laura: 25.
Orion: I rolled a natural one, with negative two.
Matt: Okay! Those of you with a higher perception than 20 on this roll. As you pull along, you hear this echoing sound, this (bird-like sounds) in the distance, the wind's carrying it as it's blowing past you.
Marisha: Does it sounds like anything nature-based? Something I could possibly have talked to in the past?
Taliesin: Is it something I would know?
Matt: Go ahead and make an intelligence check. You go ahead and make a nature check.
Taliesin: 21.
Marisha: 25.
Matt: It is birdish in nature, but it sounds too guttural and too articulate to be a bird. There is enough of-- you notice there's a language of the chittering that is bird-like, but there is actual voice. You recall that there are various creatures that make the cliffsides home. One of the ones that are more obnoxious that some of the earlier traders of Whitestone had problems with making this path for mining were clusters of harpies.
Marisha: Oh, fucking harpies.
Taliesin: Harpies.
Orion: Harpies.
Orion: They're the opposite of the Harpers, which are good.
Travis: What's a harpy?
Orion: A harpy's a jerk, a stupid butthole who's super loud.
Matt: You glance over as you guys are having this conversation. Behind you, you can see in the distance from where you were, a couple of these dark shapes swooping down. You see a cluster of about four or five of these harpies diving.
Taliesin: Can we find a place to maybe settle down?
Laura: Can we stealth? I cast Pass Without a Trace on us!
Sam: Don't worry! I can make us all look like cows again!
Marisha: (shushes) Everyone be quiet! MATT How long is the concentration on Pass Without a Trace? How long can you hold that concentration?
Laura: Up to one hour.
Matt: Okay. It has faded since then.
Marisha: Where are we against the mountain? Are we still on the mountain edge?
Matt: Yeah, you're still on the path, and you look back from where you came from.
Marisha: So we have a mountain behind our backs?
Matt: Yeah, a sheer cliff.
Marisha: I turn around and I cast Move Earth, my 6th-level fucker. And I (boof) and I clear out a cave.
Matt: Okay. As you're concentrating on this, eventually, Keyleth begins to focus, and over the next minute or so, she begins to push a cavern.
Laura: I cast Pass Without a Trace on us now.
Matt: Okay. As this is happening, you can see the harpies have definitely found some sort of prey. They're distracted as they're slowly tearing apart what you gather are the horses you left behind.
Laura: Oh no! Terrible!
Matt: Yeah. Good news is, they're distracted.
Marisha: Horses saved our lives, guys.
Matt: Bad news is they're probably not going to be there when you come back.
Taliesin: It's getting dark. I think we should camp.
Liam: So you're saying there's a chance.
Matt: Over the next few minutes or so, Keyleth, you've pushed a good ten by 15-foot cavern into the side of this wall that didn't previously exist. You guys are able to step out of the light as the sun's starting to disappear over the mountain range, the Cliffkeep, which you can see in the distance across this channel now. There's a channel of water between the two.
Marisha: I go ahead and Druidcraft a little campfire. Tiberius, you want to light a fire for us?
Laura: I'm going to use Hide in Plain Sight. I'm going to see if I can do this. That sort of ability to camouflage the opening of the cave to where they wouldn't be able to see it.
Matt: Sure! Go ahead and make a stealth check.
Laura: 28.
Matt: Okay! You take the next 15 minutes or so, finding what nearby pieces of brush you can and rocks that have been loosely around the area and you start setting up this pattern of them that closes off some of the entrance from the smooth opening that Keyleth had created. It takes a little ingenuity because it's just a rock opening, and there isn't a whole lot of brush and things around. But you feel you've managed to mask it to the point that to a distant eye it would be hard to see that there is an actual cavern there. At this point, the sun has set, night has come in, and you guys are sitting within this cavern hearing the distant sound of the ocean waves crashing against the bottom of these cliffside, coastal fjords.
Marisha: Me and Tiberius made a fire.
Matt: All right, a fire is made.
Orion: I lit it with my spitting.
Matt: Okay. Tiberius forms a relatively useful and effective campfire within this cave.
Laura: Oh! I want to use my holy oil and dip a couple arrows in the holy oil because I know I can make three based on what we've done before.
Matt: You can, yes. Do be aware, the holy oil will only last about a day.
Laura: Oh, really? Oh, so I'll do that right before.
Matt: It's one of those things where if you dip it now and leave it, over time it'll just either evaporate or drip off of the arrow.
Laura: Good to know.
Liam: While my sister's looking at her shit, I bogart Trinket and climb up onto him, use him like a sleeping bag and cuddle into his softest warm parts and fall asleep.
Matt: (bear groaning) Trinket, at first, just haplessly pushes you away, but recognizes your scent and lets you.
Laura: You ganked my sleeping bag.
Liam: Sorry, not sorry.
Orion: I find a little patch of dust and do a little dust bath real quick and then I'm going to use one of my books of stuffs and start researching liches just because I want to.
Matt: Okay. I mean, what book would you be researching this in?
Orion: Tobin's Spirit Guide?
Matt: The researcher ability is that you can go to places of research and find books. You don't really keep a tome of all knowledge with you. The next time you find a town or you're in town, then you can use that ability to research in advance.
Laura: I ask Grog how he's doing.
Travis: I'm bored as shit.
Laura: You want to arm wrestle?
Travis: No.
Laura: All right.
Sam: Come on, do it, Grog! Come on, you can't beat a girl?
Matt: Do you guys all rest for the evening?
Laura: Yeah.
Liam: Yeah.
Laura: But we should take watch.
Taliesin: I'm still awake. I'm going to fall asleep last.
Marisha: I also stay up with Percy.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: I'll take first watch.
Laura: Wake me up when you're tired.
Orion: I'm gonna feed Lockheed some treats.
Matt: Okay. You guys continue your business for the evening.
Marisha: I talk to Percy for a second. Percy, while we're alone for a moment, there's something that's been bothering me, and I can't get it out of my head. I thought I'd talk to you about it because I feel-- we're friends, right? We're friends? Are we friends?
Taliesin: Sure! I'd like to think so, yes.
Marisha: Been through a lot, been together a while.
Taliesin: It's been a while, yes.
Marisha: Two years now?
Taliesin: I suppose.
Sam: I go invisible to see if I can hear their conversation.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and make a perception check.
Sam: Perception or stealth? 20.
Matt: Okay. You are keeping relatively low and are able to overhear their conversation.
Marisha: You know, you're a very brilliant person.
Taliesin: Thank you.
Marisha: I can't help but feel like I'm being watched right now. Never mind, forget I said anything. I can't help but feel like there's something else, there's something more to this that you're not telling us. And I didn't really think of anything until we were having that fight where Tiberius brutally murdered that old woman.
Taliesin: Been trying not to think about it.
Marisha: Yeah, me too. But the one thing that I can't get out of my head was something that you said during that fight. And for a long time I was like, damn, Percy's got really cool one-liners and he's so smart, and I wish I could have cool one-liners. You and Grog have really cool one-liners. And then you said "your soul is now forfeit" to the person you shot that night. And I thought, wow! That was an interesting one-liner.
Taliesin: I did say that, didn't I?
Marisha: Yeah! Yeah, you did. For some reason, I was the only one who noticed it, and I don't know if that's because I'm just reading into things, if that was just a really awesome, but scary and brutal thing to say in the moment, or if there's something deeper that you might be serving.
Taliesin: Honestly, I'll say, I've had a number of years thinking about what I would do and what I would say and how I would go about this. This kind of obsession is not healthy, and I know that, and it's no way to live. And I'm sure that was something on the list of things I thought I would say, some attempt to be scary when I met them, as opposed to being scared, I think I was-- (sighs) again, I don't really remember much because I was so angry. I've never been so angry. And I think I was just trying to sound threatening. And I'd had these dreams before, you know I've-- you don't build anything like this without the knowledge that you're-- I'm aware that inventing this thing has been a mistake.
Marisha: What thing?
Taliesin: I pull out my gun.
Marisha: Wait, what are you saying? You had knowledge? You didn't build that without inspiration? What do you mean?
Taliesin: I've had thoughts about it, but I didn't really think about what I was doing or what I was going to build until I decided to take my revenge, and I'd never thought about building it because I realized what a dangerous idea it was. (sighs) And I fear for the day that that comes back to haunt me. I don't know what I'll do, but I don't know, I think I was just trying to say something to be intimidating. I honestly didn't even think I was going to kill him, it just happened.
Marisha: Can I see if he's lying to me?
Matt: Go ahead and make an insight check.
Marisha: 17.
Matt: 17. Roll a d20.
Taliesin: Is your insight really that good?
Marisha: Yeah, I'm wise as fuck!
Matt: And add your charisma modifier.
Taliesin: Add my charisma modifier? 18.
Matt: Best you can tell, he's seeming honest, and sharing open-hearted to you. You feel like you've really gotten to the core truth of what Percy's about.
Marisha: What? What did you say?
Matt: You feel like you've gotten to the core and truth of what Percy's about, and perhaps your questioning this has upset him, and you feel like maybe you've pushed this a little too far.
Taliesin: I do regret what happened and I know he was a bad man, but I still hope to never lose my temper like that again.
Liam: Got to roleplay that shit. He convinced you.
Marisha: I still really feel like we're being watched. Do you feel that? I don't know.
Taliesin: Honestly, I think we both need sleep.
Marisha: It's really distracting. Yeah. Well, I love you.
Taliesin: I love you, too.
Marisha: We're in this with you until this end.
Taliesin: Thank you.
Marisha: Let's sleep.
Matt: Okay. You guys, through your turns, the evening goes by uneventful. Morning comes to you. You can hear the distant caws of seagulls waking you up as the heat from the morning sun begins to eventually hit this side of the cave. Since you're on this side of the mountain, by the time you wake up, you realize the hour's probably a little bit past noon.
Laura: Oh shit.
Marisha: We overslept!
Orion: It's so dark in here, because of the cave thing.
Marisha: Okay, so wait. Percy, how much further out are we from Whitestone?
Matt: You gather you probably have about a day's worth of travel, and you'll be able to make your way down into the ravine from here. You've come up quite a bit of the mountain range.
Taliesin: Probably another day before we can camp close enough to attack.
Sam: Let's get going.
Laura: Should we stealth through the mountains, just in case they have any kind of lookouts?
Orion: Oh, they will have lookouts.
Laura: I cast Pass Without a Trace on us again.
Liam: Let's go slower.
Laura: Should we all stealth? Try at least?
Liam: Yes.
Taliesin: Let's keep stealthy.
Matt: Okay. You guys gather outside of the cavern and head up, continuing along this path. Eventually, you do notice that the path becomes broken and too steep to continue. It actually falls and tumbles down into this long, sliding ravine. There is a slight rockslide trail that you could climb up and over and it looks like there is a separate ravine, or a separation where the two mountains join, that could possibly be traversed. But continuing on the seaside path is not going to work. It does bring you inward towards-- maybe a little further south than you would have wanted to for optimal backdoor entrance into Whitestone, but it's about your only path.
Taliesin: Have I walked this path before? I never walked this path at all.
Matt: You would have had no reason to walk this path. You've heard about it, you know of this side of the mountain range, but based on your history, there's no reason you would have come here.
Orion: Whatever it takes to get to that back door.
Matt: Everyone make a stealth check, by the way. Just so we're aware of what your stealth rolls are with the Pass Without a Trace.
Laura: Add ten to it.
Liam: You get ten? Oh. Well, I got a 40, then.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: 27
Matt: 27.
Orion: Nine.
Matt: With the ten?
Orion: Oh, 19.
Marisha: 32.
Taliesin: 32.
Travis: 27.
Laura: 37.
Matt: That's a pretty good spread. So you guys, you've hit the edge of the path. Are you heading up the rockslide trail?
Laura: Yes.
Matt: Okay. You all, one by one, begin to climb over the trail and some rocks tumble loose beneath your feet, grasp. And you help each other get to the very top.
Orion: I use my Mage Hand to help.
Matt: (laughs) That's adorable. (laughter)
Laura: As he looks at the clock! "That's adorable."
Matt: So you all eventually manage to make it over the top of the rockslide trail and eventually it leads you to where these two large mountains come together, and there is a small path that leads between. It winds and travels downward. You can see bits of the rock have fallen and crumbled, and there are small boulders and such that just, over time and through erosion, have tumbled down this ravine to start filling it with occasional chunks of stone. You begin walking through this ravine for another good 45 minutes to an hour, keeping a keen eye out.
Orion: Is this the same ravine that we're travelling across?
Matt: Basically, you guys have been traveling up the side of the coast. You've now turned inward over the mountain range to head down into the valley of Whitestone. You are currently just now heading up through the mountain range, inwards towards the mountain.
Taliesin: Is this the river?
Matt: There's no river here. It's just stone that comes together for a pathway in between. This is where two large peaks of the mountains basically come to join at the bottom.
Taliesin: Okay, so we're not at the river.
Matt: No, the river is actually inside the valley and to the south of Whitestone. So pressing down I would like you all to roll a perception check.
Laura: Jesus.
Marisha: Ah, that's all right.
Sam: One!
Laura: Natural 20!
Liam: Natural 20!
Liam: Yeah!
Matt: One, one, 20, 20.
Orion: 16.
Marisha: 14.
Taliesin: 16.
Matt: Okay. As all of you guys are charging forward, both Vex and Vax, you hear this slight noise of a couple rocks (clattering) in the ravine behind you. You both turn and look and for a split second you swear you see between some of the rocks and paths of jagged stone that mark the walls of this ravine, you see a quick blur of blue that vanishes behind a higher platform above you.
Liam: Smurfs!
Laura: A blur of blue?
Matt: A large blur of blue just disappears behind one of the outcroppings that's blocking your view of higher up the ravine.
Laura: (shushes) Down. Hide.
Orion: I cast Stoneskin.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Stealth.
Orion: I fasten my Cloak of Displacement.
Laura: And I prepare--
Matt: You guys prepare for a second, and as you're all paying attention, you guys also see another shift of blue (whoosh) go across the way. And this time you see it's something large and blue that moves across the stone and goes into a small cavern that looks about 25 feet up the way that's just past your visual range from this low in the ravine.
Laura: Do we have any visual on what it could be?
Matt: It moved very quickly, and for a split second, you could see it appeared to be-- the way it moved was almost serpentine, like (whoosh) and vanished inside. You swear you saw limbs, though. It wasn't a giant snake. There was something attached to it.
Laura: (whispering) Wyvern? I look at Keyleth. Keyleth. (louder) And I whisper, but for sake of microphones, do you know of a creature that's blue, and fast, and is kind of snakey but has arms and legs?
Marisha: Let me think about it for a second. Do I know a creature that's blue and snakey?
Liam: It sounds like basilisks, but they're too slow.
Matt: What did you roll?
Marisha: I don't know. Ooh, that's 24.
Matt: 24. You've heard of various lizard-like creatures that grow to large sizes. Usually those fall into the realm of dragons and such. The color blue, though, is uncommon, unless it were a blue dragon. However, the motion of this creature does not seem to necessarily be the territory of a blue dragon. It's hard to point exactly what this is, but you do know it's probably something in the serpentine-type magical realm.
Taliesin: I heard them, I heard them describe it. Would I know it from the description? Just from my local knowledge?
Matt: Go ahead and make a history check.
Marisha: The blue thing's weird. The blue thing is what's throwing me.
Taliesin: Nine.
Matt: Nine. Unfortunately, nothing of this type has come across you. If it has, it's been too long, and you've forgotten it. There are a number of dangerous things that exist in these mountains.
Laura: I've got a really good idea. Wait. No! Grog, pick up something really heavy, and throw it as far as you can.
Travis: I go over and I grab Scanlan--
Sam: No!
Laura: A boulder or something.
Travis: I put Scanlan down. Find a large rock that's tumbled down, maybe.
Matt: Yeah, they're easy to find. There's like some that are this big, some that are larger. They're really heavy.
Travis: And I discus the thing and (whoosh).
Matt: Make an athletics check.
Travis: Well, that was great. 24.
Matt: (whoosh) You release the rock. (impact) It skids to a halt. As it does, you can see suddenly over the course (whoosh) something very quickly move, and it's a head. It's a snout. You see it's probably a good six, seven-foot wide. A giant, lizard-like, toothy jaw. Blue scales against it with large kind of horned ridges across the back of its head. And its claws (clacking) on the edge. Looks down. Looks down at the rest of you. Rears back.
Laura: It saw us?
Liam: Didn't see me.
Orion: Well, of course it saw us.
Laura: With 37 stealth, yo. It saw us?
Marisha: But it didn't seem to give a shit?
Matt: It just withdrew over the edge.
Sam: Should we run?
Laura: Maybe just move really fast away from him
Marisha: I can, I can cast Anti-Life Shell on us. Then we can haul ass really fast.
Sam: Will it move with us, your shell?
Marisha: Yeah, as long as you stay close to me. It moves with me.
Liam: Yeah, fuck this thing. Let's get out of here.
Marisha: Okay! I cast Anti-Life Shell. Stay close!
Matt: Okay. As you begin casting and finish the spell. As the sphere appears-- at which point you now see a large blue blur (whoosh) dart off of the cliffside into the air (impact noise) and skidding right in front of you guys, blocking off the side of the ravine you guys were running towards. You can now see it: a huge, elongated, serpentine body covered in blue scales and horns. You can see what looks to be six to eight arms and a series of legs all across its long, snakelike torso. As it looks it snarls at you all (snarls). And you see sparks of energy, electricity (sparking noises) in its jaw. (growls, roars)
Liam: Salamander?
Matt: And that's where we're going it end tonight! (yelling)
Laura: Oh, jeez Louise!
Sam: You can't do that!
Matt: I can, because it's 10 30.
Liam: No, it's not. It's like 8 45.
Matt: We can keep going if you guys want to stay long. It's Thursday night.
Zac: I'm coming to you with my laptop before you continue.
Liam: Who's that guy?
Matt: But to give you a little perspective, that is what essentially you'd be facing. (loud reactions)
Laura: What the fuck? It's got so many arms.
Liam: That's a kobold.
Matt: Yeah, totally. Kobold. [end of transcript]

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello, everyone and welcome to ta-te-ple-plah. It's already off to a good start, huh?
Travis: (laughs) Yes.
Marisha: Beautiful.
Taliesin: Live streaming.
Matt: Welcome to this evening's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons & Dragons.
Travis: And make fun of our DM.
Matt: Exactly. Live internet, it's a wonderful thing. This is why you don't drink before a game. All right, so, first and foremost, thank you. Welcome. We're jumping in here shortly from a bit of a climatic endpoint last week, but before we get into that, we're going to go ahead and try and cruise through these pre-show announcements. So, first and foremost, I want to let you guys know that the short video series I'm doing for Geek and Sundry, that's GM and DM Tips, launched last week on Friday, and a few videos will be coming out every Friday for the next couple months or so, so every Friday go check that out on GeekandSundry.com to see what other bit of rambling I'm doing and hoping to try and help some of you make your game a little more interesting. So tomorrow I guess is the next one. I'm not quite sure what topic it's on, but it should be fun. So check that out. As a reminder, most of us are going to be present at Wizard World Portland next month. We'll be there Saturday and Sunday for the con, and we'll have a panel both days. I think Saturday is the Critical Role panel, and Sunday is going to be more of a voiceover-related one, so hope to see you guys there. Bring your stuff if you want to have it signed and come get ready to ask questions and hang out, basically.
Laura: And par-ty!
Travis: And also find us during the days in the general hall area, we'll be around quite a bit.
Matt: Yeah, we'll be around. So, if you would like to see us possibly come to a Wizard World near you in the future, go ahead and send a tweet to Wizard World's Twitter, and let them know how excited you'd be to see us at more events in the future, because that would make them more inclined to want to bring us to more events! Let's see-- Also as a reminder, me and Marisha will be at Colorado Anime Fest, February 12th through the 14th in Denver, Colorado.
Marisha: Valentine's Day Weekend.
Matt: Yep, so we'll be out there, hanging with you folks in Colorado. You should come say hello, we'd love to see you. Also, a reminder, the Dungeon Masters Guild, awesome new opportunity for content creators for Dungeons and Dragons. You know, create your own classes, your own rules, your own feats, your own stuff. There's a great place to put it up there, and you can set your price for it. You can check out my most updated version of the Blood Hunter and recently updated Gunslinger, which is now version 1.1, just went up yesterday, so if you have one of those you can update that and get the newest set. A couple minor changes and tweaks.
Travis: And it's super cool.
Taliesin: Anything I need to know about?
Matt: Nothing you have to worry about yet. It was mainly the level 15 ability piercing shot and a couple of clarifications that I know. You'll be fine.
Marisha: It's for you to find out, all right.
Taliesin: That's his subtle way of saying I'm not going to make level 15.
Matt: Could be. Ouch. We shall see. All right, Wyrmwood Gaming, awesome friend of the show. They still have their 'critrole' discount code, you get free shipping if you go ahead and order something from their site, really awesome-
Liam: 'critrole'. The code is 'critrole'.
Matt: Just one delightful word. Pretty wood. That's a cool arrangement, I like that.
Marisha: Thanks. I designed it like this.
Taliesin: You're so creative.
Matt: Oh, and Liam, if you want to check your Twitter, there's a cool little present I think waiting for you now from one of our fan artists. You know her as Mikandii, is her Twitter. She has a cool little thing for you.
Liam: Yes I will, I am very excited
Laura: Is it you and Gilmore making out?
Liam: That's emblazoned on the inside of my mind. Wow!
Laura: What is it? What is it?
Liam: Wow. Oh, nothing.
Laura: No, I want to see it!
Laura: Wow! That's amazing!
Matt: I haven't seen it yet, so I'm excited.
Liam: Wow. It's beautiful. Thank you.
Laura: Oh my god, he looks so dreamy.
Matt: So, go to @VoiceofOBrien to see what apparently he is looking at, that I have no idea what it is. Hopefully it's not just a giant dick.
Liam: That's included.
Marisha: It's subversive. It's what you see in the art.
Matt: Yeah, yeah. It's your interpretation.
Matt: Now I'm excited for that.
Marisha: Oh, I want to see the two side-by-side. Yes, there's a Kickstarter up right now called Lost Hope: the Series, that I'm a part of. It's like Battlestar Galactica meets Archer and, yeah. I voice a character named Simmons in there. It's fun. Go check it out.
Liam: That's a good pitch.
Matt: There you go. And the Mythica 4 Kickstarter is up right now, as well. They're already rocketing toward their goal, which is awesome, and you get to see me as an evil necromancer casting magic spells at good people. And actually at Kevin Sorbo, second film in a row I get to cast magic at him, pretty excited about that. So check that out. Did you have something you wanted to announce?
Travis: Yeah. Matt and I are both in Warner Bros. Home Entertainment's Batman: Bad Blood! Which is out right now on Digital Download on iTunes. It's solid rock. Can't move.
Laura: Solid rock.
Travis: Yeah. I play the Heretic. Matt plays a million other people. It's really cool, check it out. We fight Batman.
Matt: Yeah! I get electrocuted.
Travis: I sing Taylor Swift songs and all that.
Matt: I jump around and punch things, it's fun. Oh, and last but not least announcement, next Monday on Ivan's wonderful RPG show No Survivors, me, Laura, Felicia, Wil, a bunch of people, I haven't looked at the full list yet, are all going to be guesting on that as players for a round of one of my favorite RPGs, Paranoia.
Laura: Which I haven't ever played. But Ivan was telling me about it and it sounds like so much fun.
Matt: Yeah, it's one of my favorite RPG systems ever. So next Monday, go check out No Survivors. We're all going to be playing Paranoia and making ridiculous choices and probably dying in horrible, wonderful ways, so, we'll be there for that. Hi, Sam. Glad you could join us, buddy.
Sam: (whispering) Thanks.
Matt: Sam Riegel, ladies and gentlemen.
Liam: Hi, Sam.
Marisha: I like this sweater, is this new?
Sam: Thanks. Yeah.
Laura: It's so hot in here, though.
Sam: Oh no, I'll take it off.
Travis: You and me, we got problems now. (laughter)
Marisha: Oh god!
Travis: I'd like to Great Weapon Master right now. Where's Scanlan on the map?
Matt: He's right over here. You can work towards over there shortly.
Liam: All this time you've been trying to kick my teeth in and your real enemy is right over here.
Travis: True colors, (singing) shining through! (laughter)
Matt: All right! Good, it's getting you in character, perfect. So now we've finished all the announcements I believe, if anyone has anything else we're going to go ahead and get into tonight's episode of Critical Role. So, where we left off, our intrepid adventurers, Vox Machina, having returned the traitor Riskel Daxio to Sovereign Uriel in the center of the town of Emon, Grog beheading him as part of his punishment for being such a traitorous worshiper of the evil entity known as Vecna. Upon going out for a pub crawl, came across Gilmore in a secret speakeasy, managed to enjoy a Heroes' Feast at his expense, whereas Vex and Vax both, all of you, got pretty-- Keyleth got very-- drunk.
Laura: I didn't get drunk at all.
Matt: That's right, you didn't drink.
Marisha: I got pretty wasted.
Matt: Gilmore had a very intense conversation with Vax over there to ensure where they stood, and Keyleth vomited multiple times. But after which the party found their way back to the Keep, where Dr. Dranzel and his Spectacular Traveling Troupe were drinking and expecting you to be there, in which they could converse and try and convince you of a little caper they've been trying to get their head around for a while, and you seem to have the entry to this possible windfall of money. Scanlan, after courting this young, pixie-haired gnome--
Sam: I sort of knew in the back of my head, right? No, I was courting her. No, it's true. (laughter)
Matt: Was instead confronted in his bedroom by Kaylie, who revealed herself to be Scanlan's long-unknown daughter from many years ago, who had trained very hard as a bard at the College of the White Duke, in Westruun, and honed her skills with a blade with the intent of finding you one day and disgracing you. Thanks to Scanlan's sudden realization, change of heart, and attempt to connect with his lost blood, broke a bit of that cold honed exterior, and managed to prevent a very dangerous and possibly deadly encounter. She left frustrated and confused, and hasn't been seen since. The rest of you, gathering the next morning, discussed this endeavor with Dr. Dranzel and how they had found a home that had been long abandoned after being purchased by a collector. A home that you guys had ransacked a little over a year before after finding a portal within that led to a dragon's hoard, as the previous person who lived there, General Krieg, was actually a dragon who had infiltrated the Council.
Laura: A really hot dragon. I remember thinking he was really cute. I had a thing for General Krieg. I was really sad when it turned out he was--
Matt: I'm sorry it worked out that way.
Matt: Yeah, that was Grog's famous rage looting. General Krieg, Bonescythe-- Brimscythe, sorry. They're close. Brimscythe the Dragon was slaughtered in this endeavor, however it's been over a year since. You guys returned to this house, scoured it, found your way through the still existing secret passage that led you to the now partially collapsed cavern, which once housed Brimscythe and his hoard. You found that the tunnel itself, freezing cold, the rubble of the partially collapsed cavern had been ravaged by some sort of large clawed entity that Vex had identified as another equally dangerous dragon that seems to have rummaged through and found the corpse of Brimscythe. You also found that a number of gold coins, a bit of his hoard that had been buried in this, were now exposed by these strange, smooth tunnels that were carved into the rock. Upon you, Scanlan, and Trinket inquiring there, the rest of the party scattered. Pike and Keyleth went to find what seemed to be the owner of the house, now frozen in fright in a far alcove. And the three, the rest of your group, traveling towards the mouth of the cavern itself, before the ground begins to rumble. Suddenly, exploding from the rock and shale of the bottom of the cavern floor, you guys managed to see before you, piercing forth from the ground itself, a very, very large, segmented, armored, worm-like entity.
Sam: Armored?
Matt: The actual hide itself is like very, very thick.
Laura: Super thick? Ugh!
Sam: Like with armor?
Matt: Not with armor, just this natural sense.
Laura: When we kill it, we can make armor out of him.
Liam: And it was pale and icy, too, I think you were describing?
Matt: It was darkish purple in its color and tint, like dark blacks, purple, with rows and rows of teeth coming out of its eyeless face. As it bursts out of the surface, I need you all to roll initiative.
Laura: No!
Sam: Oh my god, right away, right away. We're just in it. Just like that.
Travis: Fuck yeah!
Matt: All right, so. 25 to 20?
Travis: 20, to kill Scanlan. (laughter)
Matt: 20 to 15?
Marisha: 19.
Sam: That's it?
Liam: 15.
Matt: 15 to ten?
Taliesin: Ten.
Sam: 11.
Matt: All right, then comes ten to five?
Laura: Nine.
Matt: And Pike, while, as she's not here, rolled the lowest. Ashley, unfortunately, due to scheduling, could not be here this evening. So far, we're hoping she might show up at some point tonight, we'll find out. But, in the meantime, I'm going to be running Pike on my end. So, starting the encounter, as you see this giant worm creature through the tunnel, the three of you now walking the other direction, you, feeling the rumble, turn around, holding forth your greatsword unsheathed, you can feel the power pulsing with each beat of your blood through your body, as a little voice in the back of your head, stemming from your weapon, goes, "Kill." You're up, Grog.
Travis: Well, I hope you're hungry. But you have to wait one second, we're a bit far away. Can I travel as far as I can towards?
Matt: Speed of 50, I believe?
Travis: 50.
Laura: Oh, I said I hid at the end of the episode. I said I hid.
Matt: Right, roll stealth.
Travis: Do I have a line of sight with him, or is the edge of that outcropping blocking it?
Matt: He would have half cover if you were to try and like, throw your weapon at him. It'd be a plus five to his armor class.
Marisha: Pike and I are hiding, too.
Matt: Okay, stealth check for both of you.
Travis: Could I back up three squares, so that I could move to my left so I could get a straight look at him?
Matt: There, you mean?
Travis: Can I go one more?
Matt: That's the extent of your movement right there, unfortunately. Unless you want to go at this angle, there. There you go.
Travis: Can I use the Javelin of Lightning?
Sam: What the fuck is that? That's a thing you made up.
Travis: Oh, yeah, I've got it. I utter the magic word "Penelope" and I throw it and each creature in the line, excluding me and the target, must make a DC 13 dexterity saving throw.
Matt: Okay, there are no creatures in the line, just the target.
Travis: Just the target then.
Liam: Did you get that in Yug'Voril?
Travis: Huh?
Liam: Yug'Voril. Is it from Yug'Voril?
Travis: I don't remember, it's just in the bag.
Liam: In Yug'Voril, at the bottom of that pit, when he headbutted the giant.
Matt: Yup, that was in the rubble.
Liam: Yeah! Ding!
Matt: Good memory!
Travis: Can I try and throw it?
Matt: You may, go for it.
Travis: 18.
Matt: 18 total? 18 just hits. So, go ahead and roll damage for the javelin. As you rear back, aim it with your eyes, and the frustration is palpable from Craven Edge as you put it aside to throw the javelin instead as it arcs into a bolt of energy that streaks forth, slams into the hide of the giant purple worm. Go ahead and roll damage.
Travis: 19.
Matt: 19. All righty. Great. It rears in place, shakes itself for a second. It has no eyes, so it's not looking in any different direction, it just seems to be flailing in its current location.
Travis: Can I go into a rage?
Matt: Yes you may.
Travis: I would like to rage.
Matt: All right. (laughs)
Laura: Are you rolling your special dice?
Matt: As you bite your lower lip, you feel and taste the blood begin to enter your mouth, and at that point the heat in the back of your shoulders and neck begins to swell up. Grog's into a rage. That ends your turn. Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: Can I do, like, a nature check on this thing to see if I can discern any type of information on it?
Matt: Sure. Go ahead and make an intelligence check.
Marisha: Just straight intelligence? That's not good. I think that is a five? Six! Six!
Matt: Six. You have no recollection of this type of an entity in your travels. It's definitely not natural, it's not of nature, and you've seen various types of eyeless worm-type creatures, but nowhere near on this scale. So, yeah. You have no idea beyond that.
Marisha: I'm just going to whisper to Pike, and be like: It doesn't have any eyes! I feel like we shouldn't move!
Matt: She goes, "Okay!" And she gets as still as she possibly can. "It's good! Moving's not my forte."
Marisha: Okay! I, like, hold her shoulder pads so she doesn't clink any.
Matt: "Okay!"
Marisha: Okay! I'm going to stay right here!
Matt: All right. So that ends your turn. Vax, you're up. Unless you want to do something else on your turn, is that it?
Marisha: I'm just, I'm just going to, I don't want to move. I'm just going to wait.
Sam: (mocking) I don't want to, I don't want to move!
Marisha: I don't want to move!
Liam: Click the Boots of Haste, and I want to go stealth, and scoot to that column past Grog, but closer to the worm. Not that one, the next one. Yeah. I think I can make it there.
Matt: All right. You can get there.
Liam: Do I need to roll stealth?
Matt: You can roll stealth, yeah.
Liam: I want to throw a dagger at it. Yeah. That is 28.
Matt: All right. That definitely hits. However, it is not sneak attack damage. You are hiding definitely behind the pillar, but your footsteps. And you get the essence as soon as you see the creature, its head follows you across the room, you get the sense immediately that it is not a sight-based creature, it is definitely a movement-based creature, and its head just follows you as you move.
Liam: I'll defer, but let me ask, going stealth and rolling a 28 on stealth, the footsteps were still enough to alert it to where I was?
Matt: Is it a natural 20?
Liam: I didn't attack yet. No, it was a combined 28, just to go stealth.
Matt: A combined 28. Right, even so, not quite light enough. Not with the knowledge that it was an issue with this entity, and due to the proximity of it, and it being a very sensitive creature to the rock's movement, it still picks you up.
Liam: And I should have one attack. I should have an attack, right? Because I did the boots, I ran over here--
Matt: Yep, so you have an attack.
Liam: Two.
Matt: Well, two attacks, you have offhand, so yeah.
Liam: Two, yeah. Two, because it was double the speed because of the boots. All right. First one is shit. That is 14. And the second one is-- I'm going to do Luck on that. The second one is 20.
Matt: The second one hits. The first one unfortunately just bounces off of its hide.
Liam: That's not a lot. But it is seven points of damage.
Matt: Seven points of damage, got it.
Liam: First blood. First blood, everyone.
Sam: It's looking pretty beat up.
Matt: All right. At this point in time, the dagger embeds itself in. You see the hilt sinks into the hide and then vanishes in a puff of smoke as it returns to your belt, however you can see a little bit of black liquid pouring forth from it, and its head has been trained on you since you moved across the room. The worm now disappears beneath the ground.
Taliesin: Not cool.
Matt: And you feel the ground beneath you begin to shake, as it bursts out of the ground. That's a 20 to hit.
Liam: 20? Can I use Evasion or no?
Matt: To reduce the damage in half if you want. Huh? What's your AC?
Liam: Oh, with the boots on, 18.
Matt: It rolled a 20.
Liam: Yeah, I know. So tell me what happens.
Matt: So, as you look around you all of a sudden the jaws start coming up out of the ground behind you, the teeth biting into your body as you try and wrest yourself away from its grip. You take 20 points of piercing damage.
Liam: Oh, well, Uncanny Dodge. Right? Evasion is for spell effects--
Matt: Right, Evasion does not help you in this circumstance, Uncanny Dodge allows you to reduce the damage by half. So yes, you can do that. So you take ten damage instead. I need you to make a dexterity saving throw.
Liam: That's okay. All right, so. Okay. Natural 20!
Matt: As the jaws attempt to clamp around you, you manage to just pull yourself away, tearing your knees across the teeth, but rolling in the opposite direction, right in the place where you were as it bursts out of the ground just beside you and rights itself around in that direction. As its full body emerges now, you can see its tail flop out of the tunnel it just made with this giant hooked stinger on the end as it whips off in your direction. That is going to be a 15 to hit.
Travis: That'll miss.
Matt: That misses you. As the stinger swings towards you, you manage to just duck out of the way, your eyes trained on it in an absolute red fury, and it just whiffs past your face.
Sam: Could've been bad, could've been bad.
Matt: That ends its turn. Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: Who's in front of me?
Matt: Right now you're next to Trinket and Vex is behind you.
Laura: (laughing) Don't be a dick!
Sam: I'm not going to be a dick. I brush past Trinket so I can see the worm.
Matt: Okay, about there, you can see it from that perspective.
Sam: Okay I hold up my cone, my Hand Cone of Clarity, and I will cast Eyebite. Singing to it (singing) Scanlan's eyes are biting you. Making you very sick. Ooh, Scanlan's eyes are biting you. Scanlan's eyes! All right, so the Eyebite refers to my eyes. He doesn't need eyes. He doesn't need to be able to see me, I have to be able to see him, right? It works. Okay, so I'm going to do Sicken.
Matt: To sicken it? All right. All right, it rolls, this is a wisdom saving throw? It rolls an eight. So yeah, it does not succeed on that. Eyebite takes hold. Get this little marker on there, on its neck, like a little-- There we go. So as your spell completes on it, you can see its form contracts for a second and its head hangs a little less strong as it did previously. It almost goes slack for a moment from the impact of the spell affecting its physical form. All right, so it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks, for as long as it lasts. All right, so that's your movement, that's your action, any bonus actions?
Sam: I will inspire Vex. With a limerick.
Laura: I can't wait.
Sam: I once knew a bear named Trinket, and would often tell you he stink-et, but you were appalled, so you kicked me in the balls, and now I don't say it, I just think it. (laughter)
Laura: That was wonderful!
Matt: A d10 inspiration die to you, Vex.
Laura: Yay!
Liam: Plus or minus?
Matt: (laughs) We'll see.
Marisha: Am I able to take a bonus action to like shout something out over comms?
Matt: I'll allow it, since you held your turn this turn anyways, yeah.
Marisha: Yeah? Everyone should try and get a little bit so I can see you. And I can make us all fly.
Laura: (shouting) What? You can make us fly?
Marisha: I learned it today. But you have to be within 30 feet of me.
Laura: Oh, really, but I'm so far away from you.
Marisha: You know, imagine I said it more succinctly than this.
Matt: (laughs) That's as much as you can get out. Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: All right, I'm going to head in the direction of the message I just received. So I'm going to crawl around the bottom there.
Laura: Ugh, I'm not going to be able to get to her.
Matt: That's as far as you can get.
Taliesin: That's as far as I can get, that's fine. I'm going to take a couple shots, with the big gun. I'm going to Bad News this. So, let's take a shot at that guy. Yeah, that's reasonable range. Yeah, okay. Not too close. That's not bad, 21.
Matt: 21 hits.
Taliesin: 28 points of damage.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: Quick reload, going to get one more shot off and I'm going to take this one with the sharpshooter effect just to see how things go.
Matt: Sure. The sharpshooter effect, you mean the deadeye?
Taliesin: Yep. Yeah, the deadeye. The negative five to hit.
Matt: Oh, got you, got you, all right.
Taliesin: 14.
Matt: 14 does not hit, unfortunately. As you load the second round, you pull Bad News in front of you and you go to fire, the ground actually shakes beneath you. There's a quaking. Not sure if it's from the creature or just the atmosphere around you, but as you do the gun just misfires and, well, it actually doesn't misfire, but it fires off into one of the side elements of the cave and you hear it ricochet off the rock.
Taliesin: That's what I got.
Matt: All right, that's 28 damage, 28 damage is not bad. All right, Vex, you're up.
Laura: Okay. Will you be able to move forward?
Marisha: Yeah.
Laura: Okay. I'm going to send Trinket up to that little alcove. Keep running, no, a little further-- a little further.
Matt: That's-- what's Trinket's movement? Is it 40? So he can go there.
Laura: That's as close as he can get to you.
Matt: Six, actually seven, eight. So that'd be the full movement.
Laura: Okay. Get him tucked into that little side.
Matt: Trinket is now stepping onto a bit of slick of ice and is like (unbalanced bear noises) but seems to be okay at the moment.
Laura: Okay. And then I move forward so I can see him. Right there. All right. And I'm going to Hunter's Mark him! And then I'm going to shoot my Longbow of the Sky Sentinel at him. So that, I'm going to shoot an arrow and it divides into three arrows and they all turn into storm arrows. So I roll an attack for each one of those for my first attack.
Matt: Correct. Yep. Yep. As you release the arrow from the actual tension of the bow, as soon as it leaves your fingers it almost burns the tips as it races into this arrow of pure energy. As it divides in the middle of the air, you can see each arrow sparking off bits of electrical power on its--
Laura: Okay, so the first one is a 26.
Matt: Hits.
Laura: Should I roll damage for that one?
Matt: Roll to see how many hit.
Laura: The second one is a 29.
Matt: Hits.
Laura: The third one is a 20.
Matt: 20 hits. Yeah, all three hit.
Liam: This is all happening in less than six seconds.
Laura: 17-- 20. 23 for the first arrow.
Matt: All righty.
Laura: Nine, ten, 11, 13. 17 for the second one. And then 14, 15, 16...
Sam: I feel bad for this thing.
Laura: 22. 20, what is that? 27 for the third.
Matt: Oof, all right. As each arrow slams into its side, you can see portions of its large chitinous, almost like armored shell crack and break open. And you can see now these streams of black worm blood are spilling down its side. And it starts shaking in place now in pain.
Laura: Okay. I'm going to shoot through my Blazing Bowstring for my second attack.
Matt: All right.
Sam: Second attack?
Laura: Yeah, that was just one.
Matt: Yeah, she gets that once a day.
Laura: 25.
Matt: 25 hits.
Travis: You have more dice than that dice store.
Laura: I know, it's ridiculous. 16-- 16-- 19, and then an additional d10. So 19 of fire damage. So 25 for the third.
Matt: 25. Oof. That is a nasty round. Well done.
Laura: For the fourth arrow.
Matt: As this fourth arrow slams into its side there's a burst of fire from the impact and you can see it now. It's starting to shriek this horrible high-pitched multi-toned scream. All right, that ends your turn.
Laura: And I rolled a 15 for stealth, not that it probably matters anymore.
Matt: Nah, no, it doesn't really. All right.
Laura: And then I stay very, very still.
Matt: Cool, so does Pike. Pike's going to follow in Keyleth's order and spend the round just keeping in place, very quietly. All right, top of the round again. Grog, you're up.
Travis: Oh, are we flying?
All: No.
Travis: Fuck it! I take Craven Edge out. I hope you're hungry. And I would like to go into a frenzied rage.
Matt: All right.
Travis: And I would like to attack, the first two times, at the big purple dick that just came out of the ground.
Matt: All right.
Marisha: Hey, move down a bit so you're not in my way.
Travis: Which way?
Matt: Grog's just charging in.
Travis: That's a 23?
Matt: 23 hits.
Travis: 20?
Matt: 20 hits.
Travis: Wow. 26?
Matt: All three hit. These are non-Great Weapon Master, right?
Travis: The third one I wanted it to be, should I reroll since I didn't specify?
Matt: Reroll because you didn't say it, yeah.
Travis: 17.
Matt: That misses, unfortunately. But the first two do hit. Yeah, you got to mention that before you make the attack.
Travis: I do, I do. You're right. 2d6. What do sixes look like? They're squares.
Laura: They're squares. (laughter)
Sam: Cubes, really.
Travis: Jeez, three, eight, 16 for the first one.
Matt: All righty.
Travis: And 16 for the second one.
Matt: All righty. What's the DC on the sword effect, again? Is it 12?
Travis: Oh! Yep.
Matt: All right. So it succeeds its first saving throw and it succeeds its second saving throw. But you do see with each strike the intent of the sword to draw some of the strength and life force from the target. Not really making any effect, unfortunately. All right! Ending your turn, Grog, that vibration you feel in the ground, now? It's curious, because the worm itself is out of the ground, now. What caused you to lose your shot? You feel it grow stronger and stronger, before suddenly, nearby, a secondary, different-looking, but similar in size, worm comes bursting out of the base of the cavern.
Laura: Matthew Mercer! You're trying to kill us.
Matt: You can see now, as this bursts out, it's similar in size, but different. This one has a thicker body, it's a purple and white type exterior, and you can see frozen mist is just emanating from the outside of its open jaw.
Laura: No, this is the one that pukes ice.
Marisha: (laughs) Pukes ice?
Laura: This is what made the dude frozen!
Matt: As this one rears back, opens its jaw, and a burst of cold air and ice shards comes spraying out of its mouth--
Laura: Look at this cone you have.
Matt: Heading towards these-- actually, it would get the other worm too.
Laura: Yes! Yes! Freeze the other worm!
Matt: I need a constitution saving throw from Grog and Vax.
Liam: I want to do an Evasion, that's an area effect!
Matt: Yeah.
Liam: Yeah?
Matt: Make your constitution saving throw.
Liam: All right. (laughs) Do I do the dex save first, or--?
Matt: It's not a dex save. Constitution save.
Liam: Oh, it's not an area effect? All right. Whatever you say. Natural 20.
Travis: 21.
Matt: 21. All right. Good.
Travis: Saving throw, right? Constitution?
Matt: Constitution saving throw. So, read your ability real fast, does it affect only dex saves?
Liam: Evasion on dex save-- I've written an abbreviated version of this. It's area of effect, if it's like Fireball or anything that's in an area.
Matt: Right, but I think it may specify whether or not--
Liam: Oh, but you're god, what do you want me to do?
Matt: I'm just looking it up right now, give me a second.
Travis: Ooh! I have Danger Sense. I have advantage on dexterity saving throws.
Matt: This is not dexterity. This is constitution.
Sam: Oh, but you know what? I have really good dexterity.
Matt: Yep, dexterity saving throw. So this does not affect this attack. Sorry. All right, so you both take half damage, as does the creature.
Taliesin: That's a lot of rolling.
Sam: He's only rolling a d2. He's rolling a d2.
Matt: All right! That's 40 points of damage, halved, that's 20 points of cold damage to each of you, and the purple worm.
Liam: Wait, 40 or 20?
Travis: Holy shit.
Laura: It does 40 points?!
Liam: Can I do Uncanny-- this is a new round, can I do Uncanny or not, yet?
Matt: It has not gotten back to your turn, so no.
Laura: We're going to die!
Travis: No, we're good! Shut up! We're fine!
Matt: All right. Now! It's Keyleth's turn.
Marisha: Here's what I want to try and do. I want to try and hope to god I can get everyone in here.
Liam: Shake that hangover off, Kiki.
Marisha: I wanted to-- oh wait, I'm trying to point the fucking-- point the laser at the screen.
Matt: Yeah, don't point at the screen. Point it at the actual map. That's okay.
Marisha: I want to try and go-- five, ten, 15-- can I go through Grog? Through there?
Matt: You can try to, yeah.
Laura: You're going to go past the worm, though!
Marisha: Can I go there? Wait, wait, back closer to the-- I want to be able to try and-- can I see Scanlan and stuff, over there?
Matt: You can see Scanlan, you can see pretty much everybody but Trinket from this perspective, and you can't see Pike.
Laura: Shit.
Marisha: All right.
Laura: Thought I was helping.
Marisha: Everyone, I guess, who's within 30 range of me, I'm going to do a wind blast, and we all turn into poofy cloud versions of ourselves.
Matt: Which one is this?
Marisha: Wind Walk. Poofy Cloud. So as I run past Grog, I brush his shoulder, and he turns into a mist form, and I turn into a mist form, and then I blast it out, and everyone's mist form!
Matt: All right, cool. So while in mist form, you guys have a flying speed of 300 feet, you have resistance to non-magical weapons, you can only dash.
Marisha: Oh, you can't attack?
Matt: No. You've got to read your spell. You can take a minute to revert your form, but as of right now, all of you guys currently, everyone within 30 feet.
Sam: I'm not within 30 feet.
Matt: You can see within range, so you can't see Pike. You've got to read the spell. Does not affect Trinket because you can't see Trinket. Doesn't affect you guys. Scanlan is just out of range. So Vex and Scanlan, you're unaffected. You watch half of the party turn into these gaseous forms.
Sam: Oh my god, the worms have turned us all into clouds!
Laura: You've left us stranded. We're going to die.
Marisha: No, we're still there.
Matt: It takes a minute to revert to your actual form to be able to do any sort of attack.
Marisha: Man, that was going to be way cooler if we could still...
Taliesin: I'm going to do something insane. I've got some plans.
Marisha: It was a 6th-level spell.
Matt: I know.
Sam: It was so good.
Marisha: Thanks, guys. I feel so validated.
Liam: She just learned it yesterday!
Marisha: I did just learn it yesterday.
Matt: Vax, it's your turn.
Liam: And I'm made of wind?
Matt: You're made of wind. You can move. You can dash, or you can begin to revert, if you'd like.
Liam: I can begin to revert? So it's a minute-long process that I have to consciously decide, and I know this?
Matt: You get the feeling that if you want to return, it will take you a while because you don't really know what to do with your form.
Marisha: We could try and get the fuck out of here.
Liam: I'm going to use disengage and I'm going to fart over towards my sister and Pike.
Matt: You cannot disengage. You can only dash in this form.
Liam: Oh, then I'm going to dash towards my sister and Pike.
Laura: Pike is on the other side. Me and Scanlan.
Liam: Oh. Scanlan and Vex, sorry.
Matt: So you move over.
Sam: Not all short people look alike.
Matt: You dash over here. That guy's going to take an attack of opportunity on you. He's going to have disadvantage, technically, because you all of a sudden stopped moving and it just hears the sound. It rolled a three. No. It whips past you with its mouth biting at nothing.
Liam: I want to land and then start thinking, god, I wish I was not made of farts, and start trying to undo whatever this is.
Matt: Okay. Ten rounds later, you will be a physical entity.
Laura: Ten rounds?!
Matt: A minute.
Liam: Dispel Magic, little man!
Laura: Okay, can I see him? Can I shoot through him?
Matt: You can shoot through him. He'll take half damage.
Liam: I'm crouching!
Marisha: We could use this to our advantage and get the fuck away, so I don't feel like I just wasted a 6th-level spell. Just want to say.
Liam: Fog of war, man.
Matt: Do you have Dispel Magic, Scanlan?
Sam: That would have been great. (laughter)
Matt: Sorry.
Marisha: I technically do, but fuck that.
Laura: You can float up to the ceiling and then attack from high.
Marisha: I did learn Dispel Magic, but--
Sam: Well, dispel your own shit.
Marisha: No! Figure it out! Make it work for yourselves, assholes. That was a 6th-level spell, god damn it.
Matt: Did you make yourself mist, as well?
Marisha: Yeah! It's ten people!
Matt: You can't cast a spell in mist form, either.
Marisha: We're all shit out of luck! How does that feel?
Matt: So who's left, currently? That finishes Vax's turn.
Liam: Everyone who's a cloud, we're floating back to Emon. Let's go.
Taliesin: (singing) I can show you the world.
Marisha: I thought we could still attack, which would be way dope.
Matt: That would be dope, but that would be way too powerful a spell for sixth level. This is more of a means of travel spell, or a means of escape spell.
Liam: Let's solve the problem
Laura: But half of the party is still not able to escape.
Marisha: If you don't move, they'll go away.
Matt: This creature, now, having been hit by the terrifying Eyebite spell, its insides churning and the impact from damage it's taken, it's looking like it had a harsh round last turn. As all of the movement suddenly (poof) vanishes and there's no general movement, the last thing it recalls that was in its vicinity and still shifting with a heartbeat across the ground is you, Scanlan. (impact noise) It bursts out of the ground right in front of you. It brings its jaw down over the top, with disadvantage. That's a natural 20, so thank god it has disadvantage. 19.
Sam: I'm going to use Cutting Words to try and not have it hit me.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: I'll sing, (singing) do you really want to hurt me? Do you really want to bite my body? Okay, that taunts him.
Matt: Okay, go ahead and roll a d10 to reduce that from the attack.
Sam: A d10. this one? Wait, that's yours; why am I doing yours?
Matt: That's a 19 plus nine. This is 28 is what it rolled total.
Sam: 28 is what it rolled total?!
Matt: It rolled a 19 on the dice.
Sam: Oh fuck, even if I rolled a ten, I couldn't do anything. I rolled a three.
Matt: Okay, so as you're singing this, its jaw comes down on you (slamming sound), bites down painfully onto Scanlan for-- that's the wrong dice--
Taliesin: This could go worse.
Marisha: Shut up, Taliesin.
Matt: 19 points of piercing damage. And I need you to go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw.
Sam: I'm great at those. Dexterity saving throw. Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, sure, that's a five.
Matt: Those of you who are watching, you see as the mouth (impact sound) chomps down on Scanlan and as it pulls away, Scanlan is nowhere in sight, having been swallowed by the purple worm.
Taliesin: Oh, shit!
Matt: You are blinded and restrained, and yeah. You just see darkness and you feel the muscles constricting as you're forced down its throat. As your feet splash into what seems to be some sort of highly acidic liquid that resides in the inside of its body.
Sam: Tell me this, Dungeon Master. Earlier when I had done my Eyebite thing, I had my cone up here. When he grabbed me was the cone still close to my mouth?
Matt: Sure, we'll say that. However, I do need you to make a concentration check because of the damage you sustained on this.
Sam: Okay. Concentration check. Concentration? I've never rolled for concentration. Oh wait!
Matt: I know, I'm trying to keep up on that more now.
Sam: I have advantage on spell concentration.
Matt: Because of your feat that you took.
Sam: Well, that wasn't good either. So one was a five and one was a ten. Do I add anything to that?
Matt: All right so, it's a constitution saving throw and half the damage you took. So you're trying to beat a nine.
Sam: Constitution. So 12.
Matt: So 12. So yes, you succeed. So you currently, even though you're constrained, you're still maintaining your Eyebite spell against the purple worm.
Sam: Okay.
Matt: All right. So that ends the worm's turn. Scanlan, it is now your turn.
Sam: Great. I don't want be in here anymore.
Matt: Correct.
Sam: Can I look around? It's dark. It seems cozy. Seems nicer than outside right now, actually. I dip my finger in the acid. Ooo!
Matt: (sizzling sound) Not fun, not fun.
Sam: It's not good. So I'm going to make him barf me up.
Marisha: Oh that's right, it was sick, right?
Matt: It's sickened currently by the spell effect you put, yeah. SAM; I'm going to cast, at level five, Thunderwave. With my Hand Cone of Clarity up in my grill. I'm going to explode him from the inside.
Matt: All right, Thunderwave. So at fifth level, that would be an additional 4d8. That is 6d8 thunder damage.
Travis: Holy shit.
Sam: Where's the d8s?
Matt: It makes a constitution saving throw.
Travis: He's inside. Come on, Armageddon this motherfucker.
Matt: That is a 16 on the saving throw.
Sam: 19 is my save.
Matt: So, 6d8.
Sam: What's that? I've already lost count. 15 plus seven. Whatever that is.
Matt: 22 points of--
Sam: Wait 6d8, yeah okay.
Matt: Okay. It (impact sound) booms from the inside and you can see a central part of the worm (muffled boom) billow out like a cartoon as this bit of smoke emanates from its mouth. Just the sheer force of it forces you a little ways up its throat, but not enough to jettison yourself out of its body. Its muscles are too strong and you feel like you need to do a little more damage to it from the inside to be able to escape.
Sam: Okay. But it did hurt it, yes?
Matt: It hurt it, yeah. It took some damage. And at this point as well, you (grunt) feel your body being pulled inward and crushed by the muscles. Percy. You're up, Mr. Mistform.
Taliesin: Okay. These creatures have no eyes.
Matt: Correct.
Taliesin: I'm made of smoke.
Matt: (affirmative sound)
Taliesin: (sighs) Okay.
Travis: Yes. Well established.
Taliesin: As long as we're all clear here what's going on, that's fine. And I can just dash?
Matt: That's all you can do. Or begin to try and revert, which will take ten rounds.
Taliesin: Well, and can I still move around and do things while I'm trying to revert or is it-- Reverting. Am I just stuck reverting?
Matt: You know, that's a good question.
Taliesin: Can I just make the decision?
Matt: I think you can still move around, you just think you have to have concentration towards it, I'll have to--
Taliesin: I'm going to have my concentration on reverting. But in the meantime, I'm going to--
Matt: You can use your action to begin to revert your form, yeah.
Taliesin: I have to use my action?
Matt: However, nope! Reverting takes a minute, during which time a creature is incapacitated and can't move.
Taliesin: (sputtering)
Matt: So yeah. So currently--
Marisha: Yeah he's really married to this one.
Matt: It took me ten seconds to read it!
Liam: So to get out of this form, we have to stop and like meditate in one position for a full minute. What does it dissipate without doing that? How long does it take?
Matt: Eight hours.
Liam: Eight hours, good.
Marisha: Wait, what? No, no, no! One-- Oh no, yeah, you're right.
Sam: Can't you just kill it? Wait a second, hold on a second.
Marisha: Yeah, can I not kill it at all? I can't kill it?
Matt: Not if you're in wind form, no.
Marisha: Question. Can I switch to an animal form?
Matt: You cannot take any other action aside from dash or reverting when in this form.
Taliesin: Can I dash into one of the creatures?
Marisha: Why would you do that?
Matt: I mean, you could try to. You would surround it with smoke.
Laura: You're made of wind!
Taliesin: It wouldn't know that I was there? It wouldn't--
Travis: You could either dispel it or you could flee.
Taliesin: Okay, well I had the thought of maybe I could attempt to get them to attack each other.
Matt: I mean, that can be attempted. How are you going to do that? No, you can't talk in this form. What are you trying to do?
Taliesin: I'm attempting to tap them to get them to think that there's something happening where the worms are to get them to attack.
Sam: Like a Three Stooges thing.
Matt: Okay, so you swirl this way as a dash and attempt to make an impact. I'll say go ahead and make a strength check.
Taliesin: Really?
Matt: Yes. With disadvantage and a serious penalty. Because you're mist. Go for it.
Taliesin: Natural 20, Motherfucker!
Matt: Okay, roll again, because it's with disadvantage.
Taliesin: (screams) (laughter)
Liam: Here comes the one.
Taliesin: Baby, I know we've been arguing a lot lately. But I want you to know I take it all back, I take it all back. I'm going to buy you something so nice. I'm going to buy you ice cream. I'm going to buy you good ice cream! I'm going to go to Scoops. Three, motherfucker. (laughter)
Taliesin: Which brings me to four.
Matt: All right. As the coldish mist of Percy batters itself helplessly and ineffective against the body of the giant frost worm creature, seeming to no effect as it's now keeping itself attentive on what is nearby and within its range of motion.
Taliesin: I will use an action surge and start turning back into a normal human then.
Matt: Well, you can continue to use your movement; you only moved a short bit.
Taliesin: Oh, I'm going to move behind it then. That way. No, I mean far away from it. And then I'm going to use an action surge and start meditating on it.
Matt: Okay, it does attempt to take an attack of opportunity as it just feels you rush by. Nah, it misses. Rolled a two.
Taliesin: That's what it feels like, motherfucker.
Matt: All right. So, that end your turn?
Taliesin: Yeah that ended it.
Matt: All right, Vex, you're up.
Laura: Cool.
Sam: Vex, you and me babe, all we got to do is last ten rounds. Of course, all you hear is (muffled cries).
Laura: I know, I've got to save you!
Taliesin: Trinket's there too.
Laura: I know.
Matt: Oh, I get to make the save to see if the Eyebite maintains itself. That would be a-- no, it rolled a ten and it's minus two on its wisdom save. So it still has disadvantage on its attacks.
Laura: Okay, all right. Are there any stalactites coming from the ceiling?
Matt: There are, actually. There's a number of them. Just in this general vicinity there's a whole mess of them up above from just the natural formation of it.
Laura: Okay, I'm going to shoot Conjure Barrage at the ceiling and try to create noise away from us.
Matt: Whereabouts?
Laura: How about towards the ceiling above the frost worm?
Matt: Over there? Okay. All right, so, okay. The frost worm is in the way to hit that angle, so you may have to move to do so.
Laura: Which way could I shoot that he would not be in the way?
Matt: You have to probably move this way to get around him just to hit him at this angle just because it's such a large entity.
Laura: Huh? God, I don't know. I mean.
Matt: What you got?
Laura: I'm going to move as quietly as I can around towards that little crevice.
Matt: Go ahead and make a general dexterity check.
Laura: Just add my dexterity to it? 17?
Matt: 17? Okay. As you move past, stepping as gingerly as you can, you can see it slap; it moves its face in the direction of where you're going, but you just manage to move beyond where it thought you were, and it misses you as you move by. So now you have visual on it.
Laura: Okay. Now I want to shoot Conjure Barrage at the ceiling above the frost one.
Matt: Okay. Conjure Barrage up here. Go ahead and roll damage.
Laura: Okay. That is 3d8, I guess. 14 plus five. What's 14 plus five? 19.
Matt: 19 damage? All right. And with that, you release a blasting torrent of arrows at the ceiling in this giant cone blast. It strikes into the ceiling through the force of the magical bow that you're holding. You can see a number of rocks in bits and pieces begin to chip off, and a few small stalactites crack and plummet downward. I need a dex save from Grog and Keyleth.
Marisha: Dex save?
Matt: Dex save.
Liam: We still take damage in this form, right?
Matt: You do. You just take half damage from non-magical sources.
Marisha: Regular dexterity save or do we get advantage because we're misty?
Matt: You have resistance to non-magical weapons.
Marisha: Do we have advantage?
Matt: No. You take half damage because you're misty.
Marisha: I don't think I made my dexterity check.
Matt: What did you roll?
Marisha: A two.
Travis: I have advantage. Danger sense. Dexterity saving throws. Total of 20.
Matt: There you go. All right, so that is a total of seven damage to Keyleth, halved to four because you're in mist form. Seven damage to the frost worm.
Laura: Seven damage because of the stalactites?
Matt: Yep. They fell on it. Four damage to you.
Laura: I'm going to look over at Trinket, and I'm going to go--
Matt: Actually, no damage to you because you completely dodged out of the way.
Laura: I'm going to go like this to Trinket, and I'm going to shoot another arrow. I can't do the same thing. I'm going to shoot an arrow at the ceiling right above the frost thing, and then I'm going to use my bonus action to hide.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Okay. Oh, god. That didn't do any-- Well, I was hitting a stalactite, which is totally still, so it was 13?
Matt: 13? Because of your half-elf eyes, able to see in this dark interior of the cavern, I'd say yes, that hits. Barely.
Laura: So just a regular d8. Yep. 11.
Matt: 11 damage, all right. 11 damage. It falls. Yeah, it does not make its resistance to the fall, so the stalactite falls. Larger than the previous ones that were knocked out by the barrage that loosened it up. This one crumbles, slamming into the head of the frost worm for three points of bludgeoning damage. All right.
Laura: And then I stealth for 21 points of stealth.
Matt: Okay, good to know. All right. Ending your turn, it's now Pike. Pike, who currently is confused by the circumstances that have currently happened. She steps out. She's not mist. She steps out.
Laura: Why would you do that?! Why would you do that? You're going to kill her.
Travis: She would know better than that!
Laura: She would hide!
Liam: She could be our saving grace. Let the man--
Sam: She's the only one who's got arms and legs right now.
Matt: Keyleth left the alcove after saying stay still, she saw a few individuals turn to mist on the outside. She's very worried and confused by the circumstances.
Laura: I'm sorry, I didn't shoot an arrow. I just realized I didn't shoot an arrow at his worm and I meant to, and I'm sorry.
Sam: What worm? My worm?
Laura: The one that you're in.
Sam: You could have hit me! It's okay. Don't worry.
Matt: Pike comes around the corner. "Guys? What's happening?" And all she sees is you disappear into the shadows on the side, Trinket being very quiet, and mist swirling in the space around as these two giant worms (growls) as parts of the cavern are collapsing into it.
Laura: Can I do that to her?
Matt: She doesn't see you do it because you're hidden. No, she doesn't see you. She doesn't roll high enough perception. Right now, she feels alone and doesn't understand what she can possibly do in this. She doesn't have any indication of what to do in the circumstance, so she is going to--
Travis: Does Pike have Dispel Magic?
Matt: She does.
Sam: She doesn't even know--
Matt: She doesn't know what's happening. She's going to cast Flame Strike, 5th-level spell. It's a ten-foot radius. She's going to blast this one right here, which is the one she sees now closest to her proximity and being ice-based. So that's 8d6 radiant damage.
Sam: Hey! Nice job, Pike!
Matt: 32 points of fire damage. Does not make its save. Suddenly from the ground, you see the rocks shake and lift for a second before a beam of divine fire (explosion) comes bursting out of the ground in a ten-foot radius around this worm. However, I do need a dexterity saving throw from both Grog and Keyleth.
Travis: Okay.
Liam: Keep your head in the game!
Travis: 18.
Marisha: What? Shut up, Liam.
Liam: Get it. Get it, girl, get it.
Marisha: 16.
Matt: 16? So that's going to be 32 damage to that. That's going to be 16 damage to you, Grog, and 32 damage to you, Keyleth.
Marisha: All right, 32.
Matt: Fire and radiant damage. As she just sees mist in the air around the frost worm and has no indication of exactly what happened. However, the frost worm did take it as well. That's going to end her turn as she isn't quite sure what to do at that point. That brings us to the top of the round, Grog.
Travis: What do I--? I can't leave.
Laura: Just back away from it.
Travis: I'll just back up to the tunnel leading out of the-- yeah.
Matt: Okay. All right, that brings us to--
Travis: Oh, and I'd like to start to revert, if I could.
Matt: Okay. You'll be there for a minute doing so. You can't move any further. You can't move, you're just sitting there focusing on-- incapacitated.
Travis: No, I don't start to revert.
Matt: Okay. All right, that completes your turn. Now we come to the frost worm's turn. The frost worm, first and foremost, it gets its frost breath back. It turns this way, burrows underneath, and, seeing all the movement to this side, goes ahead and unleashes a secondary frost breath in this direction. That will only affect the purple worm and Vax. I need you guys to make constitution saving throws.
Liam: And I can't remember, Evasion has nothing to do with this?
Matt: Correct.
Liam: Okay, I'm going to use Luck. My last Luck. That's not good. So constitution save?
Matt: Correct.
Liam: Seven.
Matt: Seven? Nope. Purple worm also does not make it, so that'll be to both of you...
Laura: So obviously these worms don't even care about each other at all.
Matt: No. Seemingly, in this moment you see now, there is not a kinship between them. If anything, they both arrived due to feeling the same movement and one is currently now attacking whatever is large and in the area that it doesn't recognise the center movement of.
Marisha: Does that mean we could just get them fighting each other?
Laura: That is what I'm thinking, we could get them to fight.
Matt: 36 points of cold damage to you. 36 points to the purple worm.
Sam: That halved?
Matt: No, it is magical damage, not blunt damage, so you just take it. Especially as mist, cold is bad as mist. All right, so with that, the purple--
Sam: Wait. Doesn't my worm take it too?
Matt: He did. Both of them are still there.
Sam: Still alive?
Matt: Yeah. Looking a little rough, but it's still alive. All right, that ends its turn. Now it's Keyleth's turn.
Marisha: Okay, here's my question.
Matt: Yep?
Travis: Probably no.
Marisha: I know. (laughter)
Sam: Can I juggle while I'm a mist?
Matt: If you wanted to, because it is your spell that you cast, even though it's technically not concentration--
Marisha: I will say, we all failed in reading it, also--
Sam: Don't do this, don't do this!
Taliesin: (laughs) Can't win.
Laura: It's also what? What does it say?
Marisha: Nothing.
Taliesin: I'll say it if it makes you feel better?
Liam: Why don't we let him say what he was going to say?
Matt: What were you going to say?
Marisha: Nothing.
Matt: No, what's up?
Marisha: I'm afraid now.
Taliesin: As you should be. You're defying god.
Sam: What were you going to say, Matt?
Marisha: Yeah, what were you going to say? (laughs) I like that question.
Laura: Yeah, right? Since you cast it, you could break your concentration?
Matt: I'm saying, because you cast a spell that wasn't a concentration spell, if it was a positive effect, which it technically is, and you did not want it, you could cancel the spell. I'd let you do that. If you wanted to. What did I not read?
Marisha: We all failed in reading it.
Taliesin: Casting time.
Matt: One action.
Taliesin: No.
Taliesin: One minute.
Marisha: One minute.
Matt: It says one action on my thing.
Marisha: It says one action on yours? It says one minute on mine.
Matt: Does it?
Marisha: Yes, it does.
Matt: Thank you, Fight Club Five.
Marisha: No, it's different. It says casting time one minute.
Matt: Let's see what the Player's Handbook says.
Taliesin: Consult the book.
Laura: It doesn't matter, it already happened.
Marisha: It already happened, so it doesn't matter.
Travis: Shouldn't there be an ad for Gilmore's Glorious Goods right about now?
Marisha: Yeah, it's already happened, we're already committed.
Matt: In the Player's Handbook, Wind Walk is one minute, you're right.
Marisha: One minute. So Fight Club failed.
Matt: Fight Club Five failed.
Sam: This is a reverse ad for Fight Club Five.
Matt: Or I have to update it. Either way. No, It might have been fixed since, I've just got to update it. All right. Well, anyway. In a bit of druidic inspiration, you manage to, very quickly, for the first time--
Marisha: I mean, I'm still willing to commit to it. It's fine.
Matt: Being as an Air Ashari, this is your realm of expertise, and your first time using it, you were so excited that you managed to accelerate the casting of the spell, regardless of the situation it may have created, so, what do you want to do?
Marisha: So I accelerated the casting of the spell.
Laura: So you can cancel it if you feel like canceling it.
Sam: If you want to.
Laura: Some people's brothers in the room are at a really low health level right now. I don't know who we're talking about, but some people's brothers--
Marisha: Are you giving me an out because you feel bad? Because if you're giving me an out--
Matt: No, because technically it shouldn't have happened, because it was a one-minute casting time. There are many things in that spell that were not read, by the caster, so I'm giving you the opportunity to correct the mistake, if you wish not to take it, you can.
Taliesin: I read the card too, I didn't see it.
Marisha: He did read the card too, and we all thought it was a good idea.
Matt: This was a very hard and valuable lesson for casters.
Laura: We're in the middle of a battle.
Marisha: (laughing) For my own shame. All right fine, I'll drop the spell 'cause I feel really bad about it. But on my way down, okay, here's my question, because I want to make these fuckers fight each other. So, is there loose rock along the edge of the wall?
Laura: I dropped stalactites on them. So yeah, there's lots of loose rock.
Matt: Yeah. And there's rubble on the ground next to it from where the original cave-in happened
Marisha: Okay, so as I'm dropping the spell--
Matt: All of you who are mist form now revert, and you fall about five to ten feet and catch yourself on the ground, no harm no foul.
Marisha: As I revert back can I slide down that wall to create some--
Matt: Did you want to move first over here to do it?
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: So you shift over, you drop the spell.
Marisha: Uh-huh, I drop the spell, and as I drop the spell I want to grab some wall and bring it down to make a big vibration, right in between these two motherfuckers.
Matt: Okay. Make a strength check.
Marisha: Oh, jeez Louise. Oh, that's not too bad. It's not a saving throw.
Matt: Correct. Just a strength check; add your strength modifier.
Marisha: 18?
Matt: 18. All right. So, as you slide down, you grab onto some of the loose rock and (rockslide) they come tumbling down as you slide down. So you land here, at the base of the two worms, and rocks tumble around you at the base of the cave-in. And you get the sensation that you may have made a decent bit of racket right around your feet.
Marisha: Uh-huh. Do I have any movement?
Matt: I'd say you have half your movement.
Marisha: Oh, Jesus Christ. Can I just tiptoe backwards towards Percy? Or should I-- You know what? I'm going to stay. I'm just going to stay right there. Is that even worse of a decision?
Matt: I don't know. What do you want to do?
Marisha: I'm just going to-- up against the wall. And not move.
Matt: Okay. You're going to Doctor Grant this.
Marisha: I'm going to Doctor Grant it.
Matt: Got it. Okay. Keyleth, that ends your turn, Vax, you're up. You now have your physical form again.
Liam: Okay. I look around really fast, run up to my sister, give her a giant hug, and (magic sound) Dimension Door over to where Grog is.
Sam: You can Dimension Door; I keep forgetting that!
Matt: So as you rush over and grab onto her, you both (poof!) in a Nightcrawler-esque poof of smoke, as it settles, you are both no longer there, as-- What's the range on the Dimension Door?
Liam: Oh, it's so far, it's like 500 feet I believe. I'll find it.
Matt: I believe it is. Dimension Door, yeah, it's fine. 300 feet, you're fine. You guys appear over by Grog now.
Laura: Is that the edge of a cliff over on that side?
Matt: It goes right to the edge, right there, and this is where it would go down the side of a giant, icy mountain. You guys are at the very, very top of a very cold, cragulous part of the Cliffkeep Mountains.
Laura: Got it.
Liam: I'm hasted; do I have one or two attacks at this point?
Matt: You have one attack right now.
Liam: One attack? Okay.
Matt: You went up and did your action already.
Liam: Action. Okay. Well then, I'm going to throw a dagger at the back of the frost one.
Matt: Okay. What's the range on your dagger?
Liam: It's 60 feet, Sharpshooter, no disadvantage.
Matt: 60 feet. Just misses. You go (knife sound) and it just tumbles, scrapes across the ground, stops at the base of the worm, and then vanishes. All right, that ends your turn. Now it is this guy's turn. At the top of his turn, Scanlan, you-- all right.
Sam: I'm in a nice womb.
Matt: You take...
Travis: Uh-oh.
Taliesin: All the damage.
Travis: He grimaced. Still rolling.
Matt: 23 points of acid damage as it begins to digest you from the inside.
Sam: Aren't I immune to acid damage?
Matt: Are you?
Sam: Because of the feast?
Matt: No, poison.
Sam: Isn't that the same thing?
Matt: No. (laughter)
Matt: All right. So. The--
Laura: Somebody's got something of Acid Resistance, though. Somebody has an item.
Liam: I had armor and I gave it to someone, I don't have it anymore.
Matt: As the frost worm and the purple worm are now clashing in this space, they both turn, hearing the sound. Now, the frost damage that had impacted the purple worm last turn, let's see if it-- Nope! It's going to retaliate for that, it's going to attempt to make a bite attack against the frost worm. That is going to be a 12, that is going to miss. However, hearing the noise, it's going to make a tail attack at the direction that Keyleth is-- That's a natural one. As it arcs through, it (impact) right next to your head and then pulls out of the rubble. The rock to your left is now cracked and broken with a giant hole where the stinger had placed itself.
Marisha: I hold my breath.
Matt: Yeah. Disadvantage on those attacks from that Eyebite is really bad. So that's been very helpful from Scanlan's point. By the way, Scanlan, make another concentration check because of the--
Sam: Concentration check. Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay. 18 and 19.
Matt: Yeah, you're fine. Okay. That ends the purple worm's turn, it's going to stay right there. Actually, no. It's going to burrow away, as currently it's made its attacks. It's going to burrow into the ground, and is currently not within anyone's visual range.
Laura: I have it Hunter's Marked, can I feel it?
Matt: You can sense that it's underneath the ground, somewhere in this cavern.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: That brings us to Scanlan.
Sam: It's going down.
Matt: It's going through the ground, you feel it moving around.
Taliesin: Shake it, shake it, shake it.
Sam: So it has poison, right? It's poisoned me-- Oh, it has acid.
Matt: Yeah. It's acid. You're feeling yourself digest within its body.
Sam: Can I make an intelligence check to see if I know anything about these creatures?
Matt: You can if you'd like to, from the inside of its body, yeah, go ahead.
Sam: Is that my action? No, it's...
Matt: No, no, no, I'll let you do it because you've been very close and personal with it.
Taliesin: You've had a lot of time to think.
Sam: Specifically what I'm trying to remember from my encounters in the past is if it has any resistance to poison damage.
Matt: Go for it.
Sam: What am I doing? Intelligence?
Matt: Intelligence. Add your intelligence modifier.
Sam: 16. 16.
Matt: 16, okay. You've heard of these types of entities before. You're uncertain whether or not it has a resistance to poison, per se. You get the sensation probably, based on the fact that it uses poison, you would think so, but nothing else about its body seems to be poison-related or of the essence of poison.
Sam: But it does use poison?
Matt: As part of its tail. The stinger you saw it use earlier does seem to have some--
Sam: Oh, gotcha. Okay, so it probably does have poison resistance. Okay.
Matt: You don't know. But you do know, also, that if you were able to probably do enough damage from the inside, it would probably throw you back up. You also get the sense that since you're currently underground, now would be a bad time to do that.
Sam: Well, I'm in a tunnel, right?
Matt: As far as you know, yeah.
Laura: There could be other worms around.
Sam: He disappeared down-- well, I don't know anything! Okay, all right, I can feel him moving, so I don't know where I am anymore. So I don't want to Dimension Door out, because I don't know where I'd end up. So instead I will cast Stinking Cloud inside-- No, no, no! No. No, no. Cancel! Belay that order! Shit! Because I think he's immune to poison, so I'm not going to do that. I'm going to-- Fuck! There's nothing I can do!
Laura: Can you take a healing potion in case he starts to digest you some more?
Sam: (strained) I'm like this right now. I can't do anything.
Laura: Can you go like that, and get a healing potion and (mumbled) go like that?
Sam: I am My Left Foot. Yeah, I can't reach a wand. I don't want to get rid of--
Matt: You could Dimension Door, in theory.
Sam: But I don't know where I'd end up?
Matt: As part of the spell you can either visualize a place you can see, or one you can describe by stating distance and direction. So you've already been inside the room, you know what it looks like, so if you think you're somewhat close by--
Sam: So even if I've moved since I saw it last, I can still Dimension Door to where I think--?
Matt: In theory, yeah.
Sam: Okay, then I will do that. I will do that.
Matt: Okay. Where do you want to appear within the room?
Sam: I want to appear where Vex was before.
Matt: Okay. So, you--
Laura: No, I was further over.
Matt: He didn't see that. Last thing he saw was you were right next to him before he got eaten. So you disappear from the inside of its stomach and appear in a puff of smoke.
Sam: Goo! Goo all over me! Ew! Oh, and then I see-- I've seen the other worm before, right?
Matt: Briefly, before you were swallowed, yes.
Sam: And I get my bearings, and I can see Pike, I can see Trinket.
Marisha: You also see me against a wall right next to you.
Sam: So I will shake it off, I will inspire Keyleth and say, (singing) I only want to see you slicing up that purple worm!
All: (singing) Purple worm! Purple worm!
Sam: Ooh! Okay, that's good.
Matt: d10 inspiration die to you, Keyleth.
Marisha: I love that song!
Matt: Ends your turn, Scanlan. Percy, you're up. You just caught yourself on the ground on the far end, by the tunnel.
Taliesin: I want to hold my turn until the other worm returns.
Matt: Hold your action, you mean? So you want to move anywhere or are you going to stay where you are?
Taliesin: Not going to move anywhere, just going to stay right there.
Matt: All right. Cool. That ends Percy's turn as he's holding his action until it returns. Vex, you're up.
Laura: I'm going to shoot from my Blazing Bowstring at the icy worm.
Matt: That's your second and final use this day.
Laura: Yeah, I know. 17?
Matt: 17 unfortunately misses. Your flaming arrow streaks off the darkness of the cavern and just passes it before it slams against the far cave wall.
Laura: Balls, balls, balls! So I'm going to shoot-- Nope, not going to do that. I'm going to shoot a regular old arrow at him!
Matt: Do it! Hey, those are still helpful.
Laura: And it doesn't do anything. It goes right past him, and hits the wall, and he looks towards the wall.
Matt: An arrow isn't a very hefty thing when it's by itself hitting stonework. It makes a noise, you can barely make out, we'll see if it's enough to distract it. Are you going to stay where you are?
Laura: Oh, I could have used my inspiration. I should have used it on the Blazing Bowstring one.
Sam: Hey man, whatever.
Matt: What are you going to do? Are you going to move? Do you want Trinket to move? Are you going to stay where you are?
Laura: Everybody's staying!
Matt: Okay, gotcha. All right, Pike, now, seeing everyone revert, and seeing this kind of awkward situation of these creatures moving about is going to-- Yeah, and-- She can't see you because you're on the other side of the wall.
Laura: Can I use my bonus action to hide?
Matt: Sure.
Laura: I do that!
Matt: I would recommend moving to one side of the cavern or the other, because right now you're still out in the open. It's kind of hard to hide if you have nowhere to hide. But you also get the feeling that these creatures-- being visually hidden is not affecting it at all.
Laura: Doesn't matter? Then I don't do anything!
Matt: All right. So you stay still. Pike stands still, figuring that it was helpful last time but feeling bad for accidentally-- now seeing the mist reverting to her friends-- that she blasted them on the previous round. Let's see. She didn't realized in the moment that you guys turned into mist while she was in the corner.
Travis: It's all right. I've had worse.
Matt: I'm pretty sure she has another 5th-level spell, and this would be the last of them. She's going to go ahead and Flame Strike again on the frost worm. This time centering it around there, so the ten-foot radius only hits the worm and doesn't see any allies nearby. So that will be 8d6. 33 points of damage.
Laura: Go, Pike!
Matt: Natural 20 on the save, though, so it takes half the damage.
Laura: Damn you! Dick.
Matt: 17 points to the frost worm. All right, Pike casts that and then stays perfectly still in space, she still has some motion and some speech to it, but her feet are planted firmly on the ground. Hopefully that's enough. And that finishes her turn. Back to the top: Grog.
Travis: Did you hold your action?
Taliesin: I held my action
Travis: Until when?
Taliesin: Until the other worm returns.
Travis: I'll do the same thing.
Matt: Okay. The frost worm, it's now its turn. It does not get its frost breath. However--
Taliesin: There's a rock slide to its right.
Matt: It is! There is a rock slide. That Keyleth is standing in. Thank you for the reminder.
Taliesin: Damn it! Sorry.
Marisha: Thanks for that.
Matt: It's going to turn around. You can see now, its tail emerges, and it's going to arc up and try and bite and slam in your direction with both sides of its body at once. This tail does not have a stinger on it, but it is still a giant bludgeoning implement. First attack is going to be a 19 to hit?
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: Next one is going to be a 16 to hit.
Marisha: No.
Matt: All right, so the tail slams on the ground next to you, estimating your position and failing and just hitting the rocks that you had slid down. However, it does bite down with its open, icy jaws. You take 17 points of piercing damage, as well as an additional six points of cold damage.
Marisha: Bringing it to a total of 22?
Matt: 22, yeah.
Taliesin: Sorry.
Marisha: I deserved that.
Taliesin: We live in a cold, cold world. No one deserves anything.
Matt: Let's see if it makes any sort of perception check. Okay, cool. That ends its turn. It's now Keyleth's turn.
Marisha: So does it know that I'm there since it just took a big chunk out of me?
Matt: It senses that it impacted something and something that reacted and tasted like it had been bitten, so you get the sense that it knows you're there.
Marisha: All right. I'm in arm's length of it, right?
Matt: You are.
Marisha: I'm going to reach out and cast Blight on it.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: You touch me when you're trying to touch the worm. I don't know how--
Matt: Cast Blight on Taliesin! All right. Constitution saving throw. What's the DC on that?
Marisha: 18.
Matt: 18. It does not make it. 16. So 8d8 necrotic damage to it.
Sam: Necrotic damage? Best kind.
Marisha: Oh, jeez. What was that? Seven. Seven plus five. Seven, eight, 13, 16, and then another 12. Where was I at? 18. Oh, so 28, 32, 33 points.
Matt: 33 points of necrotic damage to the frost worm. As you reach out with your hand and grasp it, you can see now its icy white exterior all of a sudden shudders in place and you can see small cracks of black veins begin to spring out from your hands into its body. Its frozen breath all of a sudden thaws briefly into a dripping drool as it is stunned momentarily, and it pulls away, wrestling itself from your grasp. It did not enjoy that at all. So that's your action.
Marisha: I'm going to once again not move. Can I go ahead and cast Healing Word on myself?
Matt: As a bonus action? I don't see why not.
Marisha: Nine, total. That does help.
Matt: That ends your turn, Keyleth. Vax, you're up.
Liam: All right. I want to see if I can use the haste to do double distance to get behind Pike in that little alcove. If I can't go that far, I'll use dash to get behind her.
Matt: You could. You can get behind her.
Liam: Without the dash?
Matt: Yeah, because of your haste, you can move 60 feet.
Liam: I'm standing right behind her and I say, Pike, I'm a little banged up. Dagger, dagger, dagger.
Matt: Okay, go for it. It is just-- or no, it's within 30 feet.
Liam: 17 for the first. 21 for the second.
Matt: Hits, hits.
Liam: 18 for the third.
Matt: All three hit.
Laura: Is it sneak attack because Keyleth's standing right next to it?
Liam: All right, so first one is four. This is doubled, so that's 15 plus... 16, 21, 25, 28, 36 for the first.
Matt: All right.
Liam: Second one is nine, and the third one is ten.
Taliesin: Damn.
Matt: All right, as your barrage of blades (spinning noises) go spinning right over Pike's head, she feels the actual wind distortion (puff) past her hair, sending strands kind of wafting in front of her face as she just stays perfectly still, trusting you. The blades all (impacts) sinking into it, one of which strikes an area of the side of its body armor where the plates on the armor had seemed to be cracked from the blackened veins from her Blight spell. As it does, the dagger doesn't even stop and plunges directly into its body, and you can see a gout of dark, deep red blood just (spurt) out from the wound. It (screeches) shakes in place from the impact, the pain, it's starting to look a little harsh.
Liam: Done.
Matt: All right, ends your turn! That brings us to the purple worm.
Laura: (singing) Purple worm.
Laura: (singing) Purple worm.
Marisha: (singing) Purple worm.
Matt: Purple worm is going to now emerge from the impact--
Marisha: Come on, fight the big cocksucker.
Matt: It's going to burst out from the ground where you and Pike are as the last motion that it felt was you rushing over across the ground. (boom) It comes tearing through, making its bite attack against you and its tail attack against you as well, because of Pike not moving.
Liam: Question!
Matt: Yes?
Liam: Pike probably doesn't, but do I have any advantage being that I'm in this little closed-in bubble?
Matt: Technically, no, because it has reach. And it just kinda swerves around the inside and it knows this cavern pretty well as it's been through here a few times. So. That's going to be a 23 to hit on you?
Liam: Of course that hits.
Matt: For the bite attack.
Sam: Even with its disadvantage?
Matt: Oh, with the disadvantage-- sorry, the second roll-- thank you for reminding me there. It would have been a 13 on the second one plus nine, that would be 20.
Liam: Still hits! Uncanny Dodge please! To halve the damage.
Matt: To halve the damage? Yeah, you can do that on this one. But first then there's the bite. I will do that now. That is 21 points of piercing damage?
Liam: Unconscious.
Matt: With it halved?
Liam: 21 halved?
Matt: 21 halved would put you at 11.
Liam: Oh, yeah. Okay, no, I'm still on my feet.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: (dazed mumbling)
Matt: The tail stinger's going to swing at you with disadvantage. That is 14. Rolled a six and a five. So, as the bite clamps down at you its tail tries to strike at you but misses entirely. However, its jaws attempt to close around you, I need you to go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw.
Liam: Hold on. 16.
Matt: 16. As you try and move out of the way, it's not quite fast enough as darkness takes you, the mouth (slam shut sound) clamps around you, (gulp noise) and you are swallowed.
Laura: You didn't even get healed! (panicked gasp)
Liam: Still conscious.
Matt: That ends its turn. Now having it appeared, as this round has happened, I would like both Grog and Percy to--
Taliesin: I'm going to shoot the purple thing with a violent shot.
Matt: How many points into it?
Taliesin: I'm going to drop all three points into violent shot.
Matt: Okay! That adds plus six to your misfire. So you have like a 46% chance of misfiring on this shot.
Taliesin: If I roll a six. A six or lower. It--
Matt: Well, it adds plus two to your misfire per point spent.
Taliesin: Oh! Never mind then! Oh shit! Then never mind. Then I'm just going to take two points of violent shot. So that's--
Matt: So that would bring it to a misfire of seven.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: Okay! So take your shot.
Marisha: You misfire on a seven or lower?
Taliesin: Yep.
Marisha: Holy shit, Taliesin!
Matt: But if he hits it's two additional dice damage to it.
Marisha: Come on, Golden Snitch!
Taliesin: Seven.
Matt: You rolled a seven?
Taliesin: I rolled a seven.
Matt: As you rear back, get ready to fire, all of a sudden, you pull the trigger and the way that you had customized the barrel to blast additional black powder blows up in your face and the gun actually bends out of the way and you feel the impact--
Taliesin: Wait! I get to reroll something, don't I? Where is it? Where is it? Aw. Do I get a reroll? Yeah. One save reroll per---
Matt: That's a saving throw reroll, that's not an attack, unfortunately. Yeah, the weapon misfires, doesn't do damage to you but the blast does not take off. You would have to repair the Bad News to use it again.
Taliesin: Okay, I'm going to pull out my new gun and take two shots.
Matt: Okay, so you drop Bad News, take two shots. Go for it.
Taliesin: God damn it. (sighs)
Travis: Come on, Percy!
Taliesin: That hits! That's a 21.
Matt: That hits.
Taliesin: I'm just going to roll the other one, too. And that's a 30, that hits. So that's, plus 12. Eight, 15, 25. That's 27 points of damage.
Sam: Lot of things going on in Matt Mercer's head right now.
Matt: All right. How do you want to do this?
Marisha: Thank god! Such an asshole.
Taliesin: Bad News is down, I toss it to the ground, I pull out the new one. I take my shot just to get its attention to get one in the mouth.
Matt: Okay, as you take one shot (gunshot noise) it blast the side of the wall, its head turns towards you, seeing the sudden movement, and as you do you aim up, aiming for the back of its head. You fire. This time the bullet strikes true, right into the back of its throat. You can see now (explosion noise) the blowout which is a small hole in the back of its throat, you can see the cavern behind it and a little bit of light that is peeking through. It (groans) and just (impact) falls across the ground here. The Eyebite spell no longer effective but it is, currently, still there, holding the area.
Liam: (muffled) I'm still in here.
Matt: Yep, you feel it (impact) collapse on the ground and it's not moving and the muscles go lax around you.
Laura: That's good, so you can move a little bit.
Matt: It's now Grog's turn.
Travis: I can't go get him, though, 'cause the other dick lord is still on the map.
Liam: (muffled) I'm in acid in here.
Travis: I can't get to him. I'll run up to the dead earthworm and try and cut Vax out of his stupid stomach. With Craven Edge.
Matt: As you rush up, leaping onto the body of the now-deceased purple worm, you bring the blade up and begin carving through. Go ahead and I'll say you manage to, over the course of this round, you don't have to roll for it. You just begin to tear through it with the blade repeatedly, gashing it open until eventually you can feel the blows from the outside.
Travis: Did I just help midwife Vax out of this thing?
Matt: Just a moment. I would like you to go ahead and make an attack roll with disadvantage.
Laura: An attack.
Travis: 20.
Liam: Hits!
Matt: All right, go ahead and roll damage.
Liam: I mean, I'm unconscious.
Marisha: You're unconscious?
Laura: Well, he will be once he takes his damage.
Travis: 17.
Liam: Unconscious--
Matt: 17, so, as you strike through you feel yourself hit something else within the purple worm, and as the wound opens up, you can see Vax's bleeding, unconscious form slip out of the purple worm's body, onto the ground of the icy cavern.
Travis: Ew.
Laura: You just killed my brother.
Liam: I'm unconscious.
Matt: All right, that ends your turn?
Travis: It was only one-- it was a couple of strikes to get him out, right?
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: Yeah, that ends it.
Matt: All right. (laughter)
Sam: Killed Vax.
Matt: That was your saved attack. Now, finishing that turn, Scanlan, you are up.
Sam: Ah, me? oh. Hello, hello. (laughs) I will kill it with fire. Well, let's see, can I see Vax over there in the worm juice?
Matt: No, not from your position. As far as you know, he's still been swallowed.
Sam: Then I'll kill it with fire. I will use my Wand of Fireballs to blast balls at it.
Taliesin: Your balls of fire wand.
Sam: My balls of fire, and I won't hit Key, will I?
Matt: Currently, if you aim it properly. It's a big radial spell.
Laura: Oh no, it's going to get Keyleth.
Sam: Oh, it's that radius!
Matt: Yes. You could aim it in such a way--
Sam: Forget it, I'll just do Lightning Bolt instead.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: That's a huge radius.
Matt: Fireball's a powerful, dangerous spell, if things are in close quarters, but against mass amounts of enemies, it's brilliant.
Sam: So I take two steps to my right, so no one else is in the line and I will lightning it instead.
Matt: All right. Go for it, go ahead and roll damage.
Sam: 8d6, yeah?
Matt: Yep, that is an 11 on its dexterity saving throw. Full damage.
Sam: 31.
Matt: 31 points of lightning damage to it. All righty! As you step to the side, releasing the bolt of lighting energy, it blasts into the front of its face. You can see one of its jaw mandibles gets torn off from part of the impact, you can see now the deep red blood begin to pool on the side of its face and drip down as it looks over, whipping its head in your direction.
Sam: (whimpers) Do I still have any movement?
Matt: Yeah, you only moved ten feet, so you still have 15 more feet.
Sam: I'm going to try to shuffle back into the tunnel there a little bit. And for my bonus, I'll Healing Word myself.
Matt: Go for it.
Sam: Okay, what is that, d4? Great, yeah, six points. Awesome.
Matt: All right, that finishes Scanlan's turn. Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: I'm going to take another shot at the big icy worm.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: I'm just going to take two normal, everyday shots because things have been weird. It's got to be close to death now. That's 17.
Matt: 17 just barely hits.
Taliesin: And 24.
Matt: Okay, both hit.
Laura: Get it, Percy!
Matt: Your pistol now needs to be reloaded.
Taliesin: Yes. Well, that's my third-- Third attack is to reload. I keep track, I'm good. 21 points of damage.
Matt: Good. (gun firing twice) Both shots go off, (click) the third one kind of clicking. You go to reload, you can see both blast across the front of its body, leaving little reddish dots on its midsection as each bullet sinks into it. It's still standing, still writhing about. You can see it's bleeding from many different wounds and it's not looking too great, but it's still standing. Stay where you are or you going to--?
Taliesin: Oh yeah, I'm staying where I am.
Matt: All right, Vex, you're up.
Laura: I'm going to Hunter's Mark him.
Matt: All righty!
Laura: And I'm going to shoot two arrows at him. Because what else am I going to do? Oh, Pike can help you.
Travis: He's unconscious; don't listen to that piece of shit.
Laura: I can't tell what happened; Grog went to save you.
Liam: Huh? Oh, yeah.
Laura: 29 on the first hit.
Matt: 29 hits.
Laura: And 27 on the second hit.
Matt: Both hit.
Laura: Okay. 20 on the first hit.
Matt: Nice.
Laura: 18 on the second hit.
Matt: Got it. Both arrows (impacts) sticking into its side, you can now see multitudes of the shafts sticking out. It's still standing. It's a hardy, hardy creature. You want to move or you want to stay where you are?
Laura: I'm going to stay where I am.
Matt: Okay. That's all right, ends your turn. Trinket's still sitting there wanting to help, but not able to do anything. All right.
Sam: So you mean, Trinket is doing what Trinket always--
Laura: Shut up! (laughter)
Matt: Pike screams out, "Vax!" and runs up the body, climbs up to the top and jumps off, landing next to your unconscious self. Reaches down and is going to use her one 6th-level spell, Heal.
Marisha: Ooh!
Matt: So you immediately regain 70 hit points.
Laura: Whoa!
Travis: It's like Pulp Fiction with the adrenaline shot.
Matt: Clerics, man! You come to consciousness, taking the deep breath-- The cold air from the cavern that you inhale stings your lungs, and you look over and Pike's there before you, eyes wide. Goes from a serious frown and a worried, furrowed brow to a big smile as you come back to consciousness. "Vax!" as she goes and hugs you.
Liam: And I clap my hand here and I leave a big, gory, slimy smear right on the half of her face. Thank you, Pike.
Matt: So you're back up, that finishes her round. Grog, you're up.
Travis: We are still hungry! And I rush up to giant dick smear.
Matt: Leaping over-- (grunt, running sounds)
Travis: And I would like to use reckless attack on my first of all three great weapon master.
Matt: Okay. You can use them all. All of them are affected now.
Travis: Let's do that.
Matt: All right! So, advantage on all of your attacks.
Travis: That's a 23.
Matt: Hits.
Travis: Oh, Jesus. What's 29 minus five? 24.
Matt: Hits.
Travis: That probably--
Laura: That hits, too.
Travis: Yeah. I've got to do the math. 22.
Matt: All right, go ahead and roll damage.
Travis: Okay. 12. 20, plus ten, 30 for the first one. Eight. 13. 21, 31 for the second one.
Laura: Grog, you've never been so hot!
Travis: Three, eight, 16, 26 for the third one.
Matt: 26. How do you want to do this?
Travis: I'd like to take Craven Edge and jump up, straight up, as high as I can and drive it straight into the top of its cavity and just drag it down and open it up like a beautiful bouquet.
Matt: As you see Grog staple himself to the top of this now-standing, 20-25 foot tall creature, he, using his barbarian strength to leap up on the top, sinking the blade into the back of its head. Immediately it rears back, its whole back arching. As it does so, you just use the heft of your weight, grinning as you drive the blade down the entirety of its body. As you grind down to the surface, you can see its armored back just pop open, like a freshly cooked sausage-- just the insides spill out onto the ground. By the time Grog reaches the ground, you are coated in thick, thick crimson. Strangely enough, even though the blood is liquid, you feel almost like this crystalline force, like there are actually ice crystals within the blood stream itself from the cold that emanates from its body--
Travis: Like Icy Hot.
Matt: Yes! And as you land and hit the ground, its body slaps forward, barely missing Keyleth as it wet hits the ground. Almost like a shrimp that had its entire back torn open. It's just in two pieces face down on the ground. Right there.
Marisha: Good work, Grog.
Travis: I want more. Who's next?
Liam: Shh!
Laura: Calm down, Grog! Calm your tits, Grog!
Travis: Can I look in the blade and go  that was good, wasn't it?
Matt: "You did good, my friend. Very, very good."
Marisha: Hi, Grog.
Sam: Who you talking to, Grog?
Travis: That was good, wasn't it?
Marisha: It was very good, yeah! You did good!
Travis: Well, fucking answer me next time, Jesus!
Sam: Sorry!
Liam: I speak quietly into the earring and say could everybody shut the fuck up, please, and can we get out of here? Quietly?
Laura: No! There's gold! There's lots of gold on the other side!
Liam: Yeah, let's call another two worms, let's do that.
Sam: These are probably the only ones! It's a male and a female!
Marisha: How do you know that!?
Liam: They fucking hated each other. They hated each other!
Marisha: Yeah! They were trying to kill each other!
Sam: Yeah! They were married! They're a married couple! They hate each other!
Marisha: Scanlan, that's only your relationships!
Laura: Scanlan, you're right there. Get as much gold as you can and Dimension Door over to the teleporter.
Sam: I'm here? What?
Laura: You're right by the gold!
Sam: Oh you mean, I'm going to get the gold?!
Laura: Get the gold and Dimension Door!
Sam: I don't have a Bag of Holding! I weigh 14 pounds! I can't hold that much gold! Gold is heavy!
Travis: I can get over there. Do we want gold?
Sam: Yes, we want fucking gold! Wait, isn't there gold all over the place?
Matt: It's like smatterings of single pieces across the floor, but this one tunnel, the hoard itself is pouring into the tunnel left behind.
Laura: I need it!
Taliesin: Go grab the gold, let's get the body, and we'll get out of here. We have to search the body as well.
Travis: I run over to the gold. I run around the worm and run to the gold. And I (yelling) frenzied rage-loot this shit!. Just hacking away at it!
Matt: Slapping the stone and pouring all the rest of the gold you can get your hands on inside this--
Sam: I'll assist. Grog, Grog! Open the bag! (singing) Bigby's Hand will grab the gold. (laughter)
Laura: Yes! Oh my gosh, get so much gold!
Matt: Giant scoops into the Bag of Holding. It's just pouring off the sides of it onto the ground and you're having to scoop it back up inside.
Marisha: I take out like my little filet knife and I start going to town on the frost worm in front of me, trying to salvage anything that I can from him.
Matt: Okay!
Laura: I call Trinket and I tell him to get over by the teleportation circle.
Matt: Make a nature check real fast.
Marisha: My book! I got my book!
Sam: Who, me? Nature check?
Marisha: It's me. I got my book, which gives me advantage.
Liam: I'm meeting Trinket, and I'm going to lay-slash-nap on his back.
Marisha: 29.
Laura: And I'm going to run as fast as I can over to where I can see them hoarding the gold, because I want to see it.
Matt: All right. You get over there pretty quick.
Taliesin: I'm going to check the frozen body.
Matt: Okay. As Keyleth checks, you check the frozen body.
Taliesin: Is that the dead man?
Matt: Oh. oh! The frozen man. Okay. Keyleth. You take a moment to cut through and there's the other undamaged mandible, the eye appears to be undamaged but those are all going to be very careful, time-intensive things to remove properly. There isn't much that can really be pulled from this other than that. There's not a whole lot of material on--
Marisha: Can I vial any of the blood?
Matt: You can bottle some of the blood, yeah.
Marisha: Yeah, I want to do that.
Matt: Okay, so you bottle some of the blood--
Marisha: And I'm going to take that mandible if I can.
Matt: Okay, so you remove a mandible. So you can mark that down. All right, so you guys are gathering money.
Travis: We don't have anything to store it in, really.
Laura: Can I try to get some of the icy armor off of the big worm that's right next to me now?
Matt: You step up to it. I mean, most of the armor--
Laura: I just want to pull on it and see if I can get some of it.
Matt: The parts that you pull on, that are like big hefty chunks that would be of any real use, are part of its body. The few that are busted from the damage you dealt to it throughout the combat, they're such small pieces and they crumble at your touch.
Laura: It's okay, I'm more interested in gold anyway.
Taliesin: Is it possible to move the frozen man, or is he just really stuck in there?
Matt: You go ahead and you grab onto him, and he's actually frozen to a coat of ice that is left in there, and looking at the ice pattern, you get the sensation that that frost worm may have frozen him in there, had seen him previously and, unable to reach him within the very back of that alcove, just frost breath-ed, this one or another like it did so.
Taliesin: Keyleth! Can I borrow you over here?
Marisha: Yeah. What do you want?
Sam: Are your hands dripping with blood right now?
Marisha: Yeah.
Taliesin: Can you warm him up and see if we can get him out of here?
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: Okay, so you begin to slowly--
Marisha: We were trying to do this before. We were trying to melt his face because Pike was going to do a talk to dead spell.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: We know what happened to him now, though.
Laura: Yeah, we've got to get out of here.
Matt: So, anything else you want to do?
Marisha: Well, I guess we're taking the body? I'll focus my heat on his feet so we can just dislodge him and throw him over our shoulder and go.
Matt: Okay. The ice slowly begins to melt, you gather you probably have another five to ten minutes before he'll be free.
Travis: That's pretty long. Too long.
Laura: Yeah, if we feel anything, let's go, okay. Got the gold? Let's go. Let's go.
Matt: You're still gathering gold, it's going to take you a while to get all this, it's a lot of-- it's a small opening--
Travis: Do we leave the cave or do we use the teleportation circle?
Laura: Teleportation circle.
Marisha: How much time is it going to take them to get the gold?
Matt: Probably, to get all of it? Another probably 15 minutes or so.
Laura: Jeez.
Matt: Because you have to like get in the cavern and pull out chunks, so it's a big hoard.
Marisha: How about this, let's spend five minutes doing all this stuff and see where we're at.
Laura: He's rolling, he's rolling!
Marisha: Son of a bitch, we should go.
Matt: As you're having this conversation, the ground begins to quake and you can just see--
All: Go! Run run run!
Sam: It could be an unrelated seismic event.
Laura: Scanlan, run!
Matt: All right, as you all rush around the corpses, heading towards the teleportation circle, you--
Sam: I smack myself with Bigby's Hand.
Matt: Giving yourself a lift as you're pushed along over the course, you guys rush over to the teleportation circle, right as you hear the ground erupt about 30 feet behind you.
Laura: Oh, shit!
Matt: In a very similar fashion as the initial arrival of the worm, and you hear a similar shrieking sound.
Laura: Slow-motion turn around, is it a purple one or a blue one?
Matt: It is another purple worm. A larger one. Immediate comparison? You get the idea, and as you were tearing it apart-- Both of these were adolescent. They weren't fully grown.
Taliesin: Run!
Travis: Must go faster. Must go faster.
Matt: All of you guys rush onto it, one after the other, onto the teleportation sigil, the sigil carrying each of you back to your destination before the purple worm can reach you in time, you all now find yourselves standing in the room beneath the house that previously belonged to Krieg, safe, with as much gold as you could carry in the time period you had.
Laura: Which is a good amount, I have a feeling.
Matt: We'll come back to that in a minute, but first we're going to take a little break for the restroom, guys. So we'll see you back here real fast, we'll make this a quick break, and see you soon.
Travis: Five minutes. Five minutes. Don't leave.
Matt: Bye, guys. [break]
Matt: Welcome back, everyone. So. Returning, as the party calms down after the harrowing encounter with a couple of worm-based entities. What would you like to do?
Marisha: Sorry about that whole cloud mist thing, you guys. I was trying to--
Laura: We almost died.
Marisha: Yeah. Sorry about that. Thanks, Vex.
Travis: That was you?
Marisha: Look, it was something new, I'm still working out the kinks, all right?
Laura: Don't do it again. Not in combat.
Marisha: I'm working out the kinks. I'm sorry. It'll be really cool next time I try it.
Liam: 20. Anything left? Or is it just where I, we--
Matt: Same setup where you left it, but the same pattern to escape that you recall from before.
Liam: There were traps left still. Still the same, all right.
Matt: Still the same pattern, so you guys all, thankfully, due to Vax's viselike memory, follow the path through the tiles to avoid the traps that are set entering that room. You make your way back up the stairs to the gallery room that contained the tapestries, the domino set, the gold tea set, the skull with the gem, all those things.
Taliesin: I say we grab the tea set and the skull and take them to Lady--
Laura: Dr. Dra?
Taliesin: No, actually, maybe we should have it identified first.
Laura: Right. That would be smart. What are we going to get-- are we doing-- wait. Here's a question I have. Do we have to give Dr. Dra the portion of what we found down there? Because technically it's not in the house. Technically. So, whatever we find in the house is what we give him a percentage of, yes? Yes?
Sam: Technically, he's not an honorable man. But we should be.
Laura: Right, and honorably, it is truthful to say that we didn't find it in the house. Technically, it's across the fucking world.
Travis: That's true. Give him a bit of the tea set, we give him the dominoes--
Laura: They tried to steal our money, Scanlan, and you're letting them have free rein in our house right now.
Sam: It's their nature.
Marisha: I'm still really confused as to why we came back here to begin with.
Sam: We were checking it out to see if it was safe.
Marisha: Right, well, that's been confirmed, it's not.
Laura: Right? We found the owner of the house, and he's been frozen.
Sam: Should we report this to the officials and try to quarantine the house, destroy it, something?
Taliesin: I think that would be wise.
Marisha: Quarantine the house?
Sam: Just destroy the portal, destroy the teleportation circle.
Taliesin: Certainly can't have anyone else moving in here.
Laura: We should take it for ourselves. Just to keep it safe.
Sam: Take the gold, or the house?
Travis: The house.
Laura: The house.
Laura: We should let Emperor Uriel know that we should take control of this house because it contains very powerful secrets.
Taliesin: We should find out what that skull does.
Sam: What does Pike think about that?
Matt: Pike? Hearing this conversation and still glad that everyone survived this end of this whole circumstance, goes: "Well--" (laughter)
Matt: "I mean, we should let Uriel know."
Taliesin: I can't look at him.
Matt: "But we also made a deal. And we're people of our word."
Laura: Yes, Pike, we made a deal for anything we found in the house.
Sam: Don't condescend to Pike.
Laura: I'm not condescending Pike, I am rationalizing this agreement.
Marisha: I'm still really confused as to why we are trying to maintain honor to inhonorable people.
Sam: Because we're better than that.
Laura: I'm going to tell him you said that.
Travis: Yeah, why do we care if they have money?
Sam: Let's count our money first before we make that decision. But I'm mainly concerned what Pike feels about taking control of this evil, evil house.
Laura: It's not evil, evil. It's not an evil house.
Sam: It's got an evil, mysterious gem-eye looking at us right now.
Laura: Well, exactly, it's got secrets. We have a house that has powerful secrets in it, that people shouldn't be in. I'm saying we should claim it so that we can keep other people from falling victim.
Sam: All right. If in claiming it we can get someone, some sort of religious person in here to clear it for us, making sure that it's-- Pike would be an option.
Marisha: How is this going to sound to Uriel? Excuse me, Uriel, just want to let you know that we broke into General Krieg's old house and found out it's really dangerous. Can we have it?
Laura: No, we just say-- Keyleth, really?
Marisha: Well, I'm just saying, how do we phrase this?
Laura: You think that's how you would phrase it? You'd say: we heard rumor that the owner of the house had gone missing. We went to investigate and discovered very powerful, dangerous secrets within. We know where he is. He's frozen on the other side of a portal. We need to make sure nobody else falls victim to it. So we close off the house and we say we'll keep it safe. For the time being.
Marisha: And what happens when he asks why we were there in the first place?
Laura: We tell him we heard that somebody went missing and we were investigating where he went.
Travis: That makes sense to me.
Liam: We've probably earned a bit of trust at this point.
Laura: What, we have to go through his guard? No. We're part of the council.
Marisha: I don't know
Laura: I think it's a very fair-- Percy?
Taliesin: I would agree. I don't think it's necessary for us to claim ownership for it. We just need to have it cordoned off and make sure no one else, other than us, can come in.
Laura: Exactly. I'm not saying it's ours. I'm saying we just make sure no else comes in.
Sam: We're leasing with an option to buy.
Travis: Is the skull with the gem in there still?
Matt: It's still turned away, and I believe you put a tapestry over it.
Laura: Yes, we did.
Taliesin: Let's bundle it up in the tapestry.
Liam: That thing is trouble, though, that thing is trouble
Taliesin: Well, let's take it to somebody who--
Sam: Take the skull?
Taliesin: I think we should take the skull and show it to someone who might know what it is.
Travis: All right, I go over and grab the tapestry and the skull, hold it like a knapsack.
Matt: Okay, make-- no this is fine, it's relatively light.
Travis: Can you hear me?
Taliesin: Yes, Grog, we can hear you.
Travis: Yeah. Right, good, maybe--
Sam: Oh shit, the whispers. If you haven't read the comics, check it out on geekandsundry.com.
Taliesin: And while you're there, spend some money at Gilmore's Glorious Goods. Gilmore's, where all of your magical items can be procured. With a smile a week.
Laura: (laughing) That was the lamest slogan ever.
Marisha: All of your items can be purchased.
Taliesin: I'm exhausted.
Travis: Shut the fuck up! Wait, wait, wait. Last part, last part, last part.
Sam: And don't forget!
Taliesin: Don't forget?
Sam: If someone's whispering in your ear, it's probably the sound of your conscience saying: "Go buy a T-shirt!"
Travis: I take off running out of the house.
Matt: As you guys are having this conversation, Grog just bolts out of the house. Just runs up the stairs, out through the foyer, and is--
Laura: Grog!
Taliesin: Grog!
Liam: I start running after him, and I'm hasted.
Marisha: Oh, it's reverse whispering!
Taliesin: It's the reverse whisper!
Sam: Guys, this is the rest of the show.
Taliesin: They're not talking, there's just tongues in ears.
Laura: (laughs) Lalalala.
Marisha: Wet willie.
Liam: I'm running out stealthing, after him.
Laura: I stop and I get the golden tea set. And I take off after him.
Travis: (yelling) Guys, you've got to come out of the house, now!
Taliesin: Okay, we're running out of the house.
Travis: We've got to get out of the house. Now!
Taliesin: We're running out of the house.
Marisha: Okay, okay. We're running out of the house. Christ.
Taliesin: I'm following him out of the house, so.
Matt: Right. You all rush out. You're now out of the foyer. You burst out the front of the home itself. You're in the front yard at this point in time, in the slightly dead grass.
Taliesin: It's going to go Poltergeist on us, isn't it?
Marisha: The house just collapses.
Matt: The sun's still high in the sky, late afternoon at this point.
Laura: What the fuck was that about?
Travis: The house and the skull are linked. As long as the house stands, his evil will grow.
Sam: Whose evil?
Travis: It didn't say. The house has to be taken down to the ground. The portal must be destroyed.
Liam: Says who? Who's in there?
Travis: (loud and angry) I just heard this fucking-- (calmer, hesitating) I. Have... premonitions at times, it runs in my family.
Marisha: Since when, Grog?
Travis: You know, when I'm drinking ale, this voice goes like: "Stop!" But I'm like: "No." And I keep going. And sure enough, I should've stopped.
Marisha: But you haven't been drinking today.
Sam: That voice is usually me.
Travis: Are you saying anything?
Matt: Grog. Make a deception check.
Travis: 12.
Matt: I'm going to say, over the course of everyone listening, Grog hasn't been really fancy with wordplay or deception. He's a very blunt, upfront person, and it's very awkward to see a childlike mind attempt to convey a fictional story like the one he's been pretending.
Laura: So, you're lying.
Travis: What?
Laura: You're lying, Grog.
Travis: What? Why do you say that?
Taliesin: Because you're really bad at it. And it's hilarious.
Travis: Reverse psychology. I'm really bad at it.
Laura: Yes, you are.
Travis: That didn't work.
Taliesin: No, it didn't.
Liam: I want to walk right up to Grog. Right up to his nipples, because that's as high as I go.
Sam: Kiss him on the mouth. (laughter)
Liam: That's two episodes from today. Will you come down here, please? Big Man? Couple of things. First, and this is a smaller detail, I shaved half your beard, correct? It's correct. You've cut me open at least twice, right now. Pike, come here.
Matt: Pike walks up. "Yeah?"
Liam: I would say that makes you and I even. You've been acting all kinds of fucked-up for a while now, and I know you don't want to disappoint her, your best friend. Something's going on with you, and it's time to talk about it. You're talking to yourself, you're talking to your own asshole. You're talking to that fucking sword, you're talking to trinkets we're picking up in houses. What is going on?
Travis: Talking to the sword?
Liam: And she's listening. And she knows when you're lying, and she knows when you're telling the truth.
Travis: Pike?
Matt: She does give you this concerned look that only a possibly disappointed friend can give you, like, "I am worried about you, Grog."
Travis: Honestly, I'm hurt. I'm offended. And we are not fucking equal. If you want to get equal, we can step out here, and handle business like men.
Marisha: Who all is around to see this?
Travis: I've cut you open twice. Twice.
Liam: I walk away. I walk off. I leave the fucking house.
Laura: We're already out of the house.
Matt: So as you guys are standing in front of the house, Vax just steps out into the center of the Cloudtop District, in the direction towards the exit.
Liam: Gone. Stealthed. Laters.
Travis: Pike, can I talk to you for a second?
Matt: "Yeah. Grog, anything."
Travis: (scoffs) Talking to my sword. The skull has a voice.
Matt: "What do you mean?"
Travis: Yeah. I picked it up, right, because I was just going to carry it out, and it said, like: "I can grant you a wish. Any wish that you want."
Matt: "We've been told something similar before, and that didn't go too well. Put the skull down, please."
Travis: Yeah. But it's a wish. We can wish for anything.
Matt: "Grog, please, trust me? Put the skull down."
Travis: I don't want to put it down.
Matt: "I know. Do you trust me?"
Travis: Yes.
Matt: "Put the skull down, Grog."
Travis: I drop the skull.
Matt: Okay. The tapestry clatters to the ground and opens up, and the skull rolls for a second and stops on its side. You can see now, the golden skull is just resting there. The gem still with the intricate filigree, buried within the eye socket. Pike turns to the rest of you and calls you over. "We don't know what this is. And dangerous magics are drawn to imagery like this. Let us see what this is about, first."
Marisha: Pike, can you discern what kind of entity this might be attached to?
Matt: "I had a feeling before." And she pulls out her healing symbol and casts Detect Good or Evil again in the direction of the skull. You can see she recoils the moment that she concentrates. "The aura is definitely evil from this object."
Marisha: Okay.
Laura: Maybe it was lying to you.
Sam: What?
Travis: Lying? I hadn't thought of that.
Marisha: Is that all you have, Pike? That's all you can find out?
Matt: "You have to take it to somebody who knows it or spend some time with it, perhaps."
Laura: How about this, how about nobody ask the skull any more questions?
Marisha: Yeah, no one touch the-- Is it just laying on the floor right now?
Matt: Just laying right there, off to the side.
Sam: Put it in the Bag of Holding?
Laura: No.
Marisha: No.
Laura: I don't like evil things in the Bag of Holding. We have lots of weird things in there, I don't know how it'll react.
Taliesin: I'm going to pull out my sword and pick it up by the eye socket.
Matt: The empty one? Okay. You lift it up.
Taliesin: I'm going to carry it on a stick.
Laura: Should we put a cloth over it?
Sam: Yeah, that might look a little weird.
Taliesin: It's going to look weird with a cloth over it, but please, go ahead.
Matt: Okay. Vex, as you approach it and go to throw the cloth over it, you get a brief view of the gem that's in the socket. And where there was a slight shimmer to its surface when it was looking to before, you can now see briefly what looks like some sort of a ghostly face appears across the surface for a second and then fades.
Laura: Oh, shit.
Matt: You throw it over it.
Laura: That thing's alive. That is definitely alive.
Travis: What, the skull?
Laura: No, no, no. There's definitely something in that stone. It looked at me.
Sam: Well, that's creepy. Can we take it to someone; who do we know? Not Gilmore, this is beyond--
Laura: Allura? She's not here, she's--
Matt: Allura's in Whitestone right now.
Sam: If only we had some way to magically transport to Whitestone.
Taliesin: We do actually have a way of magically transporting to Whitestone.
Sam: Yes. We do. Could you go?
Laura: Oh. Just one of us though.
Sam: Yes, you.
Laura: Can you transport items with it?
Taliesin: As long as they're on you, as long as you're holding them.
Marisha: But Percy, to be fair, you've had a bit of a weakness with, you know, evil entities being attached to you.
Travis: Yeah. Besides, if it grants a wish. I get the fucking wish.
Laura: You get the wish, Grog, you sure get the wish.
Marisha: No, it's not going to-- It's not granting anyone's wish.
Sam: We could send Pike with it?
Marisha: I mean, if want to sleep a day, we can all just bamf back. We can tree stride back to Whitestone, if we want to take a nap.
Laura: That's true.
Sam: Wait, we're going to sleep with this skull in our house?
Marisha: Well, I've already spent my one 6th-level spell turning us into fucking clouds.
Sam: You didn't turn me into a cloud.
Laura: Or me.
Marisha: Yeah. Honestly, if I would've turned everyone into a cloud--
Taliesin: We'll keep it locked in my workshop for now. We can make it a night. And we will make sure that they know we have to deal with the house.
Laura: Okay.
Marisha: Who has to deal with the house?
Laura: I'm going to go speak to Uriel and see if I can tell him what just happened.
Sam: You by yourself?
Laura: You can all come with me.
Sam: All right.
Taliesin: I'll actually-- I've got a great idea.
Sam: Oh. We'll leave the skull with Uriel.
Taliesin: I'll take the skull to Whitestone, and I'll see you in the morning.
Laura: No.
Sam: After you've been corrupted by it?
Laura: How about we all go together to Whitestone?
Taliesin: I was just thinking it'll be a way of getting the skull out of the house tonight.
Laura: Yeah, but then it'll be in Whitestone.
Sam: We'll leave the skull in this house--
Taliesin: That's a very fair point. We're not leaving-- I don't think that's a good idea.
Laura: No.
Marisha: What, hang on, Grog. You were--
Laura: Why did you run the skull out of the house?
Marisha: Yes. Exactly.
Travis: I told you. The house is evil. The portal has to be crushed.
Sam: Wait, that part's true?
Marisha: The portal has to be crushed?
Travis: It's an evil portal. Yeah.
Sam: Who told you that?
Travis: The skull did.
Sam: Oh, in addition to the wish? Oh.
Laura: I don't know. Maybe the skull was trapped in the house. Maybe it wanted to get out of the house.
Sam: It's like a genie.
Travis: Don't look at me. I'm just the translator.
Sam: Oh, this is weird. We need some help on this.
Marisha: Why was it talking through you, Grog? Why not Pike?
Taliesin: I think we'll get answers from Allura.
Marisha: If you can ask it questions, maybe we could ask it a few more questions?
Travis: I'm okay with that.
Sam: No. It will hypnotize us and corrupt us.
Travis: It's in a knapsack.
Laura: I think we should hide it and then open it up when we're in front of Allura.
Taliesin: That's fair.
Marisha: What time is it?
Matt: Right now, it's mid-afternoon. Two, three o'clock in the afternoon.
Taliesin: Let's let Uriel know what's happened.
Sam: We'll go on a quick pub crawl.
Taliesin: I've got to get home and work on a few things, anyway. I've got a broken gun.
Marisha: I guess I'll go with Percy and take the skull, and I'll make sure we put it somewhere safe in the keep, if you guys want to go talk to Uriel.
Laura: Pike? Grog? What do you guys want to do?
Travis: What do we want to do, Pike?
Matt: "I don't know. We wanted to go talk to Uriel."
Marisha: Do you want to come with us, Pike? Do you want to be with the skull, Pike, or do you want to go talk to Uriel?
Matt: "I should walk with you with the skull."
Taliesin: Yes, I think that would be best.
Sam: Before we all part ways, can we do a quick accounting of the gold?
Laura: We can't just count it right here.
Taliesin: We'll count it back when we're--
Laura: Away from your friends, but back at the keep.
Sam: All right. Fair enough.
Matt: Okay. So, as you guys make your way back to Greyskull Keep with the skull, keeping it properly covered so you're not walking through the city with a giant gold skull at the end of a sword. You head towards the palace. You make your way through the front to the outer doors. The throne room is currently closed, and there is heavy guard up, and upon you approaching, "I'm sorry. Do you have business with Uriel?"
Laura: Not at the moment.
Matt: "All right."
Laura: But we will, once you tell him that we're here.
Matt: "All right. Hold on." He steps inside. The doors close. About two minutes pass. The guard comes back out. "I'm terribly sorry. Uriel currently is in a very heated discussion and cannot take guests at the moment. Would you like me to relay a message?"
Sam: Yes.
Laura: Yes, but we would like to write it down first.
Sam: Actually, while you were gone-- And I cast Friends on him. While you were gone, other guards came by and said we were clear to go in.
Matt: You can go ahead and make a deception check with advantage.
Sam: Natural 20.
Matt: He goes, "Other guards? Uriel himself just told me I can't let anyone inside."
Laura: Oh, they must have seen him right after you saw him.
Matt: "All right, fine." And he opens the door. You guys walk in, and there you see the entirety of the rest of the Council of Tal'Dorei. You see Tofur Brotorus, you see Seeker Asum, you see-- what the hell is his name? The other guy. Arbiter Brom. They're all gathered in this discussion. Uriel looks up immediately and says, "I'm sorry, we're not taking any--"
Laura: We heard there was a council meeting.
Matt: "Technically, no, but yes, what is your business?"
Laura: We're here because there's a council thing?
Sam: We're here to report a security concern of the utmost importance and urgency to you.
Matt: There's a long, internalized sigh. Not out of frustration, just more out of being lost in thought and a little sad. He goes, "All right. Very well."
Laura: Is everything all right, Uriel?
Matt: "Everything's fine. What would you like to bring to the council?"
Sam: Are we among friends here and free to talk in front of everyone?
Matt: He looks around. "These are my trusted advisors and my trusted palace guard. Yes."
Sam: We've been alerted to some evil afoot in your kingdom yet again. The former Krieg's homestead has been vacant for a while and apparently has a portal to an evil realm inside. We went to investigate, acting on a tip from--
Laura: An old friend.
Sam: Yes.
Laura: And discovered that it was, in fact, true. The owner that was missing has been killed.
Matt: "So, Krieg's estate, which was sold off after his disappearance over a year ago, you're telling me contains some sort of evil portal."
Laura: Yes.
Matt: "Was this built by the new owner?"
Laura: No, I believe it was built by Krieg.
Matt: "Built by Krieg? How are you certain of this?"
Sam: Our informant told us as much. We don't want to give his name.
Laura: It seems rather old, this portal.
Matt: "Where is Krieg now?"
Laura: I have no idea.
Matt: "All right. Well, we'll send a security force to keep a very close eye on the house while it is investigated."
Sam: It's extremely magically dangerous. They should not set foot inside the place at all.
Laura: Incredibly dangerous. It might be best if we investigate it ourselves.
Matt: "All right, if you'd like. I was going to wait until Allura returned and I was going to assign her to it, but if you feel confident, then I will leave the investigation in your hands."
Laura: Thank you.
Sam: Will you notify us when she returns?
Matt: "I will."
Sam: Is there anything else?
Laura: No. You all look quite lovely today, and we will leave you to your business.
Matt: Asum chuckles a little bit. The rest of them acknowledge, Tofor gives a nod, and Uriel closes his eyes for a second and rubs his temple and goes, "I appreciate the information. If you please, we have matters to discuss."
Sam: Just real quick before we leave. I'm sorry. I think I had a burrito. Can I just use a facility inside? A restroom or something?
Matt: "Certainly."
Sam: Thank you.
Laura: I'll wait for him.
Sam: Just wait out of earshot.
Laura: Far away.
Matt: "Thank you." They wait as you guys leave the chambers. The guards close the doors, and you're welcome to go. There are a number of various WCs, water closets, throughout the palace.
Laura: They closed the doors?
Sam: They closed the doors?
Matt: They're not going to let you crap in the middle of the throne room!
Laura: No, but I thought I could wait in the back of the throne room, out of earshot.
Matt: The guards are pushing you out of the throne room. This is a very private meeting.
Laura: Excuse me, handsy. I'm leaving.
Matt: "Sorry, Miss. Orders of Uriel." They push you out and close the doors.
Sam: I've been in the throne room before?
Matt: You have been, yes.
Sam: Do you have eyes on them?
Laura: No, they fucking shut me out.
Sam: All right. Give me ten minutes.
Liam: Do you need a scroll?
Sam: I sit down on the WC.
Matt: Do you take your potion?
Sam: No, I don't. Instead, I Polymorph into a fly, and I'm going to fly my way to the throne room.
Matt: Okay. All right. You fly through, over to the doors. The front doors?
Sam: Of the throne room?
Matt: How are you getting into the throne room?
Sam: The doors are closed, yes?
Matt: Yes.
Sam: Is there any gap at all?
Matt: There is a slight gap on the bottom.
Sam: Okay, I'm going to crawl in there.
Matt: As you come by, one of the guards swings at you. You dodge out of the way without issue and make your way underneath the doors and raise your flight pattern.
Laura: I start chatting up the guards on the outside of the door to distract them a little bit.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw.
Sam: Dexterity? Oh, no, someone's got a fly swatter! Ten?
Matt: Okay. As you cruise in for a moment, you can see the throne room itself, in its round pattern, has designs carved into the walls, almost like Celtic knots. There are a number of these designs right towards the sides of each entrance that previously just looked like a design, but they emit a dull glow for a second, and a burst of arcane energy comes out from them. You find your form immediately unfurl into that of Scanlan the gnome, which then plops back onto the ground, your Polymorph spell dispelled. All of a sudden, the talk stops and the entire council turns back towards the entrance as you're catching yourself on the ground.
Liam: Surprise!
Sam: That one's full. The one that I tried to go into? It's full and it needs a big cleaning.
Matt: "Good to know, Scanlan."
Sam: I thought there was another one this way.
Matt: "There isn't, Scanlan."
Sam: Not through there, or anything? All right. Carry on, then. You should send someone up to service it, though, right away.
Matt: He looks over to Tofor, and Tofor goes--
Sam: It's a matter of security.
Matt: "We'll have it done. Thank you, Scanlan. Now, please."
Sam: Okay. Two lefts and a right, and I'm out? Thank you.
Liam: Matt's got to be using Botox, because he didn't move! (laughter)
Matt: Yeah, you gather, due to recent events, that the magical defenses have been reinstated, with the current circumstances. The doors open again, and Vex, as you turn, you see Scanlan being led out of the doors.
Laura: Scanlan, what are you doing here?
Sam: Shat all over my plans. Let's go home, I guess.
Matt: All right. You guys make your way back to Greyskull Keep. Vax is there, waiting.
Liam: No, I'm not.
Matt: Oh, you didn't go back to the keep?
Liam: Nope.
Laura: I tell some guards on the way out just to block off that house and not let anybody in it. Don't go inside, on your life.
Matt: "Noted. The order just came through. Don't worry. We're gathering a troop specifically for this. Don't worry."
Laura: Not a lot of troops. Just a couple of dudes is good.
Matt: "Very well."
Laura: Okay.
Matt: As you're leaving, you can see there are a few armed individuals, four, approximately, that are moving towards the house to stand guard and inspect the exterior, at the very least. You return to Greyskull Keep. You guys get there, as well. Grog, you return on your own, essentially, at this point, unless you're walking with them with the skull. Vax is nowhere to be found. You do find that Dr. Dranzel, that whole team is gone, except for Zed.
Sam: The drummer?
Matt: Yes. Zed is currently having a little bit of ale in the dining room area, along with Jarett, who was assigned to watch over while they're at the keep. As you step inside, they all notice. Jarett, still with his crossbow loaded in his lap, though he's happy and jovial and conversational with Zed. "Ah, you've returned. Good to see all of you in good health. The rest have left into the city."
Sam: Did they say why? For a performance?
Matt: Zed leans forward and goes, "Actually, it appears that Kaylie got in some sort of a serious bar tussle last night and is currently being held in the stocks. The stockade. I get those words confused. Stockade." He takes a sip of his ale. "The rest of the troupe's going to see if they can get her out."
Sam: All right, good to know. Thanks, Zed.
Laura: Jarett?
Matt: "Yes?"
Laura: Any issues while we were gone?
Matt: "No issues, actually. They were good conversationalists. They were very aware of my disposition, and I kept a very close eye on any movement, preventing them from leaving the room unless they were as a group, except for their exit, in which Zed escorted me. There have been no problems."
Laura: Good man. I pat him on the shoulder.
Travis: She's in the stockade. Only problem is getting caught. I like her style. Should we get her out?
Sam: I'd like to, very much, but I don't know how. We can't just barge in there and break someone out of jail. We're known people.
Laura: Don't you have your sheriff badge?
Liam: (laughs) Well-remembered.
Travis: Yeah, can't we post a bond or something?
Sam: It's customs, not sheriff.
Laura: Call the council.
Marisha: Well, it sounds like they've already-- they're sending other people to get her out. What's the big deal?
Sam: Yeah, but they could make the problem worse.
Laura: Those guys? They'll make it worse.
Sam: She's quite special to me. I think we should-- I think I should go and try to get her out.
Marisha: Oh, she's 'quite special' to you, yeah?
Travis: There's one place I haven't done it, and it's in a prison.
Sam: Not, not in that way. (laughter)
Sam: That's creepy. No, not in that way.
Marisha: Why is that creepy?
Sam: I'm not interested in her in that way.
Marisha: But you were courting her two days ago.
Sam: Things have changed.
Marisha: I thought she spent the night in your room.
Sam: She's a good person and she deserves much better than the likes of me--
Taliesin: That's never stopped you before.
Laura: Don't say that, Scanlan. You've got a cube!
Marisha: That's true.
Sam: It's a rather large cube, but, listen, all right, she's-- she's-- we're related. We're related.
Marisha: What?
Sam: And I don't just mean--
Marisha: Wait, what?
Sam: She's a Shorthalt.
Travis: Like a cousin?
Laura: Like a sister?
Marisha: Like an aunt?
Taliesin: Like a mother?
Sam: Like a baby. Like a baby Shorthalt.
Travis: Whose baby?
Sam: (high-pitched 'hee' sound)
Travis: 'He'? (laughter)
Sam: Listen, don't spread the word around. I don't want my cred to be ruined, but... she's my little girl.
Laura: You dog!
Travis: You're a baby daddy?
Sam: I didn't know this, this is new information. I'm still just adjusting to it.
Travis: Holy shit!
Marisha: You tried to sleep with your baby daddy?
Sam: No I didn't.
Travis: Did you lock that up that night?
Sam: No, I did not! I did not try and sleep with her. I think deep down inside, some part of me knew, which is why I gave her all that gold. I think.
Travis: You paid her for it?
Sam: No! Oh, Grog, please! (laughter)
Sam: I may deserve that but no, no. It's not like that at all.
Laura: Then you didn't know. There's no part of you that knew you had any children.
Sam: I mean, I always knew that was a possibility, in the trade I deal in.
Matt: At this point Zed breaks in and goes, (chuckles) "Indeed!"
Sam: All right. Easy. Listen, drummer--
Matt: "It's Zed."
Sam: You can be replaced easily. When I played with them, we had seven drummers in two years. And I killed two of them. (laughter)
Matt: He sets his drink down and pushes it away. "Should I go?"
Sam: No, just stay and shut up.
Travis: I'll take that, though. I take his drink.
Marisha: Oh, wow. Well, that's--
Sam: Yes, I don't quite know how to act or behave now. And I'm going through a crisis of conscience and identity. I'm sorry; I'm off my game right now. But she's related to me.
Laura: Just make sure that she knows that you love her. And make sure that she knows that you're there for her.
Marisha: Why do you keep saying she's 'related to' you? Why don't you just call her exactly what she is? Which is your daughter.
Sam: I don't know. Okay, all right.
Marisha: That's weird to be like, 'my child is related to me.'
Sam: I'm not good with this stuff. I haven't done this before, all right? I haven't really had family for much of my life. And this is a new thing and it's going to take me some time to adjust and figure out what this means for me. All right? I've defined most of my life by the people I've slept with and now, this a new part of me that I have to figure out.
Laura: Well, technically, it's still defined by--
Taliesin: I was just thinking that. It's a redefinition.
Laura: You could make a really good move of it by helping her get out of the stockade.
Sam: I would like to. But I'll need some help, probably. I don't know if we can all go barge in there.
Laura: Trinket.
Matt: (bear grunts)
Laura: Scanlan needs help
Matt: Trinket lumbers over to you and (slurp). Licks the side of your face. (bear groan) Leans into you. Nearly pushing you off your feet from the sheer mass.
Sam: (laughs) Thanks, Vex. Trinket, I'm okay for right now. But maybe you can help best by staying here and looking after the drummer here and making sure.
Matt: (growls) Just growls at Zed, who stands up. "I'm just here to make sure that we continue our deal when they return. I'm not-- I don't-- I just play the drums."
Laura: You do a good job of it. Keep drinking that ale.
Travis: I give it back.
Matt: "I--" Takes the empty and goes and refills it from a nearby cask.
Sam: I know it's late in the day, but I wouldn't mind going right away. Does anyone want to join me?
Travis: Do you want all of us? Or a smaller party?
Sam: Probably just a smaller party. Don't we have business to attend to here? Gold to count and--
Laura: I can stay and count.
Travis: I can stay with her.
Marisha: Who do you want to take? You pick your dodgeball team.
Travis: Yeah, yeah.
Laura: Ooh, I like it.
Taliesin: Yes.
Sam: Well to get out of a stockade, we'll need some cunning. And cunning-- And cunning.
Travis: Go ahead and ask.
Sam: I wish Vax were here.
Travis: Don't we have earrings?
Sam: You know what, we are but they have a range.
Laura: They do have a range.
Sam: Come in, Vax. Earth to Vax. Tune in Tokyo.
Matt: Approximately where are you right now?
Marisha: So many secrets!
Matt: I love the whispers!
Sam: He's gone to Whitestone!
Matt: All right, there is no response. He really is out of range.
Sam: Percy, I need you for your words, and Keyleth for your magic. Let's go.
Marisha: All right.
Laura: We're useless.
Marisha: Can I heal myself up first?
Sam: Sure, if you've got a little left for me. Wait, I can give us--
Marisha: Oh wait, Pike! Will you hook us up?
Matt: "Yeah," And she goes over and--
Taliesin: I'm going to try and do a quick repair to my gun, also.
Matt: Okay, go for it. She throws down a couple of Cure Light Wounds. She's going to do 3rd level to each of you.
Marisha: Dope.
Matt: Of Cure Wounds. This'll be 3d8 plus five to each of you. So 23 to you, and 21 to you, Scanlan. She'll do a third one to you, Keyleth. Because you're looking pretty rough, right Keyleth?
Marisha: Huh?
Matt: You're looking pretty rough?
Marisha: I'm at 65 now, with that. So I'm still 30 under.
Matt: So on top of that you get another 13. Pike's going to stay with you guys.
Laura: Oh, okay.
Matt: All right, so. While you guys count the gold and what you managed to gather, you find in the--
Laura: Out of sight of Zed! Just so you know.
Matt: Not a worry. You manage to pull from the hoard entirely, out of gold, silver, copper, platinum, the equivalent of 4,150 gold pieces.
Travis: Wow.
Liam: There was another 20 or 30g there.
Laura: I know, right?
Liam: Probably.
Sam: We can go back.
Marisha: How much? 4,000?
Matt: 4,150 gold.
Travis: You don't want to go back in there.
Matt: About 1,050 gold worth of gems.
Laura: 1,050.
Matt: Yep, in gems. Mark that. And about 750 gold approximately of art items, knick knacks, things that you would have to find a specific seller to really get the money for them.
Laura: (singing) Knick knacks.
Sam: Tchotchkes.
Matt: Yeah, like small jade statues, bits of jewelry...
Laura: And how much in platinum?
Matt: Well, the gold equivalent of platinum is what it would be. The total amount is 4,000. But nice try. All right, so. You guys make your way-- After asking around a bit, you figure the closest stockade is the Promenade stockade.
Sam: Oh, there's multiple stockades.
Matt: There are. But that's the one that's closest to the keep and the first place you should start. So you make your way towards the Promenade stockade. It's a fairly grim-looking grey stone building on the outskirts of Abdar's Promenade, which is a very, very, bombastic, colorful gathering of tents and buildings and various shopkeeps. As you walk to the outside of it, approaching, you can see immediately, there on the steps, is most of Dr. Dranzel's troupe, just sitting on the outside steps with two guards at the door. And they're all talking amongst themselves, waiting outside. Dr. Dranzel is not amongst them. As you begin to step closer--
Sam: He got nabbed, too, didn't he?
Matt: (laughs) As you step closer, you can see they wave you down, and they recognize you and approach you with an excited look on their face as if they now have some sort of backup.
Marisha: I'm going to whisper to Scanlan. I'm going to say, I'm going to stay back. You go ahead.
Sam: All right, thanks.
Matt: So Kent Plucker approaches you as you approach and goes like, "Scanlan. Good thing you're here. I think we may need your silvered tongue to go ahead and help us out in this endeavor. Dr. Dranzel's inside; he's been arguing with the warden for quite some time. We're trying to get Kaylie out."
Sam: What happened? Why is she in jail?
Matt: "She got in a bit of a bar fight last night, it seems. Messed up quite a few gentlemen and all of them are arrested and being held inside. They're wanting a bit of change to do the damages and pay for the fine of whatever else she's done. And, well, we're not keen on really paying fines, so we're trying to see how much we can get out of this with our--"
Sam: What's the fine?
Matt: "I don't know. We didn't go in as a full group. The guards wouldn't let us."
Sam: Was she injured in any way?
Matt: "I haven't seen her. You'll have to go inside to find out."
Sam: All right. Thank you. You won't be needed here anymore. You guys can leave.
Matt: They all look at each other. "If it's fine by you, we're going to wait for Dr. Dranzel."
Sam: Oh yes, all right. Percy.
Taliesin: Yes?
Sam: What do you think our play is here?
Taliesin: Well--
Sam: Should we go in and pay? Should we do a bit of a ruse? You still have your Hat of Disguise, right?
Taliesin: Yes, but I think I'm more useful as myself, rather than anybody else.
Sam: Well, you could be a guard taking me in there.
Taliesin: I think on a certain level, you're possibly making this more complicated than it needs to be.
Sam: Yeah, but it's fun, though? No, no, you're right, we should just go in and talk.
Taliesin: You forget you have clout. Part of the point of clout is that you spend it. You spend your clout.
Sam: Oh, all right.
Taliesin: I know you're not used to actually having the means by which to just simply get what you want by asking for it. But you could just... ask for it.
Marisha: That was the most privileged thing you've ever said.
Taliesin: That's the most privileged thing I've ever said that you've heard. (laughter)
Marisha: Touché.
Liam: Marisha has a high clout score.
Sam: So you think just walk on in there. No subterfuge, no sneaky-sneaky, no breaking down doors?
Taliesin: Well, a little subterfuge. Let me--
Marisha: I've got Polymorph. I can always be a tiny thing in your pocket.
Sam: Who said that?
Marisha: Sorry, I'm back here. I figured Percy and I were waiting back here.
Sam: Oh, okay, hi.
Taliesin: Let me attempt to see if I can defuse this relatively easily. I will need some gold.
Sam: Are you lying to me to get me to pay you for a new gun?
Taliesin: No, but that's a very good point. So later I will be asking for some gold to help me fix my new gun.
Sam: All right, I'll give you what you need.
Taliesin: All right.
Marisha: Do you have gold, Scanlan?
Sam: I do.
Taliesin: Okay, we may have to have a discussion. At the very least I'm going to need 20 gold, at the very least.
Sam: 20?
Taliesin: 20 gold, at the very least.
Sam: You don't have 20 gold?
Taliesin: Oh, I do. Just not for your daughter.
Sam: Oh, Jesus. (laughter)
Sam: Take 50.
Taliesin: That will do.
Matt: So you guys approach?
Marisha: No trips to Coldstone with Percy. You are not the Godfather.
Taliesin: I will take you to White Castle, though.
Matt: You come to the front steps of the stockade, there are two guards there, with tower shields and what looks like halberds to each of them. One of them steps forward, putting his shield out. Not in an aggressive way, but definitely in an attention-gathering way. "Do you have business here in the stockade?"
Taliesin: I do; I wish to speak to the warden.
Matt: "The warden is indisposed in conversation at the moment."
Taliesin: Well, he will agree to be indisposed in conversation with me. I'm Percival Fredrickstein Von Musel Klossowski de Rolo III. And I'm here on the business of Whitestone.
Sam: He's an ambassador.
Matt: Make a persuasion roll. I'll say with advantage due to the very, very, intense, believable stare of Scanlan backing you up.
Taliesin: 19.
Matt: He gives a nod. "All right, but good luck." The two guards open the doors, and as they do you can already hear raised voices shouting back and forth. Can't really make out the words, but as you step into the inside you can see there is a clerk's desk. With a clerk sitting there, keeping one ear closed as he's trying to write in a book. To the immediate right of them, there is Dr. Dranzel in an argument with a gentleman with a well-kept mustache, thick over the top lip, slicked black hair that curls up in the back in a small poof. He's wearing a breastplate and is standing with an appearance of self-importance. At which point, as you approach, Dr. Dranzel turns and goes, "Oh good. Someone with actual--"
Taliesin: Shush! Who is this person?
Matt: Everyone gets quiet and the individual standing there goes, "Well apparently, he's the man who's bothering me. Hm?"
Taliesin: What do you do, sir?
Sam: I just throw Dranzel a quick little wink.
Taliesin: What do you do, sir?
Matt: "I'm a performer." (slight chuckle)
Taliesin: Excellent, he's a performer. You may leave, we have no need of you.
Laura: (whispered) Oh, shit.
Matt: "Hmph." He adjusts his hat and--
Taliesin: Guard, escort the commoner out of the room.
Matt: The guards instinctively step up and take his arms and they lead him out. Dr. Dranzel, taken aback and the whole time he's looking at Scanlan with this look of like--
Sam: You heard the ambassador; please leave. (laughter)
Matt: (boom) The doors close behind. The individual steps forward.
Taliesin: Now that that's been taken care of, who is an authority that I may speak to?
Matt: "That, I'm afraid, would be me. (sly chuckle) Pleasure to meet you. I'm Warden Cyrus Hume. What is your name?"
Taliesin: Cyrus Hume. I'm Percival Fredrickstein Von Musel Klossowski de Rolo III of Whitestone.
Matt: "This does me no service."
Taliesin: It will.
Matt: "Hmph."
Taliesin: I am, of course, the newly appointed ambassador from Whitestone, and I have been brought down here because apparently you are holding one of my performers. A performer who is meant to be heading towards Whitestone in the next three weeks to perform for my sister.
Matt: "Describe your performer, sir."
Taliesin: Oh, small, plain, female. (dismissive sigh)
Matt: (sighs heavily) "I know of the one you speak. The same one we're arguing-- I assume this other individual that just left is one of your performers as well."
Taliesin: Yes, he is. He is one of the official performers-- they're supposed to be performing at the new coronation of a brand new temple in Whitestone. Much has been arranged, much has been paid for, and I don't want to explain any of this to the royal court.
Matt: Make a deception check.
Taliesin: Casting-- no, not yet. 13.
Matt: Okay. He goes--
Taliesin: If you were to be agreeable to helping us move this along, I would remember the favor. Whitestone would remember the favor.
Matt: "Good. Well, listen. There are fines for damages, or she sits until tried. Now."
Taliesin: Damages?
Matt: "The damages to the Nervous Brook pub are estimated to be upwards of 450 gold pieces, and the fine for drunken battery and disturbing the peace amounts to 250 gold pieces. 700 total and I would gladly let you take that rabid dug-grubber off of my hands."
Sam: You'll watch what you say about her.
Matt: "Oh, will I?"
Taliesin: Shush, performer. Well, sir, I appreciate your candor, I appreciate the cut of your jib, and I appreciate that you are a man of honor and of your station. It is very, very rare to find someone who respects such things. Obviously the damages must be paid--
Matt: "If you wish to discuss it with the three in question--" He points to one of the cells on the other side of the room and you can see that there is a set of bars, and you can vaguely see what looks like the shape of a person who's just slumped in the cell. Mostly cast in shadow.
Taliesin: Who are they?
Matt: "Bar patrons. And they're all worse for wear."
Taliesin: Do we know what happened?
Matt: "The dog has teeth. Three against one, if the stories say true. The bar patrons and the owner of the establishment all verified that she indeed started and finished it."
Taliesin: I don't care who started or finished it. Obviously, we will pay for the damages out of your troupe's pocket.
Sam: Your majesty, are you sure you don't want to write a check from the treasury?
Taliesin: Quite.
Sam: I've got the checkbook with me. We could just write a check.
Taliesin: We will write a check for our friend's pocket, but for the damages, I feel that some responsibility must be taken.
Matt: "I'm not familiar with this check you speak of. I deal in gold, as does Emon. What good does this do me in my station if I am to show up with a simple piece of paper?"
Taliesin: He has a very fair point.
Sam: (whispers) Your brand of subterfuge is not what I had in mind. (laughter)
Taliesin: What good is subterfuge when there's such an opportunity to create a ballad? Some sort of ballad about a cautionary tale.
Sam: I could have picked anyone to be with me here. Not this. You're rubbing my face in it because I threw your gun in the lava.
Taliesin: You chose so poorly. You chose so poorly. It is truly impressive how poorly you chose.
Matt: "Stop wasting my time, if you're going to retrieve this invalid, do so quickly."
Taliesin: You may come pick up your gold from Castle Greyskull in the morning. It will be waiting for you, of course, sir. In the meantime, here is 20 gold for your trouble. On top of the gold you will be expecting for all fines imposed.
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Taliesin: (high-pitched) One.
Matt: He rolled a natural 20.
Taliesin: All right, bring it. Bring it.
Matt: "Well, I appreciate your attempt to maneuver around my station of which you hold so clear. You seemingly attempt to bribe a warden of the stockade in an attempt to retrieve what appears to be a relatively... How do I put it? Immoral, destitute and feral creature."
Sam: Warden. This is just like this bastard. He always goes around trying to boss people around and throw his money around. And I turn and I punch Percy in the face.
Matt: Okay! Roll for an attack.
Sam: Oh, shit. Going for another one. A nine. Probably not.
Matt: Plus your strength modifier.
Sam: I don't have any strength. One, so that's ten.
Matt: Ten. Percy, do you take it?
Taliesin: Yes, I take it.
Matt: Okay. Whack! A solid hit across the face. You have to lean into it and make it look more impactful than it really is.
Taliesin: (overly dramatic) Oh!
Sam: And then I turn around, and I punch a guard.
Laura: Oh my god.
Taliesin: Where are you going with this?
Matt: Roll another attack.
Sam: 13.
Matt: 13. You whirl around, and one of the guards is rushing forward to try and break this up, and as you swing towards him, your fist collides with the side of his helmet. It definitely shakes him for a second. It doesn't do much in the way of damage, but it does kind of hurt your knuckles a little bit. Now the guard's like, (startled sound) and stumbles back a bit.
Sam: I've just had enough with all of you people. We performers demand respect and deserve it as well.
Matt: The warden's now stepped forward and put his hand on the side of his blade and says, "Am I to understand you walked in here and immediately struck a guard of the stockade?"
Sam: I've just had it up to here with being bossed around by people like him.
Matt: "Well, would it make you feel better if he's thrown in prison?"
Sam: It would.
Taliesin: It would make me feel better if he was thrown in prison.
Matt: "Oh, don't worry. You'll both be going."
Marisha: About this time, I come over the earpiece and I go, how's it going in there, guys?
Sam: Great.
Taliesin: Great. Everything's fine. (laughter)
Marisha: Good. Just let me know if you need me.
Matt: He looks to the side and two guards now, one of the ones that punched you and another one to the side both step up and are reaching--
Taliesin: Won't it be unfortunate when you find out I have diplomatic immunity?
Sam: Diplomatic immunity.
Matt: You both have been manhandled and brought your hands behind. You feel manacles being pulled forth, and the warden's just looking down upon both of you.
Taliesin: I blame you for this.
Sam: You should blame me for this. I'm sorry. I just had a really shitty day, all right? He doesn't deserve this. Let him go. Just take me.
Matt: "Very well. Now." And you feel the release as the manacles come away. You are escorted out of the room. You are put in shackles, brought, and thrown into the same jail cell as Kaylie.
Taliesin: All right. How much to get both of them out?
Matt: As you're being pushed out?
Taliesin: Yeah. I'll bring it.
Matt: There's no answer at the moment. The doors close behind you, and you're thrust off of four steps. Make an acrobatics check.
Marisha: They were tossing your ass out.
Taliesin: 23.
Matt: All right. You manage to catch yourself with a small tumble over the shoulder, land Willy Wonka-style, well stuck. As you're thrown, you hit the ground. You can see off in the corner of the cell, Kaylie, arms crossed, sitting on the ground. She leans forward a little bit, and you can see the light hits the side of her face, and she has a bit of a welt there and a bit of a black eye, but she doesn't look too worse for wear.
Taliesin: Now for the love of God, just wait until nightfall and Dimension Door out of there.
Sam: Did I hear that?
Matt: Yeah, you'd hear that.
Sam: Good idea. Thanks, Percy, for your help.
Taliesin: You're welcome. Wait until nightfall.
Sam: Huh? Oh. All right.
Matt: As she leans forward, she goes, "Huh. Like father, like daughter, aye?"
Sam: You could say so. I heard you had quite a night last night at the bar.
Matt: "Hm. Felt good. I like breaking faces."
Sam: Apparently you're very good at it. I saw-- I got a glimpse of your victims over there.
Matt: (laughs) "They had it coming. Don't know why, but I had a feeling somewhere in their life, they probably deserved it. Most men do."
Sam: Yep, you're right about that. Stay away from all men. Forever.
Matt: "They were fuckwits. Their faces were so punchable."
Sam: I know that feeling. Listen, I've come to get you out of here.
Matt: (laughs) "Apparently you've not done that very well."
Sam: Don't worry. I've still got some tricks up my sleeve. Just wanted to make sure you're all right. Did they hurt you in any way?
Matt: "Only one person's really hurt me recently."
Liam: Cold as ice.
Matt: "Look, Scanlan. Father. I spent a lifetime hating you. I'd imagined the moment we would finally meet for so long, planned it out in my head, had it all worked out. My idea of you, what you'd be like, what you'd say, and you know what? Up until last night, I was pretty spot-on. I don't know what I wanted. I have a lot to process, to think about. But I'd prefer not to do it in this dank cell, so if you have a way out, please, now's the time to do it."
Sam: You think now? All right, is anyone watching?
Matt: There are two guards that are not watching directly, but they're muscled up against the bars and keeping an eye over the shoulder.
Sam: I'll need a distraction. Do you think you can come up with one?
Matt: Her eyes turn for a second and she goes, (chuckles) "I think that can be done." She leans up to the side of the bar and peeks her head out for a second. Closes her mouth, cups it with her hand, and you start hearing from the opposite side of the room, through arcane ventriloquism, these three different male voices going, "I'll fuck you up!" You hear punches and you hear all of this screaming and chaos. At which point, the two guards look over. One of them gives the other a motion, and they both run off to see the other side of the room. She looks back at you.
Sam: You'll have to teach me that trick. And then I Dimension Door us out onto the street.
Matt: As you reach for her, she still pulls away a little bit, but you still grab hold and (poof) puff of smoke. You guys (magic sound) appear outside, landing a couple of feet above the ground and catch yourselves. You're off to the side of the stockade where it meets with one of the nearby walls. No one seems to immediately notice you, other than a couple of people that are walking down the street that see two individuals appear out of the ether and land onto the ground.
Sam: All right. Let's get out of here. Percy, I didn't wait quite until nightfall.
Taliesin: I assumed you wouldn't. We're already walking back.
Sam: All right, we'll catch up.
Matt: You guys head back towards Greyskull? All right.
Marisha: I'm glad I came in handy for that field trip.
Sam: Oh, shit! Burn it down! Burn the stockades down!
Liam: I'd also like to point out that Grog's single nut-flick did more damage than your two full-on punches. (laughter)
Matt: This is true! All right. Eventually, you guys make your way back. As you do, you gather, and about five minutes behind you, the rest of Dr. Dranzel's troupe arrives, looking a little bit frazzled and a little confused. He steps forward to the rest of you and goes, "I don't know what you did, but there's a manhunt for two gnomes right now over by the Promenade. But good on you. Might want to lay low for a little bit."
Sam: Good thinking.
Taliesin: The troupe may want to get out of town for a bit, as well.
Matt: "I think that's the plan. We were going to stay a few more days-- we had a couple of gigs lined up, but I think we've pressed our luck far enough, so all right! Everyone feeling spectacular?" He claps his hands and the rest of the troupe start grabbing their goods and their instruments and what little cases and bags they do. Kaylie runs off real fast and comes back with her one over-the-shoulder satchel that carries all of her worldly belongings. "Then let us be off." He gives a little tip of the hat to Scanlan with a nod. Looks to the rest of you. "We greatly appreciate your hospitality. We're sorry for any confusion, misunderstandings, and general debauchery. Good night to you all." He turns around and they all start walking out. Kaylie begins stepping and she stops and looks over her shoulder towards you, Scanlan, and says, "Don't come looking for me. When I'm ready, I'll come find you." She turns back around and leaves.
Sam: Oh, shit.
Marisha: I liked them. They were fun.
Travis: Did you tell her you're her dad yet?
Sam: That's not-- She figured it out, Grog.
Travis: That's awkward.
Sam: Yes. Yes, it is.
Laura: They forgot to grab their gold. I like them!
Matt: That they did, actually.
Marisha: Maybe they thought we were even?
Liam: Probably should check the silverware, though, in the keep.
Laura: Oh. I run and check the silverware.
Taliesin: I check to make sure the skull is still there.
Matt: The kitchen is cleaned out.
Laura: No!
Matt: All of the silverware.
Laura: What about Jarett? He was supposed to be keeping an eye on them.
Marisha: Yeah, what the fuck? What's with Jarett?
Matt: Jarett was one man keeping track of multiple people, with one very small, quick child that you were the only one able to keep an eye on.
Laura: I hate your friends!
Marisha: They were good drinking buddies.
Sam: They're all right. They've got their good qualities, too.
Travis: Just the silverware's missing?
Laura: What about our rooms? Is it just the kitchen that's cleaned out, or did they take everything in the keep?
Matt: Oh, no, no, no. None of the rooms have been touched, except for the guest room where some of them were staying.
Laura: There was shit in there, anyway.
Matt: Yeah, there wasn't much in there, but a couple of candlesticks, things that were just decor. Anything that could possibly be hocked for a little bit of change from those rooms is gone.
Laura: They don't know I shopped for everything at Home Goods, so joke's on them.
Matt: You gather probably no more than two to three hundred gold worth of materials were taken in total. That includes fine cookware, that includes decor, that includes a couple of previous art pieces that you had collected--
Taliesin: Please tell me they stole the giant painting.
Sam: It's not here yet.
Taliesin: Damn it!
Matt: It hasn't been delivered yet. That's probably in transit.
Taliesin: No!
Liam: And where would it have been hidden on their person?
Taliesin: They could have rolled it up and stuck it where the sun don't shine.
Marisha: A 20 by six foot canvas?
Taliesin: Some caverns run deep.
Sam: I'm going to check my bed just to see if there's any shit on it.
Matt: You go and inspect pretty extensively. It does not appear that anyone has left you a Scanlan surprise.
Marisha: Percy and I go downstairs to make sure the skull is still there.
Matt: Skull is still in the workshop, yes.
Marisha: Beautiful.
Matt: What do you guys want to do right now?
Taliesin: I'm going to spend some time working on the special barrel and see if I can get that up and running.
Marisha: What time is it?
Matt: At this point, it's closing towards dusk.
Laura: We should heal up and get ready to take this to Whitestone in the morning, yes?
Marisha: I guess so.
Taliesin: 18.
Matt: 18? All right. You disassemble elements of the pistol. You get the feeling that the way it's weighted, to attach the hand mortar to the pistol, it's still going to continue to be a very unwieldy thing. You are probably best to design them as separate pieces. Unfortunately, the way the pistol's balanced, for aim and such? The mechanism that's required to lob an object for the mortar to be able to do any help with is going to throw off your ability to aim much with the pistol, going forward. Not to mention increase the misfire score by crazy amounts. But you could create them both separately and swap out as needed.
Taliesin: All right.
Matt: All right. You guys spend the evening. You rest up, you're back to full health, you're good to go. As the morning comes around--
Travis: I have a question.
Matt: Yes?
Travis: Can I wait until everyone goes to bed and can I make my way into Percy's workshop?
Taliesin: It's locked.
Matt: As you get to the workshop, you check the door and it is, indeed, locked.
Marisha: We stashed it.
Travis: What's the door made of?
Matt: It's made of solid metal. It was constructed per specifications to be able to withstand concussive blasts in case of accident from the inside.
Travis: Can I try to pick the lock?
Matt: You have no lockpicks.
Travis: Can I shove an axe in the lock hole?
Matt: You can.
Sam: Clang!
Matt: Make a strength check.
Travis: I have a greatsword that's just a normal greatsword.
Laura: Are you going to try to shove it in the lock?
Travis: Yeah, like a credit card in the side of the thing. Like a crowbar. That was crap.
Matt: What did you roll?
Travis: Ten.
Matt: Ten. In trying to wedge the sword into the side of the door, you eventually feel a shift as you push. You feel it gives way, and you look and withdraw the greatsword, which is now bent at an angle to the side. Yeah, that sword's not going to be functional in combat any further.
Travis: All right, I go to bed.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: Nothing good ever happens to you in my workshop. It's just not a good place for you. Too many things.
Matt: All right, so. Morning comes around. You guys come back rested. As you each individually come to consciousness and finding your way down, the first thing you're met by is a very perturbed Laina, who as soon as you come down, says, "I'm terribly sorry. I went to make breakfast, and there's nothing to make breakfast with! I don't know what happened."
Laura: It's okay. Scanlan is going to buy all new stuff for our kitchens.
Sam: I'm supposed to lay low, though.
Laura: Oh, that's okay. You can give her all the gold that she needs to buy new things for the kitchen.
Sam: I have only--
Laura: You have about a thousand gold because I gave it to you.
Sam: I gave 50 to Percy, which you didn't use.
Matt: To buy basic cooking supplies, it wouldn't be more than 30 gold to restock the entire kitchen. It was more other elements of the keep.
Sam: Including the silverware?
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: Oh, great.
Laura: It wasn't fancy silverware. It was utilitarian.
Matt: It was decent. It was functional. It was included with the keep.
Sam: All right, here's 50. Go get us a decent set of silverware.
Laura: And other things. Or send somebody else, if you'd rather.
Matt: "I'm not much help around here right now, am I? All right." And she runs off, returning a short time later, with groceries, as well, that she found while she was out. Makes a fresh meal for all of you. Partway through breakfast, there is a knock at the edge of the dining hall, and you see Cordell, your half-orc guardian there. Has his big, heavy crossbow at his side. "Sorry to bother you while you're eating. You have a messenger who wishes to speak to you at the front gate."
Laura: I'll go.
Matt: "All right. Follow me."
Sam: Vax never came home last night?
Matt: Did you come home? No? Vax has not showed up yet.
Sam: Should we be worried?
Taliesin: We're going to have to collect him before we go.
Matt: As you go to the gate, it's opened up and you can see there, standing by himself, Seeker Asum. Hood back, bald halfling helm with his tattoos greeting you. He goes, "Hello, Vex."
Laura: Hi.
Matt: "I've come to request your presence at the Precepts Stage within the Cloudtop District near dusk. All of Vox Machina, this evening, if you don't mind."
Laura: Oh. Well, why?
Matt: "Uriel and I have been in extensive discussion these past few days, and the reveal of Riskel's betrayal has had a profound effect on Uriel, and rumors have been spreading amongst the district and the higher order of the city. Uriel is to make a statement regarding it and to prevent any political intrigue will talk to the politically inclined populace first. As members of the council, we would like for you to be there to help us based on the reaction. If you would be so kind?"
Laura: Yes, of course. I'll tell the rest of the group. We were planning on heading out to Whitestone today, but we can put that off if it's very important?
Matt: "It's rather important."
Laura: All right. What were you guys fighting about before? Can you tell me?
Matt: "It's nothing you need to worry about."
Laura: Really? It looked kind of serious.
Matt: "I think tonight's discussion will absolve any questions you have."
Laura: Is anybody in trouble?
Matt: "No. You're fine. You've done nothing."
Laura: Can I insight check him?
Sam: We should torture him to find out.
Taliesin: I'm going to shoot off a limb.
Laura: 23?
Matt: 23? He seems fairly forthright and honest. There is a sense of urgency to him. He's really insisting you guys be there.
Laura: Okay. Well, we will be, then.
Matt: "Wondrous. I will notify the rest of the council. I look forward to seeing you this evening."
Laura: Yes, if you see my brother anywhere, can you send him home?
Matt: "Yeah, I'll keep an eye out. I have a network in the city. I can probably locate him within the hour, if need be."
Laura: Thank you.
Matt: "No worries." He walks away. As he steps away, you look for a second. You glance away and look back, and he's gone.
Laura: He is so sneaky. I need to train with him more.
Taliesin: Like Batman.
Laura: I go back and tell everybody what he just told me.
Sam: Oh my god!
Laura: Right? (laughter)
Taliesin: I suppose we'll have to put it off for a day, then.
Sam: Yes. Is the skull going to be safe here while we're gone?
Taliesin: I think so.
Sam: Can it see inside our keep? Can it channel some beast?
Taliesin: It's locked very far away right now, in a very secure room.
Sam: But not secure magically.
Marisha: Yeah. Percy, maybe me and you should make some reinforcements or something?
Liam: It's just radioactive material in the basement. It's fine.
Sam: What if it's a portal? What if it can send a dragon to us, or a worm or something?
Travis: It did say as long as that house stands, it will be very powerful.
Taliesin: Well, do you think it would be safer somewhere? Do you think there's something you could conjure, perhaps, around it? Or should we move it to another room?
Laura: I feel like your room is very secure.
Taliesin: We could always send it straight away to Whitestone. But...
Marisha: But we'd have to put it with someone else, right?
Taliesin: We'd have to let someone take it to Whitestone. It could be there today. Or we could keep it in my room, or we could move it perhaps into the temple of Sarenrae?
Laura: Maybe... how many times can you use that little tree thing, Keyleth?
Marisha: Once a day.
Laura: Fuck.
Marisha: I know. Or else I would totally run it over and run it back.
Taliesin: Oh. But you can run it over and run back.
Marisha: Oh, if I use your thing?
Sam: If you, if you go there, take the stone from his sister and you can come right back.
Laura: Yeah, take the stone from his sister and come back.
Marisha: I could.
Laura: Let her know it's useless after the one use.
Sam: Well, let's not lie to Percy's sister. (laughs)
Travis: Is it safe in Whitestone? I mean, the temple of Sarenrae is at least here.
Laura: Got a good idea. What if you go, you don't take the skull, you tell Allura what's going on, bring her back with you through the tree!
Sam: We keep summoning Allura to solve our magical problems. We brought her to Whitestone and now we're bringing her back?
Laura: She's really, really smart!
Sam: All right...
Laura: She can go right back, you can send her right back.
Marisha: What if she doesn't come?
Laura: Well, then you come back--
Marisha: I'd be using a 6th-level spell as a glorified messenger? 'Hey, we found a scary skull.'
Sam: Hey, you used it yesterday for no reason, too. (laughter)
Taliesin: Wow! Oh my god.
Travis: (high-pitched) The sickest burn. That's the sickest burn! Oh fuck!
Taliesin: And somehow the coffee has not been poured on your head. That's the greatest magic trick I've seen all night. How are you still dry? It's witchcraft.
Marisha: You know what, Scanlan, why don't you figure out how to get the damn skull back to Whitestone by yourself, how's that?
Taliesin: Why don't we just let it be in the room for now-- Let's let it be in the room for now, nothing happened last night.
Marisha: Nothing happened last night, but it seems like a ticking time bomb.
Taliesin: I'm going down, I have to go get my things anyway, so I'm going to go down. Everything seems fine, doesn't it?
Matt: Untampered, room seems left as it was.
Laura: It doesn't seem tampered with at all, the door?
Taliesin: The door is steel reinforced, lined and bolted to the wall; it's not going anywhere. This room is designed to explode.
Marisha: I mean, I could-- all right.
Laura: Maybe we should make sure there's, like, fabric over it.
Taliesin: It's hidden in the room.
Travis: Maybe we should go in and check on it.
Marisha: I could Wall Of Stone another kind of box around it.
Taliesin: I go into the room, I shut the door behind me. I check my hiding place.
Matt: Untouched.
Taliesin: And it's untouched and perfectly reasonable. I return it to my hiding place. Which, if I have to reveal it later, I will happily tell you where it's hidden. Shut and lock the door behind me. Everything's fine.
Travis: That's a relief.
Taliesin: Let's find your brother.
Marisha: All right. I guess we're staying in town.
Sam: We're leaving the skull?
Marisha: Seems okay.
Sam: (laughing) Let's at least post Jarett here.
Marisha: Yeah, let's post someone here, I guess.
Matt: Jarett's already, by the way, off to the side listening to this whole conversation.
Sam: Do you ever sleep, Jarett?
Matt: "I sleep when I'm not needed. But it seems right now I am needed, and I am more than happy to stand guard. It's what you pay me for."
Sam: You're so cool.
Laura: You're seriously the coolest guy.
Marisha: Yeah, you're great.
Matt: "You're being absolutely ridiculous. Continue." (laughter)
Taliesin: If anything strange happens, make note of it.
Matt: "Of course."
Marisha: Don't let anyone in or out.
Taliesin: Well, he can't, he doesn't have the key anyway.
Matt: "No. This is true."
Marisha: I'm just saying.
Matt: "It'll be done."
Marisha: All right.
Matt: "All right."
Marisha: Okay?
Matt: "Okay."
Laura: We need to give him a raise.
Matt: "Yes, you do."
Sam: Why don't you just take it from my money?
Taliesin: I throw ten gold at him right now, just in lieu of-- I throw ten gold.
Matt: "Very generous of you, Percival."
Taliesin: It's the very least.
Matt: And he sets up his chair in the far corner, staring at the door again, and sets his crossbow over his shoulder and just sits waiting.
Taliesin: Let's go find your brother.
Matt: Now, Vax, what are you up to?
Liam: I mean, I'm assuming-- I didn't go there to find anything, but I went just to think, and I didn't see anything by chance, no?
Matt: Nope. You detect no movement inside whatsoever. Dark windows over the course of the evening, no sign.
Liam: All right, well, I guess I'll go back to the keep.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: And I will sit up. No one's there? I'll sit up in my sister's room.
Matt: All right. Well, as you guys are walking back--
Liam: Stealth, please. I'm not walking in the open.
Matt: All right, make a stealth check.
Liam: 27.
Matt: 27? All right. All of you that are out looking for him, make a perception check.
Marisha: 29.
Taliesin: 18.
Matt: As you guys spend a good portion of the morning scouting about the usual paths that you take as a group, knowing the back alleys and the various paths that you walk through Emon to ensure that you avoid the main thoroughfares and the most-used walkways, as you're glancing about you see a quick shadow shift past about the size of the individual you are seeking.
Taliesin: (puffs air) Sorry.
Matt: You look over and you see Vax dart off around the corner and dodge down an alleyway.
Marisha: Vax? Vax!
Matt: You faintly hear Keyleth's voice behind you.
Liam: Not now, Kiki. And I just keep going.
Laura: Did you find him?
Marisha: Nope.
Laura: Vax!
Matt: You guys spend the better part of the day searching for him. Asking questions, nobody has an idea. A few individuals try and squeeze some gold out of you. You eventually manage to gather they have no idea what they're talking about. By about early afternoon, two o'clock in the afternoon, you eventually make your way back to the keep, figuring that he'll find his way back if he doesn't want to be found. Upon arrival, the guards also haven't seen him. But once you go up to your room to get into more comfortable attire, your brother is sitting inside your room, waiting.
Laura: Well, there you are. What's going on?
Liam: Look, everything's fine. All right?
Laura: I believe you. Fully.
Liam: Everything's fine. I just don't know what we're doing, anymore.
Laura: What do you mean?
Liam: I don't know what we're doing, I don't know why we're doing it. I don't know! I've just been thinking about it, I mean, what is the point of our lives?
Laura: Well, that's a very deep question.
Liam: Yeah. It's fine, let's go. I don't know what I missed. I can go wherever everybody wants to go.
Laura: No. (sigh) Sit down! Seems like a problem in your mind. Are you mad because we're stealing gold? Are you mad because everybody's running off in directions and you can't keep up? Are you mad because you almost died?
Liam: No. When it was just you and me, I knew what we were doing. We were just trying to survive.
Laura: Right! That's really all we're doing now, just on a grander scale.
Liam: (sighs) We're running into this shit on purpose now. Which is all right, when there's reason. I don't always know why we're doing the things we do. It was fun, breaking into that house. I'm good at it!
Laura: Yes, you are.
Liam: I don't know why we did it! I don't know why I'm working with a large fucking beast of a man who seems to despise me. Day after day.
Laura: He doesn't despise you.
Liam: The fuck he doesn't. I don't know why we're doing it. I don't know why we're with most of these people! And I love these people, but I don't know why we're doing it! And I just want you to think about a little bit too. And I walk out the door.
Laura: I get ready for the evening.
Matt: Okay. As the sun draws across the sky, pushing towards dusk as the light blue begins to turn to a somewhat purplish-orange hue, you all gather your materials, whatever attire you wish to bring, and make your way towards the Cloudtop District. Anyone wish to do anything else?
Liam: I'm going through my vast array of cloaks. (laughter)
Liam: And I'm taking the other one. And putting of all my many two cloaks, I'm going to put the other one on.
Matt: All right.
Sam: Can I swing by Gilmore's and just see if he or-- Sherri works there?
Matt: Sherri works there.
Sam: Sherri works there, if they're around?
Matt: Going to ask. Sherri kinda greets you as you enter and goes, "Hello, Scanlan. Gilmore is back in Westruun, weeks away from opening his new establishment, but can I help you?"
Sam: Two things. One, when he returns, he made me a potion, a while back. I'm running a bit low. It was a scrying sort of thing. When he gets back, maybe he can whip me up another batch for next time I come pay a visit, but also-- oh, yes?
Matt: She puts up her hand for a second and walks off through the beaded curtains in the back, and comes back with Gilmore.
Sam: Oh!
Matt: Gilmore steps forth. "Terribly sorry, Scanlan, trying to keep business right now kind of on the DL. There's a special event tonight." And you see how dressed up he is. "I imagine, being part of the council, you're probably invited too."
Sam: Yes, I was just going there now.
Matt: "Oh, well, I'll accompany you!"
Sam: All right, we'll save business for another day.
Matt: "Well, what business did you have?"
Sam: I just wondered-- I may want to try to find someone at some point tonight. I don't know how.
Matt: "Hmm, scrying. We've had this conversation before."
Sam: Yes, but a different sort, a less fecal sort.
Matt: "Not going to lie, I'm very glad to hear that."
Liam: Fecal matters.
Sam: I don't know how to scry, I don't know how to find someone or what I need. I may have a hair strand or two, but I don't have much to go on.
Matt: "That should be plenty. If I can't help you, I know a few that might be able to."
Sam: All right.
Matt: "But! Nevertheless." And he adjusts his collar and he's very, very well dressed in his long, deep navy robes, a high collar that nips at the side of his neck. "Shall we?"
Sam: Absolutely. You lead!
Matt: He leads you out towards the Cloudtop.
Travis: Could I have also gone to Gilmore's?
Matt: If you'd like to.
Sam: Oh! Oh, Grog! Oh, Jesus!
Travis: No no no, just, we go in together and when he's talking to Gilmore, I find one of the lesser clerks and I say: Do you sell lockpicks here?
Matt: The other clerk is probably a new hire, you haven't seen him here before. Young, early 20s, very, very thin hair, kind of waify. "Lockpicks? This isn't--"
Travis: Yeah, you know. I keep locking myself in the shitter and I'm really tired of asking people to come let me out. It's really--
Matt: "I wish I could help. Those are outlawed, I'm sorry. That's not really--"
Travis: Look, I've got these huge clumsy-fuck hands. Is there anything you could give me, maybe magical, that would just keep me from being embarrassed in front of my friends? It smells so bad and then they all come and the door opens and it's just awful!
Matt: As you're getting closer and closer to him, this, looming goliath who's feigning fear and worry in his face, the guy just retracts. "I'm sorry! I don't-- We're closing shop!"
Travis: No, do you have like a wand or a potion or like, a thing--
Matt: "Good night!" And he runs up the stairs to the second floor.
Travis: Fucking shit. (laughter)
Travis: Lovely goods you have here. I'll let myself out.
Matt: "We'll come with you don't worry!" He puts his other arm out.
Travis: All right.
Matt: The three of you arm in arm.
Liam: He's currently like this.
Matt: Yeah! He's, like, lifted.
Sam: It's the Wizard of Oz!
Matt: Yeah! You skip along, the rest of you make your way to the Cloudtop, and you make your way around the stage and it's against the wall, near one of the entrances to the Cloudtop, but on the interior. And you can see there is a rather large stage up against the wall. There is already a crowd gathered. You see merchants, highborn families, political guests, upper-station military, a number of well-dressed representatives from all over Emon have gathered for this. You guys meet up with the rest of the group and you kind of, you know, gravitate. Gilmore gives everyone a quick wave and gives you a respectful nod. "Aha! Yes!" and he wanders off and starts mingling with some of the other guests. Just as the sun vanishes beneath the distant horizon, a procession of palace guards approach the area, the crowd parting, as Uriel arrives with the escort, flanked by his family, and the current inner council of Tal'Dorei with Arbiter Brom, Seeker Asum, Tofor Brotorus. Allura is absent of course, for being in Whitestone. They all step onto the stage along with the guards as well, as cheers and light applause begins to break out. Not crazy go wild, but just like (muted) "Hooray."
Marisha: Rich people clapping, sure.
Matt: Yeah, you know.
Matt: Guards have already set up a few chairs on the stage. Uriel begins to sit on one as his family gathers behind it, and he puts his hand out and motions to everybody to go ahead and hush down. As he does, he stands up from his chair. "Friends and family. Allies of this fair city of Emon. Houses-in-arms to the Tal'Dorei family. Guests, guardians and law-keepers alike. I thank you for coming on such short notice. Now, it has not escaped me that talk spreads quickly within these walls, and rumors only seek to undermine trust. It is true Lord Riskel Daxio, honored member of our council and overseer of development within Emon for many years, has unfortunately passed away. We mourn our friend, and ask you all to respect his legacy enough to not to smear his name. That being said, this was just one of many hardships that has befallen our council and my family this past year. Many that have left me with a terrible burden. We've been faced with deceit, and I failed to see it. We've been beset with allies in need, and I have been noncommittal in aiding them. We've been clouded by demonic powers, and I've failed to protect my family. And my responsibility to all of you. I look back at my bloodline, at my father and his father before him, and I plainly see what I am not. These times are different. This wonderful city has grown these past centuries into something grand: a beacon of civilization, here in these lands that my ancestors gave name to. My family has built us up, and I feel that there is little more my family can accomplish for the greatness of these lands. It has outgrown our meager guidance. I did not choose to be your sovereign; it was by blood that I came into this. And I did my very, very best to live up to your expectations. I can see the future of you all and I wish to safeguard it, by leaving it not in one hand, but the hands of many. As of the end of this week, I will be stepping down as your sovereign. The Tal'Dorei bloodline will no longer hold the fate of this realm. We will instead leave the council to rule." And he looks about at the other council members, on out to you, out to the rest of the group. "There will be a chosen few, exemplary members of our society, who will step up and aid in this task, and join the council as well. You, the peoples of Emon, will be the ones to guide us to a new age of prosperity." At this point now the claps come in again and some cheers happen. There's a little bit of confusion in the crowd, but for the most part everyone seems to be into it. At this moment, one of the guards hurries up the side of the stage and, you notice, whispers something into Asum's ear, who leans over and gives a nod and worried expression. Vex.
Laura: (giggles) Yay!
Sam: (radio DJ voice) Don't forget to subscribe to Geek and Sundry, so you can see archives of the show and many others! I don't even know--
Laura: Wait.
Travis: It's hard, right? When one ear's in and one ear's out, it's tough. I was trying to plug it.
Sam: Remember, Liam doesn't really hate Travis in real life! (laughter)
Laura: Wait, wait. As soon as I notice that, I touch Grog and Vax's shoulders and I point up really fast.
Matt: You look up and-- you guys all gather this as well. You can see, piercing out of some of the cloud cover above, what looks to be two fast-moving streaks of color, black and red. They just-- (whoosh). And then you can't see them any more.
Laura: Could I tell from my favored enemy-ness that it was dragons?
Matt: You can make a hefty perception check if you like to see exactly how much detail you can make out.
Travis: Can I look up, too?
Matt: No. I'm giving her this because of her really high perception.
Laura: No, that was wrong. 23.
Matt: 23. It's hard to make out details from this distance. They're moving quick.
Laura: One black and one red?
Matt: Uriel now goes, "I am beyond confident that all doubts in the capabilities of those I leave the city to, and more--" And it's at this point you start hearing bells going off around the city. Tops of walls in the distance. You recognize these. These are warning bells. At which point the crowd starts murmuring and getting nervous, and Uriel puts his hand out. "Please, please. I--"
Laura: Can I use my Primeval Awareness to see if it's actually dragons close by?
Matt: Okay. You begin to concentrate on that for the moment. Asum now steps up and says, "Everyone, if I might ask you to all quickly make your way to your respective homes. There is a small emergency we must attend to." At this point, you guys hear this (whoosh) sound and you turn around just in time to see what looks to be a large, larger than you've seen before, white dragon just slam into the side of Allura's tower in the distance. Claws clunk into the side, digging into the stonework, wings unfurled, it looks into the upper window of where her actual parlor is and peeks in for a second before just unleashing a blast of icy cold magical breath into the inside of the tower. You can see now, screams start tearing around you as the guards start getting their weapons ready. At which point, the dragon pulls its head back and looks about at everyone screaming, and pushes off the tower. As it does you see the stonework crack, and the top of Allura's tower shatter--
Laura: Oh, my god!
Matt: -- and then begin to collapse, smashing into the city streets around you. At which point, the dragon (wingbeats) and takes off again above you. At this point in time: utter chaos has been unleashed, and you can see now the guards are rushing Uriel off the table. You guys are there caught amongst this chaos. At this very moment, as the white dragon heads deeper into the city, you hear a loud impact that silences the chaotic air around you, as the wall that the stage is buttressed up against now has perched above it an enormous vision of death: a grinning ancient green dragon. Its wings are curled around its form as it looks down at the rest of you in the middle of this open space and goes, "Delicious cattle. Raishan enjoys the taste of fear."
Laura: Raishan?
Marisha: Raishan?
Matt: At which point it leaps down onto the stage, crushing part of it. I would like you all to roll initiative.
Marisha: No, what?!
Sam: We can't fight four dragons. Can we?
Marisha: Wait, did you say four? He didn't say four.
Laura: There's a red and a black, a white and a green.
Sam: There's a red and a black, a white and a green.
Travis: Are the red and black dragons?
Laura: They were red and black-- of course they were fucking dragons!
Travis: You're sure?
Laura: Everything else was dragons; why wouldn't it be dragons?
Taliesin: For the love of God and all that is holy.
Marisha: Oh Jesus Christ, Taliesin.
Laura: Are we fighting something now?
Marisha: Are we just fighting one?
Sam: Oh, hi, dragon!
Laura: Oh, hi, dragon, you're my favourite customer.
Matt: Grog and Vex were there. Percy was here. Pike was here.
Sam: Don't worry, I'll kill it with music.
Marisha: Holy balls!
Matt: And this is the chaotic pattern of individuals amongst here.
Sam: My god, look at all those fuckers!
Matt: All right! Now, if I could go ahead and have the initiative scores from you guys. 25 to 20?
Travis: 20 again.
Matt: Anybody else? All right. Okay. 20 to 15?
Liam: 15 again.
Marisha: 15 as well.
Matt: All right. Ten to five?
Laura: 14.
Matt: Oh, 14, sorry. 14.
Sam: 13.
Matt: Scanlan, Pike is after you. Percy, what did you get?
Taliesin: Nine.
Matt: All right.
Laura: The castle looks really badass. It's just off of camera.
Matt: Is it? Let me see if I can scoot this forward a little bit for you guys. Now. Top of the round, Grog you're up.
Laura: Are we really fighting this right now?
Matt: Right there. You're right there, where the red base is.
Laura: What's happening?
Marisha: I dunno, what the fuck do we do?
Travis: Well, I only do one thing-- (yelling) I go into a rage! And a frenzied rage! And I take out Craven Edge, and I say, how do you feel about dragon?
Matt: "I think it sounds delicious; let's try a taste."
Travis: (laughs) Great Weapon Master-- I run up to the dragon and hack away!
Matt: All right, make your strikes.
Travis: All right, fucking hell, where's that son of a bitch? 19.
Matt: 19 misses.
Sam: 19 misses?
Matt: Yes.
Travis: Everybody hear that?
Marisha: Dragon.
Travis: 22.
Matt: Just barely hits.
Marisha: It has an AC of 22. It's some bullshit.
Travis: (mutters) That'll miss.
Sam: Wait, how do I do anything to it?
Matt: Vex, you are familiar with dragons, as one of your enemies. Only the most ancient and powerful of dragons ever reach this size. Chromatic dragons are very selfish entities and do not usually work with individuals of other color patterns. The fact that this is this coordinated between multiple is a very, very bad sign. You're suddenly brought back to a singular moment in your past when you recall seeing four orbs embedded in a wall.
Laura: Yeah, no, I think we-- We brought this on ourselves.
Liam: Chickens come home to roost.
Matt: So, Grog, damage on the one strike?
Travis: Just on the one. Oh, yeah right, I'm sorry I was so caught up in the fact that I'm just literally going up against death incarnate-- hey!
Marisha: We had no fucking reason to go into that basement.
Travis: 19.
Matt: 19? Okay, 19 damage, good to know. All right, that ends your turn. First, it is Raishan. Raishan-- (roars). As you can see now, this burbling cloud of greenish black fume just spills out of its open jaws, outward towards the crowd.
Laura: Jesus!
Matt: All right.
Sam: Jesus Crit!
Matt: I need Grog, Vex, Pike, and Vax, and Percy to all make a constitution saving throw.
Marisha: Am I in there as well?
Sam: I was in there as well, I think.
Matt: You were as well, yeah. You guys were as well. So all-- Yep. Pretty much everyone but-- heh-- everyone but Trinket, probably for the best.
Travis: Ten plus eight is 18.
Sam: This is a constitution saving throw?
Matt: Correct.
Sam: Can I use Cutting Words on this? Is this a magical effect? No, wait.
Matt: No this isn't a saving throw thing. It just happens.
Sam: Oof!
Laura: Bad?
Sam: Oh yeah! (laughs)
Sam: Five.
Taliesin: 14 with resolve.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Seven.
Liam: 14.
Laura: 20.
Travis: 18.
Matt: Okay. All of you take 66 points of poison damage, as you feel your lungs and your outer flesh begin to burn and curl.
Laura: 20 didn't save?
Matt: Nope. The rest of the crowd around you screams out in horrible pain as the rest of them gasp and fall to the ground.
Marisha: Holy fuck, he just took out the entire council.
Travis: If I had resistance to poison damage because of the Belt of Dwarvenkind, is that halved?
Matt: You take that halved, yes. You take only 33.
Travis: Oh, fuck me. I'm like, I can't remember-- I can't remember what I'm trying to do. We got to go!
Matt: Actually, before your turn is over, the dragon (whoosh) repositions itself for the rest of the crowd over there. You get an attack of opportunity against it, if you want.
Travis: Oh hey, awesome. That's a 19.
Matt: 19? That does not hit. You go to strike-- it's already out of the way and you find yourself even amongst your rage shaken by this, as you look around for the first time and realize that the crowds of people that were around you are now face down, unmoving on the ground, amongst the open space. As it steps across the wood as it lands, ruining the last bit of stage and landing on the opposite side, Keyleth, it's your turn.
Marisha: Are there any trees nearby?
Travis: Wouldn't mind turning into that mist right now.
Marisha: No shit-- I didn't learn it! Go ahead.
Matt: There is a tree. There's a tree about 100 feet in that direction.
Marisha: 100 feet?!
Laura: Or go inside.
Marisha: All right, everyone's around me, more or less?
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: I slam my staff on the ground and I cast Anti-Life Shell and I say, (shouts) everyone in the shell-- we're running!
Matt: Okay. How big is the radius of the shell?
Marisha: It's not that big. It's ten feet radius, so you guys are going to have to get close to me.
Marisha: Ten feet.
Liam: That's enough for all of us.
Marisha: That's enough for all of us if we gather.
Matt: That's your radius there.
Sam: I'm right there already!
Matt: All right.
Marisha: Pike and Scanlan are in it, everyone else needs to get close.
Matt: Yep, all right, and you're going to stay there? Wait for everyone to gather to you, or are you just going to run and everyone else has to catch up? Which, if everyone else makes a dash movement, they could probably get to you next round.
Travis: Yeah, just go.
Marisha: All right, yeah, I'll do like 20 feet, not my full 30 but enough to where people-- no, fuck it, I'll do 30 feet.
Matt: Okay, so you're 30 feet up to the edge there. All right, that ends your turn. Vax.
Liam: I click my boots, and I-- Shit, where is everybody?
Laura: Running towards Keyleth.
Liam: I yank Trinket by the fur on his butt and say, come on Trinket! And then start running backwards and grabbing at my sister's cloak as I go towards Keyleth.
Matt: Okay, with the boots of haste you get up within this area pretty easy. Trinket turns and sees you run and looks over towards you, which, it's your next turn.
Laura: Okay. I don't know why we're not running inside, instead of away. Are we running?
Marisha: We're running to the tree. So we can Transport Via Plants, was the thought.
Laura: Got it. Okay, I'm going to shout out in Draconic, and I'm going to say: Raishan! Is that his name?
Matt: Raishan is what it seemed to refer to itself as.
Laura: Raishan!
Marisha: You got it, you got it!
Laura: So sorry for whatever pissed you off so bad--
Sam: All right, you had it.
Laura: Your fight's with us, not with this city. Leave the townspeople alone. And I take off
Matt: Okay. I imagine you tell Trinket to do the same?
Laura: Yeah, yeah, of course.
Matt: So you rush up. Trinket comes and gathers off to the side there--
Marisha: He's going to kill us, yeah.
Laura: Oh! Oh! Can I cast something?
Matt: We'll say, you are now there, for those who want to see there, technically, there off to the side.
Laura: Can I cast something?
Matt: To get over there would take both-- it would take a dash action, so, no. Unless it's a bonus action, then you could've, like Hunter's Mark if you want to do something like that.
Laura: I guess I'll do Hunter's Mark on him. I was going to do Protection From Poison, so I might not full dash.
Matt: Yeah, we'll say-- up to you.
Marisha: Is that a radius thing or just for yourself?
Matt: What do you want to do? Hunter's Mark?
Laura: I'll Hunter's Mark. I'll just dash. I'm just stupid.
Liam: Matt, probably too late, but can I retcon-- say I'm holding my attack, since I didn't do anything? Fine if not, I just thought--
Matt: With the haste you could've gotten there. I'd say sure. So we'll let you have it. All right, holding your attack for what?
Liam: If it bears down on us.
Matt: Okay. Scanlan.
Sam: Me? I'm going to--
Laura: (gasps) What about Gilmore!? Where is he? He was right next to us.
Matt: I know.
Travis: Just keep-- it's not about Gilmore right now-- it's Scanlan's turn.
Sam: Where is he?
Matt: You can make a perception check.
Sam: 12.
Matt: 12? You don't see Gilmore anywhere. You look about the bodies. You know the color of his robe, but you don't see it anywhere on the ground. In the chaos you really have no idea where he is.
Sam: Okay, I will-- (sings) Bigby's Hand! Shamone! I will Bigby's Hand and put it right in front of him and-- wow, it's so tiny compared to him! (laughter)
Sam: I will use it as a Interposing Hand, blocking him from approaching us. And I will use my movement to climb into the circle of good.
Matt: Okay, you can get there. Okay, that ends your turn.
Sam: And I'll-- shit.
Matt: Want to inspire somebody?
Sam: I guess, I mean, who's near him? Just Grog right?
Matt: Right now, it's Grog, Percy and Pike are all still out right now.
Sam: They'll get away right, they're going to run? You're going to run, right? They'll be fine. All right. I'll inspire Grog by saying, you're a magnificent, handsome bastard, don't die!
Matt: All right. You take a d10 inspiration die.
Travis: Thank you.
Matt: Pike is going to rush right here and is going to attempt to cast Mass Cure Wounds. Mass Cure Wounds as a 6th-level spell, so that's 4d8 plus five. Six creatures in a 30 foot radius. So that'll be-- all of you. She's not going to do it to herself. Or, she can't do it to Grog, so she can get--
Sam: Grog, did you get hit?
Matt: She can get everyone but Trinket, but Trinket seems fine, so-- that is seven, eight, 12, 15 plus five-- 20 points healed to all of you guys.
Sam: Great, that'll help.
Matt: Except for Grog. That's going to be her turn, and she just moves into the circle there with the rest of her movement. That brings us to Percy.
Taliesin: I'm going to look for Gilmore.
Matt: Perception check.
Taliesin: What!
Laura: What happened to you, Percy?
Taliesin: I don't know. Nine.
Matt: In this chaos, you have no idea where he is, unfortunately.
Taliesin: I'm going to hold my attack for if the dragon comes towards us and I'm going to run into the--
Matt: You rush in. all right, at the end of your turn, all the rest of these guys just go running. Running as far away as possible, getting up, going at full sprint all over. The guards are trying to usher people out of the way. You have crying mothers who can't find their kid--
Laura: Oh god.
Matt: You have absolute chaos, and at this point your hear in the distance a large explosion, as you see a rolling cloud of fire rise up in the distance over the mountain and the rest of regular Emon, surrounding the Cloudtop District. This guy over here's going to run as well. Beginning of that turn, Grog you're up.
Travis: I'm booking ass.
Matt: Okay, with a dash you get over to there.
Sam: Don't worry, my magical hand is there. (laughs)
Matt: Raishan now is going to move over here.
Sam: Hey, but, I try to stop him!
Matt: The hand is going to try to--
Sam: Got a strength of 26.
Marisha: That's awesome.
Matt: Interposing Hand just gives you cover against the target, and it can't move the hand's space if its strength is four, so it's not going to move through the space, it's going to try and move to the side. So instead of going after you guys, the hand just moves with it and keeps it in between, but it stays approximately here. It then blows towards this crowd here, just catching Grog in the corner. So Grog, I need you to make another constitution save.
Sam: With inspiration.
Matt: With inspiration, if you'd like, if you need it.
Travis: (mutters) I'm okay. 26.
Matt: 26. You succeed, so you take we'll say 33 points of poison damage, halved, to 17. All right. The rest of these guys except for-- Oh, no, Grog, no! Grog, no! Those guys all survive, though they're coughing and trying to get away. This brings us to end of his turn. At this point in time you look up and see (whoosh whoosh) another set of wings come slamming down onto this side.
Travis: Holy shit, look at the size of that thing. What the hell?
Sam: (laughing) What is that thing?
Matt: As it lands, it looks down at the group and then runs up the side of a building's rooftop up here.
Marisha: Oh, Jesus Christ!
Laura: So we're totally getting in the tree, I know it, we're going to make it.
Sam: (laughs) The tree has been evaporated.
Matt: So, the rest of you guys, are you all moving as a group forward?
Sam: Oh, hells yes!
Matt: Okay, you all go rushing-- You all go dashing forward. At full speed, aside from Vax, who can get to the tree this turn, the rest of you are going to get halfway there.
Marisha: Fuck!
Matt: So we'll say for the purposes of this movement, we'll move it backward.
Marisha: There's not a closer bush? Nothing closer we can jump in?
Matt: No, not currently. the closest large enough plant to use this ability--
Sam: Me and Pike get there, because I Dimension Door us.
Matt: Okay. Actually, technically Grog can get there too, and Vax and Pike and Scanlan. You guys all get there. The rest of you are all inside the Anti-Life Shell as you're running.
Liam: I'm not going to leave the group, I'm going to pace with them.
Matt: As you're pushing forward, the large black dragon is just toying with you-- it's climbing across the rooftops, and just watching you as you run, and you hear it chuckling under its breath-- (menacing chuckle, whoosh, impact).
Taliesin: Okay, is he taking to the air?
Matt: He takes to the air and jumps to another rooftop.
Taliesin: I'm going to try as I'm running-- do I have enough time to try and take a shot?
Matt: You can, yeah.
Taliesin: Am I going to be able to keep up with he group?
Matt: Probably not.
Taliesin: Never mind. Damn it, never mind.
Matt: So you're like, "shit," and you just keep running. It now jumped over onto this rooftop and Raishan has moved up toward the center and making its way towards you. At this moment, another burst of fire over the wall much closer goes (boom) and swooping out of it, out of the flames, you see the largest red dragon you've ever experienced come swooshing through the flames, rises up past. The two other dragons almost lower their heads as it passes over.
Sam: Maybe they just want their gold back?
Matt: (whoosh) It swoops past without even noticing you all, slams onto the top of the palace, causing part of the entire throne room glass-domed structure to (shattering noise) shatter and break inward before it turns around and plants itself outward. You've seen ancient dragons-- this is large for an ancient dragon. In fact, by its sheer size, you feel like you may have have encountered this individual before when you were passing through the plane of fire.
Laura: That fuck that was like the biggest dragon ever ever?
Sam: I don't remember that.
Marisha: They guy we missed because we laid low from him and he flew over and we were like: 'don't move,' and we missed him?
Matt: As it lands, the two other dragons take a step back and recoil and snarl and you hear this voice come just tearing through the center of the Cloudtop District, saying, "Move on, Umbrasyl. I claim this as my domain now. The rest of you have a task to complete. Go! I shall remain and set a new dominion of the Chroma Conclave."
Sam: (whispering) Chroma Conclave, that's so cool!
Matt: At which point the two other dragons snap at each other and they both-- the black one just takes off in this distance. The green dragon stalks for a second and then (snarls) angrily turns around and climbs back onto the top of the wall and then flies off into the distance as well, both of them heading westward.
Laura: West.
Sam: Oh, we're okay! Hey guys, it's fine.
Matt: You watch as they curve around and start heading east.
Laura: East?
Matt: At this point, you guys have now reached the outskirts of the tree and you can see now this large red dragon has planted itself--
Laura: He died! He died!
Matt: He's fine, he flew off, it's fine. Just begins breathing flames into the center of the Cloudtop. As you can briefly see javelins being thrown, bolts being shot, and you hear a wave of screams in the distance as it rains death through the center of Emon. You're at the tree, Keyleth. Where are you going? Where are you going?
Marisha: Where are we going, what are we doing? Do we want go back to the keep?
Marisha: What do we do?
Laura: To the keep. Get underground.
Travis: We need that skull.
Marisha: What?!
Travis: The skull grants a wish.
Marisha: Grog!
Sam: Just get to the keep-- we can talk about it there.
Marisha: I cast Transport Via Plants on the fucking tree!
Matt: The tree-- opens up and a small oval, almond-shaped portal and you can see, it's in the intensity, it's partially unstable but it's keeping itself clean. You guys each dive in as the Anti-Life shell vanishes.
Laura: I shout  Gilmore! Before I go though.
Matt: Okay, and you come leaping through the center of the tree as it closed behind you. And we're going to end tonight's session on that point!
Liam: Thought we were going to be starting a brand-new Shadowrun campaign next week!
Sam: You know, maybe the warden of that jail was a dragon! And he invited his friends to find us.
Laura: Did this all happen because we went back to General Krieg's place? Did we kill the entire city because we went back to General Krieg's place?
Sam: But think of the 4,000 gold we got! (laughs)
Laura: Or maybe this was a long time coming and it just happened to time up.
Sam: We'll find out.
Marisha: I'm hoping it's the first, I'm hoping it's the first.
Matt: We shall see if all of these interests come to reveal themselves in the future--
Liam: That was frightening, man.
Matt: -- for future episodes of Critical Role.
Marisha: What did we do?
Travis: You just massacred people. You just committed genocide.
Matt: I just destroyed something that I built. It's a really weird feeling.
Laura: You destroyed your whole city, Matt.
Marisha: The whole city, everyone's dead.
Travis: Well done!
Sam: Not everyone, just a couple of dozen people. And Gilmore.
Laura: This is Act Two of the game, of the video game that you're playing.
Marisha: Holy fuck.
Matt: So with that, folks, as it closes on 11 o'clock, we have to get ourselves a rest for the evening. We hope you've enjoyed tonight's game. I forgot to announce earlier because I was feeling all tense and-- yeah-- but we have a winner of our initial drawing.
Taliesin: It was a thing, wasn't it?
Matt: Earl Grey Austin was the winner tonight of our Critical Role package. So congratulations to you, buddy
Taliesin: Someone won tonight! That's so nice.
Laura: Someone won.
Matt: All right, well guys, have a wonderful night, thank you all for watching, we'll see you next Thursday.
Marisha: I'm going to have an aneurysm.

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around, roll dice, and play Dungeons and Dragons, while Liam curses at me a few seconds before we start the show to try and throw me off. It's worked once before.
Taliesin: Cock goblins.
Matt: It'll probably work again. (laughs) Welcome to the show. So yeah, for the returning friends, thank you for coming, and for new folks, welcome to the chaos.
Travis: Get the fuck out.
Laura: Don't say that.
Matt: It's already so hostile here tonight. So I guess first and foremost, let's see if we can get through these announcements pretty quick. First and foremost, a reminder, me and Marisha will be in Colorado tomorrow at the Colorado Anime Fest. We'll be guests this weekend there, so if any folks are coming out, we'll look forward to seeing you. We'll be flying over bright and early tomorrow morning. Taliesin, you're also--
Taliesin: I will be in Phoenix, Arizona at the Amazing Comic Con, and if you follow me on Twitter, @executivegoth, I will actually tell you where I will be at the convention at various times.
Matt: So you can stalk him.
Taliesin: You can stalk me. I'll be very stalkable. E-stalk.
Marisha: It's like Santa Tracker, but Taliesin Tracker.
Matt: Yeah. Waldo Tracker. Why has nobody done that yet? Give it some time. Let's see. Also, I guess, tonight we're going to be trying out this new table camera here on the side to give you a separate view of the battle. We can switch around as we're finding our way through the amorphous betterment of our program.
Liam: Can we work in like a Wolf Blizter hologram? Like they have on CNN as well?
Matt: I'll put that on the wish list.
Liam: On the table, next to all the guys.
Matt: Only if it's actually Wolf Blitzer, though. If we can have him running through the battlefield, it'll be great.
Taliesin: Just his head, floating.
Matt: But yeah, so you can head to the Geek and Sundry Amazon wish list, the link should be in the chat, for other things they're looking for to hopefully try and improve this experience and bring it to you guys and be even better going forward. So you can check that out, and this camera's our first leap in that direction, so you can let us know how you think it works and bear with us as we still figure this whole thing out. Let's see. Also, next week, most of us will be at Wizard World Portland. That's our first Wizard World, you can check out the website for information about our events and signings and tickets and stuff like that, so go check it out, please, we look forward to seeing you guys, and we'll see you up in Portland next weekend. What else do we have going on?
Liam: Well, you know, we have an ongoing relationship with Wyrmwood Gaming, which you can find on the internet. They make beautiful boxes for holding dice and stuff, and if you use the code "critrole," "critrole," you will get free shipping. They have all different kinds of woods, they're lovely. And then also, hey, this is an impromptu announcement, but Kurtis Wiebe just announced on the Twitters, Kurtis Wiebe is the writer for the comic book Rat Queens.
Laura: Amazing.
Liam: We all are addicted to it. He works with Tess Fowler, who's the artist right now, and basically their outfit and our outfit are in love, and Kurtis announced on Twitter today that he is going to be shoving Vox Machina in there in some way, somehow, and we're very excited.
Laura: We're making a cameo appearance in Rat Queens, you guys!
Taliesin: Our first cameo.
Sam: I want to be the rat!
Matt: (laughs) You would, wouldn't you? So stupid excited for that. Can't even. I can't even. It's so dumb. So dumb. Life is dumb. Life is dumb. But yeah. So, we got that going on. I can't think of anything else. If anything else comes up, we'll throw it in there in the mid-break, but in the meantime--
Sam: Oh yeah, I want to give a quick shout-out to my charity of choice, the Pablove Foundation.
Matt: Yes!
Sam: I talked to them today. Their minds were blown by all the gifts that people have sent in and donations in the name of Critical Role and the Critter community. They didn't quite understand what the Critter community was, but I enlightened them, and they're so jazzed by you guys. And they appreciate not just the donations and gifts, but also, they said that the Critters have been writing long letters and telling great stories and stuff, and they're super excited.
Marisha: That's awesome!
Sam: So keep it going to those charities. The Pablove Foundation.
Marisha: Yeah, should we go off and do a shout-out of each of our charities?
Matt: Sure, go for it.
Taliesin: First Place for Youth. I'll have a link up to my Twitter in about five minutes. They help kids get through school, they help kids who are orphaned and having issues get their stuff together and become fabulous teenagers like we need in this world.
Marisha: We do. And of course, Sam is with Pablove Foundation.
Sam: The Pablove Foundation.
Marisha: Pablove Foundation, which is amazing. I chose the Nature Conservancy. They're great and they protect the lands and the animals that is very important so we can keep having a beautiful green world.
Liam: I chose the Planetary Society, just in case the green world dies, and it promotes exploration of space, and the stuff like that.
Laura: I chose My Friend's Place, which is an awesome, very similar to Taliesin's, it's an awesome place for teenagers that are runaways or living on the streets. It gives them a place that they can crash and really help get their stuff together.
Matt: 'Sup, Jewel-face?
Travis: I am the Vision. (laughter)
Matt: Donate to the Vision.
Travis: Yes, I have Operation Supply Drop, which is a great charity service that delivers fun where there is none to soldiers that are in combat overseas. It delivers gaming systems, games, brings some much-needed levity to areas of high intensity and overall warrior badassmanship, and I'm very proud of that.
Liam: What a variety of charities.
Marisha: Yeah, that's a good stretch of charities.
Matt: My charity.
Marisha: Oh, yeah.
Sam: Oh, yeah.
Matt: I got one too, guys!
Marisha: Sorry. I sometimes forget about you, because you're on that side.
Matt: I know, it happens.
Liam: You're god!
Matt: Hey, no, overlooked my entire life, it's nothing new. My charity is First Book, which brings reading materials to underprivileged children and helps people become more confident readers and youth that don't have access to programs to help promote literary adventure and really delving into the amazing thing that is reading. Thank you guys for helping us support that, it's been really fantastic.
Marisha: All things that are important for the future.
Matt: So important. More than you'd give it credit for. Yes.
Marisha: And of course, as always, Critical Role always supports 826LA.
Laura: Yes, continually.
Marisha: Continually. They are our sponsored charity of choice, and of course look up 826, there might be an 826 in your area. And you should go to their storefronts. They make great date locations, as Taliesin always says.
Taliesin: Yes, great date.
Laura: Oh, they really do, that is a really good place.
Matt: Find a date. Take them there.
Marisha: Find the date first.
Matt: Tell them Critical Role sent you.
Marisha: Don't try and find dates at 826. That gets-- that's bad. (laughter)
Taliesin: Wow, you took that to a dark place. You took that--
Matt: Anyway. So. So. Let us go ahead and delve into tonight's game proper, folks. So, to get you up to speed, Vox Machina, the intrepid band of adventurers you see before you, after a series of adventures, had found their way back to their central city of Emon, in the center of the region of Tal'Dorei. After a ceremony in which the leader of their city, Sovereign Uriel Tal'Dorei, was announcing him stepping down, the town was suddenly under siege by a group of extremely powerful and dangerous ancient dragons that call themselves the Chroma Conclave. After tearing the city asunder in many places, three of them flew off into the east under the instruction of the fourth and possibly largest and leader of the group, that has recently been found to be called Thordak the Cinder King, who currently resides in the center of the city of Emon, claiming that his mercy is only for those who worship him and essentially feed his greed and hunger. As such, Vox Machina, narrowly escaping the battle, a couple of encounters with these dragons, including one above their Keep, are housing a number of survivors who have made their way out of the city and are currently residing in Greyskull Keep for protection. You guys went into the city to see if you could find any other allies and friends that may have survived this encounter. You befriended a member of the Clasp, named Garthok, who walked amongst the rubble and proceeded to show you the secret entrance he knows to the Clasp, of which you may be trying to inquire about information. On your way to that area, you passed by Gilmore's shop, Gilmore being a good friend of the group and a powerful magic practitioner and creator of magical items and artifacts and a number of glorious goods. His abode, however, smashed and currently a pile of burnt wood and rock. Looters were currently poring through, and you attempted to get them to leave the area alone. It came to blows, and with many of the looters falling in battle, two of which were kept locked away. You discovered the location of where they were hoarding the massive amounts of gold and artifacts that they had acquired from the rubble. You then found the secret compartment in which Gilmore's teleportation sigil was locked beneath his shop, where the remaining family of Tal'Dorei, Salda and the three children, as well as Gilmore himself, wounded and barely alive, having saved them. You found that Uriel, the Sovereign, did not seemingly survive the encounter with the dragons, and Gilmore nearly fell going back to try and make sure that you guys were okay, barely escaping with his life. You managed to save his, and taking the children, Salda, Sherri, and Gilmore back to Greyskull Keep, some of you splintered off to try and acquire the goods that were taken from his store, however, they apparently had already been stolen from the location they were being stored in, or been delivered already, you're uncertain as to what became of them, but you get the sense that it was probably best that you chose Gilmore over the gold at first glance. Making your way back to the Keep, you've sent Gilmore up to rest for the evening, some of you have then found your way down into the temple of Sarenrae, where a number of the escaped refugees from Emon currently try desperately to cling to their memories, to try and keep the shakes at bay and contemplate what the next step is for survival in this now partially ruined city. That was where we left off. So. What would you like to do?
Sam: Kill all the dragons and save the day.
Matt: Good! Roll for it.
Laura: Oh, that was a good roll. See?
Taliesin: Natural 20. No, no.
Marisha: Good show, guys.
Laura: I rolled five natural 20s before the show even started.
Sam: That's a great, great idea.
Laura: So it's all going to be terrible.
Sam: Why are you rolling before the show?
Travis: She feels like she's got to "warm up" her endless army of dice.
Laura: No, I just have to figure out which ones I want to use that night.
Travis: You have five d20s right now.
Laura: I know, and they're all useful. No, I've got six out here.
Liam: Yeah, yeah, definitely all useful.
Taliesin: This is, by the way, for anybody tuning in for the first time at home, this is how we express that we have no idea what to do.
Sam: Where are we?
Taliesin: We're at home.
Matt: You're in Greyskull Keep.
Sam: And Gilmore's with us?
Matt: Gilmore's with you, he's been brought upstairs--
Liam: And did Pike's holy visitor fix the keep, or is the keep still effed up?
Matt: Actually, in the short time in which her visitor, this angelic deva-like entity that was brought forth from Sarenrae's sphere of influence, did manage to repair entirely the damage that was sustained to the Keep from the battle with Vorugal out in your courtyard. So yes, Greyskull Keep is now back to being intact and rather fairly polished. The stained glass is affixed and corrected.
Liam: It must look so strange next to the ruined city of Emon.
Matt: It's far enough away, but--
Laura: Little strange.
Marisha: So what time is it? It was nighttime, right? Or was it midday?
Matt: It's about midafternoon at this point, maybe pushing into the evening.
Taliesin: Is Kima still around?
Matt: I'm sorry, what was that?
Taliesin: Is Lady Kima still around, or?
Matt: Lady Kima's been in Vasselheim.
Taliesin: Oh, not Vasselheim, I'm sorry. Allura. I'm on the wrong page.
Matt: Yeah, she and Drake went.
Marisha: Remember, they turned into shooting stars and they flew away.
Sam: Is Clarota still here with us? (laughter)
Laura: We're off to a good start tonight, guys.
Matt: In your hearts. In your heart of hearts.
Travis: No, not even there. That piece of shit. Where are the majority of the people? Are they in the dining hall and in the--
Matt: They're scattered between the dining hall and the temple to Sarenrae. Partially because, one, there's enough space there, two, it's a place of sanctity, it's a place of hope, and Pike is currently bringing people-- not preaching to them, per se, but offering comfort in their current area of misery and worry. So those are pretty much the localized areas. Occasionally one of the kids might begin wandering the halls, a parent might chase after them, trying to draw them back in, but respectfully, no one's wandering the house filling their pockets, they're all still happy to be alive at this point.
Laura: Well, that's because we don't have anything, because Scanlan's troupe stole everything anyway.
Matt: There's that, too.
Sam: We bought new silverware.
Travis: Sure we did.
Sam: Maybe it wasn't my troupe, maybe it was our new guests, the people fleeing for their lives.
Travis: I was going to say, are there any new people that have come into the keep while we've been away? Can I ask one of our guards that?
Matt: Sure, yeah. Shayne, who's out front, currently strolling through the courtyard, comes up to you, and as you ask her, she goes, "Well, we've had a few other refugees come in and ask for entry, and we patted them down to make sure there were no weapons and tried our best to keep an eye on them since they arrived. Seems like most everyone's keeping either into the city or keeping fairly underground."
Travis: Nobody's sticking out to you, though, no shady individuals, nobody sweating more than is necessary when being threatened by a big fuck-off dragon?
Matt: "Not yet, but I believe Jarett's keeping a close eye."
Travis: Jarett--
Sam: That guy. Man-crush?
Travis: No. (laughter)
Sam: I wonder, in all prudence, should we go around to the 'fugees, the refugees and do a quick--
Laura: Insight check?
Sam: -- scan, alignment check or something?
Travis: Lauryn Hill is shaking her head.
Laura: Do we have anything that can sense people's alignment?
Sam: Pike might.
Marisha: Yeah, I can.
Sam: Can you do a mass, a mass sense alignment?
Marisha: Mass sense alignment?
Sam: Is that a thing?
Marisha: No, I'm saying I could do some insight checks on people.
Sam: Oh, I'm talking about your magic.
Marisha: No, I'm not Pike.
Sam: All right.
Travis: Pike's with us, though, right? She could do an insight check.
Sam: Is she with us?
Matt: Pike is with you. She is currently helping folks inside the temple. But you could go ask her to.
Liam: Use the skull to wish to know everyone's alignment. Problem solved.
Travis: We'll kill everyone. Kill everyone.
Sam: Maybe we should just kill one of them to make an example.
Laura: This is terrible, what is happening?
Liam: This isn't the real game, the game hasn't actually started yet.
Matt: So. Glancing about the populace of scattered refugees throughout the general vicinity of Greyskull Keep, I will pick two of you who wish to be the main surveyors of the crew.
Sam: Is this insight?
Matt: This would be insight, yes.
Laura: I'm on it.
Marisha: I'm on it with Vex.
Matt: Okay, so Vex and Keyleth, both you guys roll insight checks, please.
Laura: See, this is why I shouldn't have this many dice, because I don't know what to choose. Okay. 21.
Liam: Insight?
Marisha: 22.
Laura: 21.
Matt: Okay. Both of you guys spend about ten, 15 minutes or so scanning through the crew, asking a few questions, helping a few folks out while keeping an eye on reactions around the general vicinity. No one sticks out to you as being either hiding their intent, shifty. There are a few folks that are aloof from the whole experience, who seem to be either in a state of shock, or discomfort based on their current surroundings, but nothing in a way that strikes you as nefarious or worrisome.
Liam: And are they all strangers, other than the people we brought back with us?
Matt: Correct.
Liam: They are strangers?
Matt: Yeah. There's a lot of people that live in Emon, and none of them seem to catch your eye.
Liam: Yeah. Is anyone still badly hurt?
Matt: Most of them have had their wounds tended to. There are a few that have general scars, some from elements of frostbite on their skin, who were caught in the blast, who were salvaged after Vorugal left. There are a few that have scrapes and bruises from fleeing from the town, from collapsing debris from different buildings and such, but no serious injuries. A few bone fractures here and there that have been set and bandaged.
Liam: I'm going to spend the first bit of time at home helping Pike, doing whatever she tells me to do, really, to help the people here.
Marisha: Is there any deceased that need to be tended to?
Matt: Well, there are a number of deceased in the front courtyard, people that were frozen and shattered as part of Vorugal's attack, which at this point, most of them have been taken care of by the guards and given a proper burial on the outside of the Keep, a few yards away, towards the inside of the one of the hills. They haven't been left to thaw, if that was what you're worried about.
Marisha: That's what I was worried about.
Taliesin: Red meat. Red.
Laura: Gross.
Liam: Way to go dark. Way to go dark.
Taliesin: I thought that's what we were doing today.
Matt: Cost-effective. A number of the refugees have also helped the guards as well, transporting the bodies of the deceased and making sure that they're properly interred in the nearby countryside.
Marisha: Okay.
Sam: What are our options here? First of all, do we know Gilmore's status?
Laura: Yeah, we need to get him settled in, make sure he's all right.
Liam: Well, he's gone up, he's resting.
Marisha: Yeah, we put him to bed already.
Liam: He's in Percival's room, I think. You said you would sleep in your laboratory.
Sam: And when we last left things, there was one plan to go into the tunnels of the thieves' guild and try to see if there's any more--
Laura: Yes. Actually, Garthok.
Marisha: Yes.
Laura: Garthok is waiting for us down in those, so we can go look at the Clasp and talk to them and everything, because he's told them we're on our way.
Sam: And to what end, again? We're going to see if there's any random diplomats left over?
Taliesin: They're the only functioning organization left in the city at this point.
Liam: It's true, they're a double-edged sword, though. I mean, they should not be trusted, we cannot trust them, but they are an infrastructure under the city. They may have more of an idea what's going on than we do. I'm the best to speak to them, but I'm not on good terms with them, and I've never really talked to you about this, but you were marked at one point, a long time ago.
Laura: What?
Sam: For death?
Liam: Actually, yes.
Laura: Why? What did I do?
Liam: I'm sure I don't know. The reason there is a brand on my back is because I interceded. Some other schmoe died instead of you. You might be a bit of a sore point with them. I don't know. They might not remember, but I don't think that's true, I think they'll remember.
Marisha: How long ago was this?
Sam: What did you do?
Laura: So many things.
Liam: Before we met, when Vex and I were on our own.
Sam: Was it because you farted that time?
Laura: You didn't think you could mention this? All the times we've dealt with the Clasp? You didn't think it was worth mentioning that I almost died?
Marisha: She's already been down there. She's already been down there! You think they're going to recognize her now?
Liam: We're going down to talk.
Laura: We've been down there to talk.
Liam: Right. All right.
Laura: That's why you don't keep secrets.
Taliesin: Well, I say that we organize a group. Let's not get overexcited about the sudden realization that some of us can be a bit iffy. We've all had a moment, probably within the last three weeks. I'm not saying I don't.
Travis: I haven't.
Taliesin: Yes, oddly, you and Pike seem to be immune.
Travis: It is a virtue.
Taliesin: But let's organize a group, and let's at least open relations with them at this point.
Marisha: Well, hang on, hang on. What are we going to say to them when we get down there? What are we going to offer them?
Taliesin: We are going to offer them our services in getting this city back to a functioning level. They don't want a city ruled by a dragon, we don't want a city ruled by a dragon. It's in their interest to help us clear the city.
Liam: They're going to look out for themselves, and you're probably-- I'm sure you're right, they want these dragons out, but they will do-- they will preserve their own existence, and there's a possibility that bowing before these beasts will preserve their existence.
Taliesin: Not long-term, and these are groups that think long-term.
Marisha: Wait, are you talking about us bowing to the Clasp, or the Clasp bowing to the-- okay. Sorry, there were levels.
Liam: And yes, we've been down there, we've argued with them, but we're talking about going down there and making an alliance, an ongoing alliance, and shit might come up, that's all I'm saying.
Taliesin: Let's make it a business deal. We're talking about making a political decision. This is politics.
Travis: What if they leave? What if they leave the city, or what if they turn us in to the dragon to save their own asses?
Taliesin: They could. I doubt they'd leave, that's a terrible waste of an investment.
Marisha: You're essentially relying on the underbelly of Emon to restore it.
Taliesin: I am, I'm relying on greed, it tends to be exceedingly reliable.
Marisha: In your experience.
Taliesin: Yes.
Laura: In all experience, let's be honest.
Taliesin: Thank you.
Travis: Said the greedy one to the greedy one.
Liam: This is one option, are we sure we don't want to seek help--
Sam: Yes, what are our other options?
Taliesin: I'm curious as to other options.
Sam: We know why the dragons are here, right? Ish?
Marisha: I really feel like it might be necessary for me to also reach out to the Air and Earth and possibly even the Water Ashari. It might be difficult because I haven't been there yet. To see if they've had any other tears through the other elemental planes.
Taliesin: That would be quite wise.
Marisha: We can also seek to employ their services.
Travis: Scanlan.
Sam: Huh?
Travis: What about you becoming a spy?
Sam: I've been thinking about that, long and hard.
Marisha: Have you?
Sam: Yes.
Marisha: What are your thoughts?
Sam: Most of what I do is long and hard. And my thoughts are still: fuck you, no way, fuck off.
Travis: So what you're saying is?
Sam: Maybe. (laughter)
Liam: So you're saying there's a chance.
Travis: Your shining moment--
Taliesin: Nothing is ever going to top the triceratops, really.
Sam: Maybe the triceratops could kill all the dragons.
Travis: All right. So we reach out to the Ashari.
Taliesin: Absolutely.
Sam: How's your homeland?
Taliesin: I don't know.
Sam: Do we need to find out?
Taliesin: I would love to.
Sam: You can transport there instantly.
Taliesin: I can. I just can't get back instantly.
Laura: You need Keyleth.
Taliesin: And I figure that they would have sent somebody at this point if things had gone-- they have an instant transport to us if they need to find us.
Sam: True.
Laura: Unless they don't know about the stone and the only one with the stone--
Taliesin: The Council knows about the stone.
Travis: Or there's no one left to send.
Liam: Yes, if things went south--
Taliesin: We would've heard.
Marisha: I can scry twice today.
Taliesin: That would be lovely.
Marisha: I can do it two times. So we need to pick where it's most important to check in versus where we might want to pop in and say hello.
Taliesin: Whitestone is also somewhere we could arm ourselves more completely against something like this. We're going to have to start--
Travis: With what?
Matt: As a note, too, Pike can also scry as well.
Laura: Oh, good. Because I would like to check in to Vasselheim as well.
Sam: How do you kill a dragon? Do we need a dragon? Can we get a dragon that hates these dragons? Is that a thing?
Laura: You know, there is the Slayer's Take.
Travis: Wait, what are we talking about dragons? Do other dragons hate dragons?
Sam: Yeah, could we find a dragon who could fight for us?
Laura: Well, there's metallic dragons.
Liam: Don't get along with chromatic.
Sam: Do we know any metallic dragons?
Travis: Yeah, where are they?
Marisha: We would have to go to Vasselheim and maybe--
Taliesin: My Aunt Edna.
Travis: What?
Taliesin: She's a dragon-lady, I don't know if that's the same thing.
Marisha: Like, oh, like she-- little ceramic dragons, she likes collecting them?
Taliesin: I was mocking him, yes.
Sam: So, wait, the Slayer's Take, what?
Laura: Well, it's an organization made to hunt massive creatures, isn't it?
Liam: It's a horde of fucking ass-kickers, is what it is.
Taliesin: We fought a dragon-- we killed a dragon for them.
Marisha: They're also rooted in Vasselheim, which is--
Sam: It's safe.
Laura: Yes, but-- If everything else is under attack, Vasselheim is inevitable.
Sam: Yes, but they're protected.
Laura: For a time.
Liam: Allow me to play tiefling's advocate. If we leave now and allow the Clasp to take hold and form some sort of new shadow government, without us having any part in it, it's out of our control completely. It won't be in our control at all. But maybe if we speak to them now, we'll have a better idea of what's going on. I'm not sold on any idea yet, but if we leave now and let things play out, it's entirely out of our hands.
Marisha: All right, well, how about this? We can scry, between Pike and I, four times. So we can make four phone calls today.
Sam: Not phone calls, just a look.
Marisha: Yes, look home. No, we can peek through a window. And we can try and go visit the Clasp.
Sam: Okay, well, let's scry it up, then. Who are we calling? Whitestone, Vasselheim, center of Emon?
Taliesin: Whitestone and Vasselheim, I think. Definitely.
Marisha: And I want to check in with--
Travis: Can I object to checking the center of Emon, right? Because that's where the Cinder King is?
Taliesin: Yes.
Travis: Didn't it, like, ruin magic when we did it to the beholder, didn't it see us and laugh and we were like, augh, it hurts my brain--
Taliesin: He's got a point. You've got a point.
Sam: You're pretty smart, Grog.
Marisha: We don't need to scry into Emon.
Travis: I remember.
Liam: We're talking Vasselheim, yeah? Whitestone. And you can do it another two--
Marisha: You know what, let's go talk to Pike, because Pike might possibly have some sort of spiritual connection with Vasselheim as well that might save us a scry.
Taliesin: It's possible that Vasselheim might be our next stop after we secure everything here.
Marisha: Okay.
Sam: Oh, Pike! Oh.
Marisha: I can also teleport us once today, if we decide to go anywhere.
Sam: Thanks.
Marisha: Pike!
Sam: Pike! Pikey!
Matt: Comes out, a little bit of dirt on her brow, looks like she's been busy handling some of the folks--
Sam: I reach out and brush the dirt from above her forehead.
Matt: She smiles and pushes your hand away. "Yes, what, yes?"
Marisha: Pike, do you have any sort of spiritual connection with Vasselheim? Do you feel-- you know how--
Matt: "I do. I do. Why?"
Marisha: Okay, can you check--
Sam: Can you scry?
Marisha: Can you see if they're okay? We want to scry and check in with a few places.
Matt: "Of course, of course, no worries." She ushers you guys back into the temple.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: And then gets a little nervous when she starts thinking about it and walks up to the central platform of prayer and takes out her holy symbol. Her armor's off right now, by the way, she's in her ceremonial robes. Because it's hard to clank around in armor amongst a bunch of refugees. Sits down and focuses for a second, and pulls out some salt, and begins spreading it into a small triangular shape around her, and then pulls her holy symbol out and closes her eyes, and for that moment, you can see a beam of sunlight come through the roof, the glass roof of the temple, which then refracts into multiple colors that slowly dissipate around her. You can see, everyone else that has gathered in the room falls quiet, and watches on as there is this tiny little visual miracle. And she stays there for a moment. A few more moments. Probably about 30, 40 seconds pass before the light slowly retracts back up through the glass, and she stands up and turns around and goes, "Vasselheim seems fine for now. Untouched from the dragon's scourge, at the very least."
Marisha: That's good.
Laura: That's good.
Taliesin: What of Whitestone?
Matt: "Oh. Yes." She gets right back down into position with an air of begrudging acceptance. Focuses for a second. Spends a few more moments in her scrying ritual before stepping back, and turns slowly to you, Percy, and says, "Whitestone seems fairly overlooked by these dragons as well. The town rebuilds. People seem to be going about their lives. Possibly none the wiser as to what's transpired this side of Tal'Dorei."
Taliesin: We'll send word, at the very least.
Laura: It's all over the water. Maybe the dragons haven't gone that far.
Taliesin: It's far north. I'll make sure to send word.
Matt: "Okay." One of the kids starts crying, and she goes, "Oh, hold on." And goes over and starts tending to one of the children who has like a knee brace on, and is currently aching, and she goes to help calm him down. "Shh, shh."
Liam: Do you think you could look in on Syngorn?
Marisha: Of course.
Laura: Mostly to see, you know.
Marisha: I step up to the table, and begin my scrying ritual, checking on Syngorn first.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: Shit.
Laura: Come on.
Taliesin: We need like cups and string or something.
Sam: We do. Or a walkie-talkie. He's saying, Syngorn is gone.
Laura: Don't say that.
Taliesin: Millions dead.
Laura: Millions. It's very large.
Travis: Remember to shop at Gilmore's Ruined Rubble. (laughter)
Sam: Oh no, he didn't even get a new franchise before it was--
Taliesin: For all your reclaimed wood needs.
Travis: Oh. Well done. Well done. That was nice.
Taliesin: The best was watching Laura go, "Oh what a great i-- ooh."
Travis: And endless supply of pavers and gravel.
Sam: Gilmore's Building Supplies. (laughter)
Travis: All your home improvements.
Matt: Back to your regularly scheduled D&D game.
Sam: What did you see, Keyleth?
Marisha: Syngorn is gone. And I don't mean destroyed, I don't mean burnt. I don't mean that it's rubble, I mean it's gone. The city is gone. There's, like, a huge chasm, a huge empty spot in the middle of the forest where Syngorn once lied. Lie.
Sam: Lay. Did it look like it was destroyed to nothing? Or transported somewhere?
Marisha: Like that. Like transported, like the city was lifted out of its place and was teleported elsewhere.
Sam: Could it have been-- I don't know how your scrying works-- could it have been some sort of a magical block? Not real, an illusion of some sort?
Matt: I would like Vax and Vex to both roll a history check.
Laura: Any kind of advantage on that? For growing up there or something?
Matt: Nope, that's-- you get to roll this because of that.
Liam: History?
Taliesin: Should have stayed in school.
Liam: Didn't help.
Laura: Eight.
Liam: 15.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: Can I take a roll just for being a nerd?
Liam: All out of luck.
Matt: Are you proficient in history?
Taliesin: I am proficient in history.
Matt: Sure, I'll let you roll.
Taliesin: I want a nerd roll. 24. Book reading!
Matt: Okay. Being the astute researcher, the indoor kid growing up. Yeah. There aren't a lot of books that made their way north about pure elven culture, especially wooded elves, that comprise the entirety of the Syngorn nation.
Taliesin: I speak Elven, so that's good. (laughter)
Matt: It has rarely come into play, but because of previous wars, terrible devastation, and the need for the elvish culture to protect itself, and to maintain its existence, you do know that there have been instances of large enchantments on places of cultural importance that would bridge between here and the Feywild. And as a defense mechanism, essentially, would cloak and/or shift those locations.
Taliesin: They've gone into hiding.
Marisha: How can you be sure?
Taliesin: I can't, but there's reason to believe so. It's what it points to.
Liam: What points to what? What are you talking about?
Taliesin: Historically, elves have, in times of great stress, taken important sites, important places, people, and either cloaked them, hidden them, or moved them into the Feywild until such time as the danger has passed. There is precedence for this. They've gone into hiding.
Laura: Great.
Liam: That's one more thing our father failed to impart to us.
Laura: (laughs cynically) At least he's safe.
Taliesin: Most likely.
Marisha: I need to check in on the Air Ashari. I'm going to spend my last scrying.
Matt: Okay. As your vision separates from your current place of origin, you find yourself drifting up into the clouds and speeding through the air. The location itself is blurred, though recalling the origin of where you originally came from, you pass by columns of black smoke to your left, you assume somewhere related to Westrunn's current location.
Marisha: Right.
Matt: Eventually, the clouds part, and you find yourself thrust down upon the earth amongst the center of the Air Ashari tribe. You can see the thin leather constructs that make up a portion of your people's hovels and buildings. You can see the nearby chasm-based windfall that pours through constantly with a gentle whistling sound that forever is marked as the chorus that guides you all to sleep every evening. There, you can see your people amongst various conversations, going amongst their various daily duties, seemingly untouched, unscathed, and unaware of what recent events had transpired.
Marisha: They're okay.
Matt: That is the last of your scrying capability for the day.
Taliesin: You didn't have to know that. Big girls don't scry. Sorry, I saw it on Netflix.
Laura: Wow. Wow. Hit after hit after hit today, Taliesin.
Liam: You know, just because you can, doesn't mean you should.
Taliesin: I know. I know. Coffee hasn't kicked in yet.
Marisha: All right, they're okay. They seem unaware, which is very disheartening on a few levels.
Taliesin: Well, they'll know soon enough.
Marisha: Exactly.
Taliesin: We are going to need transport.
Sam: To where?
Taliesin: Ah. I don't think we're going to win this fight staying here, I think we're going to have to rally power, I think we're going to have to rally allies. I don't think there's enough here for us to win.
Laura: Can we relocate all of the refugees staying in our walls? Can we bring everyone through the Sun Tree? Keyleth? How long does it stay open?
Marisha: Six seconds.
Taliesin: We can go in shifts. This is not something that's going to be solved tomorrow. We can take a week, and move people.
Liam: That's true. And there's 50 to 100 refugees, you said, something like that, right?
Matt: At this point now, in your keep, surviving, you're looking at the 30s.
Liam: 30s?
Sam: But there's hundreds more inside the city walls. Thousands.
Taliesin: We're going-- we're not going to be able to empty the city.
Laura: But we can at least get these people out.
Taliesin: We can get these people out. And we're going to need-- and I apologise for the brightness in my voice-- I think we're going to need an airship.
Laura: An airship sounds wonderful, Percy, but--
Liam: You mean like the one that crashed?
Taliesin: Like the one that crashed.
Laura: One dragon attacking it and it's down.
Taliesin: We're going to need to move quickly, though, from city to city, and we're going to need to get word.
Marisha: Well, moving quickly from city to city-- I don't know.
Taliesin: We may have to steal an airship or something.
Sam: You're going to steal a plane?
Taliesin: I'm making a plan. I'm thinking of a plan.
Laura: You keep thinking, there.
Taliesin: It's working.
Marisha: Well, I mean, I've recently discovered that that misty Wind Walk spell that I cast on all of us is not great for battle, but is great for travel. And that lasts for eight hours.
Sam: What does? Who?
Marisha: Remember how I failed and almost killed us all?
Travis: Shit the bed. Yeah.
Marisha: Yeah. Thanks, Grog. What I learned out of that was it's not great for battle, but it is great for travel. It lasts for eight hours. We can move 300 feet per second.
Laura: Wonderful. We get the refugees out, we go to Whitestone, we talk to them there, we use the Misty Walk thingy and go to Vasselheim, talk to the Slayer's Take. This is perfect. Problem--
Sam: Are we going to check in with the Clasp? I really like Percy's idea about stealing a plane. I'm just throwing that out there.
Taliesin: There is an empty airdock that's currently not being used in the city.
Laura: Do we need a ship right now, darling? I understand the joy in it.
Taliesin: We don't need it now, but we're going to be-- need to move--
Sam: We could take all of these refugees with us. Don't you understand? We would be helping humanity.
Marisha: I'm with Vex. You all honestly--
Laura: -- believe a dragon wouldn't notice a giant airship flying out of the city?
Sam: Not if we hide it with some-- some smokescreen action of some sort.
Liam: Guys. This is an RPG, not a JRPG. (laughter)
Taliesin: I want to live like Teddy Ruxpin. This is all I've ever wanted. (laughter)
Laura: We need to talk to the Clasp first.
Sam: All right, let's go talk to the Clasp. We'll ask them what they think about--
Laura: Plus Allura and Drake are coming back. We need to talk to them as well. Find out what's going on in Westrunn. And then we need to get everyone out.
Marisha: I can transport some of us via plants today. I will have to sleep if we want and study to do the Misty Step again.
Laura: I've got a plan.
Taliesin: We have time. This is not a one-day plan.
Laura: Here's a good plan. This is a good plan, though.
Liam: Here it comes, everybody.
Laura: Open up the tree. Send a bunch of refugees through.
Marisha: Shove a bunch in.
Laura: Shove them through as fast as possible. Percy. You go with them. We keep the stone. You go through. You talk to your sister. You bamf back with the stone.
Marisha: Let Whitestone know what's going on. Because they're going to freak out if like--
Laura: And then we talk to the Clasp together.
Taliesin: I think that's a good plan.
Marisha: They will freak out if 20 refugees pour out of the Sun Tree. And they have no context.
Travis: Do that first.
Marisha: Okay. So wait, are you going to go on your mission while we go talk to the Clasp?
Laura: No, we're going to wait for you. So can we get the refugees together?
Matt: All right, so as you go into the temple and get Pike's attention, you begin to round up the refugees, which as a statement, historically, is already unnerving. You begin to push them all together in a group and tell them what?
Laura: Well, we comfort them and tell them  all right, obviously Emon is not a safe place to be right now.
Matt: "No, that's true, that's true! It's terrible here!"
Laura: It's dangerous, and we want to keep all of you as safe as possible.
Matt: "Yes, and thank you for taking us." Everyone starts cheering.
Laura: We have a plan.
Sam: We probably can only take a few. It should be women and children.
Laura: We're going to take those of you who need the most attention first, and we're going to bring you to Whitestone, which is a city that has not been affected by dragons at all. It has much need of people who can do an honest day's labor, and you can earn a wage and find a living there, for the time being, and if at some point in time you want to come back to Emon when all of this is done, of course you're more than welcome to.
Liam: There is opportunity.
Marisha: And no dragons!
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Laura: I'm rolling the gold one! 20?
Matt: Okay! A couple of folks currently, (muttering) "I've never been to Whitestone! Is it cold?"
Laura: In the winter.
Matt: "It's winter!"
Laura: Then it could be a little chilly!
Sam: Bundle up! We'll give you some wool blankets for the trip!
Matt: "Okay?"
Liam: There's definitely no vampires there. None.
Matt: A couple of kids go, "Vampires, sir?"
Laura: I like that we're sending to them to the place that's got the orb of death.
Matt: "What was that? What'd you say?"
Sam: No, nothing, she didn't say anything.
Laura: I said, "You might be able to see your breath!"
Matt: "Winter! Right! Okay, let's grab our things!" And some of the folks start getting their things together. Packing up their things-- what they had on their back, essentially, as they rushed here. Shake a few out of their shell-shock, and they all gather up towards the center of the Temple of Sarenrae.
Laura: Percy-- stone. To go through the--
Taliesin: I already gave it to Keyleth.
Laura: Oh, okay.
Marisha: DM question? How many do you think I can fit through in six seconds?
Matt: We'll find out!
Marisha: If I put them in like a line, and we're like, "Go! Go! Go!"
Matt: That's up to you guys! How do you want to do this?
Liam: They can't get-- no one can get cut in half, can they?
Laura: Well I assume, as soon as we see it start to shrink, we stop! We cut off the line.
Marisha: Well, what we should do-- here's the thing that I'm worried about. We don't want, like, a kid to go through, and then they get separated from their mom.
Travis: Well, everybody's got to grow up at some point.
Laura: Anybody with children. How many children are here?
Matt: I'd say you have seven children.
Laura: Children with their moms go-- and families go first.
Liam: Well, we were saying that the terribly injured, the people with the worst injuries--
Laura: All right, those people first!
Liam: Yeah, those people first.
Travis: Yeah, because they'll go through real fast.
Liam: And then with kids-- But they need attention now! They need--
Sam: Hey! We're going to be doing this every day for several days.
Taliesin: Hey, I've got a weird theory. Let's not send people with injuries yet, so that perhaps Pike can stay here and take care of them for a little bit?
Laura: Oh! Good call, okay! So the injured can stay.
Travis: Can't we put them on a wagon? Can't we like put them on a wagon, down and like--
Taliesin: We don't want to lose a wagon to Whitestone.
Sam: This is just how Schindler did it, by the way.
Laura: What!?
Sam: He debated it for a while, and then-- (nervous laughter).
Liam: No words! No words!
Travis: And the room goes silent, and the mug comes up.
Laura: Okay. So not the injured. Families first. How about that?
Taliesin: We'll count to six, and then we'll put the rope down, and when we hit six, we pull the rope, and it'll hold everybody--
Sam: Wait, there's a rope?
Laura: As soon as we see it start to shrink, I'll hold the people back.
Taliesin: Yes, hold the people back.
Laura: So Percy, you're first, everybody follow through. So any families here? Families?
Matt: Some of the kids raise their hands, some adults go over and they grab kids' hands and stand next to them. "Yes."
Laura: Are you really respons-- I can tell when you're lying, sir. Are you responsible for that child?
Matt: Make an insight check.
Laura: 26!
Matt: Ha! Two of those people are definitely just taking a kid's hand in hopes of getting through first.
Travis: I walk in and start cracking my knuckles behind Vex.
Matt: "Well, I mean, I can wait, no worries! Eh--"
Laura: Child, where's your parents? Do you have one?
Matt: "They haven't shown up yet."
Laura: Oh, dear.
Sam: Leave them here, in case the parents come.
Laura: Okay. Then you would stay and wait for your family, potentially?
Liam: You can stay with Pike, for now.
Matt: Pike comes over and pats him on the shoulder. They're the same height, so it's easy.
Marisha: Let's do completed full families who are comfortable relocating.
Laura: That can move. Here we go.
Matt: Altogether, completed full families, there are two.
Marisha: How many people?
Matt: It'd be a total of eight people.
Laura: That's good! That's a good amount!
Travis: Yeah, think about it! One one thousand, one one thousand--
Laura: And then, any other like single people that can move fast?
Marisha: Yeah, a couple single people? To bring up the rear?
Matt: Okay. You have about ten more people that raise their hands.
Taliesin: We can get that many through in six seconds.
Sam: What are you talking about?
Laura: Get ready to run, people.
Marisha: All right. So let's go to the tree. Percy, you're going to lead. Percy, you're going to lead. We're going to put the eight up front, with the ten, 15 stragglers behind. I tell them all: all right. As soon as you see that tree start to part, run! Run your face off! I tell that to the crowd.
Taliesin: And keep running. So that you make room for everyone behind you, we don't want like-- it's not the bottom of an escalator. Whatever that is. It's a thing I've been working on, it's going to be great.
Marisha: Don't stop in the tree, you will create terrible congestion.
Laura: Everybody comfortable with the plan?
Sam: Can I inspire Keyleth for this?
Matt: Sure.
Sam: Okay, I will perform a limerick for her to inspire her. I know an airheaded young druid / whose plans are more gassy than fluid / when the battle starts / she turns her pals into farts / they see danger and pass right through it!
Marisha: Thank you, Scanlan. I love it. It's so like me.
Matt: Take a 1d10 inspiration die.
Travis: I hate to be the detail-oriented one about this whole thing, but should somebody be counting as soon as she starts so we put down an arm at six?
Laura: You count in your head, Grog.
Travis: You really don't want me to do that.
Marisha: Maybe with my inspiration, I can get a few more seconds in there?
Matt: We shall see. I'll say for the sake of this, go ahead and roll a wisdom check.
Marisha: Oh boy.
Matt: A d20 and add your wisdom modifier.
Marisha: Oh, that's not good.
Sam: You've got inspiration if you need it.
Marisha: Can I add my inspiration to this?
Matt: Go for it.
Marisha: Ooh, that's good. That helps a lot. What am I adding? Just my straight wisdom?
Matt: Yep, wisdom modifier.
Marisha: My modifier? 19 total.
Matt: 19 total, okay. So as you all gather around in the center of the temple, Keyleth, you step up to the outside of one of the two front trees to the temple, one of the ones you guys usually use to transport to and from here. As you focus in and reach your hand out and touch the outside of the tree's bark, with a rough tearing sound, the tree bark widens into an oval-shaped doorway that is immediately visible. On the opposite side, you can see before you a lightly snow-dappled landscape that is the central market of Whitestone.
Laura: We put blankets on everybody, right?
Matt: From what you had.
Marisha: Go! Go! Now, run, go! Go, Percy, go!
Matt: Who's pushing?
Taliesin: I'm already through.
Matt: Percy's through. All right, are you guys just letting them go at their own rate?
Travis: (shouting) Move your fucking asses!
Matt: Roll an intimidation check.
Marisha: It's like a football line.
Travis: 17.
Matt: 17. With that, everyone goes, (startled noise) and starts charging through wildly. The crowd starts pushing through.
Marisha: I'm trying to hold it.
Liam: No severed limbs, no whammies!
Matt: Okay. All of the rest-- the family people go through, the young folks push through. You manage to get a total of 23 people through. (cheering)
Matt: Some folks who weren't even planning to go on this were so driven by the sudden shouting Grog voice echoing from behind that they charged forward Black Friday-style, and managed to escape the tail end of the spell tapering the doorway off.
Liam: "I regret nothing!"
Sam: Well, I hope Percy comes back soon.
Marisha: I've got the gatestone.
Matt: Percy?
Taliesin: I'm going to get everybody organized. Everyone, please follow me. We're heading towards the main castle.
Matt: They're all looking around.
Taliesin: Welcome to Whitestone.
Matt: A gentle snowfall is coming down. The sky itself you can see is covered in light, white clouds. Just enough moisture to carry the little snowfall that's happening. There are folks in the center of the town that are surprised to see this arrival, but recognize you and cheer a little bit. "Hey! Percival." (laughter)
Taliesin: Thank you for that smattering of applause. Golf claps, please. Golf claps.
Matt: The refugees all gather up behind you, and you guys walk towards Castle Whitestone.
Taliesin: We make our way to the castle.
Matt: The guards greet you and lead you inside. And within a few minutes, Cassandra comes down from the upper floor. "Percival, you've returned."
Taliesin: Things are not going well. Have you heard any news of Emon and what has been transpiring there?
Matt: "No, we've been focused on restoring our city. Why?"
Taliesin: Yesterday, we were attacked by a group of chromatic dragons. The city is destroyed. There's no simple way to say this, but we're under siege. We were afraid that Whitestone would be destroyed, as well, but it seems that they have passed over you so far, but we fear for many cities' safety. I was hoping that it would be all right if we moved a small number of refugees through to Whitestone for the time being. Less than a hundred, I imagine. These are the first 20-some-odd that we've pulled through.
Matt: And she looks behind you, looks to the crowd, snaps her fingers. Some of the guards step forward, she goes, "Please, if you would make sure to find any of the various unoccupied buildings are provided to these refugees. Thank you." And the guards nod, and begin gathering the group and sending them back into town, and she gives you a look back and says, "For better or for worse, we happen to have a number of vacancies in the city due to recent events. But--"
Taliesin: Oh! Well, yes. Nothing I-- Anything I should know about?
Matt: "No, just-- We've lost many in the struggle against the Briarwoods. But yes, they will be provided for, I assure you."
Taliesin: So I will let you know to stop all business with Emon for now. Be very wary, prepare the city for a possible dragon attack. Things are looking dark.
Matt: "Yes, yes."
Taliesin: And if it's possible, any research-- any energy that can be put forward towards mounting some sort of defense against these creatures would be greatly appreciated.
Matt: "Right, right, well, we had a few individuals that were researching the ziggurat beneath the city. Two left a while back and we had one arrive just the other day."
Taliesin: Who arrived the other day?
Matt: "I cannot recall his name-- Realm Seeker, Realm Seer-- I'm not--"
Laura: (whispering) Eskil Ryndarien!
Taliesin: Please bring me to him.
Matt: All right, Cassandra leads you down into the city again, and one of the houses has been provided, she knocks on the door, the door opens and you see stepping out, an older gentleman who you've heard of but not really had an encounter with since-- no, actually you encountered him for the final ritual that took the phylactery from Grog's chest.
Taliesin: Oh my god.
Matt: But this is Realmseer Eskil Ryndarien, the archmage that basically was one of the folks who lived within Westruun and was called to Whitestone as part of research--
Taliesin: That's some pre-stream stuff, everybody.
Matt: As the door opens, he comes out, eyes adjusting to the light, and you can see the interior is very dark. He's one of those live-in-lightless-territory types of person. Comes out with his round spectacles around his nose, his robe is disheveled, bundled over his shoulders, he goes, "Yes, if I may be of service--?"
Taliesin: We've met! You look very familiar.
Matt: "Quite! Yes we have. You're with those S.H.I.T.s, weren't you?"
Taliesin: (laughing) Ah, yes.
Matt: "Unfortunate title you've chosen--"
Taliesin: Long gone, thankfully, long gone. We're Vox Machina--
Matt: "Good! Vox Machina, glad you took my suggestion."
Taliesin: Yes, thank you for that. (laughing)
Matt: "What can I do for you?"
Taliesin: Well, first of all, how goes the research into the--
Matt: "Frustrating, to say the least. It appears that this entire--" and he walks back into the house, expecting you guys to follow. As you enter, immediately you're hit with the smell of sage and other burning herbs, and you can see there's a vast number of books that are strewn about the table in front. The fireplace in the back is pouring smoke up into the roof area and soot's starting to gather on the stonework on the outside. Looks like there's two or three different kettles going off with different types of tea. It's complete chaos in here, but he seems to be in control of most of it, at least. He goes, "From best we can ascertain, this is some sort of a magical siphon device. It has prevented us from utilizing any sort of ritualistic endeavors in ascertaining its nature, it's quite perplexing. I'm hoping to either head over to Wildemount, or perhaps return to the Cobalt Reserve and perhaps find some historical information about such an object, but nothing in my current--"
Taliesin: Well, sir, I have some bad news for you. I hail from Emon, which has been attacked by chromatic dragons--
Matt: "I'm sorry, what?"
Taliesin: Dragons have declared war on civilization. A group of dragons have destroyed our city, and they have destroyed other cities as well. We are in desperate need of powers to defend ourselves with-- So I would be very careful and send forward-- Send word ahead of yourself before you travel anywhere, it may not be there by the time you get there.
Matt: "Well, I guess it's good that I moved my tower before I left."
Taliesin: Things are looking grim and I would ask while you-- If you intend to remain and work on your research on this anomaly beneath our city, perhaps thinking as to how it may be turned into a weapon for our use against these creatures would not be out of the realm of question, and any information you do have of the chromatic dragons would be invaluable. Any research that can be done. We are at war.
Matt: "This is very disconcerting news. I will do what I can. Unfortunately, I'd have to get back to the Cobalt Reserve. That's where most of my research is completed."
Taliesin: That's Westruun?
Matt: "Let me see. Jeckt--" And he snaps his fingers, and you can see his manservant, Jeckt, who you've met before, slicked-back darkish red hair, mustache, very prim and proper-type manservant, well-dressed, steps out of the shadows. "Yes, my lord?" "If you would be so kind, prepare me for travel, pack up this--"
Taliesin: Westruun is no more, sir.
Matt: "Well, that's really frustrating!"
Taliesin: Yes.
Matt: "Really."
Taliesin: Extremely aggravating.
Matt: "Yes. I am unhappy with this circumstance! How am I supposed to do my research without a place to do my research?!"
Taliesin: Well, we hope that you will find our winters here quite solitary, and convenient on that level. Things are looking grim.
Matt: "Well, you can say that again."
Taliesin: I must go. I have other work to do to start preparing--
Travis: Peace!
Matt: "Yes, yes go! Do your thing!"
Taliesin: Good day, sir. And good luck to you.
Matt: "Should I find anything, how will I-- whereabouts-- Where are you?"
Taliesin: We don't know yet, but we will be returning here.
Matt: "That does not help me. I will do my best."
Taliesin: Cassandra will be able to get a hold of me if necessary.
Matt: "Ah, Cassandra. All right! Someone of use around here."
Taliesin: I am going to go find my sister and make my way to the stone.
Matt: He doesn't even say goodbye to you. He's completely flustered. It's funny. For everyone who's taken completely by the horror of the situation, he just seems really perturbed about the--
Travis: Inconvenience of it all.
Matt: Yeah, it's so inconvenient. That library was very helpful.
Taliesin: Why isn't the internet working! (frustrated noise)
Matt: Basically. You find your way to Cassandra again. She's waiting outside of the room. "I hope he's been helpful, brother"
Taliesin: No, he wasn't helpful, but it was very helpful the way he wasn't helpful.
Matt: "Yes."
Taliesin: It's a strange, strange--
Matt: "He's a very strange man."
Taliesin: Everything's going to be all right.
Matt: "I hope so."
Taliesin: Thank you. I will return very soon. We will, again with your permission, hopefully be using Whitestone as a place to regroup and prepare ourselves.
Matt: "Is there worry that these dragons might come here?"
Taliesin: Yes.
Matt: "How will we stop them?"
Taliesin: You'll hide. I have thoughts, perhaps of a weapon. I don't know. But we're going to find a way to stop them.
Matt: "We have to."
Taliesin: I'm not good at being the bearer of any bad news, but this is very dangerous and I don't know what we're going to do.
Sam: (whispers) Steal an airplane.
Matt: "Neither do I."
Taliesin: (whispers) They don't have an airplane.
Matt: "Stay safe, Percival."
Taliesin: I shall return soon.
Matt: "I hope so. We'll do what we can in the meantime to see to your refugees and hopefully try and prepare ourselves."
Taliesin: There will be a few more through, possibly tomorrow, with word.
Matt: "All right. We'll be prepared. Thank you." She reaches out and puts her hand on yours, again, and looks you sternly in the face and goes, "Be careful."
Taliesin: I will.
Matt: "You're all I have left."
Taliesin: And Cassandra, I'm proud of you. You're doing very well here.
Matt: "There's still a ways to go, brother."
Taliesin: We'll get there.
Matt: She hands you the gatestone. And with that, there's a slight popping sound as you're in a very soft bit of bluish-purple light. Your body slowly subsides and fades into nothing before it (poof) vanishes out of existence. As you guys are back at the keep, suddenly, who has the gatestone? As you're holding it, it begins to shake in your hand and give off a warm light.
Marisha: I think our reservation's ready.
Sam: I'm telling the, what, seven remaining refugees?
Matt: You have about eight or nine.
Sam: Sorry you didn't make it through. It doesn't mean that you'll be here forever. We'll get you there tomorrow. No big. Don't worry about it.
Laura: More food for you guys, which is A+.
Matt: At which point now, there's a slight smell of burnt cedar before the air itself begins to sound like a light hum or vibration as suddenly Percy's form (poof) appears in the center of the room next to your gatestone. Both of the stones you guys are holding all of a sudden become white-hot, and you instinctively drop them before they tumble to the ground.
Laura: Hey! They work!
Taliesin: They hurt. Good to know.
Sam: That's great. Did you see your sister?
Taliesin: I did, everything is fine up there, the research continues. They're happy to take people.
Laura: That's wonderful.
Taliesin: So, and they are prepared for more. They're also happy to be a base of operations as we put things together.
Laura: And you told them to make preparations in case something happens?
Taliesin: Whatever preparations one can make for something like this, to be prepared to hide. (sighs) For now.
Liam: In the worst-case scenario they can go underground.
Taliesin: Worst-case scenario, they can go underground, yes.
Laura: They need to start hiding food.
Taliesin: They have to grow food, they haven't really recovered that yet. There's also a--
Marisha: Hopefully I hooked them up there.
Taliesin: I have one of those terrible ideas I get on occasion.
Sam: What is it? I love it.
Taliesin: That thing beneath Whitestone could be a weapon.
Sam: How?
Travis: Ooh, that's true.
Laura: Anything touching it disintegrates.
Travis: Yeah! Like a dragon.
Sam: Do you shoot it at something?
Taliesin: I might be able to turn it into a projectile.
Laura: How would you turn it to a projectile-- are you okay, Keyleth?
Liam: It is a fun idea--
Taliesin: A long-term idea.
Marisha: Just choking on Percy's idea.
Taliesin: I can make an antimagic missile.
Marisha: What-- a magic-- a magic missile? An antimagic missile?
Taliesin: An antimagic missile.
Liam: One plus one plus two plus one.
Laura: One plus two plus one plus one!
Sam: That's a great idea.
Taliesin: I've been-- I've been mulling it over.
Sam: Could we fire it from an airship of some sort?
Taliesin: Yes, I have-- that's actually part of the idea.
Marisha: Percy, when I tried to touch that thing it was like it was sucking me in. I don't think that thing and me touched. How are we going to turn it into a projectile?
Taliesin: I have thoughts, I'm going to follow them through, and it may require some experimentation in the future, but I think perhaps--
Marisha: At the cost of possibly your life?
Taliesin: I take my life into my hands any time I build something. I think that a non-magical approach to containing it might actually work. I think the problem is--
Laura: Well that's good, because it cancels out any magic--
Taliesin: I think the problem is that we keep trying to magic our way out of something that denies magic, and maybe I can engineer our way out of it.
Marisha: Have they found anything out, did you get any updates?
Taliesin: A little bit of information, there will be more later. I'm going to take a look at all the data and see if it's possible.
Sam: Should we go visit the Clasp?
Travis: Oh, please.
Taliesin: I'm trying to be more open.
Travis: Yeah, let's go!
Marisha: What time is it?
Matt: At this time? It's pretty close to dusk, the sun is getting close to the mountain line, you probably have another hour of daylight.
Marisha: Okay.
Taliesin: To the Clasp?
Travis: Yeah, they're probably nocturnal anyway. That means they're around at night.
Taliesin: They're not turtles, no.
Marisha: Did you learn something new, Grog?
Travis: What?
Matt: All right, you guys heading back into Emon?
Sam: Everyone? Some? All?
Taliesin: I think Pike should stay behind to take care for--
Marisha: You seem to have reservations--
Sam: Vex, are you okay going down there? You're marked for death by these people.
Laura: I've been down there several times without knowing that.
Sam: I know, I feel like it might put you on edge.
Liam: She's not marked for death, she was marked for death, it's just awkward. It's awkward. I'm not a full-fledged member, they don't like me. I don't like them!
Laura: Maybe I can become a member.
Liam: Maybe you can.
Taliesin: This is politics, you're not supposed to like them.
Liam: Well, let's go, then.
Travis: Yeah! What he said.
Matt: You guys taking the tunnel or you walking in?
Laura: Taking the tunnel, we're taking the secret entrance--
Travis: Oh come on, we're never even-- we've not even walked in yet.
Laura: Garthok showed us the secret entrance, he's waiting for us and having them prepare our way, this could get bad.
Matt: No, are you guys walking through your tunnel to the city, is what I'm saying.
Laura: Oh! That! Yes. Cool.
Liam: We're not going to walk in the open.
Sam: What are we doing?
Laura: We're taking our secret tunnel into the city.
Sam: Okay. It puts us in the wrong side of the city, but it's okay.
Laura: What else are we going to do?
Marisha: (coughing)
Laura: How you doing there? You okay?
Marisha: I'm good. Mm-hmm. Sorry. I got a piece of chip stuck.
Taliesin: No, I'm going to leave one with Vax.
Travis: What is it?
Taliesin: I'm giving Vax my gatestone.
Liam: That's a good idea.
Taliesin: I'm giving you the other one.
Liam: For now, it's a good idea, I won't hold onto it forever.
Taliesin: He's the one who's going to get stuck in a room alone if they decide they don't like him.
Liam: Can we call this the Jenga stone? In moments of need.
Taliesin: Jenga stone. Remember, it takes about a minute to work.
Liam: Do I need to spend a little time with this?
Matt: No. However, it does work only once a day.
Liam: Once a day?
Matt: After another long rest you'd be able to use it again.
Liam: All right. Good to know. All right.
Sam: Into the city.
Laura: In your pants.
Matt: Like you do. Half-elven storage space. You guys find your way back into Emon, utilizing your secret tunnel entrance, coming up through the false outhouse once again. You leave the chain behind, locking it up, and make your way into the city.
Laura: Cast Pass Without a Trace on us.
Matt: All right. You guys, I'd like you all to make a stealth check.
Travis: Come on, giant blue nut ball dice. Natural 20!
Laura: Aw, it fell out of my hand. I don't think it should count if it fell.
Matt: Nope, too bad.
Laura: Aw, that's mean. Oh, I get advantage!
Sam: Oh, and we get a plus ten, right?
Taliesin: 33.
Sam: 15.
Marisha: 35.
Liam: 38. LAURA 35.
Travis: Natural 20.
Sam: Wait. With no judgment, is Trinket coming?
Laura: Trinket is staying with Pike.
Sam: That's a fine decision.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: Hell hath frozen over.
Matt: Placing Trinket over here.
Laura: Oh! He's crying! I'm crying.
Matt: So as you guys start dodging between the alleyways, making your way towards the north side of Emon, alongside the ruined interior of the Cloudtop District, you instinctually begin to-- and I'd say-- who else has proficiency in perception?
Liam: Right here.
Matt: All right. You guys all start noticing there are what looks initially like flocks of birds moving through the sky. Some of them are heading down into parts of the town in the distance. As you continue to push forward, one set of four in particular start heading overhead. You look up and you can see a small cluster of about five or six flying creatures. Not dragon-sized, by any means, but either a very, very large bird or something of that degree. You can't make out the details, as right now as the sun's beginning to set, a lot of it's dark against a red-orange sky. You keep yourself at bay, waiting for them to pass.
Marisha: Oh, waiting for them to pass?
Matt: Unless you guys want to do something else.
Laura: As a dragon-favored enemy, could I guesstimate what those winged creatures are that would hang out around dragons?
Travis: Could you determine if they're wyverns?
Matt: Yes. They are actually indeed wyverns. Wivverns. However you want to pronounce it. Both work in my world. It's fine.
Liam: It's pronounced 'jif'.
Matt: Yes. (laughter)
Matt: I will fight you. But yeah.
Sam: They're diving into the city?
Matt: You can see a few that dove into city and stayed there. And one group goes overhead, and continues onward.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: Pushing forward, deeper into the city, you make your way through the Temple District, and start pushing through Abdar's Promenade once again, retracing your steps from the day before, dodging through open areas as fast as possible to stay within the shadows. All of you go darting into one of the alleyways. As you turn behind you, you can see your tiny-legged gnomish bard friend, keeping up as best as he can before his foot hitting a divot on the ground and (slam) falling face first on the ground, making just enough noise--
Sam: Sorry. Sorry.
Matt: You hear a little screech in the distance. (screech) And coming up on the rooftop, you can see, perched up there, appears to be one wyvern that is looking over down at the currently toppled gnome, and on top of the wyvern, you see something riding it. Something that is holding reins on the edge, something humanoid is glancing over, just a little enough of a shadow, to see.
Sam: He sees me? I see him?
Matt: He looks down at you, yeah.
Sam: Okay. I will cast Hold Person on him.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: I don't know what he is, but I want him to stop.
Liam: And Scanlan's the only one-- we all see it?
Matt: You all barely see it looking over the edge as Scanlan's there, left in the middle of the main walkway. That is going to be a natural 17 on the will save. That'll be an 18. What's your DC?
Sam: Well, it's 17, but the hand-cone makes it 19.
Laura: Ah-ha!
Sam: Do you think I had the wherewithal to use it?
Matt: With having you fallen on your face, I'd say probably not. Since it wasn't specified, that would be a DC of 17. So the creature seems to rear back for a second, shake its head, and you get a little bit of a look at the features at this point, too. And it is humanoid, but you can see its outer body is not fleshy, or smooth, it is scaled and bumpy. You can see ridges across the back of the head, and in one of the hands, looks like some sort of a spear. Immediately as it rears back, it puts its head up and goes (guttural gibberish).
Laura: The creature?
Matt: Yeah, riding on the back of the wyvern.
Laura: Those are the things that attacked the airship!
Sam: Yes. Possibly.
Matt: I would like you all to roll initiative.
Taliesin: This is going to be fun.
Laura: I think you should turn it into a bunny, Keyleth! Turn it into a bunny.
Marisha: Jesus Christ. I can do that today. Just rolled shitty on my initiative.
Liam: Not too good.
Sam: (singing) This is the music that plays when we fight!
Matt: All right, so! Scanlan, as you were running across the thoroughfare, you tripped and fell that way.
Sam: That's me!
Matt: The rest of you had come into this alley over here. Currently, looking over the top of this rooftop, is this wyvern and its rider.
Marisha: I love that the rider is like (derpy noise).
Matt: (imitates derpy noise) It's fine.
Marisha: Go home, rider, you're drunk.
Matt: That's going to be-- 25 to 20?
Taliesin: 26.
Travis: 20.
Matt: 20. All right, 20 to 15?
Laura: 18.
Matt: 18, let's see. Vex. 15 to ten?
Sam: Yikes.
Matt: Ten to five?
Sam: Eight! No, seven.
Marisha: Five.
Matt: (laughs) Okay.
Taliesin: Wow.
Liam: Uno!
Matt: Plus?
Liam: Oh, six, thanks for that.
Matt: So you would be-- actually, technically, Keyleth, is next to you.
Liam: That was so crushing, to see the number on the die.
Matt: Aw, sorry buddy. It happens to the best of us. All righty. So. Currently with this guy up on top of the rooftop, Percy, you are first.
Taliesin: Quick question, is he in flight, or is he just sitting on the rooftop?
Matt: Just sitting on the roof, perched on the edge. You can't even actually see him, everyone else who's near the front can see, the few that made the check. You've got a little bit of movement up there, but you're just out of view with the building-- you're right in an alleyway.
Taliesin: There's no easy way up onto the roof, is there?
Matt: Aside from a well-placed acrobatics check. You could try.
Taliesin: That would be my whole movement, too, wouldn't it, though?
Matt: Most likely.
Taliesin: Nah, let's see.
Travis: And how high is the roof?
Matt: I'd say it's about anywhere from 16 to 20 feet tall. It's two-story, but it's not extremely well-built.
Taliesin: I'm going to try to get a vantage point where I can at least get where he's only three-quarters cover. So I suppose I'm going to head south down the alley to see if I can get a--
Matt: Pushing to these guys?
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: Okay, so one-- You can get to about there if you want to.
Taliesin: I can get a good look at him there.
Matt: You can see, yeah. He'll have half-cover from there.
Taliesin: Half-cover's fine. So, if I were to knock him prone, would he fall off the roof, or could I try and push him off the roof? These are my--
Matt: For the wyvern, or for the rider?
Taliesin: The wyvern.
Matt: You can try. It's hard-pressed, he's sturdy on the side, knocking him prone might fall over onto the rooftop. Who knows if it'll slide or not. It's your call. What do you want to try?
Taliesin: I'll try knocking him prone, and see if that does it.
Matt: Okay!
Taliesin: Actually--
Sam: Do it!
Taliesin: Yeah, it's either that or try and push him off the roof, which could be pretty funny. I'll try and knock him prone.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: All right. So I'm going to use Bad News, because that's funnier.
Matt: Okay. So (whoosh) you whip out.
Taliesin: Take a shot. That's a 28 to hit.
Matt: That'll hit.
Taliesin: And that's a wing shot, so you have to make a constitution saving throw.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: Against 18.
Matt: Well, this is the wing or leg shot, right?
Taliesin: Wing or leg shot. I'm sorry, that's a-- Actually, I'm sorry, I have the new sheet.
Matt: Yeah, new sheet on that one. Updated that.
Taliesin: Strength saving throw. Sorry, strength saving throw against 18.
Matt: Okay. That's a natural 19 plus four for strength, so that's a 23 on the save.
Taliesin: Motherfucker, but he'll still take some damage.
Matt: Still takes damage though, go ahead and roll.
Taliesin: I'm going to take another shot at him, too, because eff that. I was not quite prepared for this. 2d12 plus six, four, eight, 14 points of damage.
Matt: 14 points of damage, nice. All right.
Taliesin: And I'm going to take a-- reload, take another shot and try and knock him off the roof.
Matt: Go for it. The same shot?
Taliesin: Same shot. Ugh. That's a three, so that means I--
Matt: Misfire.
Sam: Clank!
Matt: So, first shot of Bad News, (explosion noise) echoes, the sound of the blast rippling through the nearby alleyways, the blast hits the wyvern in part of its arm, sending a spray of blood as it shrieks in pain. As you can see its rider is moved to the side, and you see a second head behind the rider from the reaction of movement. Looks like there's actually two of these creatures riding on the back of this creature. As you go to reload, bring Bad News up again to fire a second time, you pull the trigger and there's a (thump) sound, and you can see now a stream of smoke pouring out the back of the gun itself, and you're a little worried what this is going to do if you don't fix it soon.
Travis: Look down the barrel!
Sam: Yeah, that'll work.
Taliesin: I can use my-- I actually can't do-- Am I going to panic and try and fix this?
Matt: Next turn? That's your movement, that's your three attacks, do you have a bonus? Anything?
Taliesin: I can-- I'm going to, I'm going to throw an action surge and see if I can fix this.
Matt: Go for it. Go ahead and make your tinker check.
Taliesin: Yes! Yeah, 14.
Matt: So you spend your action quickly trying to fix the gun and get Bad News back. You manage to clear the barrel, get the pellet out, as the rest of the team starts coming up with their turns. That'll be the rest of your action. Okay, finishes Percy's turn. Grog, you're up.
Travis: I'd like to hold my turn until it gets off the roof and maybe comes down to the ground.
Matt: Okay, okay, good to know. Let's see here. It appears that my-- Taliesin, could you do me a favor and hand me that box next to the fridge there?
Taliesin: Sure.
Matt: Thank you. All right, so Grog, as you're doing that, the blasting sound of Bad News that echoed through, you all of a sudden start hearing other shrieks in the distance, like a call to arms of a number of other entities.
Marisha: Oh boy.
Matt: As you see a multitude of other winged creatures begin to arise in the distance.
Taliesin: I shouldn't have gotten him that box, should I?
Marisha: Was that in the box?
Travis: Yeah, we could always run, too.
Taliesin: Could.
Sam: How far are we from the tunnel system? Far.
Matt: You're a ways. Probably a good 25-minute run. There's another one on the roof over here. And there's one on this roof here. Each one of them with their own riders, as well.
Laura: Shit.
Matt: Now. All right, so for this turn, this one leaps off and swoops down here to where Percy is while both of its riders leap off to the side. One that leaps off and rushes over to Scanlan on the ground, and this other one that gets right up next to Percy. This one goes flying forward and lands in the center to about there. Two of its riders leap off. This one stays up in the air over this way in a flanking position-- or in a visual perspective with two of its riders on its back. Put them there.
Liam: For clarification, does this count as turns, or are they, since they're coming late to the party, or this is just them in position?
Matt: This is them now entering the fray.
Liam: Are they into the initiative order, just gameplay talk?
Matt: Yeah. Well, this is the initiative I rolled for them after being called by the guy who was already shouting out into the air.
Laura: Oh, right, right, right.
Matt: You didn't see them before, given your perspective. These guys leap off over here-- over there. Okay. So we have, first the wyvern that swooped down on you, Percy, is going to go ahead and make an attack with its bite and an attack with its stinger as a multiattack. So that first strike, that is going to be a-- The bite, 13?
Taliesin: That does not hit.
Matt: The stinger, however, is a 19.
Taliesin: I'm going to use my Amulet of the Shield and up my AC for that attack to 23, so.
Matt: Yeah. So that will miss. So that uses the Amulet. Good to know. So the stinger goes to strike you after the bite misses, and as you grasp your chest, you can see now an arcane barrier shines in front of you and completely ricochets the stinger out into the air to the side as it reacts angrily. The other giant humanoid lizard creature that's coming towards you with a giant heavy club is going to attempt to slam you with it.
Laura: There's so many things!
Matt: Twice. Well, it's going to attack you with its club, that's going to be a 17.
Taliesin: Nope.
Matt: And then it's going to try and slam you with a spike shield. That is 15.
Taliesin: Nope.
Matt: So that guy starts swinging at you loosely.
Taliesin: I'm sword out. Yeah.
Matt: All right. Attacking you, Scanlan.
Sam: Oh. Shit.
Matt: The one that's on the ground there. All right. So it has two attacks against you with advantage.
Sam: With advantage?
Matt: Because you're prone. You're on the ground. That'll be a 24 to hit.
Sam: Yeah, yeah, okay.
Matt: And the spike shield is going to be a 24 again, actually.
Laura: Oh no!
Matt: So as you're on the ground, it slams you with a shield for 12 points of bludgeoning damage.
Sam: Okay.
Laura: Why didn't I bring Trinket?
Sam: I know! What's wrong with you?
Matt: The shield slams you for eight points of piercing damage. So a total of 20 points of damage as (whack) slams you into the ground twice.
Laura: I thought this was a stealthing mission!
Matt: It was until he rolled a 15 stealth.
Sam: Blame me, blame me.
Matt: Those wyverns are too far away for combat. The other guys are just assisting the scenario here.
Liam: Percy shot at them.
Matt: Okay. There's one fellow over here that is a bit far away who steps off. Instead of holding the same clubs and shields or other various hack weapons, he's carrying a gnarled staff.
Sam: Oh, shit.
Matt: Steps forward and sees the weapon that you fired twice and had been fixing, this large metallic dangerous entity, looks forward and begins hissing under his breath (hissing gibberish).
Sam: Do I see this?
Matt: You do.
Sam: I'm going to release my--
Matt: Though you are being slammed on the ground. I'd say make a perception check, actually, to see if you see this.
Sam: Okay.
Matt: Because you are currently--
Sam: 19!
Matt: Yes, actually, I will say you do see this.
Sam: I will release my Counterspell.
Matt: Okay!
Sam: I assume he's casting something.
Matt: He is, actually--
Travis: Or has a terrible cold.
Sam: And I will-- I will sing at him, (singing) And you still haven't hit what you're aiming for!
Matt: That's a second-level spell, it is dispelled immediately. As he'd attempted to Heat Metal on your weapon, you can see as the metal begins to glow for a moment and you could feel the heat welling in your hand, all of a sudden the spell (crack) is shattered, like the sound of thin glass in the distance as Scanlan shouts to intercept its arcane ability. That is going to end their opening turn. That brings us down to the initiative order. Vex, you're up.
Laura: Oh, I think Grog was before me.
Matt: Oh, right, Grog, you're holding your action first.
Travis: Right. Can I barrel down through the alley now that someone's on the ground, and race towards the one that's nearest Percy?
Matt: I'll say sure. Usually, going forward, if you hold your action, that's just your action, not your movement, you still move to the situation, but I'll let it stand for this, it's fine.
Travis: I'll remember that going forward.
Matt: Yeah. So you're going to tear down to this guy there?
Travis: Yeah. I would like-- and I would like to swing twice with Craven.
Matt: Go for it. Still maintaining your bonuses from last game, by the way. You haven't taken a short rest yet.
Laura: Oh my gosh!
Travis: Yes indeed.
Laura: He's so strong from the last game.
Travis: Plus-- That's 26.
Matt: 26 hits.
Travis: And a 14 on the second one.
Matt: 14 does not hit. This is the Great Weapon Master?
Travis: No, these are regular attacks.
Laura: You didn't rage yet?
Matt: Did you rage?
Travis: Yeah. Oh! No, I did not.
Matt: Do you want to rage as part of your bonus action to this?
Travis: I would like to rage.
Matt: Okay. Figures. All right, so as your bonus action you go into a rage before you strike. Go for it.
Travis: 12-- 22? Oh, wait. Yep, 22.
Matt: 22 damage. All right. The second strike missed.
Travis: Oh, that's right. 22, that's it.
Matt: 22. So you rush forward, slam the sword into the side of the lizard creature. It puts its shield up and it manages to block most of the blow, but it still slides off and slams into part of its neck area. It shoves the blade out. However, it fails its save.
Travis: Yes!
Matt: Take a strength point off of it and add that to what you have now. What's your strength currently?
Travis: 22.
Matt: So it goes up another plus one to attack and damage. If it became 22, it does.
Travis: Yes.
Matt: All right. Grog, that ends your turn. Vex, you're up.
Laura: Is there anywhere I can stand that I get a good cone shape? Or am I all blocked in?
Matt: You can try to move through. You might get an attack of opportunity from the guy that's attacking Grog.
Laura: Okay, how high is the roof next to me?
Matt: It's about 16, 20 feet.
Laura: Could I acrobatics that shit up?
Matt: You could try to. Go for it.
Laura: Okay.
Liam: Parkour!
Laura: Hold on. Oh! 31?
Matt: With that, you look over and see the rooftop up there. You leap off each side, Ninja Gaiden-style. Hop onto the rooftop with a solid view of the entire battlefield before you, including the one flying creature up there.
Laura: Oh, okay. Then I'm going to Hunter's Mark the magic user.
Matt: All righty.
Laura: And I'm going to Conjure Barrage in a cone to get as many of those fucks as I can.
Matt: Okay, so it's a 60-foot cone. Right there?
Laura: Yeah, sure. Sorry, Scanlan.
Matt: You will hit Scanlan, as well.
Sam: Oh, balls! I'm a little man!
Matt: All right, so go ahead and roll for that.
Laura: 3d8.
Matt: Yeah, roll 3d8 damage.
Sam: 3d8 damage?
Matt: Yeah!
Laura: It's not that much. 16, and then an extra d6 on that guy. An extra six.
Matt: Okay, so does he make his save? He does not.
Sam: Do I have to make a save?
Matt: Yes, you do.
Sam: What kind of save?
Matt: This would be a dexterity saving throw.
Sam: And I'm on the ground. That's a nine.
Matt: You take 16 points of damage from that. That's a fail, and a success. So 16. The wyvern makes that, so half that for eight. He fails. All right, cool. Got it. So as you go forward, leaping up on top, you mark the one guy, turn around, and release a torrent of arrows that sprays into the center of this open pathway of the city. I believe that ends your turn.
Laura: Yes, it does.
Matt: All right, that brings us to Scanlan.
Sam: Oh, me?
Matt: Yep.
Sam: Balls. Shit. I'm on the ground. If I stand up, that's my action?
Matt: It's half your movement.
Sam: That's half my movement. Okay, I'll stand up. He doesn't get to hit me, right?
Matt: Not unless you move away from him.
Sam: Okay. Which riders are still on their beasts?
Matt: These two are the only two that are still on their beasts.
Sam: I will ignore the guy next to me and I will Hand Cone it up, and I will-- he's got two riders?
Matt: Yeah, they have these ramshackle-- you can see now with a closer look, these leather kind of saddles? But they're mostly thrown leathers that are strapped to its back, and there's two of them holding onto these knobs in front to stay on.
Sam: Two riders?!
Laura: Come on, Scanlan.
Sam: I guess I'll Dominate one of them. The main guy.
Laura: Can you Dominate the beast?
Sam: He's not a person.
Matt: There's Dominate Person and Dominate Monster. They're two different things.
Sam: I'm going to dominate the guy in front.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Maverick, not Hollywood.
Travis: It's Maverick and Goose!
Sam: Well, at the end, it was Hollywood.
Travis: No, it was Merlin.
Sam: Merlin?!
Travis: Yeah. Tim Robbins.
Sam: Merlin was the teacher, the guy who spun out. Hollywood was the guy who was his--
Travis: You don't want to do this with me.
Taliesin: This is the first conversation I've ever been in in this group where I feel young.
Matt: The rider's screeching down while it's holding on, and all of a sudden it shakes its head for a minute and looks down at you, eyes connected, and you know that this entity is waiting for its command.
Sam: Can I only give it one command per turn?
Matt: You can give it a basic command and it will follow it through, unless you wanted to directly control it.
Sam: Well, I've got two things to do. He's got to get rid of that fucker on his back, and also other things. Let's go for the big kahuna. I command him to ride his beast to attack the one below him. The wyvern below him.
Matt: Okay. All right, good to know. And do you want to stay where you are? Do you want to move?
Sam: No, I don't want to move because he'll hit me. That would be bad. Who hasn't gone? You haven't gone.
Taliesin: Vax hasn't gone--
Sam: Vax hasn't gone? Oh my god.
Laura: No. because he rolled a one, remember?
Liam: Yup!
Sam: Okay. I will inspire Vax with my inspiration. And I will say: This is ground control to Major Vax, you've really made the blade. And the papers want to know whose blood you spilled!
Matt: (laughs) All right, take your d10 inspiration die.
Liam: d10. Yes.
Sam: Rest in peace.
Matt: All right. That's Scanlan's turn. Vax, you're up.
Liam: So I'm having trouble seeing the battle map. Grog is right against a wyvern, right?
Matt: Grog is against a lizard-like creature--
Liam: Oh, so not against a wyvern?
Matt: No. That's a little bit away. But Percy is next to it.
Liam: Oh, so Percy is right there?
Matt: Correct, yes.
Liam: And Scanlan's next to the magic user, right?
Matt: The magic user's over here, that's been Hunter's Marked.
Liam: Scanlan's up against a dude, right? All right, so what I want to do is slink up behind Percy, reach over-- oh, no, I want to click my Boots of Haste, is what I want to do.
Matt: Did you use them during the battle against the looters?
Liam: I don't think so.
Travis: I don't remember him doing it.
Liam: No, I didn't. No I didn't, I definitely didn't, because I remember kicking myself for-- I definitely didn't. Okay so, click, everybody starts moving slower around me. I want to-- so Percy's against the wyvern, I want to reach over Percy's shoulder and stab the wyvern, and then I want to throw another dagger at the dude standing next to Scanlan.
Matt: On this side there, you mean?
Liam: Yeah. Well, I can't tell, I can't see shit-- is that over Percy's shoulder?
Matt: Because right now you're being blocked, you can't quite get to the wyvern unless you move around the building that you left.
Liam: But I can go around it, yes, let's do that. I'm going to stab the wyvern in the butt, and then I'm going to throw a dagger from my other hand at the guy standing next to Scanlan-- I've got a question for you. Because both of them have somebody who's running interference, do I get sneak attack damage on both?
Matt: You only get one sneak attack damage per turn.
Liam: Just per turn?
Matt: Once per turn.
Liam: All right. So I'm going to use sneak attack damage on the wyvern if I get it.
Matt: Go for it! So first strike against it, as you (whoosh) whip around the side of the building, blades out--
Liam: 25!
Matt: That hits!
Liam: And then for the dude by Scanlan gets a-- word, 19.
Matt: Yep. If you have both blades out, you get a third attack too, don't forget.
Liam: I do. Oh-- yes. So the third stab will go back at the wyvern.
Matt: Okay! So the sneak attack against the wyvern, first strike.
Liam: Yeah, and the last one was a 24 total, so that hits as well. Okay! So that's two, one, yes. That's 14, 17, 22, 23, 25, 27, 29 into the wyvern.
Matt: All right.
Liam: And then the jerk over by Scanlan gets seven.
Sam: Yes!
Liam: And then the wyvern takes another, the Keen Dagger, takes another nine.
Matt: All righty. So, as you rush around, you stab the wyvern on the back of its haunches and you see it shrieks in pain (screeches), looks over its shoulder and starts biting its tail, its stinger swinging about, but you avoid it, fling the other dagger to the side and then jam the other side of its haunches with your other hand. It's definitely aware of your presence now.
Liam: Did I use up all my movement?
Matt: Nope!
Liam: Knowing that it can swat at me, I'm going to try to go right back around where I came from.
Matt: All right.
Liam: And I'm wearing the Cloak of Displacement.
Matt: Okay. It's going to swing at you with disadvantage.
Sam: Just call it cloak number seven.
Matt: That's a two on the first roll, so yeah. That misses you. (whoosh) Its stinger swings out towards you and you duck underneath, it slams to the side of the building, breaking part of the wood, you can see splinters fly out to the middle of the road. That ends your turn?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: All right. Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: Okay. How far away am I from this guy, like-- roughly how many feet?
Matt: Roughly--
Marisha: The guy who's in the air, flying.
Matt: I'd say about 60, 65 feet.
Marisha: Beautiful. I want to move up and around-- here-ish.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Sorry, I've got this thing in the way. Back a little bit-- scoot back. Is that still in your path?
Sam: No, he's my guy.
Marisha: He's your--? Oh. Well, I'm not going to fuck with him. I'm going to-- you Dominated the guy?
Sam: I Dominated the guy.
Marisha: Should I turn the wyvern into something else?
Sam: I don't know. I don't know.
Marisha: Should I Polymorph him? Yeah, I guess he's Dom-- you are Dominating that guy. Is there anything else that's flying? He's the only one that's up in the air left, right?
Matt: Yeah, all the other wyverns have landed and let their riders off on the sides.
Marisha: So you commanded him to attack the one below you, right? I'm going to turn that wyvern into a-- chicken!
Matt: This one?
Marisha: Yes!
Matt: Okay. What's the save on that?
Marisha: Poof! He has to make a wisdom save.
Matt: That is a seven!
Marisha: Fail!
Matt: And with that-- (laughs) The wyvern-- (laughs) Twice now--
Marisha: (laughs) This is my favourite game, you guys!
Matt: The bane of wyverns everyone-- (swoop, chicken noise). As both the riders tumble off, slamming into the ground (sound of impact). That would be-- Okay, ten points of damage to the wyvern, which kills the chicken form entirely. It turns back to a wyvern on the ground, taking the excess three damage.
Laura: Yeah-- (laughs) Keyleth.
Marisha: Fuck.
Laura: Shit! (laughs)
Matt: What?
Sam: Do I keep hold of my guy?
Matt: The riders fall also, they both take an additional 14 points of damage to each of them from the fall.
Marisha: They all took damage-- and they're on the ground now.
Matt: Let's see if it takes damage and makes a new saving throw against the spell. Does not make it, so it is still Dominated.
Sam: Oh. Okay. Thank God.
Marisha: I didn't fuck it up this time.
Matt: But they are all-- all three of them are considered prone for now. They are all knocked prone.
Marisha: Cool. That's my turn.
Matt: All right, ends Keyleth's turn. At the top, Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: Okay. Where am I, I can't see--
Matt: You're right here, you're blocked in between the two buildings, the mouth of the alleyway, with a wyvern and lizard creature right there, standing before you.
Taliesin: Okay, I have no advantage on any of these bastards at the moment if I were to attack. Okay, that's fine. And how would you describe-- these are like scaly people?
Matt: This up close and personal, they are humanoid in build, they have, you know, stand up upright, they have long tails, ridges across the head, they're bigger than an actual human and they're very muscular, and the more you look at it, you can see that their clothing, they have tattered cloth and leathers that have been haphazardly dyed in blood and gore to all be a very, very deep red color. And they're pretty uniform across what they are wearing.
Laura: They're an army.
Sam: Team colors.
Taliesin: I think you've got that one guy covered at the moment, so I'll concentrate on the--hmm. Tough call, tough call. You know what, I'll have a little fun. I'm going to pull my sword and I'm going to take a slash at the guy who's involved with--
Matt: All right, go for it.
Taliesin: That's 21.
Matt: 21 hits.
Taliesin: Oh shit, I forgot to use my bonus action. Can I pop in a quick bonus before that?
Matt: For what?
Taliesin: Hex him.
Matt: You've already hexed today. You used it in the battle versus the looters.
Taliesin: Oh, it's--
Sam: Same day.
Taliesin: That's right. Still the same hour. It can only do it once a day, right? That's all right. That's fine, I can just do a little thing. So, just add to this, would he be described in anywhere on his little D&D card as something with a dragon keyword?
Matt: Nope!
Taliesin: So I'm just going to do normal damage to him?
Matt: Yes.
Taliesin: Okay. So--
Matt: Wyverns, however--
Taliesin: All right, just checking. I'm going to do nine points of damage, slashing damage, to him.
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: And I'm going to turn to the wyvern, and take two slashes at the wyvern.
Matt: Go for it.
Taliesin: First is-- ew. 14?
Matt: 14 hits.
Taliesin: Wow.
Matt: They're sacks of hit points, but they don't have lot of armor to them.
Taliesin: That's 19 plus-- 26 points of damage.
Matt: Nice!
Taliesin: And second shot-- 13, 24, yeah, that hits. Ten, 17, 18, 19, 26 points of damage.
Matt: 26 twice in a row. So with this you pull the sword out, as soon as you see it in the proximity of the wyvern, the blade itself almost seems to shimmer with this gleam of green on it, like the metal almost seems to bend and wave with your movements. And as you turn back around to slash at the wyvern, the blade cuts through it like butter, there's not even resistance, it goes right through its flesh. With each slash of the longsword, you can see large chunks of its muscle coming visible as parts of its body are now being pulled from the muscle and sinew. It shrieks in pain, you can see it angrily now starting to get ready to rake at you pretty heavily. That end your turn?
Taliesin: That's my turn.
Matt: All righty. Grog, you're up.
Travis: Yeah, I'm going to continue where I started on, shitfucker out in front of me.
Matt: Okay! (laughs)
Travis: But I would like to go Great Weapon Master and I would like to use Reckless Attack.
Matt: Go for it.
Laura: Wow, wow. Wow.
Sam: Reckless.
Matt: Roll your first attack against him.
Travis: That's a 31.
Matt: Roll damage on that.
Travis: 25?
Matt: 25? He fails his save, so you get another plus one to your strength, and that swing just cleaves it in two. It goes (whoosh) right through its midsection, it (gurgles). It tumbles off, falling to the ground.
Laura: Oh my god. Grog.
Liam: Grog is full juicing.
Travis: I told you he'd open up to me! (laughter)
Matt: You can move in now with your movement and do your next attack, if you'd like.
Travis: I'll go ahead and take care of that wyvern that's next to me.
Matt: Go for it, all right, so now you get your next attack.
Travis: Natural 20.
Matt: Go ahead and roll damage.
Liam: Does his strength go up to 100 eventually?
Matt: It's double your first dice roll--
Travis: 19-- oh, so the 2d6 was nine, plus five is--
Matt: So 18.
Travis: Plus 11.
Matt: So 29, plus two additional die rolls.
Travis: Ten.
Matt: Okay. So we're at--
Matt: 39.
Travis: 39.
Marisha: 39.
Matt: And then one more? Because you roll 2d-- it's twice, because of Brutal Critical.
Liam: Jeez, you got like Tetsuo arm, it's like five times bigger than it should be.
Travis: Four. Four for those two, do I plus five to that as well for the--
Matt: Well, plus ten for your-- you already added that for your--
Travis: Yes, 2d6 plus five on each one and the--
Matt: No, it's just the additional 2d6 each time.
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: So yeah, with that you turn around after hacking its friend, leaping forward (grunts), foam at the corner of your mouth, your eyes bloodshot and angry. You take the blade and sweep it down, and it plunges itself right into the wound that Percy had left open with his sword swing, finding no resistance before it comes all the way to the hilt in the body of the wyvern, which shrieks for a moment (screeches) before its breath stops and its body falls limp.
Sam: Yeah, one down!
Matt: Does make its save, though.
Travis: Oh, yeah, and on Great Weapon Master on a crit or killing an extra hit, but I guess I--?
Matt: As a bonus action! For the record, going forward, if you're frenzied raging it doesn't really give you a benefit, but if you're not, it does help. So in theory, you could if you wanted to try and chuck it.
Travis: (laughs) Just throw it? Don't throw it?
Matt: What are you going to do, Grog?
Travis: I'm good, I'm good.
Matt: Ends Grog's turn. All right. Now these guys both get up, currently no longer on the wyvern. Did you want to give it another kind of a thought, if you see it land?
Sam: Get on the wyvern and kill the other one.
Matt: Okay. This guy gets up on the wyvern, grabs its reins, pulls it forward, and jams it with its spear as it leads it inward. It runs forward and is going to take a swing-- It's going to take a swing with its stinger at the one behind it. It's confused and figuring out what's-- why is it doing this, it's more of like-- this might work once. That is going to be a-- 17, it hits! That's going to be 11 points of damage, does it make its save? It does not make its save, that's an additional 24 points of poison damage on that one. So that's 35 points of damage, one wyvern to another. (laughs) As this guy immediately whips around angrily.
Sam: You have pleased me. (laughter)
Matt: Both of these guys go charging forward here.
Laura: Oh no, Scanlan!
Matt: It's going to pull up its javelin and chuck it at you, Vex.
Laura: Me?
Matt: Yeah. That is going to miss you at a 12. It (swoosh) throws, the javelin arcs past you. This one over here is going to come forward and it's going to take a javelin as well out and chuck it right at you, Grog.
Travis: Heh, you're dead.
Matt: That is a 20 to hit.
Travis: Hits.
Matt: You take ten points of piercing damage, reduced to five, as you basically (impact)--
Travis: (snapping noise)
Matt: (laughs) Snap it off and grin in its face.
Travis: Let me return that favor in a second.
Liam: Grog is on god mode.
Marisha: (laughs) Save game plus.
Matt: (laughs) --now it sees the danger that you're in, looks at you, sees you hack through the center of one of the wyverns, intensely looks at you and begins casting another spell.
Travis: Oh shit.
Matt: Like it is wont to do.
Marisha: Is it?
Travis: Come on, smart Grog.
Matt: All right. So, Craven Edge, as you're holding it, all of a sudden the handle becomes white hot and you immediately take six points of fire damage just holding it.
Sam: Grip it harder! (groan)
Matt: Fire's biting through. Three attacks against you, Scanlan.
Sam: Oh, God.
Matt: Currently two of which are flanking you, so they're going to have advantage on the attacks. So that's a natural 20 on one of them. This guy is-- 18. That hits. And then this guy here without the advantage-- still hits with a 17.
Sam: I'm going to use Cutting Words on the last guy.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: I'm going to just-- (plays flute badly) to distract him.
Matt: Okay, go ahead and roll a d10.
Sam: d10. Which one's ten, I never remember. This one. Nine!
Matt: Okay! So he rolled a 17 plus seven, that would've been a 24, that brings him to 15, which I believe misses you. So the last strike, as he swings towards you, the shrilling tones, it causes him to reach up and grab one of his lizard-like ear holes and (snarling) the swing goes wildly over your head. However, as you duck down, you look up as you see the shadow come down of two large clubs that (boom boom) over the head of your tiny gnomish form. That's going to be-- (groans)
Sam: Oh, that's not a good sound.
Matt: Oh, and they also get bites after this, too. All right, so you take 12, which would double to 24-- Oh, no, sorry, 12-- 20 points of bludgeoning damage from one. You take 12 points of damage from the other. So 32 points of damage total. And they're both going to attempt to bite you as well, with advantage.
Sam: A bite with advantage!
Matt: That is a 20 on the first one.
Sam: That's the damage it does?
Matt: That's to hit. And that one's going to -- double 19, so they both hit. So you take another 20 points of damage total of piercing damage as they both start tearing into your body.
Laura: 52 points of damage just then?
Sam: (rasping breath)
Laura: No, Scanlan!
Marisha: No, you're still up, you're still up! I thought you said you had 55!
Sam: I did.
Laura: 52!
Marisha: It was 52 total.
Laura: You have three points left.
Sam: Ah! That was close, guys. I saw my mother! Then I saw myself at math class, failing.
Matt: I need you to make a bunch of concentration checks here.
Sam: Oh yeah. Okay.
Matt: To maintain control over it, yeah.
Sam: Advantage on concentration checks.
Matt: Yeah, so just roll two at a time.
Sam: Two whats?
Matt: Two d20s.
Sam: Well, I only have one d20.
Matt: Adding your constitution modifier to it.
Sam: How many-- oh, for each thing that-- constitution modifier. Holy God. Okay. I'm counting both of those, the first one's only 12.
Matt: 12, that'll work, because none of them-- only one of them did 20 damage and it's minimum of ten, so as long as you get above a ten with each one, you're fine.
Sam: Okay. So I got to do two more?
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: Yeah, that's 16 plus two.
Matt: Okay. Another one.
Sam: 17 plus two.
Matt: Another one.
Sam: Two plus two.
Matt: You have advantage on these.
Sam: Seven plus two. Nine.
Matt: Nine. Nope.
Sam: No good. No bueno.
Matt: With that, you lose your concentration on the Domination spell. As that fades--
Laura: That's okay. The other wyvern is still mad at the first one, so that's good.
Matt: So that ends their turn. Vex, you're up.
Laura: Oh man. Okay.
Matt: You see Scanlan being tossed around on the ground, and then you see streaks of blood in the air as one of them tears a big chunk out of his shoulder.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: He looks up at you briefly, his eyes half-open.
Laura: Scanlan! I got you!
Sam: No, no, I know you did. You shot me on the last turn, I remember. Yeah, you got me good! You got me good!
Laura: I shoot from my Bow of the Sky Sentinel.
Matt: Sky Sentinel, I believe, did you use that last battle?
Laura: Fuck.
Matt: I'm pretty sure you did.
Laura: I did, but I only used my burning thingy once, so I can do that. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. So I'm going to move my Hunter's Mark to one of the guys around Scanlan.
Matt: Okay. Do you want to say the most wounded of them?
Laura: Yeah, sure.
Matt: That would be--
Laura: Or the least wounded of them, actually.
Matt: The least wounded would be this one.
Laura: Okay. And then I'm going to shoot-- I'm going to shoot arrows.
Matt: All right!
Laura: All right. I'm going to shoot through my Blazing Bowstring on that guy and the guy in front of him.
Matt: Okay. Right there and there?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: So Blazing Bowstring, and then regular. Go for it.
Laura: Okay. So I forget how to do that. I roll to attack. Why is this so hard?! Okay, 18!
Matt: 18 hits.
Laura: Okay, I'm going to roll damage on that one, which is ten plus my normal eight. 12, 14 plus six for Hunter's Mark. 20 plus six for sneak attack, bitch!
Liam: Did you just call the DM a bitch?
Laura: No, I was calling that guy a bitch.
Sam: Matt does not deserve that kind of language.
Laura: 6d6. So that's 25 damage against the first guy.
Matt: 25 damage? That's just enough. Say goodbye to him. That sneak attack was just what you needed, that was the last bit of damage.
Laura: Yay! Okay, so the second guy is another 18.
Matt: Another 18? That hits.
Laura: Actually no, that's a 20-whatever. Yeah. Okay. 14, 15, 16. Do I get sneak attack on him, too?
Matt: Can only sneak attack once per turn.
Laura: Dang it. So 16 damage against that guy.
Matt: 16 damage, okay. So this arrow-- The first one hits it in the neck and he gurgles and falls to the ground and bleeds out on the floor next to Scanlan. The other one, the arrow strikes it in the middle of its shoulderblades and it arcs up in pain, but it's still standing. Though it's having to really move around with much pain in its face. That end your turn? You going to stay up there?
Laura: I'm going to-- yeah.
Matt: Staying up on the rooftop, sniping down. Good call. That brings us to Scanlan!
Sam: It's my turn?!
Laura: Take a potion! Heal yourself!
Sam: Oh yeah! If I had a potion, that would be great! I will do Thunderwave-- Thunderwave at third level.
Matt: Thunderwave at third level, all righty.
Liam: Dissention in the ranks.
Matt: (laughs) Okay, so that is 4d8 thunder damage to all the ones on a failed save. So, their constitution saves here. Is this through a hand cone?
Sam: Sure, man.
Matt: Figured-- both fail!
Sam: What is it, 4d8?
Matt: It's 4d8 thunder damage. They are pushed ten feet away from you.
Sam: Did they all fail? Did they both fail?
Matt: Yes. This pushed this way. This pushed that way.
Sam: Ten. 17!
Matt: 17 points of damage to each. Okay! They're blasted backward, barely catching themselves on their feet. And from the impact, you can see what little bit of red-colored leather armor they have on is tattered and destroyed. You can see blood pouring out of the sides of their earholes where the thunderous blast possibly burst their eardrums. And they're both like, shaking their head. All right.
Sam: Bonus action, I will Healing Word myself--
Matt: (laughing) Okay.
Sam: I can do that at higher levels? Yes?
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: I'll do it at a level four.
Matt: (laughing) Okay.
Sam: And I will sing to myself; sadly, pathetically, (breathy) I get knocked down, but I get up again. Ain't never going to keep me down. (laughter)
Matt: All right! So that is 4d4 plus five healing to yourself.
Sam: Okay, 4d4 plus five-- That's 14 plus five.19.
Matt: 19. So you heal yourself 19 hit points. That ends your turn. Up next, Vax.
Liam: I'm going to scramble up to the top of the building that I'm right next to.
Matt: Acrobatics check.
Liam: Sure. No problem. Yeah, way high. 20-- 33.
Matt: Yeah. You parkour up the side, land on top of the rooftop. Leap across and you're now at the edge.
Liam: Is that Percy right there?
Matt: That's Percy right there.
Liam: Okay. Oh, who's right directly in a row, away from me? Yeah, I can't tell. It's a bad guy?
Matt: It's a bad guy, bad guy. Bad guy, bad guy, bad guy.
Liam: I want to run, actually, and I want to jump off and land next to Percy. Yeah. I want to run straight by and I want to stab the dude. I'm going to run forward, yeah. Stab that guy. (laughter)
Liam: Yeah, exactly. That is 20.
Matt: That hits, roll damage.
Sam: Run, run, run. Stab. Run, run, run. Stab. Those are the two buttons on the Vax video game. (laughter)
Sam: Run and stab.
Liam: Nine.
Matt: Nine damage?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: (grunt) You shank him in the side and he tumbles over. (cheering)
Liam: Run towards Scanlan, and I want to grapple him. Hopefully he just takes it. No, not that far. One square back. Right there! Grab him. And I'm using my bonus action to dash and then drag him backward, behind Grog.
Matt: It's an action to grapple someone who would be against it, are you letting him grapple you?
Sam: Oh, hell yes.
Matt: I'll say for the sake of the--
Liam: Right, two actions and a bonus action, mix them around, Matt!
Matt: Yeah, it's fine, because he wants to. You rush forward, you grab him, and you're dragging him back this way?
Liam: And then back-- yeah, right behind Grog, and I drag him behind Vex and Grog, back by Keyleth. (airplane noise)
Matt: Okay. I'll say that's about as far as you get because you have a bit of movement taken away, even though you are hasted, because he's not too heavy, but he's still a gnome.
Liam: Right. Dash-- hasted, I can go very very far.
Sam: Your hands are so rough and masculine.
Liam: I spank him on the ass and say, you're welcome, shorty.
Marisha: Okay. I'm going to push my way through the crowd a little bit. Can I have that laser pointer?
Liam: Yes, you may.
Marisha: Thank you. Okay. (grandiose voice) And now with all of the rage, thinking about all--
Sam: "I turn someone into a chicken."
Marisha: I-- boof! Boof! Boof! I want some feather-down pillows for our loft. I channel all of my Fire Ashari ancestors. And I cast my 7th-level Firestorm!
Sam: Oh god, we're all going to die.
Marisha: So as I concentrate, enraged at the sight of dragons, I have ten--
Sam: (whispers) Did you get me away from-- because I--
Marisha: Yes, you're fine. You're fine. No, he didn't get you away because he knew this was happening, it just happened to work out. So ten ten-foot cubes-- They all have to be connected. Exactly, I'm going to start here and I'll work my way over. They're ten-foot-- remember, they're ten-foot. But they're attached. So they're bigger than that.
Matt: Three-- well, they're ten foot by ten foot, which is about this size.
Marisha: Okay, okay.
Matt: Right, so it's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Marisha: Oh, okay, yeah, get the wyvern.
Matt: You can get all of them there.
Laura: Oh my god, that guy is going to be so--
Liam: Grog's going to bite his head off.
Matt: What's the DC on this?
Marisha: They have to make a dex saving throw or they take--
Matt: Right, right, but what's your DC on it?
Marisha: Oh, my spell DC? 19.
Matt: Fail, fail, fail, they're not very dextrous. Fail, fail, fail-- Fail! They all fail. (cheering)
Matt: So that's 7d10 fire damage to each of them.
Sam: Why don't you use that all the time!?
Marisha: I just got it! I just got it when I leveled.
Liam: You've got to be careful with friendly fire, and we're all out of the way.
Marisha: So a giant, fiery chasm splits open.
Matt: The ground bursts open, rocks being torn asunder as giant columns of flame-- boof, boof, boof, boof, boof-- out of the ground, completely engulfing each one of them in this sudden conflagration of red and orange and yellow flames and molten magma.
Marisha: 24. 24, that was four-- 24, that's good, so 27, 36, 30-- 42 points of fire damage. (clapping)
Liam: Phew. Gingers, man. Gingers.
Marisha: My hands light up.
Matt: Each one of the lizardfolk-type creatures in the flames, you see them shriek for a second before their forms are turned to ash in these blasts of fire, each sub-woofer-like, guttural impact as the ground cracks open like (explosion noise) scatter amongst--
Marisha: So they explode? Popcorn?
Matt: Yeah, each one of the wyverns themselves, you can see the flames emerge around them, and as it recedes they have burn scars and their flesh is cracked and peeled against the fire wounds that now tear across the front of their body. They're all looking fairly hurt by that.
Marisha: And then, I take a bow. (laughter)
Marisha: And I'm-- exhausted a little bit, little single tear as I think of my ancestors-- And that's it.
Matt: All right, end of your turn. Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: All right. I'm going to start walking towards that wyvern at the bottom there-- Yeah, that way, I'm not going to get quite close enough to get into the reach of that jerk over there--
Matt: So you can go here.
Taliesin: Yeah. While I'm walking by him, though, I'm going to nail-- I don't even know if I'm really going to-- going to shoot him three times while I'm walking by, because that's funny. With Sharpshooter.
Matt: Okay. So first shot against them?
Taliesin: It would be seven, 19.
Matt: 19 hits. Go ahead and roll damage on him.
Taliesin: That's-- 1d10, what did I do with my 1d10s, because I wasn't thinking-- here we go. That's 26 points of damage.
Matt: (explosion noise) You take his head right off as you walk by, without even looking. (explosion noise, pained squawk) And you can see the lower jaw gets blown off and it falls to the back on the ground.
Taliesin: Since I've got two more shots, I'm going to start shooting at that one dragon-- that wyvern, as I'm--
Matt: Right there? Go for it. Two shots on the wyvern.
Taliesin: Sharpshooter again.
Matt: All right.
Sam: Pew!
Taliesin: That's a nine, yay! So that's 16?
Matt: 16 hits.
Taliesin: And I'll roll the second one, just to have it. That's nine. Nah, nine'll miss. Thankfully will not-- that's great. 26 points of damage.
Matt: All righty. This one (explosion noise) the bullet hits inside of its body, you can see a little (splurting noise) of blood squirt out--
Taliesin: And I'll get as close as I can get to him in this round, also, I'm going to spend my movement walking straight towards him.
Matt: (heavy walking noises) That's the rest of it there. Okay. That's your turn. Grog, you're up.
Travis: Oh! Yeah! I leave one of those to you guys, and I run at the two wyverns on the left.
Matt: Getting in the middle of the fray? Against them both?
Travis: Yeah, against them both!
Matt: There you go! Grog charges, and they're both-- There you go!
Travis: Here's hoping these puppies go-- That's 24?
Matt: 24 on the more wounded one?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: All right, that hits him.
Travis: Can I swing at the other guy?
Matt: If you want to.
Travis: Yeah, let's divvy it up, I don't want to give anybody too much love. Five, four, 26?
Matt: Hits, so roll damage on each.
Travis: 11, 22, 32?
Matt: They're both Great Weapon Master? Okay, 32 damage?
Travis: 32 on the first.
Matt: First one, you carve through him with the blade (whump).
Laura: Nice.
Matt: Makes his save.
Travis: Five, ten, 21, 31, 31.
Matt: 31 damage? Okay. This one you (whoosh) streak across with Craven Edge. Makes its save. You leave a large wound across the front of its jaw and it (choking noise). However, you did kill one, so you do get to use your bonus action for an attack because of your Great Weapon Master feat.
Travis: Do I have to roll for the hit?
Matt: Yes.
Travis: That's 31?
Matt: With the minus five?
Travis: Sorry! No, no, never mind, sorry, what's 31 minus five?
Liam: 26.
Taliesin: 26.
Matt: Hits, yeah, you're good.
Travis: Okay. Three, seven, 12, 30. Oh, 22, 32.
Liam: He's covered in ichor.
Matt: 32. This time (whoosh) you swipe through the second time with the blade, this time carving off part of its wing, and you see that one of the wings is half-curled and keeping up to the side, it's hobbling around its legs, looking like it's on death's door, but still keeping itself. All right, is that the end of your turn?
Travis: That's it.
Matt: All right, (wyvern noise) in there, and this one stays there and is going to unleash upon you, Grog. It's going to bite and tail attack against each of you with the stinger against you, Grog. That is a 21 to hit?
Travis: Hits.
Matt: And natural 20 on the stinger, okay.
Travis: Well, I have resistance against poison, so that helps.
Matt: That does help, actually, so it'll just do regular poison damage against you. So you take 11 points of piercing damage, reduced to six from the bite. And the stinger deals-- That's 12 points of piercing damage, reduced to six as well.
Travis: Okay.
Matt: The stinger, however, I need you to make a constitution saving throw.
Travis: All right. Ugh, 12.
Matt: That's a failure. Actually, it would have been an additional 12, because it was a critical hit on the pierce, so you take 12-- so a total of 18 damage so far, and then, as part of the poison, you take 48 points of poison damage. Because you have resistance, that is reduced to 24.
Sam: Hey! That's nice!
Matt: All right, you have poison resistance from the belt, right? Yes. All right, so there you go. The other one coming up against you, Percy, strikes with its bite. That is going to be a 20-- 16?
Taliesin: 16 misses.
Matt: 16 misses. That is going to be a 22 for the stinger.
Taliesin: Stinger hits.
Matt: Okay, stinger hits you for six plus four, ten points of piercing damage. I need you to make a constitution saving throw.
Taliesin: Constitution saving throw. 20.
Matt: 20, you succeed. No poison.
Taliesin: So I took ten points of--?
Matt: Piercing damage. Correct. All right, it's looking rough on both their ends. They're just fighting to the end at this point. All right, that ends their turn. Vex, you're up.
Laura: I'm going to cast Hunter's Mark on the one fighting--
Matt: Moving it over?
Laura: Yeah. Percy.
Matt: All right.
Laura: And I'm going to first attack the one fighting Grog.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: 16?
Matt: 16-- does hit, yeah.
Laura: Yes! Okay.
Matt: Don't have a whole lot of armor. They just got a lot of hit points.
Laura: 17 plus sneak attack-- 18.
Matt: 18. So Grog, as you're thrashing about with the blade at this creature, eager to get that final hit, you reach back with Craven Edge before an arrow (impact) into its face and it (burble, thump) collapses to the ground.
Travis: Aw! (laughter)
Laura: And I shift my attention over to the one fighting Percy!
Matt: All right.
Laura: And that is 30, no, 28?
Matt: 28 hits, go ahead and roll damage with the extra d6 for Hunter's Mark.
Laura: Nine, ten, 11-- Where's my dex? 17.
Matt: Gotcha. 17 points of damage. second you (whoosh) pull out the second arrow, (whoosh) release it and it strikes the side of its body, and (pained squawk) it still seems to be standing. It hurt it, but didn't leave it in any dire straits yet. That ends your turn, are you staying where you are?
Laura: I'm staying where I am!
Matt: Okay, Scanlan, you're up.
Laura: Actually, I'm going to jump off the roof and rush over to Scanlan.
Matt: Okay. So leaping off, make an acrobatics check.
Laura: 24?
Matt: 24-- Scanlan, at the start of your turn, as you're getting ready, all of a sudden (impact) in front of you, spooking you momentarily, you see Vex lands on her feet and looks down at you with a look of concern and wanting to make sure you're okay.
Sam: Oh, hi, thanks for checking on me. Could you move for a second? I'm going to kill this thing. (laughter)
Sam: Oh, so I'll-- I can't do much, because I'm far away and I don't want to kill Percy--
Taliesin: It's not going to live through me anyway.
Sam: That's true. I will Wand of Magic Missiles him.
Matt: Okay, using how many--
Sam: I'll use six of my seven.
Matt: Oof! All righty. So go ahead and roll proper damage on that.
Sam: Okay, the first, okay, so is that 6d4 plus one?
Matt: This would be Magic Missile, cast at level six, technically, I'm pretty sure--
Sam: Well, it's weird, because my--
Matt: So it would be-- it would be 6d6 plus six.
Sam: 6d6 plus six?
Matt: Oh, I'm sorry. 6d4 plus six. Bleah.
Travis: (chuckles) Heh, math.
Matt: Hey.
Sam: Sorry, it's close.
Laura: Yeah.
Sam: One more? 12 plus what? Six? 12 plus six. 18.
Matt: 18? Okay. The missiles (impact noises) slamming into the side, arcing off and swirling around Percy to hit it, anime-missile-streak style, hitting it from all sides, you can see chunks of its body being blown off from the force of the arcane casting. It still stands, though it is dripping from multiple wounds and is having a hard time.
Taliesin: I got this.
Matt: Ending your turn, Scanlan?
Sam: I think so, I mean, I'm okay. I'll heal myself a little bit more with another level one Healing Word.
Matt: Go for it, take your d4 plus five.
Sam: Okay. Seven more points-- yay!
Matt: You're up.
Liam: I'm going to start walking towards it and dagger, and dagger, and dagger.
Matt: Go for it.
Liam: First is 20.
Matt: 20 hits.
Liam: Second is 23.
Matt: Hits.
Liam: Third is a 23.
Matt: Hits.
Liam: So, we get--
Matt: This is Sneak Attack.
Liam: Ten for the fir-- Sneak Attack? Is it near something?
Matt: Percy is in melee range with it.
Liam: Okay, so the first is ten plus-- wah!
Laura: Oh no, dice down!
Liam: Ten plus 16, 23, (growling) 29, 36, 39, 41 for the first dagger.
Matt: How do you want to do this? (cheering)
Liam: I will aim for its open mouth as it's going "huah." And pin its tongue into the back of its skull.
Matt: As you step forward, your first dagger, you pull it out and aim it and over-the-hand toss it as it rears back, ready to bring its fangs out to sink down into Percy, the dagger vanishes into its throat, and you see its face go lax for a second. (wet coughs) It begins trying to cough, and as it does, you can see bits of blood and gore from its throat being hawked across the ground. It takes a few steps. Percy steps out of the way as it heads towards you before it rears back and (choking, thump) and collapses onto the ground. You can see the blade still sticking out the back of its head, towards the back of its throat, before it appears at the side of your belt.
Sam: Sorry I made a noise, guys, sorry.
Laura: Next time, stealth. We should get inside.
Travis: Yeah.
Laura: We should hide.
Taliesin: We should-- we should take what we can and we should also hide the bodies.
Laura: Good call.
Taliesin: Let's bring everything inside.
Marisha: I go down to the wyverns and I start going for those stingers.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: If you can do this quickly, Keyleth, because we need to hide these bodies.
Matt: It's going to take you a while to do it.
Liam: Can I assist with my Keen Dagger, and help her under her instruction?
Laura: Let's get them inside.
Liam: We're going to drag the wyverns indoors?
Taliesin: Drag everything indoors.
Sam: Wait, wait, wait-- these stingers are on the end of tails?
Liam: Yeah.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Sam: Grog, can you chop off their tails and we'll take the tails with us?
Laura: No, we've got to get the wyverns inside. If anything flying overhead sees these bodies, they know something's been attacked.
Sam: Aren't half of them burned to a crisp anyway?
Taliesin: Not crisped, just scorched.
Marisha: There's some ash. I go ahead and I do a cantrip, Gust, and start spreading out the ash.
Matt: Okay. It still looks like someone emptied a bunch of fireplace ash pits into the center of the walkway where there once were lizardfolk.
Laura: I'll have the bag.
Travis: What for?
Laura: Just the Dust of Tracelessness.
Sam: I give us cover. I'll blow my Horn of Fog.
Laura: I start putting the Dust of Tracelessness down on the ground so it looks like nobody's been here.
Matt: Low fog sound as Scanlan blows the horn. Fog fills the vicinity and you guys begin tossing Dust of Tracelessness around--
Travis: I go grab the humanoid figures and I throw two over my shoulders and then I get one in each hand and I start dragging them toward a door?
Taliesin: Any-- inside. Just inside.
Travis: To an "any inside."
Liam: I'll get the door for you. (door creaks)
Matt: All right, you guys pretty quickly manage to move what you can out of the way, we'll say over the next few minutes the fog is there. Under that cover, you begin to drag the wyvern bodies into the alleyway, into the shadows. If you want to go ahead and make some checks here to go ahead and see if you can harvest.
Marisha: Yeah, okay, let's do different ones. Okay, so first one, I'll definitely take advantage, so, since I have advantage-- not that much better-- 14. The first one.
Liam: Would it help if I gave her my Keen Dagger for the rest of it?
Matt: I would say, given the circumstance, all it would do would offer her advantage, which she already has, so it wouldn't make much difference. So the first one, it's been a little too damaged in battle and you aren't able to really draw any poison from the stinger for the first one-- what's the second one?
Marisha: Second one, 15 total.
Matt: 15's what you needed. You manage to extract just enough of the wyvern stinger poison for possibly a single dose, so you can mark down a dose of wyvern poison.
Marisha: Okay, I'll give it to-- I'll give that to Vax. Do you have poison? Or do you-- Vax or Vex-- I give it to one of the twins. Here, twins. You fight over it. Fight over it.
Laura: Is it good for you?
Liam: Yeah.
Marisha: Two more, maybe I can-- 14-- Okay, well, the second one I rolled a 25.
Matt: Okay, so that's a second dose of wyvern poison.
Marisha: That I give to Vex. Last one-- I'll take that 15, with-- 26.
Matt: All right, so you have three doses of wyvern poison that you've managed to harvest from these creatures; you guys can distribute as you see fit.
Taliesin: Anything else to loot from these schmuckuses?
Matt: They don't carry much gold, and what they have, you envision, probably went to the entity that rules Emon. And as you're looking over the bodies of the few of the lizard men here, you see they didn't just wander their way in here. And you remember mention from Allura before that there were lizardfolk worshipers of Thordak years ago. Apparently, once the city's been taken, Thordak has, or at least the worshipers of Thordak are also moving in. So, taking this time to harvest poisons, looking over the bodies, you can see the consistency between their red, crimson-dyed leather materials, and you get the sensation that while this was a small skirmish group, this is probably the new policing state of Emon. So. With that, we'll take a quick break for the restroom. We'll pick up here in just a few minutes, guys, if you want to hang tight. And we'll see you here shortly. Jumping back in-- As the party re-gathers themselves after the battle with these lizardfolk and the wyverns in the center of the city of Emon, you slowly make your way back through the streets towards the north, passing through Abdar's Promenade, finding the building that was previously brought to your attention thanks to Garthok.
Laura: Should we take a short rest, though, before we head down to the Clasp? Because some of us have taken some hits--
Taliesin: We'll take a breath in the--
Laura: Okay. Before we head down?
Taliesin: Yeah. In the basement.
Matt: So you guys find the building that was brought to your attention; you head down into the same cellar, keeping tabs on the external trap that was brought to your attention by Garthok last time. You make your way inside. There's the same barrel in the far corner; you pull the top off and there, indeed, is a ladder that leads down underground.
Laura: This is why I left Trinket. Because he wouldn't have been able to come down here anyway. Just so you know.
Travis: Hey, search that shit, Vax.
Marisha: He's very claustrophobic.
Liam: So we've just got ladder down. That's it?
Marisha: Well, hang on, let's heal up. I need to hit dice it up as well.
Liam: Well, I'm fine, so while everybody is--
Travis: I would not like to take a short rest.
Laura: Oh.
Travis: I lose all my Fancy Feast if I do.
Liam: Just do some push-ups. Just do some push-ups while I check this ladder out. So I'm going to check for any traps on this ladder or anything.
Travis: Oh, yeah yeah yeah! Can she heal me instead?
Laura: I'll heal you. I'm going to heal you--
Liam: 23.
Matt: Okay. Looking at the barrel, there are no traps currently set, and it's not locked. The only traps were on the outside of the cellar, from what you knew previously, and as that mechanism had already been shown to you by Garthok, so that was easily disabled.
Liam: I'm not going to go crazy, I'm just going to go to the bottom of the ladder-- in I go.
Matt: Okay. So while you guys are taking a rest--
Liam: 30 for stealth.
Matt: You drop down the ladder. As you head down what probably comes to about 15, 20 or so feet into pitch black-- it's completely dark down there. Do you have any light source, or do you want to--
Liam: I have a Flame Tongue Dagger.
Matt: Okay, so you pull the Flame Tongue Dagger. It puts out a very, very low candlelight, opens up the vicinity to you as your feet splash down into very, very shallow, a couple inches, shallow water. Looking around you, you are in a subterranean sewer system. The smell hits you as you hit the bottom of it. This is the entire underbelly of Emon, and there is the slight sound of trickling water that's rushing through this tunnel you're currently standing in. The ladder drops close to about a foot above the floor before it comes to a complete stop. Looking to your right, it descends a little further down on that side, and you can hear-- make a perception check.
Liam: 22.
Matt: Okay. To the right of you, what should be the eastern tunnel, you can hear the sound of trickling water growing louder; it's almost like this stream meets another. As you listen to the left, and the stench is pretty rough in this part, to the left you can see in the tunnel is a very, very faint dim, yellow light that is shifting ever so slightly in the distance as it curves around out of view. It is level to where you are now, actually, slight incline for a little bit.
Liam: (quietly) Vex'ahlia-- There is a long tunnel down here and there is a bit of faint light. I have Percy's fancy rock; I am not planning on doing anything crazy, but I think I should--
Laura: You don't have the-- the rock doesn't work until we sleep. You don't have anything.
Liam: Well, technically I do still have it. Regardless, I should go ahead and, if there's anyone to talk to, I should talk-- I'm not going to go yet, I'm going to wait 'til you guys have rested, and come down to-- it's pitch-black down here, I'm not running ahead. I'm better at this shit than you and the rest are, so take a rest, I'm going to sit here--
Laura: You're better at talking than the rest of us are?
Liam: Sometimes, Stubby, yes.
Laura: How will I know if you get into trouble, and your hands are tied--
Sam: Do you need me to come?
Laura: We can all hear you. (laughter)
Liam: Stubby, could you come down here for me?
Marisha: Hi, Vax.
Laura: Hold on just a moment. Mind the gap.
Matt: You splash down into the sewer system.
Laura: Eugh, fuck, it smells down here.
Liam: Yeah.
Laura: Do I have to step in the water?
Liam: Probably. Come here.
Laura: Yes?
Liam: All right so, before all these guys-- you were being stalked by someone, I don't know for what reason, I don't know who the person was, I don't know what they wanted with you.
Laura: Stalked?
Liam: Someone wanted you, and I don't know who. The Clasp was going to get you for them, and I stopped that from happening. I followed you one night, or rather, followed this person following you, and met the Clasp. And I made an exchange for your life.
Laura: What?
Liam: I went and got someone else. And--
Laura: And said it was me? No--
Liam: Not immediately. You're almost on it. They told me to get a body, I got a body. A living body. A child rapist. And brought him to the Clasp, and they brought out a stick-- really it was made of human tongues.
Laura: A stick. Of human tongues.
Liam: Yes. They touched it, and he turned into you.
Laura: What the fuck?
Liam: And they took that guy. For whatever. And in exchange for your life, I have this, and they are allowed to call on me when they want. So, I know that we've run in and out a couple of times, but we're going in. You can talk my fucking ear off in a moment, all right? Just shut up for a second. We are going to go in and try to form some sort of alliance or working partnership, this is different than running in, smashing some shit and running out, all right? So keep the cloak up, hang back, don't say a lot, and you can talk my ear off later.
Laura: Okay, I will do that, I want to know that tongue guy, that looks like me-- is he dead or is he alive now? They gave him to some stalker, some stalker!
Liam: I don't know why you were wanted, I don't know what it was about, all I knew is that they were going to take you away and I wasn't going to let that happen and I took some fucking piece of shit and traded him in.
Laura: So there could be at this moment in time another person that looks just like me parading around the world?
Liam: Well, if I had to wager on it, I'd say that he's in a dungeon in a rubber suit, but I don't know where, no.
Laura: Well, thank you. For, you know, doing that-- (nervous laugh)
Liam: I never told you because it's creepy as fuck.
Laura: Was it the Clasp here, was it the Clasp in Westruun?
Liam: It was in Westruun.
Laura: Well, these guys probably don't know me.
Liam: Probably? Probably.
Laura: I'll put my hood up--
Liam: Stay at the back.
Laura: I would like to find out who the guy was that wanted me, though. That's kind of weird. Thank you. For everything. thank you. You always have my back and I know it.
Liam: Yeah.
Laura: And for that, I won't say very much.
Liam: You do you, Vex'ahlia.
Laura: Everyone can come down.
Matt: So as you finish your short rest, you all progressively find your way down the ladder and to the subterranean sewer system. The choice is to travel to the east or western side of the tunnel.
Liam: Sounds like there's, I don't know, drainage or something coming from slightly up in that direction.
Laura: I'm guessing towards the light, is where they are. Scanlan?
Sam: Oi?
Laura: Do you have something that can make disguises? Don't you have like, not the mustache, but something that can really change my looks?
Sam: How do you know I'm Scanlan? I could be in disguise, but yes I do.
Laura: Could I use that?
Sam: You would have to attune it to yourself-- is that right?
Laura: Oh, it takes like a little bit?
Sam: Oh no no no, requires attunement. What do you think?
Liam: Well, that's not a bad idea, but it means we've got to sit in this stank.
Sam: I can instantly make us, with Seeming, I can instantly make us all look different. Or just you.
Laura: Or just me. How about just me? I've got a question, though. Here's the thing: if you think that they know what I look like, don't you think they know what you look like? Because you look just like me. So what difference does it make if I'm there or not?
Liam: I don't know if the person who wanted you was part of the Clasp. I don't know who it was. It's parading you around in front of the people who made an illicit deal with me.
Laura: All right, all right, all right. Seeming, how about that?
Liam: It could be fine. I don't know.
Laura: Okay! Seeming?
Sam: Yeah, no--
Laura: Please?
Sam: (smarmily) It's pretty high-level stuff--
Laura: Scanlan, what if I heal you?
Sam: What if I-- ooh! I cast Minor Illusion and give her a moustache. What about that? Is that pretty good?
Matt: A fancy, fancy moustache that you cannot wipe off your face!
Travis: Hey, that's very handsome.
Liam: I don't think that's going to be enough. It's not quite enough for our purposes.
Sam: All right, I dispel it.
Laura: How about a limerick as payment, Scanlan?
Sam: A limerick for you?
Laura: For you.
Sam: Oh! You're going to give me a limerick?
Laura: I'll give you a limerick. Hold on. I've been preparing it--
Liam: She's multiclassing a third time.
Laura: Have you heard tale of Scanlan the Bard? / Or Burt Reynolds, if you look at his card. Always tries to get laid / Sometimes with ladies he made! But I still respect him, 'cause rhyming is hard. (laughter, cheering)
Sam: That was excellent.
Liam: Second firestorm of the night.
Travis: Where's the extinguisher?
Matt: I will give you a d6 inspiration dice for that.
Laura: Yay!
Sam: Wait-- me or her?
Matt: Her.
Sam: Wow. That's impressive. Here's the hat. You can use it--
Laura: Oh, thanks, Scanlan.
Sam: In about 20 minutes you'll be able to use it.
Laura: I take off my circlet, I guess, and I put on the hat.
Liam: How 'bout that smell, everyone? Eh?
Marisha: Did you live in this?
Liam: I never lived--
Marisha: Did you deal with this!? Oh, oh, that's good.
Liam: I'm, like, a distant cousin to all this. (laughter)
Matt: In the time it takes for you to take the Hat of Disguise and go ahead and attune to that, you guys are now prepared. What path would you like to take?
Sam: Towards the sounds, yes?
Matt: Well, you have the sound of water rushing to the right, in the darkness, and you have the sound, or, yeah, the view of slight moving light to the left.
Liam: But did you say, on the right, is it going down, or is it coming down?
Matt: The water is trickling downward; the water continues sloping downward this way. The opposite direction is where the light is. The little bit of light you see in the distance.
Taliesin: I say we follow the water.
Liam: Follow the water down or follow the light?
Marisha: Follow the water towards the light. Right?
Travis: Jesus, what the fuck are we doing here?
Liam: This is like the Underdark again.
Sam: I abstain.
Laura: Let's go towards--
Marisha: Towards the light.
Taliesin: I'll do whatever they say.
Marisha: Are we going towards the light or towards the rushing water?
Travis: Light.
Marisha: All who vote "light," say "aye."
Taliesin: Aye.
Laura: Aye.
Travis: Aye.
Marisha: All who vote "water," say "aye."
Taliesin: Aye.
Marisha: To the light.
Matt: So you guys head-- left, or--
Liam: Is there any-- I'm sorry, one last question. Is there any Thieves' Cant on the walls at all?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Laura: Can I look, too?
Matt: You know what, yes, you can.
Sam: With inspiration.
Travis: Is there any poo on the floor?
Liam: 31.
Laura: Oh, he doesn't need my help.
Matt: Looking along the walls, you start heading in that direction, you do see a few markings that basically say 'sanctuary' in Thieves' Cant, in the direction of the light.
Liam: All right. Confirmed.
Matt: You guys continue onward?
Liam: Yeah, I'll lead the way. Yeah, we sat here for 20 minutes in the stank.
Matt: Yes. (clears throat) So, you guys continue forward up that tunnel. Eventually, as it curves around, the light-- you can see-- it's shifting, because it appears to be a distant fire light that is the source in this vicinity, and as you turn the corner, as the tunnel slowly curves around, it opens up into a large central sewer chamber, though most of it is dry, and you can see there is a large mound of dirt in the center that seems to rise above most of the water that has collected along the ceiling, and there are a series of platforms constructed out of wooden scaffolding at different levels all throughout this chamber. Some of it looks a little rickety, some of it looks very old, but various states of moisture rot. (offscreen sneeze)
Matt: You hear a sneeze from the distance from one of the-- (laughter)
Matt: As you look and see a series of small bonfires throughout the room that are currently lit and surrounded by figures. You see a ramshackle tent city, and/or a series of small, wooden hovels that have constructed here. You see a number of figures that are huddled around these bonfires: cloaks, hoods up, generally keeping warm in what is a relatively cold, subterranean area. You guys, glancing over here, as you're first looking, and you can see a few of them appear to be laid up and hurt, and there appear to be at least a few individuals that are heavily bandaged or have slings on. As you guys step into the room, not being very stealthy in your arrival--
Liam: We could have been, but I use a bit of sign language from the Cant, and let them know that I'm part of the Clasp?
Matt: Okay. A few of them stand up, hands on the side of their hilt, and stop there for a second before one individual steps out of the shadows and puts his hand up, putting it down. You recognize this to be Garthok.
Sam: Garthok!
Matt: He says, "Don't worry, they're with me. I'm glad you made it. It had been a while. I was afraid maybe you wouldn't come."
Sam: We got held up by some wyverns. I almost died, it was crazy. We're here now.
Matt: "It sounds like it. I'm sorry to hear it."
Sam: Hey. It's all right.
Matt: "I'm glad you stayed alive." And as he starts to talk, the group of individuals standing about ten feet behind him separate as another figure pushes past them. Pulling the hood back, you can see a man about six feet in height, average human height, long, blond hair that trails past the middle of his back over a dark grey cloak. Fine features at one time; he looks older, you can see the weathering in his face and the various wrinkles and lines from years and years of living in this atmosphere.
Liam: You said "human", right?
Matt: Human, yes. He has a red-tinted monocle over one eye.
Sam: Ooh! I like him already.
Matt: As he steps forward, the rest of the Clasp put their hands off to the side of their weapons. He pushes aside Garthok to the rest of you and says: "So, you are the ones called Vox Machina, am I correct in this assumption?"
Sam: Yes, you are.
Matt: "Hmm! Trusted of Uriel, executors of Modeth the Traitor. One among you is a member as well, I'm told."
Liam: I step forward.
Matt: "Then you are welcome here. I am Spireling Shenn--"
Sam: (whispers) Spireling Shenn?
Marisha: (murmurs) He's a Spireling!
Matt: "Master of networks and information--"
Sam: Ooh!
Marisha: Ooh!
Matt: "--of the Clasp of Emon. Excuse the mess, we lost a portion of our territory and are currently caught in mid-adaptation. So, what can I do for you?"
Liam: Well, you know who we are.
Matt: "And you know who I am, now."
Liam: Yes. And you know my spotty track record with the Clasp. But that's all past now. The city's in ruins. You're looking at the right hand of Uriel.
Matt: "Uriel is no longer with us. You are a hand to nothing."
Liam: Of course. We're looking for what to do next with this city. I don't think any of us wish to be the pets of the beast that's now roosting in the heart of Emon.
Matt: (chuckles) "No, that does not do any of us any good. Business has ground to a halt, and we've lost a few good patrons in this unfortunate circumstance. We lost our entire northern tunnel structure as soon as the creature attacked the Cloudtop District."
Liam: Well, I'll be honest, our first thought was to flee this city.
Matt: "Safer."
Liam: But before we make that decision-- yes, it is-- we know that you're the next best thing to a government in Emon.
Matt: "Hmm."
Liam: And we want to know what's left behind.
Matt: "Well, we're seeing to our own. We're going to see how many of our allies still lie within the city. Going to reach out to our friends across Tal'Dorei and see how much of a network we still stand to keep. Then we call in a few debts, reach out to some friends and, ah, we see if we can find some way to supplant this red thing."
Liam: Can I insight check?
Matt: Go for it.
Liam: Not good. No. Nine.
Sam: Nine, you said?
Liam: Nine. The plan now is to lay low and hide?
Matt: "Well, for now, I have a number of operatives topside who are currently trying to get as much information on the red one as possible. The piles of wealth are growing, and it looks like the beast is building a damn home out of the district."
Taliesin: The city's going to need a black market.
Matt: "Oh, I am aware, and we are preparing for that. However, it's still fairly fresh, and individuals aren't willing to release any coin when all of it goes to the pouches of the thing that sits on us. Word has gotten back that Westruun was also hit rather hard in the night. And these creatures have continued eastward ever since-- no further word on their whereabouts. So we're put in a reactionary position, which I loathe. We're used to being ahead of the rest of the curve."
Taliesin: Well, here's where we could help each other.
Matt: "It would appear that could be a possibility."
Taliesin: We need this city to stay alive. We need the citizenry to be fed, and we need people to know where they're going to get their medicine and when they're going to get their food. We understand it's going to be tricky. We need information, we need spies, we need to know what's happening in the city, and you need people like us to stay out of your way.
Matt: "That seems like a fairly top-heavy trade in our direction, if you ask me. There are many ways to get people out of our way."
Taliesin: There are ways that we can benefit each other.
Matt: "I would love to hear it."
Sam: (whispers) I would, too.
Taliesin: We have safe haven-- and please, by the way, stop me if you feel I'm being too broad.
Sam: No, go for it.
Taliesin: We have our keep that is untouched by the dragon's attack-- we have a safe haven.
Matt: "Hmm. How is this keep accessed?"
Liam: We can get to that.
Taliesin: There are-- options.
Liam: We also have strong connections to Whitestone.
Laura: And Vasselheim.
Sam: And to The Slayer's Take-- that's what they're called, right? Yes? There could be a formidable force that could come to protect the city or drive out the dragons.
Liam: We're proposing a short-term solution-- you want to get back to a position where you can grease the wheels and make money. That's not going to happen anytime soon. But you can't take care of these beasts on your own. And neither can Whitestone, neither can we.
Taliesin: But it is very likely that we will be the thing that is dropped upon it from a great height, and the most cooperation we can get, getting into a position of power over this beast, the happier we'll all be.
Matt: "Hmm. Let's say we do this, let's say we go forward with this alliance. You get out of our way, you promise resources from Whitestone, perhaps? They have quite a few unique contributions they could make. The Slayer's Take-- I have not had many dealings across the Ozmit Sea, but are you referring to, ah, Vasselheim?"
Sam: Indeed. They are a mighty force.
Matt: "Now, that is a tough nut to crack, that city. If you're connected in Vasselheim, perhaps we can talk."
Laura: There's no guarantees you'll be able to get in anywhere.
Matt: "There's no guarantees we'll be able to provide food or medicine-- it's dangerous times, my dear."
Laura: It is. But the sooner these dragons are defeated, the sooner business can get back to usual.
Matt: "Of course."
Laura: Ow. I mean-- (fake coughs) eh.
Sam: I know I'm getting a bit ahead of ourselves, but once the dragons are gone and the city's returned to normalcy, what is your ultimate goal? To hold power or to remain in the underbelly?
Matt: "All the real power lies in the underbelly, my friend. I have a proposition for you, then. We will do this. We have many channels and secret tunnels throughout the city, and we could very easily deliver food, medicine, shelter, even, to the wired and poor and downtrodden folk of this town, be the subterranean heroes of Emon. Out of the goodness of our hearts, of course. However, once this creature is toppled, and the city is brought toward, I gather you would have the ear of whoever comes to power in this city."
Sam: We may very well be the person that comes to power in this city.
Matt: "That is helpful. And I imagine you also have some presumably powerful connections in Vasselheim. We would be interested in beginning a sect of our fair trade in that distant, all-too-- how do I put it? Xenophobic cityscape?"
Travis: What?
Matt: "If you agree to be our seed in that stubborn garden of a town, you have our aid."
Marisha: Can you give us a moment? (softly) Please?
Matt: "My patience grows thin."
Marisha: (whispering) Can we talk about this for a second, guys?
Matt: He adjusts the monocle on his eye.
Marisha: Do we really need them? Are they really providing us with enough to make this worth our while, to where we essentially want to open up the Pandora's Box of crime in Vasselheim? Do we want to be responsible for that?
Travis: Well, I'm all about Pandora and her box, but I don't think we really need this. It's not worth all of that. Especially if we're going to Vasselheim.
Marisha: I feel like we just took one pretty top-heavy deal and traded it for an even more top-heavy deal not in our favor.
Taliesin: Oh no, I'm not-- I feel the urge to further discuss this. Also, to be fair, we're not representatives of the Clasp; we couldn't, technically speaking, open-- All we can do is-- I think, the most fair thing to do-- to offer in exchange for this is perhaps some trade with the materials that are available in Whitestone and maybe a promise of keeping a blind eye towards their business until the finished reconstruction of the city. Let them reestablish themselves until the city is properly completed.
Laura: Don't say that.
Taliesin: You need an underbelly. Underbellies are function. Underbellies function for this very need: the fact that we can actually get food and medical supplies into the city right now if we need to. Less than 72 hours after such a devastating attack, there's no other system--
Liam: If the Clasp were to vanish, something else would take its place.
Taliesin: They're inevitable.
Laura: But I don't want to introduce them to Vasselheim, no.
Taliesin: At the cost of people starving or not starving.
Laura: We're already here, Keyleth.
Marisha: I'm down for joining them and letting them join our cause, and using their infrastructure, but beyond that--
Liam: Can I use perception to make sure that we're really private right now?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Laura: Can I join in?
Liam: 22-- Oh, 22, plus can I use my inspiration on this?
Matt: When'd you get that inspiration die?
Liam: I got it in the wyvern fight.
Matt: It would've faded by now, unfortunately.
Liam: Okay, so 22.
Laura: 33.
Matt: 33? You're far away from the crowd. However, Spireling Shenn has been very concentrated in shifting his attention from each person that is currently speaking in this conversation.
Marisha: He's reading our lips.
Laura: I turn my back to him and I say, he can read our lips as well as I can.
Taliesin: Of course he can, which is why I'm not saying anything that I wouldn't want him to hear anyway. I just don't want to promise anything we can't deliver. I don't think we could deliver Vasselheim; we're going to be busy! We have too much on our plate as it is.
Laura: I don't think they'd listen to us anyway, honestly.
Taliesin: I'm going to offer what we can give, and see if that's enough.
Sam: We have to have something to sweeten the pot.
Marisha: Yes.
Sam: What are you offering, money?
Laura: Offering to sweeten the pot-- we're defeating a fucking dragon! Let them get back to normal.
Sam: We can't promise that! The dragon could very easily kill us!
Laura: We could say-- They certainly can't do it without us. And we can't do it without them. But we'll be bringing in other armies with us.
Marisha: I agree-- it's joined forces at this point, that's all we can offer them. A place to fight at our side.
Travis: You're still assuming he's going to keep his word, too.
Taliesin: Let me go back to him. (deep sigh) Shenn.
Matt: "Yes, hmm."
Taliesin: I propose a counter-offer. I just don't feel comfortable offering Vasselheim; I don't think that we could necessarily deliver, and we, honestly, have a lot to do.
Matt: "All I'm asking is an introduction to a handful of key figures in the city, no more than that."
Taliesin: Well, I will not promise that now. What I can promise right now is some access to materials from Whitestone, which-- and I show him my gun hilt, which is embedded with the gems. I can see what's still lying around, and we can make a deal. I can also promise that for the reconstruction, once this has been dealt with, which is in everybody's best interest, until such time as there's a functioning government in this city, you will be treated with the respect appropriate of a group of people who are helping keeping the city functional.
Matt: "You act like that hasn't been our treatment for the entirety of this city's existence. You think your council didn't have dealings with the Clasp for many years before this happened?"
Taliesin: Of course they have.
Matt: "We helped make this city function. All we're offering is this service to other places that maybe don't have the right guidance to achieve their true greatness. All I ask is an introduction. Beyond these other. Far after the fact; don't even need to worry about it now. Who's to say what changes from now to then?"
Laura: Who would we even introduce you to?
Marisha: We don't even know anyone.
Sam: Yes, we do. We know some high-ranking clerics. We know the Slayer's Take. We met a bunch of people up there.
Marisha: In a zealot city? You want to go to a cleric and be like, "Hey. Thought you might want to meet the underground mob boss."
Matt: "We don't have to worry about that now. Just a simple handshake, and it's all done."
Taliesin: I'll put something forward to the group. If they prove themselves honorable, if they prove themselves faithful and capable of keeping this city afloat, then we will speak to whomever they wish us to speak to precisely of what they did. No more, no less.
Matt: "If this is an issue of morality, I would like to remind you that, one, we've let you escape after murdering one of our leaders, only upon learning that he himself was an immoral individual."
Liam: You're welcome.
Matt: "Also, we went against our word as an organization by letting you take a war criminal that had already paid his way out of the city."
Taliesin: And for that, we are grateful.
Laura: And we gave you something very powerful in exchange.
Marisha: And you got to keep that man's money.
Taliesin: That was business.
Matt: "It was business, but business that was persuaded by the actions of good people, and bringing justice. We want society to thrive."
Taliesin: I'm willing to kick this ball down the field.
Travis: What?
Matt: "So. Not wasting any more time, shall we make this a fine, healthy city once again?"
Taliesin: This feels a fair deal to me, and it means that we can leave knowing that the city will, in fact, still have a populace while we're gone.
Marisha: You seem used to selling your soul, Percy.
Taliesin: It is the job of ruling.
Sam: If we come back and learn that you have made a deal with the dragons, you'll be the first to die, not them.
Matt: "Oh. I would only hope that would be the case. I wouldn't be caught dead dealing with such a selfish entity."
Sam: All right, then let's do this. Keyleth, shake the man's hand.
Taliesin: You don't have to.
Sam: You've got nice soft hands.
Taliesin: Vax?
Travis: It should be Vax.
Taliesin: This is not the worst deal I've ever heard.
Marisha: You just don't know that yet.
Matt: "I have things to do."
Taliesin: I have met the devil. That's not him.
Laura: Don't do it.
Marisha: Percy, you make me so nervous.
Taliesin: Thank you.
Matt: "I haven't all day. My arm grows weary with impatience."
Marisha: Vax?
Sam: Would you like me to sing to give you some extra strength for that arm?
Taliesin: Vax, I will make the deal if you're not up to it, but I want your blessing.
Liam: You know what? Keep your deal.
Travis: Yeah! Attaboy.
Sam: We're going to leave the city abandoned?
Travis: Yes.
Sam: With no one to protect it?
Marisha: We are not abandoning it. We already discussed it. There's more than one way to cut through this knot.
Liam: I don't think you're going to let this city fall, anyway. If this city dies, you've nothing.
Marisha: I agree.
Liam: If the parasite hasn't a host to feed on, the parasite dies. No, thank you.
Marisha: Percy? I'm sorry, but I think our methods of being rulers might differ. I don't think I need to sell myself for the greater good.
Matt: "Very well. Unfortunate as it is. Step forward."
Liam: Is this a whisper?
Matt: No, this is him asking you to step forward. He steps really close to you, and he takes you by the shoulders and turns you around to face away from him. Do you resist?
Liam: I'm going to roll out of his hands forward to my friends.
Matt: Okay. Make an acrobatics check.
Liam: 28.
Matt: 28. You tumble away from his grasp, and he (grunts). "Very well. I know your face now, at least. And the rest of the Clasp will know you are a false member, now. You are not welcome in these tunnels ever again, and if we see your face amongst our kind, it will be our word that you are to be taken on sight. It's a shame you've marked yourselves our enemy this day. I wish it wasn't this way. But to step up and confront us with such disrespect for all the patience we've shown you in previous years is just-- it irks me. Stinks of a lack of civilization. So please be on your way. We'll do as we do. You do as you. Now be gone." And he turns around, flicks his cloak, and steps back into the group. The rest of them keep their hands on their belts and wait for you to leave.
Sam: I look at Garthok and say, "Even you?"
Matt: Garthok actually gives you a very stern look and pulls his blade an inch from the side of his scabbard.
Travis: I wouldn't do that.
Matt: At which point, you can see 25 more Clasp members step out. Even wounded ones as they are, all stepping up and gathering. There are now 35 to 40 of them starting to form out of the shadows, forming a semicircle around you entirely.
Sam: Don't do it, Grog.
Taliesin: Absolutely not.
Marisha: Let's go. Come on.
Travis: A fellow can't smile every once in a while?
Laura: We'll just back up.
Taliesin: I take a bow, and I turn my back to them and walk out.
Laura: I do not turn my back. I walk backwards the entire way out, with an arrow notched.
Travis: I stay next to Vax.
Sam: I say, party on, Garthok. And then we leave.
Laura: Keyleth? Darling? Could you maybe make a wall of stone and close off this tunnel?
Marisha: Unfortunately, no.
Liam: Save a thought for the people of Emon, if you've any room left in your narrow minds. And I back out.
Marisha: I end with, hopefully, you will realize there is a far greater enemy at hand than the personal squabbles between us small people. And I also step away.
Matt: The Spireling's not even in view at this point. He's disappeared amongst the rest of them.
Marisha: I'm sure he can hear me.
Matt: Possibly. As you guys exit and find your way back up to the surface, as the last of you makes it outside of the entranceway, you immediately start hearing this slamming and breaking of stone from underneath you, and you gather pretty rapidly that this entrance is being entirely removed for possible entry.
Taliesin: I would like to point out, since you had such noble intentions towards my position on things, this is your ego at work here. I may be many things, and I may be a deal-maker, but I never forget that when I rule, I rule these people, as well. I'm not better than them. And you may think you're better than them, but this is what it creates. It creates enemies.
Marisha: No, Percy. The difference is, I don't think I'm better than them.
Taliesin: They certainly think you do, and they are not pleased.
Laura: This mark. Is it magic? Can they trace you through this mark?
Liam: I don't answer. I walk over to Keyleth. Can you still do the thing with your hands?
Marisha: (fire noise) That thing?
Liam: I rip my shirt down. I want you to burn it away. Now.
Marisha: Vex, do you have an arrow?
Laura: Of course.
Marisha: I hand it to him. Put this in between your teeth. (sizzling noise)
Matt: (sizzling noise) Searing white pain through the back of your eyes, Vax, as Keyleth presses her palm into the center of your shoulder blades. You can hear the sizzling and cracking of skin, and smell the burning of Vax's flesh in the air in this cellar. Make a constitution check.
Liam: Seven.
Matt: Seven. You break through the arrow with your grip, and actually give out a very loud, painful scream out of reaction.
Liam: Like you do.
Laura: Similar to when you hit me in my arm.
Matt: Kind of. A moment passes. Keyleth, you pull your hand back, and where the Clasp symbol once was, there is a hand mark burned into the back of the shoulders.
Travis: Vecna. (laughter)
Liam: It was you.
Travis: Kill her now!
Matt: What would you guys like to do?
Sam: Well, that was a bust.
Taliesin: That could have gone so much better.
Travis: Vax, I think you made the right call, and I don't think very often.
Sam: Or very well.
Travis: Yeah.
Liam: Thank you, Grog.
Taliesin: I think we could have gotten out of there with at least the hintings of an alliance, as opposed to just--
Laura: Straight up--
Taliesin: Bitter enemies. This was a disaster.
Travis: Sometimes you have to walk away from a bad deal to find a good one.
Sam: That's not a thing.
Taliesin: That's not a thing. Where did-- you didn't read that--
Marisha: I got what you were saying, Grog.
Travis: When it rains, the sun is shining.
Laura: That's deep, Grog. I like it.
Travis: Stew on that.
Laura: I cast Cure Wounds on--
Liam: No!
Laura: I already did it. Too late! I fucking touched you, fucker.
Liam: Does that take the scar?
Laura: It just takes the pain away.
Matt: Cure Wounds? What it does is prevents infection. It does heal you for the hit points you would have lost for that. I'll say it nullifies the damage you would have taken from the burn mark. It does not alleviate you from the scarring. It's not as graphic as it would have been, had it been left to heal on its own, but it does muddle the Clasp symbol somewhat.
Liam: Okay. Thank you.
Sam: Shall we go back to our keep?
Travis: We could just kill them all now.
Liam: There's hundreds of them, Grog.
Taliesin: (splutters) No, we can't.
Travis: I saw, like, 40 or 50.
Liam: Yeah, there were another 160 in the rafters.
Taliesin: It would do no good. Who would be bringing food into the city in the first place?
Liam: They're going to go on doing the same thing they would have done with us or without us.
Taliesin: They're doing it without us, though.
Marisha: But Percy, do you honestly think that after all of this was done-- do you want to be beholden to those people?
Liam: And I don't believe they are going to bend the knee to Thordak. I don't believe it.
Taliesin: They're not going to, no. Of course not.
Liam: And that was all I, personally, was worried about.
Taliesin: I wanted people on the inside keeping us informed, and we just lost a very powerful spy network.
Liam: I think the only people on the inside right now have scales.
Taliesin: Everybody needs something.
Laura: Can we go back to the keep?
Taliesin: We are not going to bother. We're going to go and we're going to find a way of killing these things, and we're going to hope for the best in this city. That's what we're going to do.
Matt: As you guys are heading back, I need stealth checks from everybody.
Laura: Stealth check. Pass Without a Trace.
Marisha: Fuck! Natural one.
Taliesin: Oh my god, really?
Marisha: Natural one.
Laura: Then what's the point of anybody rolling?
Liam: 27.
Sam: 19.
Laura: 37.
Travis: 29.
Taliesin: We have a plus ten? 33.
Matt: All right. You guys push southward through the city, finding your way. At this point, the sun has set. Night has come in, and occasionally you hear the flapping of leathery wings overhead as a number of sentry groups of wyvern riders go tearing through the city. At one point, you hear a similar (raspy cry) sound, and you hear other ones begin rising up off the rooftops, heading in your direction, Keyleth. What do you guys do?
Taliesin: The minute we see that, I'm going to push her against the wall, and I'm going to Minor Illusion a shadow right over her.
Matt: Okay. Make a new stealth check with disadvantage.
Laura: Add ten.
Matt: (chuckles) It's a natural one on their end.
Marisha: Oh, good.
Matt: As long as you didn't roll a natural one.
Marisha: No, I didn't, I rolled an eight, plus a seven, plus ten.
Matt: So, at that point, they (whoosh), one swoops down and lands on the edge of the roof, and you see it curling down. And takes off again, and they continue on, out of the way. You wait a few moments before silence takes the night once more, and you press on heading southward. (laughter)
Laura: Nice.
Sam: Good job, Percy.
Marisha: Thank you, Percy.
Taliesin: One day you're going to stop being afraid of me, by the way, and I hope that day comes soon.
Sam: Before we go to the keep, do you want to swing by the place?
Taliesin: The place?
Sam: The place with the airships.
Taliesin: There's no "swinging by," that's a caper. That's an entire thing, that if we're going to do--
Sam: Just to go there and look?
Travis: The showroom is fucked. It's broken.
Taliesin: This is one of those things that we're going to have to get everybody on board before we even start talking about it, so probably a good night's sleep.
Sam: All right.
Laura: We need to sleep. We need to get up in the morning--
Taliesin: And then we'll talk about an airship. I'm really on board with the airship.
Sam: All right.
Laura: I think we need to go to Vasselheim or Whitestone.
Travis: Vasselheim.
Liam: We don't need an airship to do that.
Laura: No, we don't. But we also need to find out what's happening with Allura in Whiterun. Westruun. All those cities.
Sam: All right. Back to the keep then, I guess. When we get there can we check in on Gilmore and the queen?
Matt: Yes. And as you return to the keep, Pike has been taking care of the rest of the individuals, and she's been seeing to Gilmore's side. Gilmore is fast asleep, dealing with the tail end of a fever that has broken, after the healing from the day before. Earlier in the day, I should say. It also appears that Salda and the children have been in and out, keeping an eye as well. Pike, as you enter, looks up to you with a smile, and says, "He'll be all right. He's going to pull through."
Laura: That's wonderful.
Matt: "I should probably stay with him for a bit. Make sure he's okay."
Liam: Is he unconscious still, or just sleeping?
Matt: He is asleep, currently, yeah. "He's been conscious throughout the day while you were gone, but he's got to rest a bit more. He's still had a rough few days."
Travis: It's dead on.
Taliesin: Just needs headphones.
Matt: I just need headphones, and to brush against the mic occasionally. Especially during really really impactful story moments.
Liam: "What? What?"
Matt: So you guys find yourselves resting for the evening. You take to a night's sleep.
Laura: You going to sleep, Grog?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: Yeah, you got to sleep.
Travis: I got to sleep.
Matt: If you don't sleep you're going to start getting levels of exhaustion for the next day.
Travis: Oh. Okay.
Matt: All right. So you lose the strength bonus. Everyone, you can get half of your hit dice back.
Travis: That's a lot of--
Liam: As the sun goes down? It's been down and everyone's going to their rooms? I go to Keyleth's door and knock on it.
Matt: Keyleth.
Marisha: I open the door. Hi.
Liam: Hi. I don't want to be alone tonight. Do you?
Marisha: I haven't been wanting to be alone most nights. And I let him in.
Matt: Okay. So, we--
Laura: Bow-chicka-wow-wow!
Matt: Jump forward to the next morning--
Taliesin: That wasn't the kind of ship I was hoping to get. (laughter)
Taliesin: I don't think we can all fit on that ship.
Matt: So, next morning, you all wake up; full hit points, get back half of your max hit dice that you spent. All your spells back.
Laura: I give Scanlan the Hat of Disguise back.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: You sure you don't need it?
Laura: Yeah, fuck 'em.
Sam: All right. Keep up those rhymes. Not bad for a first timer. (laughter)
Matt: All right, so. What's the plan?
Sam: You know, Vex, I don't want to be alone right now. (laughter)
Laura: I take his face and I push him down on the ground.
Matt: All right. What's the plan?
Marisha: I don't know.
Laura: Do we have a plan?
Taliesin: I suppose our plan is the Slayer's Take next?
Travis: Yeah, Vasselheim.
Sam: How do we get there? Wait, we have to get rid of all the 'fugees.
Laura: Yeah. We need to go to Whitestone, then.
Taliesin: Well, here's the question is do we want to head towards Vasselheim from Whitestone?
Laura: Yeah, let's do that.
Taliesin: So we'll all go. We'll take the last of the-- I can't believe I'm going to say this-- the last of the 'fugees.
Sam: Yes. Ooh, la la la.
Laura: Wait. All of our guards, and our servants, as well. I don't want to leave everyone here.
Sam: We're abandoning the keep?
Laura: I don't know what else to do. If dragons attack, our five guards aren't going to be able to do anything.
Liam: One dragon crashed in the roof of the building.
Taliesin: Accidentally smushed.
Liam: What are the cook and the maid going to do?
Taliesin: Make it breakfast.
Liam: Jarett's pretty badass, but I don't think he can handle that.
Travis: Dragons get hungry.
Sam: When we come back, our keep will be gone.
Taliesin: And we'll be able to build it back up.
Marisha: It'll match the rest of the city, Scanlan.
Liam: Percival's the lord of Whitestone. He's got a castle!
Laura: We find a new keep.
Sam: But my room is just the way I want it.
Taliesin: I'm sure that some lucky dragon's going to come and shit in your bed. It'll be fine.
Sam: All right, if we're going to leave the keep, I'll need a moment in my room.
Liam: You'll find another room bathed in self-loathing. (laughter)
Liam: It doesn't need to be here.
Taliesin: It takes a good month to bathe a room in that much self-loathing.
Sam: You look like you're glowing this morning.
Liam: That's ridiculous.
Sam: I've never seen you quite so chipper.
Taliesin: Let's gather what we need, make sure that Gilmore is ready to move, as well. We'll bring everybody through to Whitestone.
Sam: All right.
Matt: All right.
Laura: I guess we should go tell the guards that they probably will have to leave, if they want.
Taliesin: And that they can come work in Whitestone.
Laura: Well, I don't want to force them to, but of course they're welcome to.
Liam: Why don't you go ask the guards? I'll go talk to the kitchen staff.
Laura: All right.
Travis: I know who she's going to talk to.
Laura: He's the captain of the guards, anyway.
Matt: We'll say for the sake of brevity, you speak with the rest of the keep's staff, including the guards as well. Jarett for the most part is like, "As long as I'm still getting paid, we're more than happy to go where you need us to be. If it's further away from dragons, I am okay with that."
Sam: Don't you need your tools?
Taliesin: I can pack up my kit, and I've also technically got a reasonable workshop back in Whitestone.
Matt: Okay, so you gather your materials, you prepare at the tree in the center of the keep, you say your goodbyes--
Sam: Before we go out there, I go to my room, I take a dump on my bed--
Matt: You've used it at the temple of Sarenrae--
Sam: No, it's not a potion. Just a straight-up poo.
Matt: Just a straight-up poo? Okay. Marking your territory. I respect that.
Sam: I hang a note on the gate of the keep.
Travis: Shitting on your own bed?
Sam: I don't want anyone else to use it. And with a butter knife, I put a note on the gate to the keep that says, "If Kaylie comes, go to Whitestone. P.S. If my painting is delivered, please forward to Scanlan Shorthalt, care of Whitestone."
Matt: All righty.
Travis: "Mind the poo."
Laura: I leave a note for Allura, and tell her we've headed to Whitestone, as well.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: I don't say Whitestone. I say, "the place where we sent you originally," so she knows where it is.
Matt: Okay. Notes are placed. Spell is prepared?
Taliesin: I've packed everything that could possibly be used to make anything dangerous.
Matt: Okay. You have your supplies at the ready. You all gather in the center of the temple of Sarenrae. Keyleth?
Laura: Not yet, Keyleth!
Taliesin: We'll be back.
Marisha: What's wrong? Are you ready, Vex?
Laura: I mean, it's the first time we've had a home in forever, and we're leaving it.
Sam: Can you make it disappear, or something?
Laura: We can go. It's nothing.
Marisha: I can put Hallucinatory Terrain over it, that'll last a bit, but not long enough to make it worthwhile.
Laura: It's just stone.
Liam: We've done it once before. We can do it again.
Taliesin: It will be built back better than before. That's what we do.
Laura: Let's go.
Matt: The portal opens outside of the tree, and all of the refugees start rushing through. You guys give chase, following over to the opposite side, where Whitestone waits. You all emerge from the Sun Tree in the center of the familiar town.
Liam: Fucking cold!
Matt: It is chilly. Not as snow-dappled as it was when you first arrived. A little has melted, and the clouds are a little bit more open; you can see some of the blue sky above you. It's actually a beautiful day, if a bit chilly. As you emerge, you can see there's a few individuals in the center of the town, including a couple of the original refugees that seem to be waiting for the rest to come through. They greet you as soon as you arrive, and rush up and grab a couple of people that they had met at your keep. Some come forward and say, "Thank you. I'm so glad you made it!" They shake your hands. You've arrived back in Whitestone. So, do you guys want to wait here for the day, and then make your way to Vasselheim?
Sam: Do we need to talk to anybody here?
Taliesin: Just to set up to make sure that the queen and her children are taken in at the castle.
Liam: I imagine you'll fill your sister in.
Taliesin: I will. I'll fill my sister in on how they're to be taken care of. Make sure that Gilmore is taken care of.
Sam: We may want to stock up on potions and stuff before we leave.
Laura: Yeah, buy as much as we can.
Taliesin: There's a shop.
Matt: There is, but you guys have cleaned it out.
Laura: Buy stuff in Vasselheim.
Matt: They have not had an opportunity to restock. Their main providers have been killed.
Liam: Do you think that with the time that's passed, Cassandra has found any of the belongings of the Briarwoods? They were pretty snazzy.
Taliesin: We can ask about that.
Matt: You approach Cassandra, who is happy to greet you once you return. "Did you have a question?"
Taliesin: Vax?
Liam: We need to kill some dragons, and we are out of everything. You've been here a while. Have you found anything of the Briarwoods? Any store of treasure or potion or anything of use?
Matt: "Well, the personal effects you all retrieved when they were defeated. What remnants of income or gold which they'd kept was put in with the rest of the Whitestone treasury when they took over."
Liam: Not so much interested in gold as in means of protection or healing.
Matt: "They weren't really specialized in healing, I'm afraid, and what bits of protection they had, you've already taken. But if gold is what you need, we can probably spare you some."
Laura: I mean, I'm not going to say no to the gold.
Taliesin: Obviously, we'll sieve the coffer a little bit because we're going to need it for the mission.
Laura: So very generous of you.
Taliesin: Also, let's re-employ our castle guards as the Emon royal guards in the meantime, and they can serve the queen and her children.
Laura: I like it.
Matt: "That can be very easily presented. Oh, here we are!" There's a small chest with a lid that she hands it over to you. Actually, puts it out and your hands are already out. "All right. 2,000 gold from our coffers. It's not much, but we have to keep the city running."
Laura: Of course.
Taliesin: And a small amount of the green gem, if that would be possible, that's left over from the mining operation.
Matt: "Of the glass?"
Taliesin: Of the glass. If possible.
Matt: "Yes, certainly."
Taliesin: Thank you. I'm working on something.
Matt: "Very well." It takes a few minutes for that to be retrieved from down south of the tomb in the mausoleum, but nevertheless, you get four half-dollar-sized pieces of residuum glass.
Taliesin: Perfect.
Matt: Four shards of residuum glass. "I hope that's of aid to you. Apology for the confusion. We have quite a bit of individuals to find homes for, and get them running."
Taliesin: Gilmore will be of great help.
Matt: "Yes, as you've told me."
Taliesin: (laughs) I'm sorry to drop this all on you, and I'm thankful.
Matt: "I'm thankful that we even have an opportunity to offer aid to somebody. That's thanks to you, so it's nothing on us."
Taliesin: It will not be the end of it, sadly.
Matt: "That's all right. Whatever we can do. Anyway, good luck."
Taliesin: I'll be off in the morning.
Sam: How are we getting to Vasselheim?
Taliesin: We can teleport.
Laura: Yeah, teleport, right?
Sam: Is that true?
Laura: Just pop on over, yeah. We sleep for the night, and then we go over to Vasselheim the next day.
Liam: Let's have dinner.
Laura: Hang out in Whitestone for the day.
Taliesin: I'm going to work on that little project.
Liam: Whitestone and chill.
Taliesin: The thing I was trying to attach to my gun but wasn't working, I'm going to try to attach it to my boot instead.
Matt: Interesting.
Taliesin: I can draw you a sketch.
Matt: All right. While the rest of you guys are attempting to rest, I need you to make a tinker tools check.
Liam: Tinker tools. This goes in here.
Taliesin: That's better. 22.
Matt: 22. You've affixed it to your boot. We'll see if it works.
Taliesin: And I've got one working piece? I know each individual build, I have to build the--
Sam: The nubbin.
Taliesin: The actual device itself has to be built for individual usage; it's not auto. I'm going to try and build one and see how it goes.
Matt: Okay. So total cost for the materials on that will put you at about 300 gold.
Laura: What?
Sam: 300 gold.
Taliesin: I'm working on something.
Laura: Okay.
Taliesin: Thank you.
Laura: I mean, it's your city.
Liam: Are you borrowing 300 of your gold from the money you loaned to Vex?
Taliesin: Since the day I've met her, I've given her every bloody dime I've made. So, yes. I no longer even think about it anymore.
Laura: And I love you for it.
Taliesin: She's practically the royal treasurer. She's just happier that way.
Marisha: (laughing) "She's just happier that way."
Matt: All right. You find an evening's rest. The next morning comes uneventfully. You find yourselves refreshed. I'd say at this point, you're all at full hit dice after two nights of rest; you're fine. So, on to Whitestone, Keyleth?
Laura: Vasselheim?
Travis: Vasselheim?
Matt: Sorry. You're in Whitestone.
Liam: We were just here!
Matt: You recall you've seen a number of trees. The largest you've seen in Vasselheim would probably have been on the outskirts of--
Liam: Where we fought the hydra, maybe.
Marisha: We camped out in a few trees outside of Vasselheim.
Matt: Do you want to stop outside the city or within the city, is the question.
Marisha: Whatever's closest.
Travis: No. No magic in the city.
Laura: No magic in the city, remember?
Matt: No arcane magic. Divine magic is a different thing. There's plenty of divine magic within the city.
Laura: Oh, is there a teleportation circle? Do we have one in Whitestone?
Marisha: There wasn't a teleportation circle to Vasselheim.
Matt: There are no sigils to Vasselheim. Part of their defense process is preventing any secret intrusion in that regard.
Taliesin: We'll teleport to the outside of the city and perhaps sleep at the temple of Sarenrae.
Matt: There's the Abundant Terrace.
Laura: We always have rooms at Slayer's Take, remember.
Taliesin: We do always have rooms at Slayer's Take.
Marisha: What's the Abundant Terrace?
Matt: That's the section that Melora looks over. That is where primarily most of the farming, food--
Marisha: Yeah, let's go there.
Matt: That's where you know there are a number of orchards and things that are kept in that vicinity. If you wanted to.
Marisha: That's right outside the city?
Matt: It's within the city. It's one of the five quarters. I won't say quarters. It's one of the five areas.
Marisha: Sure.
Matt: Quarters.
Laura: Is Gilmore staying here in Whitestone? Yes?
Matt: Yeah, unless you want to try and bring him with you.
Laura: No, it makes sense to leave him here, right? Where do you want to stay, Gilmore?
Matt: (laughs) You're approaching Gilmore. He goes, "To be perfectly honest, I'm not quite feeling 100%, and let's just say I'm not a huge fan of the zealot type."
Laura: Understandable.
Matt: "Vasselheim doesn't really jangle my dingles."
Laura: You've got a whole bookstore devoted to you here.
Matt: "This is true."
Taliesin: I would appreciate your help in restarting the economy of Whitestone, to be fair.
Matt: "Well. (sighs) Guess it's not too late to open a new branch of Gilmore's Glorious Goods, since my other, possibly, two no longer exist. (sighs) I was so close to opening. I started from nothing! I can do it again. (coughs) Good luck, you all."
Taliesin: You as well.
Sam: So we're going to a tree outside of the city?
Travis: Yep.
Marisha: Well, it's in the farming district in the city.
Matt: It's in the actual city.
Laura: All right, cool.
Matt: All right. Using this once again off the Sun Tree, you guys step through. As you emerge out the other side, you are in the thick of a heavy orchard in the Abundant Terrace. There is heavy snowfall that has fallen recently here, and where it was cold in Whitestone, it's cold here in Vasselheim. You can see built-up ice and sleet that has recently been pushed off to the sides of the orchard. Even amongst this very cold weather, all of the plant life in this area is vibrant and springtime green. As you all emerge in the center of this orchard, you can see one of the nearby workers who's tilling the land looks over. "Hey! What are you doing here? You're not supposed to be in the middle of the orchard!"
Laura: Slayer's Take business. We'll keep moving.
Taliesin: We were just leaving.
Matt: (groans) "Fucking Slayer's Take. Do whatever the fuck they want." He drinks out of his canteen. "Fine! Just get out."
Liam: Glad that manticore's not in your orchard. That's all I can say.
Matt: "Manticore?"
Taliesin: That's just cruel.
Laura: Don't worry. We took care of it.
Matt: (weakly) "Thanks." He starts looking nervously over his shoulders as he goes back to his work. Eventually, you guys step outside of the Terrace, finding your way to the Quadroads, which is the central network that the four main portions of Vasselheim attach to. This is the Erathis-based center of the town. You have before you, to remind you, at the very northern part of the town is the extremely tall, pointed mountain known as Heaven's Stair. Attached to that mountain on one side is the Silver Talon's Reach. That is the main temple to Bahamut. To the left of it, against the mountain, not actually into it, is the Braving Grounds. This is the area that is geared towards Kord, the deity of war, where you had previously had a conversation with the Dawn Master, the Earthbreaker Groon. There's the Platinum Sanctuary in the Silver Talon's Reach, which is where the Highbearer Vord, the Silver-Touched, the high priest of Bahamut is. You also just left the Abundant Terrace, and there is the Quadroads, which is where the Slayer's Take currently is. And there is the Duskmeadow, which is the Raven Queen's domain. Where do you guys want to go?
Liam: Remind me, what was the Duskmeadow, again? Was that where we chased the rakshasa?
Matt: That is where the Amaranthine Oubliette resides, which is the prison of the city.
Marisha: What was the name of the section of the city that has the Slayer's Take?
Matt: That's the Quadroads, the Erathis, deity of civilization.
Travis: So, like, I really want to go talk to the Kung Fu Panda master. I don't think we're going to get a lot of fights in. The guy, I think he was the teacher of Kern. The guy I beat in the crucible.
Liam: That ripped, chiseled old man?
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: The guy who beat you twice?
Liam: No.
Laura: No.
Travis: No.
Travis: And nobody beat me twice. He got lucky once, get it straight. I want to go talk to him because maybe we need some more fighters and strong folks and I think he might know where they might be.
Sam: We should talk to the Slayer's Take, as well.
Taliesin: We should get our rooms.
Laura: Yeah, let's go post up.
Taliesin: We have things to put down.
Marisha: And also only about a day's travel from Pyrah.
Sam: What's that? Pyrah?
Laura: Her home.
Sam: Oh.
Taliesin: What's left of it. That will be a trip that will be necessary soon, but not yet.
Matt: You guys hit the Slayer's Take first, or where are you heading?
Laura: Slayer's Take.
Travis: Slayer's Take.
Laura: Just to let them know we're here and we need some rooms.
Matt: Okay. You make your way to the outside of the main Slayer's Take guildhall. The dark wood exterior greets you happily. You can see they still have a gathering of various antlers of creatures that are tangled into each other that form this rustic-looking entrance. And there on the front doors, you see emblazoned the Slayer's Take-- for lack of a better term, their symbol with the words of their actual guild spread across it, as you saw before. Opening the front door, you can see within the main foyer area, there is the dark iron chandeliers that run across the entire length of the moot hall, if you will. Across the front area, you find the clerk desk. Sitting behind it, a familiar red-haired, tousled, chin-bearded, scarred-up tiny man with his feet up on the desk, falling asleep in his chair.
Laura: (laughs) Oi!
Liam: Ta-da!
Matt: "What is this craziness? (laughs) Ah! It's been some time."
Laura: It has.
Matt: "So. Hello."
Laura: Hi.
Matt: "What's your business? What are you looking for?"
Laura: Dragons? Have you heard about anything?
Matt: "Other than the fact that you killed one. That is the most recent, but nothing beyond that, really, no."
Laura: We're going to need rooms.
Liam: And we're probably going to need to speak to your lady lord.
Laura: Your wife.
Liam: Well, your wife, but I'm talking about the boss, here.
Laura: That's his wife.
Liam: Higher still  the sphinx.
Laura: Oh.
Matt: "Vanessa, she's currently out on a hunt. Should be back in the next day or so."
Liam: We've urgent business to discuss with her. For now, we need a place to stay.
Matt: "Well, you're always welcome here. This is your home away from home, so please, take a load off. Pick a room. It's up to you. It's good to see you all so healthy!"
Laura: Healthy.
Sam: Thank you, Mertin. Right?
Matt: "Yes. So glad to hear."
Liam: The only reason I remember that is it sounds like merkin.
Laura: Is Zahra around?
Matt: "She's actually currently out with Vanessa on a hunt, as we speak."
Laura: That's wonderful.
Sam: Perhaps we could see her.
Liam: Sorry, we're tired. We've been hopping all over.
Matt: "Me, too. I was sleeping when you came in. I don't mind if I get back to that."
Liam: Sorry. Any room?
Matt: "If it's somebody else's room, they'll let you know, so please, take your time."
Laura: Well, settle in?
Taliesin: I'm settling in.
Marisha: Yeah, I guess we all settle in.
Matt: There's a number of empty rooms. Doesn't look like there's a lot of individuals around. As you walk down one of the hallways, though, you do see there is a card table, and the two individuals in there, you see a very scarred, burly, and frustrated dwarf who's throwing down cards on a table. Black, long series of beards, and his hair over his beard. You see Thorbir is sitting there at the card table with another man wearing really beautiful, ornate armor that is well-polished; very short, dirty blond hair, who is apparently owning him at cards, going, (chuckles) "You've terrible luck, friend. I'm sorry to hear this."
Laura: (whispering) Aldor.
Matt: It's Aldor.
Taliesin: Whoa!
Matt: Thorbir's sitting there, and throws his cards on the table. (scoffs, sighs) "They tell me I'm supposed to have the luck of the dwarves." (laughter)
Matt: "Oh. I guess it's about time you all showed up. I'm going to get a drink." And he gets up, away from the table, and walks away from the rest of you, with a half-hearted "hi," but he's in a huffy mood and walks off. Aldor takes his winnings and scoops the change into a pouch.
Liam: Aldor, Aldor, Aldor.
Sam: How's Lyra? Have you seen her? (laughter)
Matt: "Why? Have you seen her?"
Sam: Not in a while, but we thought you guys were engaged to be married. No?
Taliesin: That's the last we heard.
Matt: He reaches forward and grabs your shirt and pulls you in. "Where did you hear that?"
Sam: Not from a reliable source, I promise you.
Taliesin: Very sketchy source.
Matt: "Good. You haven't seen her, have you?"
Sam: Not in a long time.
Matt: "Good."
Liam: She's still a member of the Slayer's Take, of course, though. Isn't she?
Matt: "I assume. I just run if I see her. She's a bit--"
Laura: Yeah.
Sam: No! She seems nice to me.
Matt: "Good. You know what, actually, if you want to do me a favor. I mean, she's a nice girl, probably pretty easy if you ask her. Why don't you take her off my hands and go on a date? Take her out for dinner. Distract her."
Sam: You saw her first. I'm a man of honor.
Matt: "Oh. No. I should go." He grabs his stuff and leaves in a huff.
Travis: Good to see him.
Laura: Yeah.
Taliesin: He's looking well.
Sam: True love.
Marisha: It's weird being back, you guys.
Sam: Well, I guess we should ask them all if they want to come with us to fight a dragon?
Marisha: Yeah, do we do that now, or do we do that in the morning?
Travis: In the morning.
Taliesin: In the morning.
Liam: It feels like we were just running screaming from dragons in the sky.
Marisha: Yeah. We traveled.
Sam: We'll sleep on it. We'll talk to Nessa in the morning.
Liam: We'll get up in the morning, we'll take some of that gold, we'll put it to good use, we'll wait until Nessa gets back, and then we'll carve out a plan.
Sam: Okay.
Liam: Percival?
Taliesin: That sounds just fine.
Sam: Kord's strength to us all.
Travis: Yeah!
Laura: I wonder if Kashaw is still here.
Liam: Probably, he works here.
Marisha: Who?
Sam: Kashaw. That was the one that they went on a--
Laura: Oh! Right, Keyleth? The guy that kissed you.
Marisha: (stammers)
Taliesin: Brooding. Handsome. He was so troubled.
Liam: He was.
Laura: He was very handsome.
Marisha: So we should probably go to sleep, you guys.
Laura: It's morning, still.
Matt: Yeah, it's maybe 10 00am.
Marisha: Take a nap?
Matt: It's across the world, so it's technically earlier.
Marisha: You know, it's jet lag. It's teleport lag. It gets to you.
Laura: Maybe Nessa and Zahra have seen him. We could find out. We could use another healer, always.
Matt: It would be 10 00, 10 30 in Whitestone. About 6:30, 7:00 in the morning in Vasselheim.
Laura: Pike, speaking of clerics, do you want to check in with your temple?
Matt: Pike has actually stayed back in Whitestone to help the refugees.
Travis: Yep.
Laura: Oh. She didn't even come to Vasselheim?
Matt: No, but she did say that she's going to keep an eye, best she can, through Sarenrae. When she can pop in, she'll try and see if she can project her form, going forward.
Liam: She's led by her conscience.
Matt: She's led by her schedule in New York. (laughs)
Taliesin: We didn't think to leave her a stone, did we?
Matt: If you'd like to, you could have.
Sam: Would we have done that?
Taliesin: I would have definitely suggested leaving her with one of the stones.
Laura: Yeah, we probably should leave the stone with her so she can pop in with us.
Matt: Okay. We'll say that she does that. She keeps a gatestone with her, just in case.
Travis: Trinket stays in Emon, right?
Laura: Shut up!
Taliesin: Trinket's going to guard the castle.
Laura: Trinket is right here, right now! He has been quiet, because he's really well-behaved.
Matt: Trinket's been practicing his stealth. (bear grunts)
Laura: So stealthy, darling.
Matt: All right, so you've set up your rooms, your stuff about you. You have a full day before seemingly anyone from the Slayer's Take is going to come back. Where do you want to head?
Taliesin: Individual?
Travis: Individuals? Yeah.
Liam: Oh, shit, can we buy potions in this city?
Taliesin: I don't know.
Liam: Shit! You can't, can you?
Laura: I'm afraid to start anything. It's 11 00.
Marisha: I know, it's late.
Matt: All right. Then we will end it there this evening. I just wanted to get an idea of where you guys were going for next week.
Laura: Oh, okay.
Travis: I plan to go see Earthbreaker Groon.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: I want to wait and talk to Zahra.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: I may want to have a conversation at the temple of the Raven Queen.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Zahra sounds fun.
Laura: Right? But I do want to buy potions, as well, and stock up.
Taliesin: Yeah, that, too.
Liam: Nothing. I'd probably tag along with Percival.
Laura: What?
Travis: Old punchy man? You don't want to come with?
Sam: Oh. Yeah, I'll come watch you if you're going to have a fight.
Travis: No, I'm going to have a conversation.
Liam: You're right. I do want to see Old Punchy Man.
Taliesin: We can do both.
Travis: Some hand-to-hand?
Sam: Watch you lose again.
Travis: I'm not fighting him!
Matt: All right, so Vax and Scanlan are going with Grog to the Trial Forge.
Laura: I'm going to stock up on a bunch of stuff.
Matt: Okay. We'll do some shopping.
Taliesin: I'm going to go to the temple of the Raven Queen. I also want to talk to our mapmaker friend.
Matt: So you're going to the Raven's Crest. Got it.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: All right, cool. We'll pick it up next week at that point, guys. Awesome. Well done, guys!
Travis: We abandoned Greyskull Keep.
Marisha: Yeah, we did.
Laura: Yeah, we did, and it's sad.
Marisha: It's very sad. We abandoned Emon.
Matt: Damn.
Laura: We can't help it from there. We have to go somewhere else in order to come back to it.
Liam: Greyskull Keep is going to be an ancient dragon's kitty litter box.
Travis: I'm allergic to cats.
Marisha: If you love it, you have to--
Marisha: Let it go.
Laura: Let it go.
Liam: Like our first hometown, or our elven town?
Laura: Don't say that.
Taliesin: I was going to say, do you know who says, "if you love it, you have to let it go?" The one who got dumped, that's who! Sorry.
Matt: That's horrible.
Taliesin: Yeah, you are. I'm a terrible person.
Matt: Well, guys. Thank you so much for watching. We'll pick this up next Thursday. Those we'll see tomorrow in Colorado, looking forward to it, and tomorrow, look for my next episode of GM Tips. That'll be fun, and is it Thursday yet?
Taliesin: See you in Arizona!

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons & Dragons. Hate you, Liam. (laughter)
Travis: That was good! Really nice. Some good flavor on it.
Matt: You'll never know. So anyway! Welcome new folks. People who aren't new folks, welcome back. We have some announcements to get to real fast, then we'll jump into the actual story proper here. But, yeah! So, first and foremost, I wanted to give a big thanks and shout-out to Syrinscape, I mentioned them in last week's game, I put together my gaming playlists on their platform, and I'm going to be trying them out tonight to make sure everything works out cool, but their setup is fantastic and I'm really excited about being able to overlap audio, and things fade in and out. If you haven't checked it out, and you want to really amp up your tabletop gaming, it's phenomenal. But they're not paying for this, I'm really excited about it. So that's that, Syrinscape's awesome. Marisha, you want to talk about Signal Boost?
Marisha: Yeah! The first epil-- episode.
Laura: Epilsode!
Marisha: The first epil, of--
Taliesin: Epilay!
Marisha: Epil, epilay, epilogue. The first episode of Signal Boost went live on Tuesday. Go check it out on GeekandSundry.com. Go watch it, it's good fun. And you should go watch it so we don't get cancelled, and we'll keep making more episodes.
Liam: Is that how it works?
Marisha: Apparently!
Matt: Yeah, it's the weirdest thing.
Marisha: It's crazy.
Laura: They care about that?
Marisha: Yeah. And I talk about Rat Queens, in it, and--
Laura: Yes! I saw! It's so good, Marisha. It's really funny.
Taliesin: It's like ten minutes of your-- you have more minutes than two minutes, spend a couple of minutes.
Marisha: And I tell you about cool things that I like. That I picked out myself. My favorite things. Done.
Matt: Watch it. It's good. All right. Next thing I wanted to announce for you guys, tonight's donations, and all donations for the week, are going to be going, as opposed to 826 overall, are going to go to 826Seattle specifically, to Fearless Ideas, is what it's called there, their section up there, you can go to FearlessIdeas.org. This past week there was a terrible gas explosion in Seattle, you may have seen on the news, and it did a lot of damage to that vicinity, including Fearless Ideas, and they've had to cancel a bunch of their stuff, and they're trying to get things repaired and going. So all of our donations this evening will be going towards them and helping them get that effort taken care of. So think good thoughts and help out if you can. Let's see.
Travis: Love you, Seattle!
Marisha: Love you, Seattle!
Matt: 826. We've, next Friday, in Anaheim, at WonderCon, Friday night, we'll be doing a Critical Role panel, from 7:00 to 8:00pm, in Room 515A.
Laura: Wait, are we supposed to be at that?
Matt: Next Friday. Next Friday. But most of us will be there for that panel. We'll be doing a Q&A, answering questions, talking about the show, for all the folks that are local or coming to that convention in the Anaheim area of southern California. So, look forward to seeing you there, next Friday.
Laura: Yes, that's when we-- I can't say. I'll talk to you guys afterwards.
Matt: (laughs) Okay. We'll go over that. Mystery-- secret, I like it.
Laura: Secret, secret.
Matt: Wanted to give another shout-out to Dwarven Forge again, I mentioned them last week. You got to get a glimpse of some of the map stuff they gave us here at Critical Role to help improve our battle mats and scenarios on occasion. Their new Castle Builder Kickstarter is phenomenal, and if you're looking to do big structures and cool castle-based ramparts and parapets and everything, go check it out, it might be right up your alley.
Travis: So pretty.
Matt: So pretty. It's so pretty. Also, Laura, if you want to announce, we have some new merch up in the store!
Laura: Go check GeekandSundry.com, go to their store, right now, because they're up, and it's so awesome, and I can't wait for you guys to see, we have a Gilmore's Glorious Goods t-shirt. (cheering)
Laura: And I've been so excited about this shirt coming out, I can't wait to wear it, why aren't we wearing it right now?
Matt: (Gilmore voice) "Don't worry. Trust me, it's a fabulous shirt. Some would even say it's quite glorious."
Travis: Oh my god, oh my god.
Laura: As well as the Gilmore's Glorious Goods t-shirts, we also have exclusive Critical Role d20 rings, spinny rings. Those are limited, so if you get them, then snag them fast, because they're going to be gone.
Travis: We get one of those before they disappear, right?
Laura: I think they said they were going to set us aside some, they'd better.
Travis: They are. They're bitchin'. You spin it, the 20 is the Critical Role logo.
Laura: Why don't we have them right now?! At intermission, maybe we can grab them at intermission.
Travis: They're sick.
Matt: For those who don't know what those are, the d20 spin rings, or spin rings in general, they're actually two separate moving pieces with ball bearings on the inside, and you have all numbers one through 20 on the actual ring, and you can spin it with your finger, and it acts like a die roll!
Laura: And the d20, when you crit succeed, it's a Critical Role logo. Just putting that out there.
Travis: You can do all your life decisions based off a ring.
Matt: What could possibly go wrong?
Liam: You still can die from them, though, just to be clear.
Taliesin: Roll a one.
Marisha: And we are not held responsible if that happens.
Travis: You go straight to Craven Edge.
Liam: It's appropriately called a "die."
Laura: Whatever.
Matt: Liam!
Liam: Yeah?
Matt: You wanted to--
Liam: Sure, I could talk about a couple of things. Hey, a quick shout-out for our neighbor, Ivan van Norman's Kickstarter, The ABCs of RPGs, has three days left. I backed it immediately, because I like D&D and I have kids, and you put those two things together and good things happen. So that's good, three days left. Also, hey, if you like to put your dice in boxes, I tell you what. Wyrmwood Gaming make beautiful boxes, and if you go over to their site and you use the code critrole.
All: Crit. Role.
Liam: There it is. You get free shipping, they're beautiful, they have all different kinds of woods to put your dice inside. Is there anything else? Oh, yeah! Oh, okay. Yeah, hey, some of us, not all of us, are going to be going up to San Fran later this month to make appearances on GameSpot's show The Lobby for a couple of segments, and then, also then hopping over to hang with the guys at Kinda Funny to play D&D.
Laura: Those guys are stupid.
Matt: Which, a few of us will be running a quick little one-shot game I'll be running with the aid of one of their local gentlemen. And it should be a ridiculously ridiculous time! And it'll be a lot of fun.
Liam: And I'm curious to see, because there's going to be two DMs, in sort of a Batman and Robin-type relationship kind of thing?
Matt: Oh yeah. We got plans. I've co-DM'd before, it can be very interesting. And very chaotic. I'm excited.
Travis: Going to kill everybody.
Matt: Probably.
Laura: This has nothing to do with announcements, but I want to only roll green dice tonight. For Saint Patrick's Day.
Marisha: That's a good idea, I've got a set of green dice. I'll get them out. Sure.
Travis: That's stupid. I have gray-ass dice and a blue one.
Marisha: Got to get them all out.
Matt: This is technically light green, guys, by the way, just so you're aware. Cool. Just making sure we're all cool on that.
Travis: Plus the underwear you're wearing.
Matt: Shh, that's just for you.
Liam: Travis and I are wearing green snake shirts, because (Irish accent) Saint Patrick drove the snakes out of Ireland, into Burbank.
Matt: Drove the Slytherin from Ireland. He got rid of them all.
Travis: Yeah. I took the Floo network.
Marisha: And I got this in Ireland, so it counts.
Laura: It kind of counts, Marisha.
Marisha: It counts.
Liam: (Irish accent) It's fucking Irish wool!
Marisha: And this is green.
Travis: Yeah, made from real Irish cats.
Matt: They are the best, aren't they? Last but not least, unless anyone else has any other announcements to make, anything else?
Taliesin: Oh! I got a quick one, Book of Murder came out today, so you can hear me do a very weird accent, it's great. So. Yes. Very weird accent.
Matt: And last, next week, we'll have a special guest joining us for an episode, a new guest, the intrepid Nerdist himself, Chris Hardwick, will be coming in for a game next week. (cheering)
Matt: Oh, I'm excited! We made his character this past Monday, and it should be a lot of fun. He's actually fun to game with. We've played D&D a couple times, and he'll be a good addition to the team for his brief stop by. So next week, come check him out on our show!
Travis: Uh-oh, what does that mean?
Matt: So thanks for coming, Chris. I don't know, it'll be fun.
Taliesin: Cleric, is what it means.
Matt: Hoping every guest is a cleric. Just in case.
Travis: Save us! From ourselves.
Matt: All right, then. Without further ado, unless you guys have anything else, we'll go ahead and hop into a quick synopsis of where we are in Critical Role.
Liam: Shit. Help. Help. Help. Help.
Matt: Sam will be here shortly, guys, don't freak out. He's dealing with children and traffic.
Taliesin: Not at the same time.
Marisha: Damn it, you beat me to it. I was going to say those two aren't mutually exclusive. Children and traffic.
Matt: So. Where we left off. The party of Vox Machina, having to deal with the current terrible danger of the Chroma Conclave, a collection of very dangerous dragons that have torn through the entire Tal'Dorei countryside, have then gone on this quest to collect allies, and find these items called the Vestiges of Divergence, these artifacts of ancient wars that carry great power and seem to be the best way you could prepare yourselves for going up against these terrifyingly powerful entities. In searching for this, you went and made your way to Vasselheim, where you reacquired and reestablished friendships with Zahra and Kashaw, two allies from previous instalments of our wondrous adventure, as well as getting Lady Kima on loan from the Platinum Sanctuary of Bahamut, and you all went to seek the first bit of information you discovered about one of these vestiges, not too far from Vasselheim. The champion of the Raven Queen's armor that had been entombed within this temple that had sunken beneath a lake. After traveling to this lake, finding your way through this subterranean, watery location, you found the location of the tomb, upon which, a series of fish creatures, called kuo-toa, had seemingly been worshiping another denizen of this temple, a rather strange slime-covered beholder, that then surprised the party. The battle hard-fought, you came out victorious, and upon going to retrieve your spoils, a trap was set off in the tomb, dodged by one, survived by a bear, and claimed the life of our beloved Vex'ahlia. After a resurrection ritual attempted by Kashaw, the party helping, they were successful in bringing her soul back from the other side, restoring her to life, and the party then, figuring out what their next step in their journey was, took their new allies, via Keyleth's Teleportation via Plants spell, back to Whitestone, which seems to be building as this defensive bastion, this currently not on the radar of the Conclave location that needs defenses, and a good place to keep your allies at the time. And that was where we left off, as you guys had just stepped back into Whitestone.
Laura: We haven't actually slept yet, then.
Matt: Nope!
Laura: It's late.
Marisha: What time is it here?
Matt: I'd say through the evening's travels-- Well, you guys slept all night the night before you went to the temple, the temple's probably been--
Marisha: That's true, we did sleep, actually, we camped out.
Laura: We did?
Marisha: Remember? You talked to Zahra, and I talked to Kash? Then we slept.
Matt: Yeah, you guys did camp out.
Laura: Oh. I didn't know if we camped, I thought we talked.
Matt: You talked.
Marisha: We at least chilled. I don't know.
Matt: Regardless. You found your way to Whitestone. We'll say for the sake of the current setting, you've come in in a rather overcast mid-afternoon in Whitestone, you may have spent some time there gathering yourselves as your allies scope out their new surroundings, the people of Whitestone accepting you as you arrive, you can always see people walking by and catching a glance at the group of heroes known as Vox Machina that helped liberate them from the oppressive Briarwoods not long ago.
Taliesin: Keep crawling out of trees.
Marisha: It's always weird. Not crawling out of trees, that people like us.
Travis: Should we inspect our spoils?
Taliesin: I was going to say, we should take the armor and the necklace to the castle and have it inspected.
Laura: Is Lady Allura here?
Matt: Kima, who is with you, is like, "Is she?"
Laura: No. Well, she was on her way to Westruun, and we haven't heard from her yet.
Taliesin: No.
Matt: "Haven't heard from her since-- You say Westruun was under attack as well?"
Laura: Yes, but she knew it. She was going in secret.
Matt: "That prideful woman." She slings her hammer off her shoulder and slams it to the ground and says, "Well. If she doesn't arrive in the next few hours, I'm going to gather a party and we're going to go to Westruun and find her."
Travis: Yeah!
Marisha: Kima-- Wait, what? Why?
Laura: Wait, there's a dragon there, Kima, a very large one, and she was being very, very stealthy--
Matt: Her hammer slams into her metallic armor, and she goes, "I've a much bigger dragon backing me up." And she looks up to the sky for a second and grins.
Travis: Lady Kima don't give a fuck.
Laura: We'll wait, Kima.
Matt: (frustrated sigh)
Laura: Going in loud will only cause more trouble.
Matt: "I'll wait a few days."
Laura: She should be here by then.
Marisha: I can always attempt to scry, and see if I can check in on her.
Matt: "Okay. Not a bad idea."
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: "Okay. I need a drink."
Marisha: Let's get somewhere safe.
Matt: She charges off, looking for the nearest tavern.
Marisha: Here, I guess. I don't know. I forget it's not overrun by vampires, I'm sorry. Sorry, I forgot; it's all right now.
Laura: Maybe somewhere safe, like right here--
Marisha: Like right here, sorry, there's a lot going on.
Matt: Zahra and Kashaw looking around expectantly as you continue this conversation. Kash crosses his arms, goes, "Great place. There's a lot of white." Of which Zahra comes and steps over and is like, "Don't worry, darling. (laughter) So, sleeping arrangements, I hope?"
Laura: Yes, the castle.
Taliesin: We'll be putting you up in the castle.
Matt: "That's what I like to hear. All right. To the castle, Kash?" "Sure. It's better than, well, it's better than anything. Let's go for the castle." And they both make their way towards Whitestone Castle, to find a comfortable place to get themselves situated in their new surroundings.
Laura: So we're healed up, we are healed, we are not running the risk of dying at any moment, because we've been healed.
Matt: What is that? What is that blur of green?
Travis: It's a fucking leprechaun, get it!
Sam: Sorry, sorry, sorry.
Liam: You should be.
Marisha: Your shirt, is that new? Because I love it so much.
Sam: Thanks! But I'm also wearing a tie because it's a special night.
Laura: Right. It's a special occasion.
Sam: (sighs) So, is Allura dead? (laughter)
Travis: Kima just left, so--
Laura: She's on her way to a tavern. Kima's drinking it up. Grog! Kima's drinking it up.
Marisha: Are we heading to a tavern?
Taliesin: We're heading to the castle. We're going to talk to friends, we're going to take a look at--
Travis: Corpse armor, hello.
Marisha: Oh, corpse armor.
Travis: Yeah. You know, the thing that almost killed our friend over here?
Laura: It did kill me. According to you.
Taliesin: It-- yes.
Travis: Yeah, but, I mean, you're here, so you didn't die. But you did. But you didn't. But you did. And then you didn't.
Laura: Thanks, Grog.
Travis: Yep.
Matt: All right, so. You guys all heading to the castle?
Taliesin: Yes.
Matt: You head to the castle. Cassandra isn't there at the moment, but Keeper Yennen is currently there with a few other members of the makeshift council you guys put together towards the end. One of the heads of the entire farming establishment here in Whitestone is with them, and they're having a conversation. As Zahra and Kashaw burst in first, he's like, "I'm sorry, we're not currently taking visitors, could you-- Oh. Friends of yours, I presume?"
Taliesin: Good friends.
Laura: Helpers, actually. They're going to be here for a while. Hopefully.
Matt: "Gracious. Oh, I see you yourself carry the vestments of a man of the cloth. Who brings your power this day?" Kashaw gives him a look and goes, "You don't even want to know, buddy." Walks past him.
Taliesin: That was a really good Kashaw.
Matt: "Very well! I assume they're staying here as well."
Taliesin: Yes. We appreciate it greatly.
Matt: "They'll be taken care of, Percival."
Taliesin: They will be well worth your time. We also have something that needs a bit of study. We found something. We found two objects of power that we think may help us turn the table against the dragons.
Laura: Two objects?
Matt: "This is good news."
Taliesin: Two objects.
Laura: What was the second?
Taliesin: There was a necklace.
Laura: There was?
Taliesin: There was.
Sam: You were dead.
Laura: Oh. I must have missed it because I was dead. That's right.
Matt: "Dead?!"
Taliesin: It's been a very long day.
Sam: Mostly dead.
Marisha: Be very careful when handling this armor, is what we're trying to say.
Travis: Or don't handle it, and we'll take care of it.
Matt: "So, the armor is what killed you?"
Laura: No, actually, a trap that Percival set off is what killed me.
Taliesin: Yes, the--
Liam: What?
Taliesin: -- trap was a bit-- it was a bit, ah-- there was a trap. And it was well-protected.
Liam: What?
Laura: What, what, what? What?
Taliesin: Yes, what.
Laura: What?
Travis: (mutters) He didn't know that.
Laura: What? So these Vestiges.
Matt: "Vestiges."
Laura: These leathers, these things.
Matt: "Um--" And he puts a couple of small, armored, like, studded-leather gloves on and has to carefully reach out for the vestments as you hand them. And he grabs them. "Give me a bit of time with them, perhaps, I need to clarify what this enchantment may be. Do you mind staying around, just in case?"
Taliesin: Not at all.
Matt: "Don't feel strange that I don't trust this, but, based on your history with it, I would like a little backup." So, he carries you off down the far hallway, you didn't get this far into Whitestone when you initially came through, but towards the back there was a small study area converted into a research establishment largely set up for the ziggurat beneath the city. He clears off an area of the table and sets this down. And he takes some time working with the vestments before he eventually, and it's this awkward quiet of hearing him mutter to himself and bring out a symbol and bring over a minor enchantment to reveal information, that tearing into the divinity, the divine magic that is granted to him, before he says, "This carries the mark of the Raven Queen, a very strong mark. I've not seen power like this in but an object."
Laura: It was worn by one of her champions. The great Purvan.
Matt: "That's a strange name."
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: "Regardless, it appears that this armor does help fortify one's defenses from any sort of physical damage, as well as give you a chance of surviving even the most dangerous of near-death experiences. It also grants a fluid resistance to the elements. Here." And he hands it over, and-- who would like to take this? Item card to--
Travis: Well, you died for it, you--
Laura: I think I like it, but I'll just look at it.
Marisha: It's leather?
Laura: It's leather.
Matt: So, to give you the specifics on it, it's plus two to AC. Magical on top of the studded leather armor. Plus two enchantment, beyond just the studded leather armor. It does give you advantage on death saving throws.
Sam: You'll need that.
Matt: As it is called the Deathwalker's Ward, and once per short rest, you can set it to be resistant to one of the five types of damage.
Laura: You choose which one.
Matt: You choose. You can change it. You can leave it all on one, but if you want to change it during a short rest, you can shift it from fire or cold, or lightning--
Travis: Acid, or necrotic.
Sam: You're, like, indestructible now!
Marisha: Do you have fancy leather armor right now? What does your armor do right now? Anything?
Liam: It's acid-resistant.
Laura: My armor's acid-resistant, I sort of stole it from my brother. Do you want your acid-resistant armor back, then?
Liam: Whatever you want, Vex'ahlia.
Laura: He's in such a sour mood lately.
Travis: Well, yeah. Well, what about the necklace?
Matt: "The necklace as well?"
Taliesin: I hand it over.
Matt: He takes it, and he goes, "Well, the chain on this necklace is not actually part of the enchantment, it's merely to hold the crystal itself. The crystal is the item of particular interest here, this-- oh, wait a minute." He takes it and he scans over the table and pulls up a jeweler's eyepiece and inspects it closely. "There's something inside this gem."
Travis: Uh-oh.
Marisha: (groans) Not again.
Laura: What is it?
Marisha: Why do things like living in gems? It can't be comfortable.
Travis: It might be a worm.
Laura: It's like tequila.
Matt: "I can't actually ascertain the nature of whatever being is encased within this, but--"
Laura: There's a being, it's a being?
Marisha: Encased.
Laura: Is it a soul gem?
Marisha: Like something put it in there.
Matt: He takes a moment and concentrates on his holy symbol of Pelor, and you can see as he puts aside the eyepiece, his eyes glaze over with a grayish, frosted white color, at which point he inspects the gem very closely, and there's this slight vibration in the air around him. As soon as it fades about a minute later, he pulls back and goes, "This is referred to as the Raven's Slumber. It's actually a small gateway to a tiny pocket-plane."
Sam: A pocket-plane?
Marisha: Ooh.
Matt: "It can contain one creature. You have to contact whatever it was, and it can't be too big, but it can essentially contain something indefinitely within this."
Laura: But something's already in there?
Matt: "Something is already in this."
Travis: Awesome.
Sam: Something that we can summon?
Marisha: Any way we can find out what it possibly is before we summon it?
Matt: "Unfortunately, I do not have that capability."
Laura: It was buried with--
Sam: I'll take that.
Laura: Oh, that's really smart to give to Scanlan.
Travis: Well, like, you said "not too big" though, right?
Matt: "The confines of the space, at least, as part of the enchantment, seem rather small. A bit larger than you, maybe, but not much more than that."
Travis: Right, right, okay.
Matt: "Here."
Travis: Please.
Marisha: Well, does it change size?
Laura: This is maybe the worst thing that Scanlan's ever held outside of that gun that you had, Percy.
Travis: What are you talking about? Can we take it in the woods, open it up, and if it sucks we kill it, and if not, we've got a new pet.
Marisha: We don't even know how to open it up! Do we know how to open it up?
Travis: Oh, we will find a way.
Laura: It was buried with the Raven Queen's champion, I mean, it could be incredibly dangerous. Or it could be incredibly good, and he trapped it, and they're bad, right?
Liam: The same could be said about your new pajamas.
Laura: They are so beautiful. I do like feathers.
Travis: What do they smell like?
Laura: (sniffs) Like (sniffs) must and mold. And birds, really.
Travis: (laughing) And birds? Eesh.
Matt: "So, is that all you require of me?"
Travis: I require Percy to tell us what the fuck's up with the necklace he's reading about.
Taliesin: Just what he said.
Laura: Yeah, he already told us about it.
Sam: Once we release whatever is inside of it, we can use this necklace as a weapon, to--
Taliesin: It's a cage.
Sam: To trap people.
Marisha: Hang on, okay. Let's think about this. What do we remember from the great Purvan's story?
Laura: Well, let me look at my book?
Marisha: What did he fight?
Sam: I just remember that Purvan's story touched me. Touched me in inappropriate ways.
Travis: (laughing) No, no, no.
Laura: You know what I like about this particular piece of paper is that you made it on cardstock so it's extra special instead of the regular paper.
Matt: It's legendary.
Taliesin: Legendary cardstock.
Marisha: Can we get purple cardstock up in here?
Laura: I'm talking to Matt, bitches. Okay. I forgot what I was going to say-- Oh, my book! My 30-gold book! Does it say anything about what Purvan fought?
Matt: All right! You read through. There were many, many things throughout the war that were fought: entities from the Nine Hells, there was a faction of the Abyss that came in as a third bit of evil in this whole conflict; and while not in alliance against the other forces of chaos, there were many forces of chaos lashing out at what was nearby. So the Champion's-- there was no specific entity that was his chosen, or at least, what you can ascertain to be a specific being of hatred, although it does speak of Purvan, the Champion of the Raven Queen, keeping with him an ally.
Laura: Like Trinket.
Matt: It doesn't say the nature of the ally, it just says the dangerous and respected Galdric.
Laura: (gasps) Galdric.
Taliesin: Well, there are some options here.
Laura: What?
Taliesin: No, that won't work, damn it.
Travis: Well, say it, come on.
Taliesin: Well, I was thinking we could find a safe place, surround it, let it out, and if it's dangerous, take care of it. We could even take it down into the pits beneath the castle so that if it's a magical creature, it would be harmless. Except I don't know if we could actually release it down there. I don't know--
Laura: Yeah, what if it touches the thing, and it--
Sam: There's also magic resistance down there.
Taliesin: Yeah, which means it wouldn't work in the first place.
Marisha: What if he's friendly? I mean, he talks about being an ally.
Taliesin: It might be an ally.
Marisha: Well then, wouldn't we want to save it?
Laura: An ally of Purvan! An ally of Purvan's!
Taliesin: Yes.
Laura: Is Purvan a good guy?
Taliesin: Yes.
Laura: I thought the Raven Queen was not good!
Taliesin: No, the Raven Queen--
Marisha: She's like-- neutral.
Taliesin: Can I make a roll for this?
Matt: Make a religion check.
Taliesin: Okay, thank you. Nope, nope, it's St. Patty's Day.
Travis: Don't kill anybody.
Laura: Yeah, with these green dice.
Taliesin: Religion or history?
Matt: Religion.
Travis: Religion.
Taliesin: 11.
Matt: 11. The general essence of the Raven Queen she is both loved and feared in equal parts. She does not lord over the afterlife, the underworld, whatever you may call it-- she lords over the moment and the transition of death, which is largely considered neither a good nor evil, just a natural force. It could be accepted either way. Many men fear it, and fear her for that reason, and there are those that instead embrace it as the inevitable. As to the true nature of her intent, no one really knows. It's part of her mystique.
Travis: So, like, even if we let out the glorious Ball-lick or whatever his name is, like, if he's bad, we can't really put him back in, right?
Taliesin: No, we actually can. Actually, we can put him back in.
Travis: What, we touch him with it and he goes back in?
Sam: Correct.
Matt: After a saving throw.
Marisha: Maybe we should save him and release him when he'll be valuable to us?
Taliesin: So would a trap. We could also trap other creatures--
Laura: It's like a Poké Ball! Right? It's like a Pokémon?
Taliesin: Yes, it's exactly like a Poké Ball.
Marisha: Who knows if he'll go back in willingly?
Taliesin: You don't have to go in willingly, that's sort of the point.
Matt: I guess you could technically use it that way, yeah.
Marisha: But wouldn't we rather be friendly with him than him be angry at us the next time we release him?
Taliesin: I'm more excited about the idea of carrying around an empty trap.
Marisha: But we could win both. But we could have a trap and a friend.
Liam: I think Percy is right that we should let it out now because it's a question mark, no matter what. Whatever, it's all theories. We don't know what we're getting into, and better that it pop out now, on its own, and not while we're facing a fucking beholder.
Laura: I think we should do it in the forest outside of Vasselheim.
Taliesin: Or the forest outside of Whitestone.
Sam: Vasselheim? We're here.
Marisha: Why don't we try and do a little bit more research on Galdric first?
Sam: That would be too careful.
Travis: Yeah, come on. Come on.
Sam: Vex! Just open it!
Liam: Percival. Are there any libraries here?
Taliesin: Not really, anymore.
Liam: What about a personal collection in your family?
Taliesin: Didn't they ravage most of our collection?
Matt: Elements have been ravaged. Elements of family history have been destroyed so that there couldn't be large connections, or the end of the bloodline itself being too prominently displayed within the castle itself. There is still a library there, though from your knowledge-- and you've read through most of those books growing up-- a lot of them are loose history books; a lot of them are more encyclopedia-like, general knowledge--
Taliesin: She wasn't a revered deity in this part of the world, we don't have a lot--
Laura: All right, yeah, let's do it. Woods!
Travis: Woods! Woods! Woods!
Taliesin: Woods, or Vasselheim, that's actually not a bad idea to get far away from Whitestone.
Travis: No, because then somebody else'll come along and kill it.
Sam: Plus they don't like magic.
Taliesin: This is sort of our secret, and we should perhaps keep this--
Laura: Okay.
Taliesin: Well, we were going to go take a look at--
Marisha: (muffled) What if--
Travis: You got shit in your mouth.
Marisha: We g-- mm, sorry. Little bit of saliva.
Liam: Goodberries?
Marisha: Snacks. We go to those goliath caves, right outside of Whitestone, that were abandoned.
Travis: Stone giant caves?
Marisha: Those!
Travis: Shit. Made me feel like I had to poop for a second, there. Goliath caves, fuck.
Marisha: Sorry! I just remembered you recognized them. They were empty, and abandoned, we could go there.
Travis: Yeah!
Laura: Is that close to your family?
Travis: Nope.
Marisha: No, we saw it on the way into Whitestone.
Taliesin: It's just a couple hours away, correct?
Laura: Oh.
Matt: It's, I'd say roughly three, three and a half hours northwest of here.
Laura: Let's do it!
Matt: Yeah, it's where the forest of the Alabaster Sierras ends and the actual Alabaster Sierra mountain range begins, is where that transitions.
Taliesin: We can take a day and do this.
Laura: All right, sure. Let's do it. All right. What do you think? Good idea? Good idea?
Liam: Sure, yes, yes, yes, Keyleth had a good idea, yes.
Matt: All right. So.
Laura: We're healed, yes?
Taliesin: Yes.
Marisha: We're healed, right? Did we sleep? Do we need to sleep?
Liam: I thought we rested before we went down under the water, though--
Laura: No, we did, we didn't rest since then.
Liam: I don't remember resting afterwards. And I was there.
Travis: I don't either. I remember I peed on a lake, and then we went under it.
Matt: Yeah, I think you guys decided instead of resting to come to rest here in Whitestone.
Laura: Yeah, we need to sleep, y'all!
Taliesin: Let's take a sleep, and we'll do it in the morning.
Travis: What time is it, about?
Matt: I'd say by now, with as much time as you spent in the temple, from waking up in the morning, it's getting four in the afternoon, five in the afternoon. The sun's starting to come down, so.
Laura: I'm going to cast Cure Wounds on myself.
Sam: Aren't we going to sleep?
Laura: But it's four in the afternoon! There's other things to do today.
Marisha: Like drink?
Laura: Like find out how Gilmore's doing and see Pike.
Marisha: And I should probably scry and check in on Allura, right?
Taliesin: I've got some work to do.
Matt: It's up to you guys. Yeah, and you're starting to push towards the bottom of your ammunition stack anyway, Percy.
Taliesin: I need to, yeah, to do a little-- and I've got a little thing I want to work on.
Matt: Cool. All right, so, who's doing what first?
Taliesin: I'm going to take Vax aside very quickly.
Travis: Let's do that first!
Taliesin: I had a careless moment, and I apologize. And you're the first apology I'm putting forward. I don't know if I would have done anything different, but I hope you know that I would've never forgiven myself.
Liam: What're you talking about?
Taliesin: I rushed in and triggered the trap that almost killed your sister.
Liam: That killed my sister.
Taliesin: I can't say that.
Liam: What do you mean?
Taliesin: I was careless.
Liam: Well, what happened, Percival?
Taliesin: I felt the danger had passed, and I moved too quickly, and opened the casket without thinking. That's all. I just didn't think.
Liam: You just opened it? Just like that?
Taliesin: I was tired, wasn't thinking. Sometimes we move too quickly. But I want you to know that it would've-- I'm very glad that she's alive, because I don't think I could have lived with myself.
Liam: All right. Could you do me a favor?
Taliesin: Yes.
Liam: In the future-- If there is anything that your little heart desires inside of a box-- In the future, could you check with my sister or myself first?
Taliesin: That's the hope, yes. That was more of a lesson than I was hoping for. Thankfully not too much of one.
Liam: Well--
Taliesin: And none of us are beyond mistakes, but... that is a mistake that I am going to be thinking about for a very long time. We are going into dangerous territory, and we all have to think a little bit more. And she especially, I-- I couldn't--
Liam: Well listen, Percy. We are not playing a game.
Taliesin: No.
Liam: And we will all make mistakes, and I wager I will make my fair share. I've little doubt. And Percival, I want to apologize. I'm sorry. But-- And I punch him in his know-it-all fucking mouth.
Matt: Do you attempt to move out of the way, or take it?
Taliesin: Yeah, let's take it.
Matt: All right. (impact sound) Decks you square in the-- for as hefty as a punch it was? Doesn't hurt quite as much as you expected. But it's not the physical pain that hurts, more than the action and the knowledge that there are more repercussions to your rash decision than even you initially anticipated.
Liam: Goodnight, Percival.
Taliesin: Goodnight, Vax.
Sam: It's four in the afternoon! (laughter)
Taliesin: I'm going to work. I'm going into my studio.
Matt: All right, who else wants to do something?
Marisha: Where'd Kima go?
Matt: Kima is actually-- she's begun day-drinking into the night! So yeah, she's currently by herself in one of the few functional taverns in Whitestone. It's fairly empty at the moment, especially at this hour as the sun slowly sets. She's not heavy drinking but she's definitely nursing a tankard and quietly contemplating as she sits at the edge of the bar with her hands around the tankard. She's staring at her reflection as she spins it slowly on the wood. You can hear it (scuffing) on the woodgrain.
Marisha: Anyone else want to go to the--
Laura: I'm going with you, yeah.
Matt: There's like a few other random patrons, but no one catches your eye. No one specifically.
Sam: I'll come, too. Well, actually, wait. Grog, what're you doing?
Travis: Nothing yet.
Sam: I'm with Grog.
Matt: Okay. So the two of you, into the tavern-- she doesn't notice you guys.
Marisha: I go up and put my hand on her shoulder.
Matt: "Keyleth!"
Marisha: Hey! How's it going?
Matt: "Better."
Marisha: Yeah.
Laura: I lean up against the bar, next to you guys.
Marisha: Want to check in on Allura?
Matt: "Let's do it."
Marisha: Is there an empty room around here?
Matt: She looks over to the barkeep. You all stare over and the barkeep is currently there like wiping down the bar section. "For how long?"
Laura: For a couple hours.
Marisha: Doesn't need to be that long.
Matt: "Two silver?"
Laura: We saved your life? And the entire town.
Matt: "You are fine to use it as you please for the remainder of the afternoon. Just don't mess it up, please."
Marisha: Sure. We'll try really hard to find better things to do with our time. Okay.
Matt: All right, you make your way up and the place is fairly vacant, there are a couple of rooms that are currently partially-- the doors are ajar and you hear voices in there, and you recognize it's a couple of the refugees that you guys brought over from your keep, currently holed up in this tavern. An inn floor on the second floor. But there are a number of open rooms right now that you could go ahead and step into for use.
Marisha: Just pick one.
Matt: Okay. So. Do you want to go ahead and attempt a Scry ritual?
Marisha: Yes!
Matt: Focusing on...?
Marisha: The flower that I gave her before we left.
Laura: Ooh, good call.
Matt: All right, so. As you all sit down, Kima sitting across from you, arms closed. She looks at you intensely with this really direct glare, waiting for some sort of sign of an answer or information. As you complete the ritual preparation of the scrying, your vision transcends your form, jettisoned through the ceiling and into the clouds. Clouds rush past, you can feel the wind pushing across your face, your hair, and as the clouds part you see, below, you see Westruun. And from Westruun you can see most of the city, as you recall, and a large portion of it currently looks toppled-over and pushed into ruin. There are no longer burning black clouds, but white smoke, long after a fire or some sort of an impact, lazily drifting off some of those ruins. It focuses even closer, and you see very little populace in the streets. Most everyone's either indoors or not visible at the moment. Your vision clicks in once again, and you can see currently some sort of dark room hidden in Westruun. You see, for a brief instant, a flicker of light, and you see Drake Thunderbrand and Allura both gathering a few small books under their arms, silently waiting, quietly. You hear (impact sounds) some heavy footfalls above. They both just stay quiet, stay quiet. Allura stays still for a moment. She looks over at Drake. They both take hands and then (whoosh) convert into that same energy form you saw that jettisoned out of Greyskull Keep, that echoes down a long hallway that you previously didn't see was attached to this room. It leads to a stone spiral staircase that goes upward before these two dual sparks travel through the small crack between where the edge of a trap door and a wooden floor is as the sparks course upward into the now-setting sun. You can see amongst the sparks the mostly collapsed rubble of the Cobalt Reserve, the large library in the center of Westruun. You can see dozens of corpses that have been largely dissolved. You can see what remnants of their bodies have been eaten away by some sort of caustic material, their arms and fingers tightened up as the muscles pull into this horrible, gnarled visage of what once were the living residents of Westruun. You do see, as the spark comes to a stop for a second in its movement, and you hear briefly overhead (wingbeats) and you see rush overhead, wings fully spread, the black dragon that you had briefly encountered in Emon streak upward, roaring loudly, towards Gatshadow, the tall, dark spire mountain just north of Westruun. (whoosh) And as it heads up there, the sparks (electric sound) continue their trek through the streets, and at that point the ritual fades, its vision unable to maintain its focus. Your vision is pulled back up into the clouds and then thrust back into your current position and with a shock you find yourself back in the tavern.
Laura: What did you see? Is she all right?
Marisha: She's alive, her and Drake both are alive.
Matt: "Good. Where are they going?"
Marisha: They're at the Cobalt Reserve, which is in ruins, as well as the rest of Westruun.
Laura: Did you see the dragon?
Marisha: Yes, the black dragon is there. Looks like he's taken up residence in the black spire-- tower. What was it called?
Laura: Gatshadow?
Marisha: That one.
Marisha: Gatshadow. Allura--
Laura: Could you communicate with her when you scry? I don't know how it works.
Marisha: No, I can just look in and see.
Laura: All right.
Marisha: She was grabbing the last few important tomes, remnants left from the Cobalt Library, I mean, Reserve.
Matt: "They staying in Westruun?"
Marisha: It didn't look like it.
Matt: "Where are they going?"
Marisha: I don't know, I didn't see.
Matt: "Did you talk about where you--"
Laura: We left word. And told her we were coming here.
Matt: "Here to Whitestone?"
Laura: Yes. If you wait, she'll be here.
Matt: "Who else is coming?"
Laura: Drake.
Matt: "Drake. Anybody else on the Council coming?"
Sam: We brought some Council members, right? Were any among our--
Matt: You're not there, you're with Grog.
Sam: Oh, that's right, I'm sorry, oh, I'm not there! (laughter)
Sam: So, Grog! Want to play some bocce ball? (laughter)
Marisha: I don't know who all's coming.
Laura: Uriel.
Matt: "Dead? Well, that's great. That's fantastic. What about the rest?"
Marisha: His wife and children are here.
Matt: "Here, okay."
Marisha: As well as Gilmore.
Laura: Gilmore's Glorious Goods.
Matt: "Right, right."
Laura: Wonderful place to buy all sorts of products, if it were still... standing.
Matt: "Huh. I've only heard things, I've not met this 'Gilmore'."
Marisha: You haven't met Gilmore!? Man, I just assume everyone knows each other.
Matt: "Anybody else? Tofor?"
Laura: Yes, maybe...? Yes, Tofor...?
Marisha: He might have... been... slain...?
Laura: Which one is Tofor?
Marisha: She's the dragonborn--
Laura: Yes, Tofor-- they did, I think Tofor is-- definitely maybe here.
Matt: Last you heard, two Council members that were confirmed still alive by Gilmore when you found him-- or, confirmed by Uriel's wife and family-- thank you, sorry, were Tofor and Asum.
Laura: Yes.
Matt: So both were two of the ones that were saved by Gilmore, and then once he was too wounded to continue, they left to seek for survivors in Emon. That was the last you heard of them.
Laura: Oh. They're not actually here, then. Yes. They're looking for other survivors, Tofor and Asum.
Matt: "In the place where this-- and what's this dragon you keep talking about?"
Laura: Oh, shit, you don't know anything. Thordak! Big. Terrible. Red.
Matt: As you say the name again, you can see her eyes resonate with a clarity, and where once was this very intense expression and air of demanding information suddenly recedes into this look of sudden fear, and she's briefly lost in thought.
Laura: Yes, you defeated him once. He escaped the Fire Realm.
Marisha: Not only did he escape, he tore a giant tear in the rifts between the Fire Realm and ours.
Matt: (sighs deeply) "Thordak." And you can see, she's starting to hyperventilate suddenly, like, for all of her strong exterior, this is the first time, aside from the brief hit of the beholder's ray earlier, you see fear in her eyes, and she starts standing up. (pants) "I need to get some air."
Marisha: Kima, Kima, it'll be--
Matt: "I need to--"
Marisha: Sit here, you want to sit down?
Matt: "I need to get s-- I need to get some air." And she storms out of the room.
Marisha: Let's go outside.
Laura: Actually, Keyleth--
Marisha: What?
Laura: I shut the door behind Kima.
Marisha: Okay.
Laura: I want to talk to you.
Marisha: Yeah.
Laura: I would ask my brother, but, knowing him, he would walk away. What happened?
Marisha: Keyleth has a hard time looking her in the eye.
Laura: Look at me, Keyleth! Be strong! You're royalty. Tell me what happened.
Marisha: Vex, I don't want to ever see you like that again. I don't want to ever see anybody like that again.
Laura: I grab both sides of her face and force her to look at me. I'm all right. I'm still here. Okay? I need you to tell me what happened. Because between us? Vax is off. Something's wrong. And I need to know what it is.
Marisha: We all watched you die.
Laura: Yes.
Marisha: It's like--
Laura: How did I get back? Who brought me back? Kashaw, Zahra, my brother. Anyone else?
Marisha: I guess... you could say, probably an unseen entity, an unseen force. Oh, I'm lightheaded.
Laura: Sit down.
Marisha: Okay.
Laura: There's a bed. Sit down.
Marisha: Percy--
Laura: Percy helped.
Marisha: Let's skip that. When we brought you back, Kashaw performed a resurrection ritual.
Laura: Like we did with Pike.
Marisha: Yes. And he called upon a deity and at first he was afraid that it was Vesh. Which he was quite terrified about.
Laura: His wife.
Marisha: Yes. That, I don't believe, is the presence that answered his call.
Laura: Okay. Fluttery words here, darling. Get to the point.
Marisha: I thought I was going to lose you both. I thought I was going to lose you and Vax.
Laura: Why Vax? Did he get hurt as well? No. What did he do?
Marisha: He-- I don't know. I don't know what he did. He said to take him instead, is what he told the entity. He offered his life for yours. And my biggest fear was that neither of you were going to come back. He offered his life for you. And for all we know, that offer was accepted.
Laura: Right.
Marisha: If I had to guess, it was probably the Raven Queen herself.
Laura: Well. It's rather suiting, isn't it?
Marisha: He seems to do that quite a lot.
Laura: Yes. Keyleth? Thank you, dear. And I leave.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: I stay behind and burst into tears.
Matt: Okay. Grog and Scanlan! What're you guys doing? (relieved laughter)
Liam: (Grog voice) Go fish.
Travis: So-- what do you want to do?
Sam: I don't know. I hadn't really thought about it. Do you have any games with you?
Travis: No.
Sam: Anything in the Bag of Holding?
Travis: I think there's some orc parts in there that've been in for a couple months.
Sam: Doesn't sound very fun.
Travis: Right. I got all nervous when they mentioned a goliath's cave, so I need to go boom-boom.
Sam: Should I play a song so no one can hear it?
Travis: Might help. Like, stand guard outside the door.
Sam: Yeah, yeah. A little muzak.
Travis: Would you mind?
Sam: It's what I'm here for.
Travis: Can I go drop some ordnance?
Matt: And as you find one of the few local ramshackle outhouses-- none are quite goliath-sized, and it's an uncomfortable experience, but thank God you brought a bard along or you would have woken up half the populace just going to bed, as Scanlan, I--
Sam: Nothing to see here, everybody! (plays random chords on the harmonica) Nothing to see here!
Travis: (coughs, then farts) Oh!
Laura: Okay, okay, okay, okay. (laughter)
Travis: Now, the music's playing, right?
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: It's just a stall, just me?
Matt: Yeah, yeah.
Travis: All right, can I take out Craven Edge?
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: All right.
Marisha: In the outhouse? Sorry, keep going!
Travis: It's the palace, this is where all the best thoughts and conversations happen! I don't know how it is at your house.
Liam: Keep in mind how confined it is, okay?
Travis: Yeah!
Liam: And go. (laughter)
Matt: Yes. (grunting)
Sam: Sounds like a rough one in there, buddy!
Matt: As you (chuckles) as you see one of the wood boards splinter out the side for a second--
Sam: Ah, yup, that's tacos!
Travis: You might want to play a bit louder and maybe take a few steps away, it's about to get violent.
Sam: No problem!
Travis: Yep.
Matt: At that moment you focus, and as you can feel the blade itself grow cold in your fingertips, you can see what little bit of light that filters through the bright orangish-red color that's coming from the sunset, you can see a reflection in the obsidian blade as a voice comes to your ear and says, "You fed me well."
Travis: Yeah, I did, right? I mean, we are really doing well. Question: so, when we were fighting that big Earthbreaker Groot-looking guy, he called you a 'dark weapon'. Does that-- do you have feelings, and did that hurt them?
Matt: There's a brief pause before you hear this long, drawn-out, (heavy sigh).
Travis: Right, hold on! No, no, listen. And I take my thumb and I run it against the blade real quick.
Matt: Okay. As you do, all of a sudden the voice goes, (gasp, contented exhale).
Travis: Right, yep, sorry, listen. So, my question is, as much as I love opening up people to feed you, I want to know, like-- what's in it for you?
Sam: Grog, are you talking to your shit?
Travis: Yeah, no, you got to let it know who's boss!
Sam: Okay.
Matt: The voice creeps in again, this time. "There is no feeling more terrifying than hunger. And I hunger forever. You help satiate that hunger. That is our arrangement. I give you the strength of those you cut down, and I feed upon them. If this is unsatisfactory, I can and have found others who are more willing to be part of this arrangement--"
Travis: No, no, no, I'm a big fan, really, I mean, I am yoked out when I'm using you, it's fucking amazing. I mean, people are flying apart, it's like a dream. But listen, can you ever be... full?
Matt: "I have never been full before. Perhaps you're the one to find out."
Travis: I'll bet I am, actually, you're really lucky you found me and not these other blokes, not even half the man I am. But listen, so, there's no, like, endgame, just to be clear, you just want to drink and drink, 'cause I've seen the blood, right? And usually I wipe it off, but you, like, suck it in, and that's a little unsettling, not going to lie.
Matt: "My hunger grows, but the air tarnishes my blade. Perhaps we can continue this conversation elsewhere."
Travis: (farts) Right, yeah, right. Not even a problem. Well, look, I like the way you cut people open, so we'll continue this another time. And I sheathe him.
Matt: All right. As you sheathe, the last thing he says is, "Don't forget: I hunger always."
Travis: I kick the door open, and I'm like, if you're within 200 feet, back up!
Sam: No one's out here, Grog.
Travis: Oh.
Sam: Just me. Are you all right?
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: I heard you say something about blood.
Travis: Yeah, no, am I sweating? It was a real workout, that one.
Sam: At some point you said, "Are you full?" Are you talking about-- did you fill it all the way up?
Travis: Yeah, the privy, you know, it was starting to give my bum a tickle.
Sam: Wow!
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: You topped it off!
Travis: Yeah. Because, you know, you don't want to, like, dip in the muck, it's, you know--
Laura: Foul.
Sam: Not at all.
Travis: Did you want to--
Sam: I think I'm good.
Travis: Are you sure? I warmed it up for you, it's, like, ready to go.
Sam: I love a good deuce, but not today, I think.
Travis: All right. Fair enough. But I'm feeling so, like, vacated--
Sam: We should go get a bite.
Travis: I think you're right!
Sam: (laughs) All right, let's go.
Travis: (laughing) Okay.
Matt: Okay. You guys are getting a bite. Percival, if you want to go ahead and make a tinkering check with dexterity modifier to create more ammunition.
Taliesin: Tinkering check with dexterity modifier?
Matt: Yes.
Taliesin: Okay.
Matt: Should be plus 11.
Taliesin: 16.
Matt: 16, okay. We'll say, in the time that you've had here, with the materials you purchased, and Whitestone's pretty open to supplying you--
Taliesin: I've got a thing.
Matt: Yeah, I'd say you're able to create roughly 40 or so simple bullets in the time that you have.
Taliesin: Do I have time to poke at a modification to the explosive arrow? I want to try and build a rock breaker. I'm curious to try and build an arrow for taking down walls or taking down doors.
Matt: Like a siege arrow?
Taliesin: A light form of siege arrow. Basically, I want to have a tip that actually manages to breach stone and then an explosion that goes outwards, so it's a shattering arrow.
Matt: All right, this'll take the remainder of your evening. You're not going to be able to do much else after this.
Taliesin: I have nothing else to do.
Matt: All right. Go ahead and make a tinkering check with your intelligence modifier.
Taliesin: Okay. So... That's 23.
Matt: 23, okay. At the cost of roughly 150 gold pieces, as you have to go through a few different attempts to finally get the design right, and the metalworking you have here is not perfected. You're not at your workshop back at the keep, unfortunately, so you have to work with whatever you have here, and nothing here is designed for the--
Taliesin: No, I've got an okay workshop here.
Matt: Yeah. The one that you used before, previously, but that's from mostly discarded and-- in the time that you've been gone, it's been cannibalized for a lot of different uses. But it's makeshift. You manage to complete what you think could function. You're not entirely certain as to what the final effect will be, but it all seems to be in place.
Taliesin: All right.
Matt: So you can write down 'Explosive Siege Arrow'.
Taliesin: Siege arrow.
Matt: And we shall find out in time what it does.
Marisha: Siege arrow. That's fun.
Taliesin: A few things I've been working on, and that's one of them.
Matt: So. Are you guys resting for the evening? Anything else you wish to accomplish?
Laura: That would probably be smart. I'm pretty tired after dying, so I'm going to go to sleep.
Matt: Okay. Vax, anything you want to accomplish before you--
Taliesin: God, the guilt. Okay. Yeah.
Sam: Can I buy a torch somewhere? Just a torch?
Matt: Sure! Yeah, torches are relatively easy to find. You want to try one?
Sam: Three.
Matt: Three torches. That's three copper.
Laura: I bring Trinket into the castle with me, just so you know.
Matt: After all this has happened, Trinket has been, like, almost locked to you. Even you going upstairs into the tavern, Trinket was like, (plaintive bear noises) stayed out front, 'cause Trinket's learned at this point, you can't really go into all the taverns.
Laura: It's hard, it's hard.
Matt: It's rough, being a bear.
Sam: And wherever we're eating, does it happen to be near Jameson the painter's workshop?
Matt: No, but it's about a 20-minute walk, if you wanted to go find him.
Sam: Be nice to check in with him. Grog, do you mind walking with me?
Travis: Absolutely not.
Sam: All right, so we'll truck on over to Jameson's.
Matt: Okay. You head up to it, and this gentleman is a painter as well as a stablehand, so you find your way to the facility, knock on it, and immediately as the door opens, the smell of fresh manure hits your nose and Jameson steps out. "Can I-- you!"
Sam: Yes! Hi!
Matt: "Hi!"
Sam: I've come back.
Matt: "I meant to deliver, but they told me not to, because apparently it's not there anymore?"
Sam: The town, you mean.
Matt: "Town, yeah, where I was supposed to deliver it to you."
Sam: It was wise of you to keep this precious artifact here, because it would've surely been destroyed en route or when it arrived--
Matt: "It's just the canvas, I don't have a-- It's a bit too large for my specifications of framing, but--"
Sam: I'm sure it's huge. Did you finish it?
Matt: "Yes, yes! Come, come!"
Sam: Can I look?
Travis: Oh please, oh please!
Sam: (laughing) Okay, let's go look!
Matt: He takes one of the hooded lanterns and turns up the oil wick on it, and as he turns away he brings you into the back stable area where it's been sectioned off, and you can see there's paints that have been dropped all across the ground and the hay, it's this multicolored spattering, this rainbow vomit across this section of hay floor, and there in all of its glory, stretched across and nailed at the corners to this far, far wall, you see a fantastical landscape of rolling hills and treelines rising up at the edges. You can see a mountainscape in the distance. The lighting he uses is magnificent. You can see why many people in the city specifically requested that you go to this gentleman. There atop this fantastic green hilltop, you see on this fine white and grey steed as it raises up, hooves in the air, is yourself, shirt open, chest slightly fuzzy and muscular. As you look off, your hair blowing in the breeze--
Sam: How's the face? How's the face?
Matt: The face is pretty damn spot-on.
Sam: Yes! (laughter)
Matt: The best likeness you can find for somebody who only had a brief reference, as he sketched you quickly before he left, and there behind, clutching you, from the side you can see Pike wearing these long greyish-silver and blue robes that are also flowing behind, a long train-- longer than it needs to be, stylistically it was a choice in the artistics point of this-- it is everything you hoped it would be. You paid good money for this piece.
Sam: I'm going to request-- Grog, I need a minute here.
Travis: Oh, yeah. I understand, take--
Sam: Just to weep.
Travis: Take all the time you need.
Sam: So I regard it for a few minutes, taking in the beauty and the wonder of all I've accomplished--
Marisha: I have a question. Would Keyleth and Scanlan be crying in rooms at the same time?
Matt: Right now? Yes. For different reasons entirely.
Sam: (singing) Somewhere out there...
Taliesin: (singing) Somewhere out there...
Travis: Look at the air, look at the air high-five. There it is.
Sam: (singing) Beneath the pale moonlight
Taliesin: (singing) Beneath the pale moonlight
Marisha: (singing) Beneath the pale moonlight
Travis: So white. That was the whitest of white high fives ever.
Taliesin: I'm imagining this as a canvas of Lisa Frank majesty, by the way. Like, the greatest Lisa Frank Trapper Keeper cover in all the land.
Matt: Oh, man. (laughter)
Sam: After I weep for a few minutes, I thank Jameson again and how much did I pay him for this thing? You've gone above and beyond, Jameson, and I know that you're a humble man and you don't want me to spread word of your accomplishments, but please allow me to write you an epic poem or a song and tell of your artistic gifts and talents, please.
Matt: "That would be a fine tip, sir. Please, yes, do so."
Sam: I'll get right on it.
Matt: "Send them back to Whitestone, please, ask for Jameson. The more I work this, hopefully I can make my way out of this dunghole."
Sam: Don't worry, you'll have lots of commissions after this, I promise you.
Matt: "Great."
Sam: And I'm going to give him an extra 50 gold.
Matt: "I, um--"
Liam: That's more than the price of a book.
Matt: "Sir, I-- thank you. Thank you, thank you."
Sam: For art supplies to get your shop up and running.
Matt: "Of course." He looks down and he's gotten a little bit of paint on the coins, he's like, (muttering and stammering). He puts it aside somewhere. "Thank you--" Wipes his hands off on a nearby rag. "Thank you." And takes your hand and shakes it vigorously.
Sam: So, can it be--
Matt: Yeah, he goes in and he takes his little claw hammer down, starts pulling the nails out from the sides and gingerly rolls up the canvas. It takes a good, like, three minutes to roll the thing up, and it's quite heavy as he hands it over to you-- (heavy grunt) In your hand, yeah, it almost takes you off your feet.
Sam: Grog! Grog!
Travis: What?
Sam: Can you hold this for me?
Travis: No, it's you, I mean, you're so magnificent in it--
Sam: No, I can't do it.
Travis: I don't know it-- I really--
Sam: Grog! I watched you shit for an hour!
Travis: Hey, all right, I'll pick it up.
Matt: All right. You guys find your way out. At this point night has taken; you can hear the crickets starting to spread throughout the city. As the rest of the blue night sky takes on-- Evening is ready, do you guys have anything else to accomplish before the evening comes to a close?
Liam: Wait 'til it's quiet. And I leave the room that I've been given at Whitestone. And I find my sister's door. And I stand outside it, and I stare at it for a minute--
Laura: Vax? Is that you?
Liam: And I stealth away.
Laura: I open the door.
Matt: Roll a stealth check, roll a perception check.
Laura: Shit.
Liam: 25.
Laura: 22. Damn it.
Matt: Nothing to be seen. Must have been your imagination, Vex.
Travis: He's good.
Liam: And I wait for the door to close. And then I walk to Keyleth's door. And I knock.
Matt: You hear a knock at your door.
Laura: And horses.
Matt: The clomping of horse hooves in the distance, apparently.
Marisha: I open it. Hey. Hi. You okay?
Liam: I don't know.
Marisha: Come in. Sit down.
Liam: I go in.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: How do you feel?
Liam: I don't know. All I know is... that I felt her. I don't know magic, I don't know anything. I open doors, and only when the wind is blowing in the right direction, sometimes, I think. I don't know what happened, but I felt her.
Marisha: Do you still feel her?
Matt: Make a perception check, Vax.
Liam: 22.
Matt: As you're sitting there, looking down at the ground, as she asks this question, you notice the symbol of Sarenrae that you have stitched into the back of your glove, what was once a very vibrant, goldish-brass color has actually very heavily tarnished, and the metal itself seems to have cracked in three places. It was not this way a day before.
Liam: Yeah. I don't know if I did anything in there, and I wouldn't take it back if I did, but I don't know what I'm doing.
Marisha: I don't know if it was very noble or very stupid, to be honest. Probably a little bit of both. I can attempt a Greater Restoration spell, and see if I can sense anything.
Liam: I don't know anything about any of that. I'll let you.
Marisha: Can I?
Matt: Yeah. So as you prepare your mindset for the cleansing ritual that is the Greater Restoration--
Marisha: Just lay back.
Matt: As soon as the dull green energy begins to course across your fingertips, and as you touch the edge of his shoulder to impart his body with the cleansing energy, it courses through his shoulders, the spell completes. You sense no difference in your current physicality, mindset, and there's this pause, this silence, of no realization, that is suddenly shattered by the sound of a (caws). You look over and at the stone edge of the window you guys are staying in, you see stepping there a single dark raven, (clicks, rapid flapping) and it takes off and flies into the night.
Marisha: I think this goes beyond any natural realm that I have any bearing over. And I hug him. I thought I was going to lose you. And I'm terrified I'm still going to.
Liam: Keyleth, I love you.
Marisha: And I think I love you. I just don't know if I can allow myself to. I'm terrified to allow myself to. You do realize that, if by some crazy chance, we all somehow make it through this domination alive, with the Chroma Conclave, and I complete my Aramente, I'll still watch all of you die. Everything could go phenomenally well. And by becoming Headmaster, we enter a bit of a realm of immortality where I could live for a very, very long time. I'm afraid every time I look at one of your faces that it's going to be the last, and I feel like deep down I know that day is coming. So because of that I'm afraid to let myself feel anything deeper than I already do.
Liam: I quickly leave her room.
Matt: The door closes behind Vax.
Marisha: And for the second time today Keyleth bursts into tears. Why do people keep leaving me in rooms alone?
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: Stop it, you're wasting water.
Marisha: We're in a drought, god damn it!
Laura: When was the last time you showered, Keyleth?
Marisha: It's been a while.
Taliesin: Makeup's runny.
Liam: Go water elemental.
Matt: It's the only way. All right, as you all find yourself coming to rest for the evening, some of you easier than others, eventually you get your full rest. Those who heal up to, say, full hit points for a good night's rest here, get your hit dice back, so not a whole lot were spent.
Travis: I lose my strength bonuses.
Matt: Morning comes to you all, and-- yes?
Liam: Sorry, just one detail. From there, I went and fell asleep in this idiot's doorway.
Matt: Okay. All right. We will go ahead and take a quick break, we will see you guys back here shortly to see what is in store for Vox Machina. So we'll be back here in a minute. [break]
Liam: Matt, shit on my face.
Matt: Welcome back, everybody!
Sam: It's too close!
Laura: They caught it, that one caught it.
Matt: That was pretty close.
Liam: All they heard was "ace."
Matt: It's all good. Welcome back, guys. We're going to go ahead and jump back in. So as you all, after that, for some, emotional evening, whether that be conversational emotion or, you know, having to go drop an emotional deuce. You know, that's important. You find yourselves waking up to a fresh morning in Whitestone, hints of blue sky breaking through the cloud coverage, and that's rare for this area because it's the northern portion of the continent, you know that, especially being so close to the ocean, a lot of the cloud, heavy precipitation makes its way in the direction of your town, so it's nice to have a little break in that. Nonetheless, as you guys come to consciousness and gather yourselves, your things, and your plans for the day, what do you wish to do?
Taliesin: We are a city of seasonal affectation disorder, so.
Laura: Well, I open my door and find my brother falling through it.
Liam: I'm awake.
Laura: Oh, good morning.
Liam: Hi.
Laura: Comfortable bed, I see.
Liam: Yeah. Sorry, I couldn't find my room.
Laura: Yeah, it's confusing, all these, all these doors.
Liam: What time's it?
Laura: I have no idea. My nature check tells me it's roughly, I dunno, eight? Nine? Something like that. Seven? Maybe seven.
Liam: Come here, you shithead. Don't fucking do that again.
Laura: It's not like I did it on--
Liam: Don't fucking do that again, all right? Just don't fucking do it again.
Laura: All right.
Liam: Fuck.
Laura: I can't breathe. You're about to kill me again.
Liam: You'll live, you'll live. Jesus. Whoever that is.
Laura: So-- (laughs) I heard a rumor that you sort of saved my life in a really creepy sort of way. I talk to people. I talk to so many people. I find out things. Secrets aren't safe when Vex is around.
Liam: Is there any coffee in this fucking castle?
Laura: Wait, wait, wait, I have a present for you, because I feel like you're going to really like it. Would you like it?
Liam: That's random. All right.
Laura: I have this armor that I think would be really great on you. Do you want it? It's really expensive. If you don't take it quickly, I might change my mi--
Liam: I don't want it.
Laura: Oh, that was expensive cardstock. (laughter)
Liam: I'll give you the leather armor after I have a chance to change.
Laura: All right. I love you.
Liam: (softly) I know. I know.
Laura: Let's get breakfast.
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: From that point, the smell of coffee begins to fill the air from the inside of the Whitestone castle halls. The servants have prepared breakfast, and a meal is ready for you. Grog jumping to attention as the scent reaches your nose. The rest of you all slowly find your way back down. You eat--
Marisha: Do we come out and see Vax in the armor?
Matt: Are you putting on the armor?
Liam: I'm just looking at it in the hallway.
Marisha: So I guess I step out and see him looking at it in the hallway.
Liam: Still pretty tired, to be honest. Didn't sleep a lot in the doorway.
Matt: Yeah. Some of you guys step out, and you see Vax standing in the hallway, clutching in his hands, looking over all the various, like, pushed-in, engraved runes across the leatherwork, the raven feathers that adorn the bottom of the mantle.
Laura: Careful, it smells a lot like must and mold and birds.
Marisha: I walk by and... briefly lock eyes and keep going without saying anything.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: Oh shit, you got the armor now?
Laura: He stole it, what can I say? He is a really sneaky, stealthy kind of guy.
Travis: Nice.
Laura: Yeah. Fair and square.
Liam: I just took it for fashion purposes, I suppose.
Travis: Oh, you need all the help you can get.
Liam: Yeah.
Sam: Should we go out in the woods and unleash an undead beast that will kill us all?
Travis: Yes! Christmas morning! Who has that, by the way?
Sam: I do.
Travis: Oh! Yeah!
Sam: Don't worry, it's safe.
Travis: Where d'you keep it?
Sam: Oh! Hold on-- Got a pouch or some-- you know what? It's back in my room.
Matt: All right. You go retrieve it.
Sam: Got it!
Travis: Where's Percy?
Laura: Where's Pike? We should bring her with us. Can we bring Pike with us? I know she's taking care of Gilmore, but.
Sam: Mm, that's possibly more important. I think this thing'll be fine!
Laura: We need some sort of somebody that can heal, I think we've learned this for ourselves.
Sam: I can heal!
Travis: Yeah, we got potions, we're fine. It's probably, like, a big Saint Bernard. What's the big deal?
Laura: (sighs) Okay. We learn nothing, carry on.
Travis: Where's Percy?
Taliesin: I'm right here.
Travis: Oh! Shit, you were quiet. Hello.
Taliesin: (coughs) Hello. Good morning.
Travis: Need any coffee? An enema?
Taliesin: What?
Marisha: A coffee enema?
Taliesin: What!? No. I'm fine. Good morning.
Liam: I'm going to walk off with this shit.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: And we go outside with the necklace.
Sam: Yeah, where're we headed?
Travis: The woods!
Laura: No. The caves. I thought we were going to the--
Marisha: Going to the caves on the edge of the woods.
Matt: Yeah. It's the caves that are--
Marisha: Going to go through the woods.
Liam: (sings) Into the woods!
Matt: So. You all gather together and make your way northwest of Whitestone, towards where you found the stone giant fortress and the series of caves that are in the mountain behind it. You get there; it's still seemingly abandoned. You case the area for a while. No noticeable movement other than a few woodland entities that exist in that vicinity.
Laura: Primeval Awareness! (radar sounds)
Matt: Okay. That is now the sound it makes every time you do it.
Laura: I like it.
Matt: Yeah, so hold onto that one. I'll make that a new ringtone sound for you guys. What are you looking for?
Laura: Oh, there's so many things I could sense!
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: What about sirens?
Laura: Sirens?
Travis: Wait, what are those things called? The things that took our horses the last time we were here?
Matt: Harpies?
Travis: Yeah, yeah, whatever.
Laura: Sure! Harpies.
Matt: For how many miles is it?
Laura: Six miles!
Matt: Six miles? Yeah, there's a few blips on the far, far western side of here. You get the essence way off in the mountains, there's maybe a small nest. Nothing that's immediately dangerous.
Laura: What about if I sit for one more minute and I think if I can sense any giants.
Matt: You do, to the far, far north. You get the sense that there is some sort of giant-based lifeform maybe two, three miles north of you.
Laura: Okay.
Travis: How's it look?
Laura: Well, I mean, clear of the things I checked for. No giants.
Travis: Sweet! Let's go! Up to the cave!
Matt: All right. So the fortress or the caves behind it?
Travis: Fortress or cave?
Laura: Were they both empty? I don't remember.
Taliesin: Everything was empty, if I recall.
Travis: Yeah. Small space.
Taliesin: Let's do the caves.
Laura: All right, sure. Cave.
Travis: Yeah. Cave.
Matt: All right.
Laura: Oh, if we stick to the woods, it's my favored terrain. If we go into a cave, not as much.
Sam: The caves would contain it. It can't fly away or anything.
Travis: So is it like, cave-fortress, are they same level? I can't remember.
Matt: It's a pathway that leads up into a small ravine in the mountain pass where you guys originally walked down into Whitestone. Up against the north side of where the mountain meets that ravine, there's a big stone fortress that is built into the side of the mountain, and then around that are a series of smaller caves.
Liam: (singing) Anything can happen in the woods.
Travis: Yeah, let's go to this fortress, then we got more room to move in case it does suck.
Sam: All right, fine, fortress.
Matt: You guys find your way inside, the cold morning air still has encompassed the stone floor itself, you can see there are still the scattered and slowly decomposing bits of meat and flesh in the far corner, you still see the splatters of blood that have turned black and cracked as it dried. No corpses here, as the corpses were retooled by the Briarwoods while they were in control. The fortress other than that is still empty, and seemingly untouched since you last left it.
Sam: All right, well, I'm just going to do it then!
Laura: Wait wait wait!
Marisha: Wait wait wait!
Marisha: Wait, there's doors open to the cave, right?
Sam: We're in a fortress.
Taliesin: We're in a fortress.
Marisha: Fortress. Whatever.
Matt: (laughs) Coffee's just starting to kick in for you guys.
Laura: Just barely! Do we have any buff spells or some shit that we should cast, to make us cooler?
Marisha: Should I throw a wall up?
Sam: A wall for what?
Marisha: Do I need to bar the entrance? Or are there doors?
Taliesin: Vex, by the way--
Matt: There are doors, but they're partially ajar where you left them.
Laura: Aww, put it on, it's useful!
Liam: No. We're not having this conversation.
Taliesin: Vex, by the way, I've got something for you.
Laura: What? Yes, dear?
Taliesin: And I pull out the arrow.
Laura: What is this?
Taliesin: This is an evening of unbridled guilt. Come here, let me show you. In theory, this is a siege arrow.
Laura: Okay.
Taliesin: Shattering stone, shattering doors, breaking things that should not be broken.
Laura: Breaking hearts left and right?
Taliesin: If that is what you're after. It should work! Never forget you're my favorite, and I'm so sorry.
Laura: I kiss him on the cheek. Thank you, Percy.
Taliesin: That was much nicer than your brother.
Laura: Is that a black eye?
Taliesin: (stammering) I didn't sleep.
Laura: Huh. This is lovely, I can't wait to use it.
Taliesin: There'll be more.
Sam: All right, in three, two--
Travis: Wait hold on, hold on hold on!
Taliesin: In a circle! Aim it into the center of the circle.
Liam: And is it three-two-one, three-two-one-do it, or three-two-one and go,
Sam: On the one. On one.
Taliesin: It's Jenga, one one-thousand two one-thousand three one-thousand four one-thousand.
Sam: Should one of us leave the room in case it comes out and paralyzes all of us? Just going to throw that out there.
Travis: Oh yeah, we should, what do you call it, spread out?
Laura: Yeah, definitely, let's all surround it and make sure we're not all clumped up.
Taliesin: If only someone had armor that could make them immune to paralysis.
Liam: That's not a bad idea, you get controlled by things. Maybe you could wait just a little bit further back?
Laura: This was somebody's pet, all right? It's probably not smart enough to take control of our minds.
Liam: That's a big if.
Travis: I don't mind stepping out, but I would like to be able to see.
Laura: Yeah yeah yeah!
Liam: Yeah! We won't shut the door, I just want you outside of any potential blast radius.
Taliesin: Let's spread out in a circle; we'll let it loose in the center, that way it can't even see all of us.
Laura: All right, I like it. It only gets to see Scanlan.
Sam: It can see me.
Laura: I'm going to stealth.
Sam: Well, when a thing is born, it latches on to the first thing it sees, like its mama.
Liam: Yes, we're going to hide.
Matt: All right, stealth check from both of you guys?
Marisha: So we're going to try and talk to it?
Laura: Yeah, Scanlan's going to talk to it.
Marisha: Scanlan? You prepared?
Laura: Natural 20!
Taliesin: You just teleport, there's like a phase effect.
Matt: The two of you back off and find the nearby shaded corners, where some of the haphazardly tossed hides and furs are in the corner, you vanish behind the alcoves keeping a watch.
Laura: Trinket, don't stand next to me, it gives it away. Go stand next to Keyleth!
Travis: Is there a doorway in the fortress?
Matt: Yeah, there's the main doorway you guys entered, which is two--
Travis: Can I stand in that, then?
Matt: Sure, you stand there, in the entranceway that's pushed open, which is wide enough for a giant to push through. You got a little bit of room to each side, but you're there.
Travis: Vax, is this g-- Vax?
Taliesin: It's fine, you're fine.
Sam: Here we go, guys.
Marisha: So, those two are stealthed-- I'm at Scanlan's left shoulder, back a bit.
Laura: And Trinket's next to you!
Marisha: And Trinket's next to me. I'm rolling with Trinket.
Taliesin: I've got a little bit of distance, yes, that's good.
Matt: All righty, and there's Percy here, and Travis is off this way. Good to know.
Sam: I don't know how to use this thing.
Marisha: Yeah, we don't know how to use it.
Sam: By the power of Raven's Slumber, I command thee: (yells) awaken! Beast! Cruel or otherwise! Face your new master, and know his name is Scanlan! (laughter)
Travis: (laughing) Oh, holy shit! Never could've been better.
Matt: As you spend your bonus action to release the gate hold on the crystal, you guys see as he thrusts his hands forward, there's a burst of shadow energy that, almost like someone throwing a big pot of water, this blackness goes out of it, and then as it hits the ground, it spills into smoke on the ground, and as that dark form stops, it is in the form of an about waist-to-lower-torso-height creature. As the form coalesces into its normal self, you can see before you, shaking its head, a rather large, dark grey and black wolf. (growls, snarls)
Sam: Easy, easy.
Travis: Told you it was a dog.
Sam: Garlic? Galdric, Galdric, easy, Galdric. Easy. We're friends. Here.
Matt: He's backing up a little bit, snarling. You see Trinket starts growling, (growls).
Laura: Trinket, be nice-- oh!
Matt: As you say that (snarls) it looks over at you in the far corner.
Laura: (whispers) I'm natural 20! That still didn't see me!
Marisha: I pet Trinket, like, 'Chill, chill, be cool'.
Matt: Trinket backs up a little bit, but still locking eyes. You can see this wolf now, its gums and teeth are bared, its fur is all puffed up, its tail is-- it's definitely holding its ground and trying to make itself look as intimidating as possible.
Sam: Is it a small beast?
Matt: This would be, technically, borderline medium. This'd be medium, technically.
Sam: I can only speak with small beasts.
Marisha: Wait, use Speak with Animals?
Liam: (laughs) She swatted me and said, 'Put your armor on,' so I'm doing it.
Matt: Okay. That'll take you about 15 minutes.
Laura: Aw.
Liam: 15 minutes! Well, guess I'm doing it.
Matt: All right. You don't just slip on leather armor. (chuckles)
Liam: No, I get that, I get that, I would've guessed two minutes.
Travis: Can somebody check to see if it's actually a wolf or just looks like one? Like, check it?
Laura: Can I use my perception?
Matt: You're a bit far away from it right now. You can try to get closer if you want.
Laura: Can I sneak?
Matt: Yeah, make another stealth check.
Laura: I do get advantage, because of my cloak. Sweet.
Liam: You should yell out, 'I'm stealthing'.
Laura: I'm stealthing! Damn it. 19?
Matt: Okay. As you begin making your way forward, it doesn't seem to notice you.
Laura: Hey, it doesn't?
Matt: No.
Laura: Can I see it better now to perceive it?
Matt: Looking right at it, and from your experience in the wild as well, and Keyleth, you're getting it, this does not appear to be anything beyond a large wolf.
Taliesin: I'm going to get on my knees and put out my hand and call it. Galdric, Galdric.
Matt: Go ahead and make an animal handling check.
Sam: Animal handling! We've never done that before!
Laura: If I help my brother get on the armor, will it happen faster?
Matt: Probably.
Laura: I help him put on the armor.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: (whispering) Ow ow ow! That's too tight!
Laura: Well, you're not the same size as the other guy!
Taliesin: Yeah, it's a little bit better. Ten.
Matt: Ten. As you put out your hand, Galdric snarls, and as you say, "Here, boy." (growls and snaps) It lashes out at your hand. That is going to be-- That's a 21 to hit?
Taliesin: I'll take it.
Travis: Keyleth, can't you talk to, like, plants and shit?
Matt: You take six points of piercing damage as its jaws clench down on your hand, and you tear your hand away. You can feel the warmth flowing under the glove.
Taliesin: Gently, I'm gentle with it.
Marisha: I cast Speak with Animals.
Liam: I click my Boots of Haste!
Matt: You do?
Sam: Aren't you getting dressed?
Laura: He can dress faster!
Travis: Speed change.
Matt: All right.
Travis: Quick change.
Sam: Seven-and-a-half minutes! (laughter)
Matt: You guys all become immediately aware of the creaking of leather in the distance as the two siblings are in the process of fast-changing one of the other.
Laura: The rustle of feathers.
Marisha: Okay, I cast Speak with Animals. And I crouch down to the ground. And bow down a little bit, and I say: are you the one they call Galdric?
Matt: Looks over at you for a second. The growl stops, and its posture changes a little bit. It raises its nose. (sniffs)
Marisha: Was Purvan your master?
Matt: Looking at you as you guys hear Keyleth making this series of growling sounds.
Laura: Trinket totally understands you, no?
Matt: Strangely enough, Trinket does, Trinket's like, (confused bear noise).
Taliesin: Trinket is Scooby-Doo, apparently.
Travis: Shitballs! Taint! You going that way?
Marisha: Oh my god, I get a secret!
Sam: There are several items that are sold out at the store! If you'd like to go on and see what items have already sold out, check it out. (laughs)
Laura: We need to get more t-shirts in stock.
Sam: Yeah, we know that. We know that, guys. We know.
Laura: That needs to happen. But there is still the Critical Role logo t-shirt available. What is happening? What is he--
Sam: Is there a ring or something?
Laura: Is the ring still available?
Sam: I don't know.
Laura: If the ring is still available, check out our ring!
Marisha: I can respond back, right? Your master died a great champion for the Raven Queen. He has been paid a great honor, and now the Raven Queen has chosen a new master.
Laura: I push Vax forward.
Matt: You've gotten maybe part of the tunic on. (laughter)
Sam: Is he Donald-Duck-ing it right now?
Matt: Practically. There are undergarments, but not much. It's, like, bare legs and knees, part of an arm. Yeah, he got thrust out of the changing room about 20 seconds into it.
Sam: Nice.
Liam: I still walk toward the wolf.
Taliesin: Waddle.
Liam: No no no, I did the top, I did the top, c'mon!
Matt: The wolf turns his head a little bit curiously.
Marisha: I continue to speak to the wolf.
Liam: And I kneel. And bow my head.
Marisha: A great darkness has fallen upon our lands. Upon Othanzia. We could use all of the assistance that we can achieve. Would you be willing to find a new purpose? Join Vax'ildan--
Liam: Keyleth?
Marisha: Yes?
Liam: Tell him to come forward and look into my eyes.
Laura: (whispers) That's a bad idea for dogs.
Liam: Tell him.
Laura: (whispers) It's gonna bite your face off.
Marisha: Galdric. Please. Approach your new master and look into his eyes.
Laura: Give him some chocolate, man!
Matt: The wolf looks towards you, looks towards the loosely half-dressed half-elf.
Marisha: Look into his eyes. I said look into his eyes. And see the touch of the Raven Queen inside of him.
Matt: Wolf slowly stalks towards you across the stone floor. You can hear the claws of the wolf clattering against the stonework. As you can see it's partially, like, digging into the stonework with each step. It has purpose with each stride.
Liam: As it's coming, I'm taking daggers out and throwing 'em on the ground.
Matt: The wolf stops and looks up at you. Turns around and walks towards the doorway where you are.
Sam: Where who is?
Matt: Where Grog is. Grog, who's now at the door, at the exit.
Laura: (whispers) What's his name?
Taliesin: Galdric.
Marisha: Galdric.
Marisha: Galdric!
Matt: Keeps walking.
Laura: Galdric!
Sam: Going to stop him, Grog?
Travis: Well, I'm in the doorway.
Marisha: Grog, don't move. Don't move. Look at the dog. Don't move, and don't hurt the dog. Please just look at the dog.
Laura: I pull out one of my treats I have for Trinket.
Matt: Okay. Trinket starts lumbering up towards you (thudding).
Laura: Wait, wait, Trinket-- This is for your buddy Galdric. Galdric!
Matt: Just keeps walking, doesn't even look at you in the face, walks--
Laura: I throw the treat and say, hey!
Matt: It scatters across the stone. Walks between your legs and exits out.
Travis: I pivot on my back foot. I take out Craven Edge--
Taliesin: No!
Travis: No, I do, I take out Craven Edge and I sink it into the earth right beside his head. And I say, (shouts) heel!
Matt: Make an animal handling check.
Laura: Whoa, is it good, is it good?
Travis: 20.
Matt: As the sword (crack) into the rock outside of this fortress, it probably embeds itself a good foot and a half into the mountain. You guys all hear Grog's shout echo through the inside of the fortress itself, causing little bits of dust and small pebbles to dislodge from the roof, slowly fall down. The wolf has stopped and spun in its place and reached out and lashed the blade with its jaws and (cling) as it releases it.
Travis: Stay.
Matt: He sits.
Travis: That went well! (laughter)
Sam: Dog whisperer!
Travis: Good pup.
Sam: Are you its master now?
Travis: No, no, I don't think it has a master. This is a very powerful beast. But it needs a firm hand. And I think it needs a job. So. What do we plan to do with Galdric? Said his name right?
Sam: Yeah.
Laura: We plan on having him help us kill some dragons?
Taliesin: I think he's a wolf. I think perhaps something a little less ambitious.
Laura: Trinket hides very well when dragons are around.
Taliesin: I think, perhaps, joining the Whitestone conclave might be a-- Having him guard Whitestone, perhaps.
Laura: Good, yeah! I like it!
Travis: I reach into the Bag of Holding and I pull out one thing of dry food rations, and a probably pretty rotten chunk of dark elf brain.
Liam: Where did we get that?
Travis: Oh, there's a veritable Walmart of shit in this bag. (laughter)
Travis: And I, like a hamburger patty, smash it all together.
Matt: The only reason you even know this was at one point dark elf brain matter is because that's what you willed to reach in and find. It does not at all visually match your memory of its--
Travis: Does it have a little bit of a viscous-y ooze, mostly?
Matt: Oh yeah, no, it's--
Travis: It'll soften up the dry food.
Liam: Gray Chicken McNuggets.
Matt: It'll soften up a lot of things. It's pretty terrifying.
Laura: It'll make the wolf vomit.
Travis: So I throw that on the ground, and I pour a little ale on top of it. (laughter)
Sam: Wolves love getting drunk.
Matt: Very good. It leans forward and smells it.
Travis: Yeah, no, it wasn't the best, I can do better. Okay.
Laura: Trinket goes up and starts eating it.
Travis: He's going to barf that all over the carpet later.
Liam: Forget the chocolate.
Travis: I need to carry beef in this bitch.
Taliesin: It goes bad.
Liam: We have Dork! We've got nothing of Dork left?
Laura: Oh, you know what I have, by the way? I still have, like, a cooler Bag of Holding. That we got from the Slayer's Take.
Travis: Oh! That's really good to know.
Travis: I pour into a little chalice some ale.
Laura: Like, it keeps things cold. Yeah, it's like a little bitty one, but it keeps parts from going bad.
Matt: It's nowhere near as large as a Bag of Holding, but it has a slow stasis for organic goods.
Sam: We should keep some food on hand next time!
Laura: Totally!
Travis: I offer him some ale, just to see if he even likes it. Some dogs like beer, some others don't.
Matt: Mm. Wolf doesn't seem to be interested.
Travis: Yeah, all right. Then I chug it.
Sam: So are we telling this wolf something or commanding it to come with us as we return to town?
Taliesin: I think he would be helpful to guard the town, at this point.
Laura: Well, he'll follow Grog, I suppose.
Sam: Let's go back to town and bring him with us.
Travis: All right.
Matt: You guys return to Whitestone. It's another, like, three-hour trek to find your way back down to the city. Stalks up next to you. Definitely seems to be attentive to your commands. Doesn't appear to be a bond per se, but of everyone that it's encountered so far, you're the only one that really gathered its respect.
Laura: I threw a treat at it. I don't understand.
Travis: That's a great thing to throw at a giant 400-pound bull mastiff.
Marisha: I spoke words at it. Apparently that's not good enough. Communicating.
Travis: Right, so we're walking back to town. We've got a giant fuck-off wolf with us. Vax looks like Edward Scissorhands.
Liam: I'm peeling that off as we walk.
Laura: What?
Travis: What?
Travis: No!
Laura: Leave it the fuck on!
Liam: I'm peeling it off.
Laura: It's really expensive. What, do you want to damage it?
Liam: I'm peeling it off.
Laura: (quietly) Fuck, he doesn't appreciate presents.
Matt: All right, so you take what little bit of the armor you had on, off, and are you putting your other armor back on?
Laura: He doesn't have any other armor. I took his armor.
Liam: I have regular fucking armor that I grew up in with you, you fucking shit.
Sam: Do you want to trade with me, Vax? I've got some armor you could take.
Travis: Yeah.
Liam: You're a funny man.
Matt: All right, so you're back in town and you have a wolf.
Travis: Do we find a holding pen for the wolf?
Taliesin: I don't think we need to. I think we can communicate to him--
Laura: No. Tell him not to attack villagers.
Taliesin: Ask him if he'll be willing to keep the town safe.
Laura: Do it in a really aggressive way, though, Keyleth. Stern.
Marisha: Very aggressive? Okay. Okay.
Sam: We should find some food for the thing, too.
Marisha: If I turned into a dog. If I turned into a wolf, do you think he'd respect me more?
Laura: No, he'll probably attack you.
Travis: He'll mount you.
Laura: Or he'll bone you.
Taliesin: I'm not ready for that game.
Sam: Do it.
Travis: Let's be clear. (laughter)
Laura: Matt's like, "mm-mm."
Liam: Oh, you soured the DM. (laughter)
Taliesin: To be fair, that's happened before.
Laura: Yeah, I remember.
Taliesin: With the troll.
Travis: With the troll. It was so good. That was you, wasn't it?
Taliesin: No, it wasn't me. Was it you?
Sam: I don't know.
Travis: Who was getting humped on?
Taliesin: I don't remember.
Sam: Finalize this wolf so we can go kill something.
Marisha: I take my staff and I say, Galdric! I'm being assertive.
Liam: Yes.
Sam: She's the alpha.
Laura: (whispering) Grog, go stand behind her.
Marisha: You want a task? I'll give you one.
Matt: All right. How long does Speak With--
Marisha: I don't know.
Matt: It lasts for ten minutes, so you can cast it again. It's first level.
Marisha: Oh, has it not been ten minutes?
Matt: It has been more than ten minutes. It took you three hours to return.
Marisha: Okay, we walked back? Okay, I'll cast it again.
Matt: All righty.
Marisha: Can I cast Speak With Animals on other people? I can't, right? No.
Matt: All right, so as you shout, go ahead and make an animal handling check, with advantage because of your ability to speak.
Marisha: With advantage?
Matt: Yes.
Marisha: I'll take the-- what is that, 16? Plus a six, so 22.
Matt: Okay. Galdric turns to you and essentially leans towards you and you get the essence, the idea of a message across, and to keep me from having to walk behind now, at this point, as you guys have managed to make seeming amends at the moment, employs the idea of, "I'll listen if you give me a task."
Marisha: He talked back.
Laura: Have him guard the village.
Marisha: Okay. (louder) Galdric. Only a beast of your great fortitude--
Laura: Just fucking tell him to do it!
Marisha: Right, okay. Sorry. Would you like to guard--
Sam: It's a command.
Marisha: -- the town, Whitestone? (shouting) Guard this town, dog.
Travis: Keyleth, repeat after me.
Marisha: Yes.
Travis: In exchange for food, protect these lands.
Marisha: Galdric. In exchange for food, shelter, and a cozy fire every once in awhile--
Travis: I didn't say that shit. I didn't say that. He's a wolf. He doesn't need those.
Marisha: Patrol these lands.
Laura: Protect these lands.
Marisha: Protect these lands.
Travis: (quietly) Holy shit.
Matt: "For how long?"
Laura: (laughs) He already asked that.
Marisha: Why does he want details? Why does the dog want--
Laura: As long as we need you to.
Travis: No, no. A great danger approaches.
Taliesin: Until the danger has passed.
Travis: You'll know it when it comes.
Marisha: (clears throat) A great danger--
Laura: Approaches!
Marisha: Approaches! A great danger approaches. Your service is required until that danger--
Taliesin: Has passed.
Marisha: Has passed! Is no longer in effect. You'll know. You'll know, because they're fucking dragons, man. You'll know. Protect--
Travis: I walk over and put my hand over Keyleth's mouth. You stay. We feed you. Is there a tavern or a butcher shop or something nearby?
Matt: There is a butcher. As you're having this thought, however, Galdric turns back over to you and says, "I can feed myself."
Laura: Yeah, you can.
Matt: "But I will watch until this danger has passed."
Laura: Awesome.
Matt: "Then am I free to go?"
Marisha: Then you are free to go.
Matt: "Very well. I grow tired of service. I wait too long." And the wolf looks at you, gives you like an acknowledgement, and then walks off into the woods.
Laura: Bye, buddy!
Marisha: Thanks, Galdric. Appreciate it, man.
Laura: Man, that's a cool-looking wolf.
Marisha: I look at Grog. How was that? Did that sound okay?
Travis: That was the dumbest thing I've ever heard. (laughter)
Taliesin: You did good, you did good.
Sam: I thought she did very well.
Marisha: Thank you. It really liked you. You should learn how to talk to animals.
Laura: What is that? What is that you have? What is that?
Taliesin: I'm holding onto the Raven's Slumber jewel at the moment.
Sam: The thing that can capture evil.
Taliesin: It's empty now, and do you know what I bet would fit in it very nicely?
Travis: Me.
Laura: And we can carry him around and then pop him out. Wait, okay, wait. Is it going to hurt him? Does it hurt him? Is it like, it's bad?
Sam: Not only does it not hurt him, he does not age or feel any pain.
Travis: A willing creature need not make a saving throw.
Taliesin: It's automatic, and no time passes.
Laura: Okay, I'm going to try it, and I'm going to try it, and just to see how he likes it. If he's okay with it.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Hey, buddy, come here.
Matt: As you turn around and look, you see there's a small puddle on the ground where Trinket has vomited up. He's pushing dirt over it.
Travis: Yeah, you got to teach him to quit rummaging, that is really foul.
Laura: What was that? Trinket, what did you eat? Don't eat the puke. Do not eat the puke. Come here.
Matt: Trinket's like scraping dirt over it.
Travis: Got a carrot on your chin.
Laura: Trinket. Do you want to go for a ride? You like rides? Yeah? You want to go for one? All right, sit still. This'll be fun. I don't know how to use it.
Taliesin: Just point, yep.
Laura: I point to him with the--
Sam: You should probably say something cool.
Laura: By the power vested in me, I now pronounce you my Pokemon. (laughter)
Matt: Words be damned. It takes you an action or so to activate the crystal, but as you do, Trinket gives a confused look before Trinket's shadow seems to crawl up his legs until it forms into this circle, this dark core, roughly half the size of Trinket's form, before it shoots into the crystal.
Laura: Is he about this size, but I don't like that one, is he about this size?
Matt: A little larger than that before he goes into the crystal, but once he's in the crystal, it's small.
Laura: Oh, it's a little crystal?
Liam: Trinkachu, I choose you.
Laura: (gasps) Oh my gosh. That's really fun. Okay. How do I let him go?
Marisha: I think you-- yeah.
Laura: I release you.
Matt: Okay. As you do that, once again the same dark energy you saw earlier spills out and hits the ground in front of you, and from that dark shadow area Trinket's form emerges, standing there looking really confused.
Laura: How was it? Did it hurt? Can you talk to him? You can still talk to him. Talk to him. Ask him if it hurt.
Matt: (vomiting noises) Vomits a little bit more on the ground.
Laura: Well, that's not good.
Marisha: You know, sometimes the teleportation makes you lose your lunch.
Laura: Ask him how he's doing.
Marisha: Trinket? You all right buddy? You all right, there?
Matt: "Feeling sick."
Laura: Ask him how the little car ride was, ask him if he liked the ride.
Marisha: How was the ride? Did you feel all right? How was--?
Matt: "Yeah?"
Laura: Okay, would you mind, ask him if he'd mind doing that on occasion, you know, whenever I need him to.
Marisha: What was it like in there? Was it--?
Matt: "I don't remember."
Marisha: Okay, that's good, that's good. Would you mind--
Laura: Ask him if he cares if I do it again, ask him if he cares.
Marisha: Would you mind doing that, you know, frequently? On occasion. MATT "If she wants me to, okay."
Laura: What did he say, what did he say? He looked really cute when he said something.
Marisha: You have a lot of men who will do anything for you.
Laura: Oh, buddy! I go and hug him really tight and scratch his ears.
Matt: You do, and avoid the little bit of--
Laura: --vomit on, I don't even care! Oh my gosh, thank you! This is the best, this is the best and we can travel with him, we can climb with him, we can sneak around.
Sam: Hey, and if Trinket isn't in it, you can also use it to capture baddies.
Laura: I know, it's great!
Taliesin: And because of the way that the projection works, you could also in theory capture a baddie and then let them loose off a cliff and watch them drop.
Laura: Oh my god.
Marisha: Oh my god, you're right.
Taliesin: It's very convenient.
Laura: Oh my gosh. Okay.
Matt: So. You have a crystal, you've set a wolf on a path.
Sam: Where are we going next?
Matt: Where are you going now?
Taliesin: Your home, I imagine.
Laura: Don't we need to--oh, yeah.
Sam: What's our to-do list?
Marisha: We don't have to worry about it. We can, it's fine.
Taliesin: Fire Ashari it is.
Sam: Wait, wait, wait. What are the things that we need to do?
Laura: We need to check in on Keyleth's family.
Sam: Cobalt Reserve, Ashari.
Laura: Grog's family.
Sam: Did we already take care of Osysa's mate, Frostweald?
Laura: No, but that's down--
Taliesin: That's far.
Marisha: That's the other Vestige, correct?
Laura: Yes, that's over by Grog's family.
Matt: That's information about the Vestiges.
Sam: We need to steal an airship.
Taliesin: I agree, that's still very important.
Travis: I can't remember where, what--
Laura: They were by Kraghammer.
Travis: Thank you. I'm having terrible hiccups.
Sam: What about, we need to find Kaylie at some point. We also need to, who's gone, where's Allu-- where's Ki-- where's people?
Laura: Allura should be here in like a day. She should be here very soon.
Travis: What's close to here? (hiccups)
Taliesin: Nothing's close, we're specifically far away from everything.
Marisha: But we can go wherever we want as long as we've been there before.
Travis: Well, we should definitely go to the Fire Ashari.
Taliesin: Fire Ashari is the next--
Laura: We should go to the Fire Ashari.
Marisha: Oh god, I'm immediately nauseous.
Matt: (bear noises)
Liam: That's two of us.
Marisha: Oh, Trinket, buddy. What time is it?
Laura: (laughs) Do you need some water?
Matt: It's still, with the travel to and from, it's middle afternoon, like one o'clock in the afternoon.
Taliesin: Take it.
Sam: If we're going to go, do we need anything before we leave? We got everything we need? Potions and stuff? Want to buy some meat for your cooler?
Laura: Yeah, let's get some meat.
Matt: It's pretty easy to go ahead and procure it, five gold of meat will fill that thing.
Laura: Yeah!
Matt: So go ahead and mark five gold off your paper.
Sam: How much, could I buy a medical kit somewhere?
Matt: Yeah, you could find a general store and purchase a medical kit.
Sam: How much is that?
Matt: I'm going to look that up right now.
Sam: All right, whatever, I've got it.
Taliesin: It's nifty that you have a book that tells you how much something like that costs.
Matt: Imagine that. It's like it's a handbook of some kind, it's crazy.
Marisha: Does anyone have any fire-resistant items?
Laura: He does.
Liam: I do.
Laura: Put it on.
Marisha: I might pick up some fire resistant potions as well.
Travis: I have this black iron plate that I haven't used ever. 'While wearing this heavy plate 'armor, the bearer gains resistance to any fire damage.'
Matt: Five gold for an herbalist's kit for you.
Laura: Oh, plate armor, none of us can wear it but Pike.
Matt: An herbalist's kit, like five gold.
Sam: Can that stabilize people?
Matt: If used with a medicine check, yeah.
Laura: Okay, I have this, which I can't wear.
Taliesin: What is that?
Laura: It's a purple and black robe. It was Lady Briarwood's robes.
Taliesin: What does it do?
Laura: Clings to nearby darkness as you walk. While wearing this robe, you gain resistance to piercing damage. Anybody need pierce resistance that can wear robes?
Taliesin: I'm pretty reasonable.
Sam: Do I wear robes?
Matt: Robes would be worn instead of your armor.
Sam: No thanks.
Laura: What about Gloves of Missile Snaring? That appeal to anyone?
Sam: Missile snaring? What does that do?
Laura: These gloves seem to almost meld into your hands when you don them, and when a ranged weapon attack hits you, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage by 1d10 plus your dexterity modifier provided that you have a free hand. If you reduce the damage to zero, you can catch the missile if it's small enough to hold in that hand.
Taliesin: Does it require attuning?
Marisha: They're pretty sleek.
Laura: It requires two, no it just requires one free hand.
Taliesin: Yes, but does it require attuning?
Laura: Yes it does, it requires attuning.
Taliesin: I might be attuned out at this point.
Laura: Anybody? I feel like that could be cool for you, Scanlan.
Sam: I think I can take it?
Taliesin: What's your dex? Your dexterity is not very-- actually, it might work out well for me, weirdly enough.
Marisha: Are you fully attuned?
Taliesin: I can undo something that I'm not using.
Marisha: Percy, you have access here in Whitestone to alchemy supplies, correct?
Taliesin: Matt, I have access to alchemy supplies here in Whitestone, correct?
Matt: (laughs) I mean, there are elements of your initial workshop I guess, that a lot of supplies have been cannibalized but a few things can be pieced together. Plus there was a lot of alchemical elements and tools that were utilized in the subterranean tunnels as part of the refinement process for the whitestone residuum, the large vats of acid that were distilled by the Briarwoods while they were here, and there are other elements of their own tinkering in the alchemical arts that remain scattered throughout the castle. So yeah, you can definitely find enough to tinker with if you want.
Marisha: I mean, we could take the rest of the evening and I can attempt to make some fire resist potions.
Sam: Eh.
Travis: All right, here's what I'm thinking, right? I mean, if we go after my herd, we're in for a fight. A big one. If we go to your Fire Ashari, we're doing recon and hopefully learning something, right?
Marisha: Well, we're going to be in for a fight at the Fire Ashari as well because there's a giant sunder in the fire plane, and last time I checked there were fire imps and elementals pouring through there.
Travis: Are those bad?
Taliesin: Eh.
Marisha: They're annoying
Taliesin: As long as we're quick we can go about it.
Marisha: Well.
Sam: What's our mission?
Travis: You really want to get the rest of the testicles of--
Marisha: I mean, we could theoretically see if there are survivors and I can attempt to close the tear in the plane. I don't know if I can do that. However, I don't know anyone else particularly more qualified to attempt it.
Travis: Allura or that bearded dude.
Marisha: We're talking about the Fire Ashari and possibly what to do there.
Laura: Oh.
Marisha: We can go and look for survivors--
Laura: And bring them here.
Marisha: And someone should probably close the tear in the fire plane.
Laura: Should we wait for Allura then, before we go?
Travis: Well, if there are survivors, they might not be that way for very long if we don't go.
Laura: They've been there for a while already.
Marisha: If there are survivors--
Laura: Then they're surviving.
Marisha: They've survived. I agree. It's not going to be pretty.
Taliesin: I know you don't want to go.
Marisha: I really don't.
Taliesin: But we need to go. I say we take the rest of the day. You make your potions, we leave first thing in the morning.
Laura: Wait for Allura, hopefully she'll be here by then.
Taliesin: Maybe Allura will join us by tomorrow morning. If not, we teleport over.
Matt: Okay, you guys are going to rest for the evening?
Travis: Wait, hold on, is there like a house of entertainment in Whitestone? I know it's just getting back on its feet but you know.
Matt: That would be a question more for Percival.
Travis: Percy? I'm having a bit of a soul struggle and I'm wondering if I might bend your ear for a moment.
Taliesin: Sure.
Travis: Yeah, could I speak to you over here?
Taliesin: Yes, of course.
Travis: Right, so, like, I want to get my freak on.
Taliesin: I don't feel that way about you. (laughter)
Travis: Yeah, no, I, I'm sorry.
Taliesin: I mean, you're very attractive.
Travis: That was very unclear. So I know this is like your home and stuff and you might not have been aware of it, but they have these houses where like....
Taliesin: Oh, where you get your freak on!
Travis: Yes.
Taliesin: Yes. Yes, we have them.
Travis: Oh good, do you think they're still in order?
Taliesin: Oh, I imagine so.
Travis: Could you point me in that direction?
Taliesin: No, I have no idea where they are. I do know that they exist. I actually had things to do here. I didn't have time for these.
Travis: Oh yeah, me too, important things. I was thinking for Scanlan in case he gets bored, you know, you've got to keep him focused.
Taliesin: I wouldn't actually know where any of these places were, would I?
Matt: No, and those that did exist in this town have not been...
Taliesin: I figured as much. I'm just fucking with him. Okay. No.
Travis: Oh, okay, well, I'll let Scanlan know. Just keep it between you and me 'cause he's very sensitive about these things.
Taliesin: Your secret is safe with my indifference. That's fine.
Travis: Well, my, my, indifference
Taliesin: I know you do.
Travis: Yep.
Taliesin: You're wonderful.
Marisha: Can I start telling that to people in real life?
Taliesin: Yes you can. I do it all the time.
Marisha: Yes. Your secret is safe with my indifference.
Travis: Okay. I'm going to rest.
Sam: Before we set off on this, is there anything closer or more pressing? I don't actually know why we're going to her place, but I'm fine with it.
Marisha: To look for survivors and close the giant tear in the fire plane that evil, well not evil, fiery entities are pouring through.
Taliesin: It's a hellmouth, it's basically a hellmouth.
Travis: It's either that or we go goliath hunting.
Laura: That's next.
Taliesin: But this is quick, this is something that we can knock off the list.
Sam: All right, let's knock it off.
Travis: Yeah, right, let's just check it off.
Liam: As we're walking through town, do I see any weaponsmiths?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Liam: Okay.
Taliesin: I'll help you make the potions.
Liam: 21.
Matt: Okay, that'll help cut down on the time. 21? There are two functional smiths left in the town. There were two more than that overall, that were more like blacksmithy, but they both unfortunately lost their lives in the insurrection. But there are two functional blacksmiths in this, yeah.
Liam: And one's nearby, to pass through?
Matt: About a ten-minute diversion.
Liam: I'm splitting off from the group.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: We've got to get out of here.
Liam: One's in front of me now?
Matt: Well, you find your way to-- it's a small blacksmith, and most of it's outside. Though the day is growing late, you do see an older gentleman, long, tattered grey hair pulled into a very tight bun in the back and a beard that is actually tied off to the side. Otherwise it would be hanging down into his work. He's wearing soot-covered clothes, big leather apron, leather gloves, and he's currently in the process of (ping ping) turning over and hammering out a piece of orange glowing steel.
Liam: Excuse me, sorry to interrupt, I have a very simple request.
Matt: He doesn't stop. He seems to, he acknowledges your presence but he's still working as he's listening. (smithing sounds)
Liam: I have six gold burning a hole in my pocket. I'm not looking for anything simple. Do you have a short sword? A regular old shortsword.
Matt: (ting) He looks over at you. "If that's what you're looking for, on that wall over there we've got two shortswords." (ting)
Liam: What's the difference between the two that I can see?
Matt: (smithing sounds) That you can see? Make a perception check.
Liam: 22.
Matt: Looking over them both, from this distance, they're both made with different hilt designs and different pommel designs, the grips are a little different but other than that the blades are pretty much identical.
Liam: I grab one off the wall. I slap down six gold, which I know is way too much and say, thank you sir. Pelor lives here. And I walk away.
Matt: Okay, as you start walking away he goes, "Hey."
Liam: Yeah?
Matt: "You're going to pay proper for that shortsword."
Liam: Oh, I'm sorry. How much does it cost?
Matt: "12 gold pieces."
Liam: My apologies. 12?
Matt: "12 gold pieces, friend."
Liam: So I put down six. I put down another 14. I really apologize. I was just confused.
Matt: "It's all right. No harm no foul." Takes the gold and scoops it and puts it into his pouch. "Have a good day."
Liam: I walk down the street going like-- it's big.
Matt: It's much bigger than you're used to, but it's got a fine balance to it and it's well-made. All right, so as you guys have all--
Laura: I've got an opal dagger you could have used.
Liam: I don't need your dagger.
Taliesin: We're going to make our potions?
Matt: Yes, yes. All right, so.
Marisha: I have another question.
Matt: What is your other question?
Marisha: Before we all go to bed tonight can we get like a fuckton of the green stone under Whitestone?
Taliesin: There's really not a lot of it.
Marisha: Say like $1,000 worth and maybe have like a real nice Heroes' Feast before tomorrow?
Liam: Wise as fuck.
Laura: Or in the morning.
Liam: Heroes' Breakfast.
Marisha: I've got to do it at night, because I have to Tree Stride in the morning.
Matt: You can choose either to create the potion or to mine the residuum for the evening. You cannot do both. Both are time, like, to pull that material from the-- because most of it that remains has been already embedded within the ziggurat beneath. You would actually have to physically chip it from the structure.
Laura: I have a plan, Keyleth.
Marisha: Yes?
Laura: We will cover the 1,000 gold from our own party funds and have someone here mine some shit for us and give it to us later.
Marisha: I like that plan, yeah. Sounds good to me.
Sam: How about the wolf?
Taliesin: So potions.
Laura: Percival, do you have people here who can mine? Looking for work, people--?
Marisha: Yeah, sure, why not?
Taliesin: I'll let them know that they should start trying to pull the residuum out of the wall, but it's dangerous down there.
Laura: Yeah, it is.
Taliesin: And tampering with it is definitely...
Travis: Necessary.
Taliesin: Should be ginger. It would, I'm trying to keep everything ginger down there.
Laura: So maybe we should take 1,000 gold just from your family stores then, huh? That might be smarter.
Taliesin: We currently have 1,000 gold from my family stores that are in the group treasury at the moment.
Laura: Oh, we do. No, that's 500. That was just 500. Just so you know.
Taliesin: I feel like it was more than that.
Laura: No, it was just 500.
Liam: Hey, de Rolo, do you remember what happened yesterday?
Taliesin: He's not there.
Laura: Isn't he, though?
Taliesin: I was going to do such a nice thing for you, but never mind now.
Laura: (laughs) No, no, no, do something really nice for me.
Liam: Where did I go? Oh, I went to buy a shortsword.
Taliesin: No, never mind. You went to buy a shortsword.
Laura: Dear, dear, dear, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Do nice things. All right?
Taliesin: I'm trying to be gentle with my family right now. They're taking on an awful lot.
Laura: You're right. They're taking on so many people.
Taliesin: And we'll see what we can do.
Liam: I'd like to think you hear me in your mind.
Taliesin: Always fucking hear you in my mind.
Laura: Let's just use the damned party funds for the time being. It's fine, Keyleth. This is a really important feast.
Taliesin: We're busy making potions.
Laura: All right.
Matt: So you prepare a Heroes' Feast before you begin this potion-creation process? Is that what I understand or not?
Laura: What?
Marisha: Can I make some potions and then, like, I make dinner for us before we go to bed?
Matt: It's going to take you about the length of a day to create the potion, with his help it takes it to about half, so it'll be about 12 hours of creating. Eight to 12 hours. So.
Travis: Pick one.
Taliesin: Pick one.
Marisha: I'll do a damn feast.
Taliesin: No potion?
Matt: You can do the potion as well. The feast only takes a moment to cast.
Marisha: All right, okay. Yeah.
Matt: I'm just saying, be aware that you guys will probably have, if you want to get a full rest after that potion creation process, you're going to have to wait until like this time tomorrow, like late in the day to make your journey. Which is fine, if you're willing to be patient about it.
Travis: Sure.
Matt: Yes, no?
Travis: Say one, just say one.
Marisha: Yeah, let's do it, let's do it. Let's go in prepared and then we can always rest on that side.
Matt: Cool. For a fine, fine dinner.
Laura: Just want to make sure we feast right before we leave so that it's most useful.
Matt: All right, so. You, everyone else goes to sleep while you and Percy work tirelessly through the night. If I could have you--
Liam: Fuck!
Matt: (laughs) Just for the sake of it, I want you to go ahead and make an arcana check.
Marisha: Aw, an arcana? Do I get advantage because of my little skill in alchemy? I'm skilled in alchemy.
Matt: Yeah. Oh, that's right you are, never mind, go ahead and do that.
Matt: Proficiency bonus, are you proficient in alchemy?
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: So proficiency bonus, and for this, use intellect modifier.
Marisha: Okay. Intellect, which makes it plus seven. Do I have advan-- ooh, I rolled a natural 19.
Matt: Okay. We'll say, for the fair cost of, reduced due to the roll, 450 gold pieces, you create a potion of resistance of your choice of resistance.
Marisha: Just one?
Matt: Just one.
Marisha: Fire.
Matt: It takes a long time, man.
Marisha: Fire!
Matt: Fire, all right. You create a potion of fire resistance. The materials cost you 450 gold to create, you finish it by about sunrise the next day. Everyone else begins slowly waking up after the night's rest as you guys both, bags under your eyes.
Laura: Oh, that was a good night's sleep, I tell you what.
Travis: Seriously.
Sam: Keyleth, could you--
Marisha: What? Oh, god, you snuck up on me.
Sam: Could you make me some tea real quick?
Marisha: Scanlan.
Sam: What?
Marisha: Go fuck yourself.
Sam: What, you were up before me, I thought--
Taliesin: All right. All right, this is fine.
Marisha: This is fine.
Taliesin: This is good.
Marisha: This is great.
Matt: You're doing a Heroes' Feast for breakfast, then? Is that how it's working?
Marisha: I'll take a nap. I'll cook breakfast, guys, good morning. Good morning!
Laura: Oh hey, good morning, Keyleth!
Sam: Why don't you sleep during the day, we'll all take our feast, and then blast off at night time?
Marisha: Because I have to teleport and cooking this feast are both 6th-level spells and I can only do one of those a day.
Travis: Man, it's hard being a druid.
Laura: Can anybody else make a feast? That's here?
Marisha: Pike. Pike. Pike?
Sam: She's with Gilmore.
Travis: She's not here.
Laura: (sighs) I miss Pike.
Liam: We all miss Pike.
Marisha: I'll cook breakfast, guys.
Laura: No, I'll cook breakfast. No, I won't cook breakfast.
Liam: That's a good idea, for you to not cook breakfast.
Matt: What's the plan?
Marisha: I'm cooking breakfast!
Matt: Are you cooking breakfast or are you summoning breakfast? That's my question.
Laura: Are you summoning breakfast and then you're sleeping and then we're leaving?
Marisha: I'm summoning-- yes, I'm summoning breakfast and then I'm sleeping.
Laura: And then you're sleeping and then we're leaving as soon as you wake up.
Matt: Okay, that's what I was wondering. We got the answer, okay, cool. Hoo, today's been a slog. All right, so you go ahead and you use Heroes' Feast, summoning forth a fantastical breakfast meal filled with coffee and eggs and everything you would hope for, the finest materials.
Laura: Froot Loops!
Matt: (laughs) Sure, Froot Loops is on the menu, why not?
Taliesin: Lucky Charms.
Matt: No Lucky Charms, sorry, those aren't available on Tal'Dorei. But yes, all you guys take an hour to finish devouring this, you finish your meal, all you guys get a 2d10 hit point maximum increase to your hit points.
Laura: Ooh, ooh, greens, greens!
Matt: And immune to poison, frightened, and all wisdom saving throws have advantage.
Travis: Damn!
Sam: Advantage on wisdom.
Matt: Yes, the usual.
Travis: Almost broke.
Marisha: And wisdom.
Laura: And you're immune to fear, right?
Marisha: Immune to fear, poison, and what else?
Matt: And you get advantage on wisdom saving throws.
Sam: Okay.
Matt: After which, Percy and Keyleth pretty much fall asleep at the table as it vanishes and they both collapse to the ground, eggs out of the corner of their mouth. Eventually they make themselves back up to sleep and the rest of you guys peter around for the remainder of the day while they get their full rest. It now comes to, at the end of that eight-hour period of time, I'd say about three, four in the afternoon before they finally wake up. You've restored your spells.
Marisha: Yay!
Matt: And the rest of you are ready to go about your business.
Laura: Let's go, let's go, let's go.
Liam: Wait! While they're sleeping, right--
Matt: Mm-hmm?
Liam: I take Scanlan aside.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Oi.
Liam: Hey, buddy.
Sam: Hey, friendo.
Liam: Yeah.
Sam: What's up?
Liam: We don't talk a lot.
Sam: Well, we start to and then you leave the room, usually. (laughter)
Liam: I don't handle personal emotional confrontation very well.
Sam: It's okay. I walk away. (laughter)
Marisha: Oh, shit!
Sam: Then I come back, I feel bad.
Taliesin: No, no, that was perfect.
Liam: Where did you go?
Sam: Just kidding, just kidding.
Liam: Pull up a chair, sit down, I want to ask you something.
Sam: I'm already as low as I can go.
Liam: You're right. How do you do it?
Sam: How do I do what?
Liam: How do you do it? You're risking your life as much as anyone in this group, you're almost dying every day. You're fucking smiling all the time. How do you do it? I'm kind of asking as Liam to Sam as well, but mostly as Vax to Scanlan. How do you do it? You almost died yesterday as well. Or two days ago, fuck. Why do you do it?
Sam: Well, Vax. I don't know, I mean, I like you people, okay? Everything before this was not as good. This is better. That's why. It's very simple. You had a shitty childhood, didn't you? You and the sister?
Liam: Yeah.
Sam: I think Grog had some troubles. We've all had our share of shit before we all met. Now we're together, we're a family, this is better. That's how I smile. It's better than it was before. That's it.
Liam: We're probably going to die in the next month.
Sam: Yes, but it's fun while it lasts.
Liam: All right. Thought I might--
Sam: Glean some wisdom?
Liam: Yeah, but I'm just as confused as before.
Sam: Listen, I'm older than you.
Liam: How much older?
Sam: A bit. I've seen more than you have. And it's all shitty, so it just depends on how you look at it. You can dwell on the shit, or you can just leave it behind in people's beds and keep going.
Marisha: Oh god, that works on too many levels.
Taliesin: Oh god, that's too deep.
Marisha: Too deep.
Liam: You did that. Water under the bridge.
Sam: I walk away.
Liam: That little motherfucker shit in my bed.
Matt: All right. As you regather your will, path chosen; Keyleth, do you wish to prepare the transportation spell?
Marisha: Yeah.
Taliesin: Let's do this.
Matt: All right. All of you gather and find your way down to the Sun Tree in the center of the town. At this point, it's later afternoon, you've been growing accustomed these past few days of taking action right around dusk, and as the sky turns from a blue to a bit of an orangish hue, you all find yourselves ready to transition back over to the continent of Issylra.
Marisha: Let's go. To the Sun Tree.
Matt: Keyleth steps forward, touches her hand to the Sun Tree, completes her mental incantation, and you watch the trunk once again tear open into the somewhat oval walkway into the tree itself. On the opposite side, what's your destination?
Marisha: Oh, god. As close as I can get to the Fire Ashari, I guess.
Matt: Okay. You recall, passing through, there were a number of trees towards the base of the mountain that were starting to grow petrified from the proximity to the ash that constantly falls from the sky. They died a long time ago and are slowly beginning to petrify. As the portal opens up on the opposite side, you can see beyond that the dark rock that formulates that mountain range. At the same time, you can see a dull orange glow, and you all begin to step through in rapid succession, Trinket racing up after Vex. All of you find yourself stepping out the other side, at which point you look up and you can see the pathway that you took towards the top of the mountain where the Fire Ashari called Pyrah, where they maintained their ever-vigilant watch on the tear into the fire elemental plane. What you do notice immediately is that the path that you took initially is no longer a simple walkway. Against the now very dark sky, this side of the realm itself, night is, actually, no, sorry. At this point, you've actually beaten the sun.
Marisha: Oh, do we gain a few hours?
Matt: Yeah, you guys have gained a few hours, technically.
Marisha: Awesome.
Matt: So it's still light in the sky from other parts in the distance, however, there is a perpetual dark cloud of smoke and actual storm cloud gathering across this mountain range. As you recall the first time you were here, that's the nature of Pyrah, it's always under this thick, heavy, soot-and-ash-filled cloud cover. The pathway that winds up the mountain, though, is instead a glowing orange mass of slowly dribbling molten rock that has filled that entire walkway, and it has come to rest at the base of the mountain where it has gathered and begun to cool. You guys are hundreds of feet off from this point as you step out of the tree. However, where you see the molten rock has reached the base of the mountain, you-- it's cooled and formed into solid rock at its base, and you start seeing flashes of the orange turning dark, then another section turns dark from the opposite side. And then a few moments pass and you can see the orange of the next section, up in like ten-foot segments, it's going dark and hardening on its own. You get the sense that your arrival did not trigger this more than it has been happening since before you arrived.
Marisha: Can I do a nature check to figure out what's up?
Matt: Sure. Actually, this would be a perception check to see if you can ascertain.
Marisha: 16.
Matt: 16. It's difficult to make out at this distance, but you can see, along portions of the jagged mountainside, a collection of small figures that are making their way up the mountain, and their slow ascent is met with the lava flow cooling in sections.
Marisha: Do they look like people, like humanoids?
Matt: It's hard to tell from this distance, they look human-ish, humanoid-ish.
Taliesin: I attempt to use the optics on my gun to get a better look at them.
Matt: Sure, go ahead and make a perception check.
Taliesin: 18.
Matt: 18. A little bit of a clearer look through, they do appear to be humanoid. You do see two arms, two legs. You can't gauge size comparison from this distance.
Sam: How far?
Matt: At this point, they're probably a good 800 feet up the mountain.
Marisha: 800 feet?
Taliesin: Are they dressed like the Ashari that I've met?
Matt: From what you can make out, their color palette shifts, there are reds and browns, some stand out as an aquamarine white. The Ashari you saw were a pretty consistent color palette. This is a little more varied.
Taliesin: I don't know who these people are.
Marisha: They could still be Ashari. Just in their elemental forms. Are there any birds around? I look up, do I see birds in the sky?
Matt: There are no birds in the sky. Unfortunately, because of the nature of this area, especially as the oppressive fumes and dust continue to pour off from the top of the caldera of this mountain range, it has made it not fitting for any sort of aerial life that you're used to seeing. You glance around for about a minute or two and you don't see any sort of bird life in the air.
Travis: Did the ground cool where they were walking? Could we follow them up?
Taliesin: We should.
Marisha: Let's stay far behind. Let's go quietly.
Laura: Let's walk. Stealth? I cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us.
Matt: Okay. Everyone make a stealth check, including Trinket.
Travis: You don't want to put him in the thing?
Sam: You could.
Laura: (gasps) Okay.
Liam: Try it out.
Laura: I put it on a string so I could put it around my neck because it's a necklace because it's cooler that way.
Matt: Well, it has a chain on it that it came with.
Laura: It's got a chain on it, so it's around my neck.
Matt: All right, so you take it, you put--
Sam: It has a chain and a string now.
Matt: Chain and string.
Marisha: The string's so you don't forget.
Matt: Exactly. You trigger the necklace, pointing it in the direction of Trinket, and once again Trinket is absorbed into the crystal, vanishing within the inside. All right.
Travis: 17.
Matt: 17.
Sam: Pass Without a Trace is--?
Travis: Plus ten. I rolled shitty.
Laura: 30.
Liam: 35.
Marisha: 32.
Taliesin: 29.
Sam: 25.
Matt: Okay. You guys begin making your trek up. How are you going up the mountain? Are you scaling the cooled flow?
Marisha: Yeah.
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: That's probably the safest route given the fact that most of the other side of the mountain range itself is pretty jagged, and elements of it, because of the formation of this giant volcanic caldera, there are portions of broken stone and obsidian glass that sticks out the side.
Marisha: As we're walking up, I fall behind and I slip Vax the potion of fire protection.
Matt: All right. You guys continue in pace with this, eventually, and make another perception check?
Marisha: Much better, that's a natural 19. 30.
Matt: 30. Okay. Looking up, as this cluster of individuals makes their way towards the very top of the mountain, seemingly not taking sight of your traveling group, you're beginning to see the nature of each section of this flow cooling. And what you're seeing is the group will move up a bit, stop, and there appears to be a burst of-- sometimes it looks like very strong wind, sometimes it looks like a very localized sleet storm that is brought against the side of the mountain and is actually forcefully cooling the flow down temporarily, at least in those sections, before it begins to spill over and continue its slow molten descent, but they're doing their best to continue to force it back up the mountain and--
Laura: Those are druids.
Marisha: Those are druids.
Marisha: I cast Skywrite in the clouds above us, in the smoke.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: And I write--
Laura: "So, how are you guys doing up there?"
Taliesin: "Hi."
Marisha: "Hi. Hey you guys." I write, in druidic symbols, "Keyleth, Kaitiaki."
Sam: What's that? Is that her?
Matt: Okay. You notice the pace in which this group has ascended comes to a halt at the very, very top of the mountain range where it ends, and there's a slight pause before the clouds shift a second time and it says, from what you understand, "Kaitiaki. Survivors remain, Keyleth."
Marisha: And I respond with, "Help has arrived."
Sam: You guys are texting?
Marisha: (laughs) Yeah.
Matt: Druid texting.
Laura: What are you saying?
Taliesin: Stop looking at your phone.
Laura: What do they say?
Sam: Why don't we go over there and talk to them?
Marisha: They're survivors.
Travis: Well, let's go.
Laura: Are they nice?
Marisha: They're survivors. What does it matter?
Travis: And we go.
Marisha: Let's go. And I tell them, you know, "Arriving. Stand down. Here we come."
Taliesin: "Lol."
Marisha: "Lol. Winky-face."
Liam: As we travel, because I was too out of it to respond and she's way ahead, I take the potion that Keyleth gave to me, because she didn't have to, I've got the David Bowie armor on now.
Matt: You did don it. Okay.
Liam: Yes, yeah. Before going to bed.
Marisha: Oh you did, okay.
Liam: And I press it into Vex's hand.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Hey, I took your, all right, I'm going to take it.
Matt: What was your choice of resistance? I assume it was fire. Okay. All right. As you guys progress up, and it is, though it is a safe route, it is still a relatively steep incline and you're all having to work together to find handholds, and it is very arduous physically getting up there. I would like everyone to go ahead and make a constitution saving throw.
Sam: Oh, shit.
Laura: A constitution?
Matt: Yes.
Laura: Oh, do we get advantage because of the feast?
Travis: No, that's only wisdom.
Laura: Shit.
Liam: Come on, Colville meteorite die.
Travis: 17.
Liam: I'm so weak.
Laura: Come on, jade.
Liam: Natural 20!
Laura: You motherfucker!
Liam: Thank you, Matthew Colville.
Laura: I'm rolling my giant jade dice, because it's green.
Travis: Way to announce it.
Laura: Womp-womp. Oh, that's a six.
Travis: (laughs) You're fucked.
Marisha: 20.
Taliesin: 13.
Sam: Five.
Matt: Okay. As you guys begin to get partially up the mountain, the proximity of the heat from the-- because the exterior of the rock has cooled, but it's still molten beneath and there are parts of that are still cracking open, and bits of the heat are still pouring through, plus the general physical exertion from the not-very-hardy physiques of both Vex and Scanlan, you both suffer one level of exhaustion from the ascent up the side of this mountain.
Laura: Oh, Trinket's in his thing, he's not worried at all.
Taliesin: I don't actually know what one level of exhaustion is.
Matt: You guys have disadvantage on ability checks. All your skill checks right now, until your next long rest, are at disadvantage.
Travis: Levels of exhaustion suck.
Sam: Not saving.
Matt: However, as you guys are approaching towards the top, you can see now the humanoids that were at the top of this mountain crest have been since keeping the flow at bay and each time it begins to crest over again and continue its flow, it's blasted again from the side and cools and it's building this very, very slow gradual outcropping--
Marisha: I use my cantrip Gust and cool areas alongside as we ascend.
Matt: Okay. You glance up and you now have a better view of this group, and what you do see ahead of you, specifically Keyleth, appears to be a cluster of about eight or so Fire Ashari-dressed individuals. You can't make out their physical details yet. Along with five other entities that are dressed in the colors and vestments of those from Zephrah.
Marisha: Oh shit!
Travis: From who? From what?
Liam: What's the matter?
Laura: What's up? What's happening?
Marisha: I run up.
Matt: Keyleth goes running up.
Marisha: You said seven or eight from Zephrah?
Matt: There are five from Zephrah.
Laura: Are we going to, we're going to follow?
Liam: Yeah, I'm breaking out of stealth and running.
Taliesin: Ah. Yeah. No. We're running now.
Laura: I walk. I'm pretty tired. You and me. Let's just walk.
Sam: Yeah. You can carry me.
Taliesin: Cardio. God.
Matt: Okay, it takes a while to get up there. As you guys begin to approach, a little bit behind Keyleth, and you look, you see the only two notable Fire Ashari that you see there are Nastoen, which is a human female that you saw was one of the four that first greeted you as you approached Pyrah when you got to the mountaintop. She looks a little rough, but she's definitely in one piece. The other one that greets you, and immediately you recognize as Flamespeaker Cerkonos, who currently does not have his right arm. It is charred and is, through some semblance of flame, cauterized to where he no longer has a shoulder and part of his torso is a black mass of burnt skin, probably intentionally, but as you approach he puts his hand out and goes, "Hail, Keyleth."
Marisha: Hail, Cerkonos. And I run up and give him a hug.
Matt: He pats you on the back and there's a coldness to his look, his expression. You can see in a brief instant, though there is strength and determination, there is a moment as he looks into your face that you can see the sorrow of losing most of his people.
Marisha: And I look back at him and I say  I'm so sorry.
Matt: "This is not your fault. We had this coming. We are the able-bodied few you see."
Marisha: Are these all that have survived?
Matt: "We are 25 living. The rest reside at the base of the mountain, to be watched, or are the watchers. But our attrition is of our own making. We helped outsiders too long ago."
Marisha: What? What do you mean, like, how long ago? 12, 15 years?
Matt: "We helped seal a drake in this rift."
Laura: Thordak.
Matt: "That is the name they call him. We helped bring and bind the beast to this rift, sealing within it the heart of a primordial flame, one of the few pure essence crystals of our plane. Such a binding will not allow it to leave. It is a punishment for the most terrible of evils that the Ashari take under their order. We carved from the crystal in bind. This beast was too strong and took the entire crystal, but it seemed enough. It seemed enough."
Marisha: Cerkonos, it's not your fault. There are greater forces at work here, beyond us. That's something that I am desperately trying to reassure myself of every day.
Matt: And a voice comes up from over the mountain range, raspy, older, and with a casual importance to it, and it says, "So, are you claiming some semblance of dealing with this?" And as it steps over, the face looks down with recognition. "My god. Keyleth."
Marisha: Who are you?
Matt: You guys look up and you see long, silver-haired half-elf in later years dressed in the blue and white robes of the Air Ashari. You see before you Korren, your father. "You live."
Marisha: Dad!
Matt: He steps forward and goes in, as he steps away from Cerkonos, takes you in his arms and holds you extremely tight against him.
Marisha: I'm sorry I didn't check in sooner. I didn't want you to be disappointed.
Matt: "Shh." He puts his finger up to your lips, holds you back and looks you over and with a smile on his face, you can see the hardness of his expression fade. "Keyleth, you've grown."
Marisha: A lot's happened.
Matt: "You look just like her."
Marisha: I haven't found Mom.
Matt: "Her path was her own. I'm just glad that you have maintained yours." He wipes the tear from your face and says, "How goes the Aramente?"
Marisha: Well.
Laura: She's kicking ass.
Matt: "Good. Good." And he places his thumb at the corner of his eye. "We were called naught but a day ago by the surviving Pyrah. Told of the angry mountain and the terrible drake that sundered the rift. I helmed the team while the majority of our people stayed to keep Zephrah cloaked and safe from the marauding beast. We've only just made our way up the mountain. Your arrival is quite fortuitous, as we need all the help we can get."
Sam: How can we be of assistance?
Matt: "Come. See what remains of Pyrah." He turns around and walks back over towards the top of the mountain.
Marisha: Daddy.
Matt: He stops. Looks over his shoulder towards you. "Yes?"
Marisha: It's good to see you again, father.
Matt: "It's good to see you as well, daughter. Now come. Show me what you've learned." Goes back to walking. The rest of the Fire Ashari stand up, acknowledge and recognize those of you that stand here before, visiting once before. Cerkonos looks about. "You show strength and honor by coming here in our time of need. This will not be forgotten. Now come." As you follow them up over the top of the mountain, you see once again before you the caldera of this once-volcanic mountain has been blown apart in areas. You can see sections of large black stone that are now pushed up into jagged obelisks where once was a relatively smooth blackened shale countryside. You can see there are pits of molten rock that have been punched through the floor and have gathered into these pools where the air above is slowly shifting and warped by the heat that is now released above the mountaintop. The flow of lava that descends down the side of this mountain continues and swells and heads inward towards the Cindergrove. The Cindergrove, from what you can see from this distance, is but a fraction of what was once there, most of the trees now torn apart and scattered amongst the top of this mountain. You can see bits and pieces of the various petrified trees thrown hundreds of feet from the center. There are still standing, defiant trees amongst what once was the Cindergrove, but they are very sparse, many of them now blackened by what you can see in the very distance beyond the broken huts and homes that once held the Pyrah, you can see in the distance moving, glowing dots of various elemental energies spiraling outward from a very large central red rift that sits there pulsing and pulsing with bright, almost sunlight energy. It's like staring into the sun at the very zenith of its movement. You have to avert your eyes even staring towards this rift, now a good 30, 40 feet taller than it was when you last returned here. What was once the portal in the ground has now ruptured and is emerging, slowly piercing out of the top of this mountain. Undaunted, your father and the other Ashari continue walking forward with no words.
Laura: I rush forward a little bit to talk to him. Question. Your majesty? I want to help, we all want to help as much as possible, but I don't know any magic. Most of us don't. Are we going to be able to do anything?
Matt: "Well, I certainly hope so. If you've survived this long with my daughter, you've picked up a few tricks."
Laura: Well, that I have.
Marisha: Father, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for these people. They are the most capable that I know.
Matt: "This is good. Because that's who we need right now."
Marisha: However, since we're druids, we're a little bit more, you know. Geared. Prepared to deal with the fire. I can cast Protection from Energy on a couple of these people, if you wouldn't mind maybe grabbing the other two?
Matt: "I will do what I can."
Marisha: And I cast Protection from Fire on Percy, you have it, you have it, do you have it?
Travis: Well, I really don't even know what I'm going to do here.
Marisha: Well, it's going to protect you from fire.
Travis: Okay.
Marisha: Scanlan?
Sam: Hit me, babe.
Marisha: I'll do Percy and Scanlan. Father, can you--?
Matt: It's a concentration spell, so you can only really have one person going, and that's your concentration.
Marisha: Can only have one person going.
Matt: Yep.
Travis: Well, good.
Marisha: I could cast it at higher levels. Can I cast it at higher levels?
Travis: I'll take a mulligan on this one.
Marisha: Can't do that with this one? Fuck.
Laura: Do Scanlan. Do Scanlan.
Sam: No, I'm fine, don't worry about me.
Marisha: Well, I'm going to cast it on myself, for starters. Because I want it.
Laura: All right.
Marisha: So I'm going to cast Protection from Fire on myself.
Laura: What does a potion of fire resistance do?
Liam: Halves.
Laura: The same thing?
Laura: Halves all fire damage?
Marisha: Halves all fire damage?
Laura: Okay.
Matt: All right. As the cluster of you begin stepping deeper into the caldera, you begin to approach the outskirts of the remnants of the Pyrah tribe's homestead. You can see where most of it has been either completely burnt to a cinder or lies tattered by some great force, shattered. And you start, as you're walking through, you can see where the landscape itself, all the jagged bits of black obsidian glass are shooting up out of the ground and there's broken pieces of the dark rock and volcanic material, and it isn't until your eyes begin to focus that you realize that elements of this rock is not rock at all but the twisted and charred remains of the Pyrah that didn't escape in time, blending in with the ground and landscape surrounding. The rest of the Ashari continue pushing forward, not taking notice, focused, as before you, you can see the rift, still blinking ever-bright, in the center of the remains of the Cindergrove. You steel yourselves.
Marisha: I turn and I look at them and nod and follow in my people's footsteps.
Matt: And that's where we'll end tonight's session.
Travis: Oh shit.
Laura: Oh shit.
Travis: Okay. We're cooking with gas now.
Laura: As Marisha collapses in a pool of tears.
Taliesin: Cry more, cry more!
Matt: You knew this was coming.
Laura: Yeah, man. You're going to have a headache tomorrow, dude.
Marisha: I'm so tired. I'm tired.
Laura: Aw, we've got exhaustion, Sam. That's balls.
Sam: Yeah, that's not great.
Liam: Thanks for tuning in to Therapy Thursday, everyone.
Travis: Where we take shits and talk to swords.
Laura: There you go.
Matt: Got a little bit of column A, little bit of column B, we got some drama, we got some personal issues, we got some reunions, we got some hardships, we got--
Taliesin: Wild animals.
Laura: Yeah, so many things!
Matt: And a travel method for Trinket.
Laura: Oh my god, I'm so excited about it!
Matt: I wasn't sure how you guys were going to use that one, as soon as you mentioned it I was like, all right, that's what they're doing. That's a way to do it. Yeah. Well cool, guys, we'll be back next week Thursday with Chris Hardwick, who will be joining us as a guest.
Laura: Yay!
Marisha: How is he going to be here?
Taliesin: As himself. He's going to be playing himself, it's going to be very exciting.
Travis: Guys, I'm a human. Usually.
Liam: I'm super busy, I'm super busy.
Taliesin: Out of the rift suddenly comes Chris Hardwick.
Marisha: Super busy, but I'm super successful.
Liam: I'll help save the world, but I got like 50 things on my schedule.
Matt: Yeah, so we'll be back then. I think April 21st is going to be our 50th episode. We're going to be doing a fun little evening there. We'll have Critmas coming up, probably end up being that night, maybe another night that week, we'll have details coming up soon, we're trying to figure out the schedule on that. This'll be our big 50th anniversary Critmas blowout, and then we're going to scale it back to like an annual-type event it looks like, both to save the people who work this channel Thursday nights and stay super later to get here, to save the length of the episodes, and to help all of us who have to then go to work sometimes very early the next morning.
Liam: We love you, but I need to sleep. It's as simple as that. We love you, and we love Critmas, but it's a health thing.
Matt: So what we'll be doing is this will be our big blowout Critmas, we'll still do it probably for the holidays, and we really implore you guys to give to charities, send us stuff, we still read them, we'll still do Periscopes, those of us who get gifts, some of us will open them on Periscope for you, so we'll still have the interaction, we'll have to do it on our own time and not at 11, midnight.
Travis: 12, 12 30.
Liam: 12 37.
Taliesin: On a 7AM call.
Matt: So this'll be our big general blowout. So if you're planning something for the next Critmas, this'll be the one to get it in for. But yeah, you can check out the guide to Critmas on Geek & Sundry, it has a list of all our supported charities if you want to give there. It's highly recommended. Thank you guys so much for those who donated to 826 tonight so we can go ahead and help out the Seattle branch.
Marisha: 826 Seattle! We love you.
Matt: And yeah. Do we have anything else?
All: Happy St. Patty's Day.
Laura: You guys are hopefully sitting at home being very good.
Liam: For fuck's sake, take an Uber.
Matt: All right, guys. Well, have a wonderful night, and is it Thursday yet? Bye!

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors roll dice and play Dungeons & Dragons. So, welcome. I know we had a two-week hiatus. We had some birthdays-- in fact, the twins had a birthday. (cheering)
Matt: Awesome. A lot of really amazing community art came out of it, because you guys are ridiculous, and we'll probably see some of that at the break today. But before we kick into the game, let's get through our announcements for the evening while we also wait for Mr. Sam Riegel, Scanlan, who I think we all can consider is pretty important to tonight's events, seeing as how he's currently being digested in the belly of the dragon.
Laura: Oh shit!
Travis: Oh shit!
Liam: That didn't happen.
Matt: Yes it did. Yes it did. No. So. Starting off our announcements for the evening: first off, I am going to be flying out bright and early tomorrow morning to A-Kon in Dallas. I'll be out there doing panels and signings with a bunch of other great guests. I understand the same weekend is also Dallas Comic Con, because what the fuck, Dallas? At which Mary and Steve are there also, so don't choose: come to both! No.
Travis: Wade the waters.
Matt: Exactly. But I'll be doing signings, panels, and meeting a bunch of you Critters that are out in that area, so come by and say hi this weekend. And if not, go say hi to Steve and Mary, wherever that happens, in the lesser part of Dallas. I don't know if it is, I just like--
Travis: Yeah, there's a lesser part of Dallas, totally, over with the lesser-- are you guys throwing up because of how nervous you are?
Laura: What? No. Oh, my dice! Where are my dice?!
Matt: Where are your dice?
Laura: I'm so nervous, I don't even have my dice!
Travis: I'll go find them, I'll go find them.
Matt: Travis is going to get them. Wow. Two weeks to stew on this and it's already falling apart.
Liam: This is the exact icy, steely demeanor that I depend on.
Laura: Oh my god, are they in there?
Matt: While he looks for those--
Taliesin: I have extras, if you need some.
Matt: I do want to also say the newest Dear Abby article series for Critical Role characters went up-- or goes up tomorrow, right?
Marisha: Tomorrow, Fridays.
Matt: Friday. And whose is that one?
Marisha: Who goes up next?
Laura: What? Who goes up what next?
Matt: The next Dear Abby?
Laura: Oh, I think it's me!
Matt: Oh! Then we'll have Vex tomorrow coming up. See her answering questions to various distraught people throughout the realms of Exandria, and her I'm sure very astute--
Laura: I'm a really good giver of advice. I learned that about myself.
Ashley: It's true.
Liam: More about quantity than quality? Maybe?
Matt: Possibly. This is very true. So look for that tomorrow on geekandsundry.com, that'll be fun and exciting. Also, for those who didn't catch it yesterday, we had an awesome event at Meltdown Comics with the official Dungeons & Dragons crew announcing: one, their new storyline, which is the Storm King's Thunder, I think is what it's called. Really awesome, bringing the giants back into the world with a very fleshed-out story. I'm super excited about it, and keep tabs on that whenever that comes out, should be in the next few months, I think. I've seen some stuff behind-the-scenes and it looks really, really cool. But as part of that event yesterday, we also kicked off and announced a new video series campaign that I'm doing with the actual Wizards of the Coast Dungeons & Dragons team. Me and Chris Perkins wrote and designed together a story that I fleshed out and am running for a series of celebrity guests, one of which is our fantastic Ashley Johnson there.
Ashley: Hey!
Laura: You're a celebrity!
Marisha: You're a celebrity!
Matt: That was pretty great, guys. I'm not going to lie, that was pretty legit.
Liam: Just keep vamping. Keep vamping until the bard gets here.
Matt: That's right, we're waiting on Scanlan to get here. Other guests include Utkarsh, Shelby, Jonah-- I wrote all the first names down because the last names, some of them were hard to pronounce, but you can look up the actual announcements to get the full names. I'm really bad at this. It's been two weeks, give me a break.
Liam: You're busy. You're busy.
Matt: Nah! I've got so much free time. But it's going to be a great group, and I look forward to announcing it soon on when those will begin to air throughout the summer, because it's going to be a lot of fun. And I get to play in Forgotten Realms, which is something I've wanted to do again for a long time, and hope I don't mess up all the existing fantastic lore that Ed Greenwood has developed since he-- oh, are you okay, Laura?
Laura: No, I really feel like I'm going to throw up.
Travis: There's literally up-chuck going to happen. Just do it in a little thing and I'll feed it back to you like a little bird
Liam: Just go in there.
Laura: (retching noise) I threw up so many dice!
Travis: I'll talk about our sponsor this week.
Matt: You want to jump into that? Yeah, so we have a new sponsor coming in, sponsoring this episode of Critical Role this evening. (cheering)
Matt: So Travis, you want to take it away?
Travis: Our amazing sponsor this week is Backblaze. Backblaze is an amazing, unlimited cloud backup company for your Mac and PC, for just five dollars a month, it's incredible. We have an amazing representative from Backblaze in the studio. He's a crazy, crazy uber-fan. Yev, wave to me baby, blow me a kiss. He's incredible.
Laura: You should check out his Twitter page because he has printed out Flat Mercer and he's chronicling his adventures, and I'm pretty proud of it.
Travis: Yes! We're on you, we're talking about Backblaze right now.
Sam: Hey guys. Backblaze is a great service. (laughter)
Sam: It offers unlimited cloud backup for Macs and PCs for just five dollars a month. They're supporting the show tonight. I was saying this in the car on the way over. (laughter)
Matt: Well, please continue, we're not stopping you.
Sam: Guys, no shit, I just installed it yesterday on my home computer. It's currently backing up right now. It's an online file backup system for all your stuff. Your documents, your media, your Critical Role fanart, your videos of Scanlan singing things. There's no gimmicks or additional charges, it's just five dollars a month, and! You don't want to go to Backblaze.com, you want to go to backblaze.com/criticalrole, where you can get a fully-featured 15-day trial.
Travis: How many days, Sam?
Sam: 15 days, free! If you like it, keep getting it, pay five bucks a month, that's nothing. Or if you don't, whatever, it doesn't bother me. But it's only for Critters, and also if you go to backblaze.com/criticalrole right now, you'll see pictures of us, quotes from us. It's actually really cute.
Taliesin: Yeah, it was pretty cute.
Sam: And I am such a supporter of these guys that I even wrote a song for them.
Marisha: What?
Sam: It's very short. Okay.
Matt: Please, go ahead.
Sam: (singing) I'm backing up in Backblaze of glory! Take me now, download the truth. I'm backing up-- okay, that's it. (cheering)
Sam: I need a drink now.
Matt: You did good Sam, you did good.
Laura: There's some Guinness in the fridge.
Matt: It's been cool having sponsors come to the show, partially because they all come to us from being fans of the actual show, and that's the driving force behind this, so we want to make sure that things are on-brand from people who are genuinely interested in our community and have things to offer that'll be useful. I can say this as I have a web series I directed many years ago and spent a whole year doing, I lost all the files because of the hard drive that I had-- the external hard drive failed, and I don't have any of those anymore. And so since then I've been very, very careful about backing everything up. So this service would have been really helpful back then. So don't make the same mistakes I did. There Will Be Brawl only lives as final video files. It kills me. I couldn't even fix stuff. Still have the watermark on the last three videos for the Escapist that I can't remove. Anyway. Learn from my mistakes. So! Do we have anything else any of you folks want to announce?
Laura: E3's next week!
Matt: E3 is next week.
Laura: Oh wait, no it's not. It's two weeks from now.
Matt: No, it's two weeks from now.
Laura: It's two weeks from now. I'm sorry.
Matt: I believe nothing coming out of that mouth now!
Taliesin: E3 is two weeks from now, and I'm also going to be at Amazing Comic Con Vegas two weeks from now. And Signal Boost is currently in its second week, which is hilarious, and amazing, and you should totally check it out because it's weird.
Marisha: Yeah. You're like the most interesting man in the world.
Taliesin: Thank you.
Marisha: It's fantastic.
Laura: I've always thought that about you, Taliesin.
Taliesin: Oh. Thanks. I'm now... yeah. I'm going to die today, thank you. (laughter)
Laura: No you're not!
Travis: Pike's got us covered. Right, Pike?
Matt: All right, great. So, without further ado, and no further delaying the inevitable--
Travis: You got a little something on your--
Matt: Little thing on my nose, right there?
Travis: You might need to go the bathroom, check it out.
Matt: No, it's great. So let's go ahead and roll the intro and start playing Critical Role. [dramatic music]
Matt: So. Continuing where we left off two weeks ago. The intrepid party of adventurers known as Vox Machina, after recently freeing the town of Westruun from being occupied and ruled by the roving Herd of the Storm, which Grog once hailed from, cut down their brutal leader Kevdak and temporarily restored power to a combination of himself and Kevdak's son, Zanror. An accord was made between the two of you to agree to go after and destroy the ancient black dragon Umbrasyl, a member of the Chroma Conclave, and marked for you to eventually destroy anyway, but who had currently made a deal with the Herd in exchange for goods, gold, and ruling over the town, would let them live and be essentially undisturbed, seemingly. You gathered an army, you forged a plan, and an ambush was set for the next time the dragon swooped down from atop the mountain Gatshadow to retrieve its package. At this time, the trap was sprung, the dragon held fast by hooks and chains, a giant metallic trap designed and orchestrated by Percival, and everything was going great. The dragon had sustained quite a bit of damage and seemed to be in a rough place until it broke free and left much of the Herd fallen, dissolving and screaming. Also, Scanlan and Vax Dimension Door'd into the inside of the dragon and have spent a number of rounds now deciding how to get out of it maybe?
Sam: Tiny Vax. Tiny Vax.
Matt: Tiny Vax. Thanks to a potion that does that. You managed to go ahead and put in an Immovable Rod within its stomach, which held it up for a moment before it decided to truly gain the advantage it needed to escape the circumstance, allowed it to tear through its body, as well as an arrow that was shot by Vex towards her brother, in hopes of-- I don't know, being a signal of hope or to put him out of his misery? I'm still trying to figure it out. At this point in time, Umbrasyl took to the sky and began to coast off towards Gatshadow, seemingly the domain that it's carved for itself in this region. On its way out, Grog had thrown his newly acquired Bloodaxe and his Chain of Returning into the dragon, left it, and is now being dragged behind it now, dangling as it flies off. And that, my friends, is where we kick back into the story.
Travis: That's when they knew they fucked up. (laughter)
Matt: So we have, as you guys-- Grog, your feet leave the ground as you swing forward, unable by the momentum pushing forward to keep up with the sheer speed of this dragon and its size, its mass, its full stretched wings, it is far faster than any of you expected and it whooshes off towards the mountaintop. You, just looking behind as the ground just fades further and further away. The rest of you, Vox Machina, seeing this happen, see essentially half of your friends, your party, only one of them visible, now beyond your reach. With that being said, for this circumstance, let's pick up where we were on the initiative order between you three.
Laura: Just straight into it!
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: I'm ready.
Matt: We left at the right time for that, guys.
Liam: I cannot feel the lower half of my body. (laughter)
Matt: Here, how about this? Because I can't find the original initiative order, we'll just say for this circumstance we'll roll initiative based on what action's going to happen here. So we're going to have you three roll initiative.
Travis: Come on, lucky dice. I get advantage on that.
Sam: I got 12.
Liam: 13.
Travis: 13 also.
Laura: Oh jeez.
Sam: Starting off right.
Matt: All right. So. As it crests into the sky (whoosh), blackish dragon blood dripping from wounds, you can feel every single tension of its upper torso muscles with each swoop of the wings crushing against you in this rhythmic pattern. What little bit of air currently has been placed at the top of the stomach, based on your Thunderwave, is all you have to maintain any semblance of hope. You, there's an arrow in darkness. However, Umbrasyl at this point, who does go first in this order, is just concentrating on survival and continues gliding upward. You hear a rumble within the inside of the body, and the essence of a growling, angry voice creeps through. "These foul creatures. Get out of me!" (straining sound) I need you guys to both roll strength saving throws right now.
Laura: He's trying to puke you up?
Sam: Or just crush us.
Liam: Strength saving? Nine.
Sam: Yeah, not great. 15.
Matt: 15. You manage to put your arms against the side, and using whatever forceful arcane cantrips to keep the walls at bay before it actually finds you, and you slip out in time. You, however, do suffer six points of bludgeoning damage as the muscles once again tense against you. Umbrasyl is very much aware that there are now living things inside the stomach squirming around and as the muscles relax, the voice just growls again, "Try all you want. Don't worry. I can eat you now or later."
Liam: Can't hear you.
Matt: So. We had two 13s and a--
Sam: 12.
Matt: 12. All right. So Grog, Vax, what are you guys doing?
Liam: I'm taking--
Matt: The Bramblewood is now beneath you, you're heading towards the mountain, you can see the edge of the forest now.
Travis: Maybe I go first, just in case something--
Liam: Yeah, go for it.
Travis: The Bramblewood? I'm holding on, right? With the Titanstone Knuckles. Whereabouts is the axe lodged? Can I see where the chain is attached to?
Matt: You can see it curving up ahead of you and with how high the sun is in the sky, it's around noon, there's a heavy bit of shadow, and at this distance? Make a perception check.
Travis: (laughs) That went one and then a 13. Minus-- zero. 13.
Matt: 13. It seems to be somewhere around the base of the tail, like where the tail meets the rest of the actual body itself, the torso area.
Laura: It's in his butt.
Matt: No, it's not quite in his butt, it's more in his side.
Travis: How high am I?
Matt: Looking down? Numbers are hard for you to pick up. It's a long way.
Travis: A long way.
Matt: It's a long way. Like-- yeah.
Travis: Well. Only one way to go. And that's up. I would like to try and pull myself up the chain towards Umbrasyl.
Matt: All right. Go ahead and make an athletics check.
Travis: Athletics or strength?
Matt: Athletics. Which is better, technically.
Laura: It's a strength saving thing, so--
Matt: Yeah, it's strength plus your proficiency bonus.
Travis: Oh! I get an advantage or?
Matt: You get your proficiency bonus. You're no longer raging, because this is more fear-struck at this point.
Travis: Oh, 14 plus five-- 19.
Matt: 19, yeah. You begin to ascend the chain. You get closer to it, and you can now see the axe itself is embedded and is starting to wiggle and pull out. So you're making your way up the chain with the full round at this point, you're almost to it, but that's going to be the rest of your action this turn.
Travis: Yeah, okay!
Matt: So what are you doing?
Liam: I'm taking the dragon sword and I am shoving it along the angle of the arrow that's coming in toward it, to try to go parallel.
Matt: Okay. The arrowhead is still poking through--
Liam: Through, and I'm sending it along that line.
Matt: Okay, okay. All right. Go ahead and make a general dexterity check. To see if you're able to--
Liam: Natural 20. (cheering)
Matt: Okay. Using the essence of where the actual shaft of the arrow has pierced the hide and is stuck through, you take the blade and use your understanding of precision weapons and implements to find the slight opening. And the blade thankfully is very thin. Slide it through with minimal resistance. You can see the muscles are still pushing against it, but the already preset wound from the arrow does guide it through, and you manage to go straight to the hilt, and it's found its way all the way through the wound. No additional damage is dealt necessarily, but it has gone--
Liam: This does not count as an attack on the creature?
Matt: You said you wanted to put it through an existing hole.
Liam: The hole is this thick.
Matt: Yeah.
Liam: Like a straw, and the blade is this, that's not piercing damage? There's no piercing damage. Whatever you want.
Matt: Do you want to roll an attack for this?
Liam: Yes, I want it to be an attack.
Matt: Right, now you would make the attack as the blade. The idea being that you wanted to guide it through the hole.
Liam: I'm going to use one of my Lucks. I've got two left. Better.
Matt: Didn't you use any Luck for the battle?
Liam: I used one last time.
Matt: Right, so you have two left.
Liam: 12 plus strength, which is low, is 14. The dragon sword-- is the dragon sword plus anything, guys? I don't know that I have the--
Matt: Plus one.
Liam: Plus one. All right.
Matt: Yeah, and then it does additional damage against dragons.
Liam: Oh, and I have to roll-- I'll just say I missed. For my bonus action, I'm going to slide the dagger up along the same line and try to widen that gap.
Matt: Okay. This roll will be at disadvantage.
Liam: The last one was too, which is why I just scrubbed it.
Matt: Right, right, right. Go ahead and make the secondary attack.
Liam: No.
Matt: Yeah. Okay, so, the blade is in there and it has found its way through the existing wound, but you don't quite have the strength to actually wrench it enough to do any real, serious damage as it is a very, very hardy and well-defended creature from its natural mass. The fleshy interior of a dragon is almost as dense and as protected as the armored hide on the outside, and that's one thing you weren't counting on when entering its form.
Liam: And what did I just do, though, with the dragon sword, did I widen the hole?
Matt: You've put the blade through the hole and so now you have that blade lodged in, you can then use that to try and widen it in successive turns in itself and that will prevent you from having disadvantage on the attacks with that blade going forward, because it's already in a soft place and you can just wedge it, but it's going to be a strength attack for each of those rounds. The dagger unfortunately, you just can't find any purchase at that point there in the time given, because of the movement and the squishing. You do also suffer an additional seven points of crushing damage.
Liam: Okay, and I forgot. One other thing I want to do-- I have movement too, can I use my legs to push as hard as I can forward a foot or something? I know with movement over difficult terrain it's halved, and I'm in the most difficult terrain.
Matt: You are in the most difficult terrain there probably is.
Liam: But if I use my movement could I shove and go like a foot towards the outside, half a foot or anything?
Matt: Pushing towards the wound?
Liam: Pushing in. Using my legs to go--
Matt: Okay. I would say that would be part of your attack next round. Actual movement within, you would be able to move a few feet but you'd have to release the blade to do so. Any actual blade pushing forward would be your next action, so hold off for the next round. Scanlan, what you got?
Sam: Oi. So I'm in a beast. As we all know, intestines are my favoured terrain-- (laughter)
Travis: I remember him saying that years ago!
Matt: This is true!
Laura: Back when we first made these characters, I remember you saying that.
Sam: So I held up that rod, clicked it, and then it was pulled out of the body pretty close to where I am right now. When it went, did I see air? Did I see daylight, when it went out of there?
Matt: It was very small. It's the equivalent of a bullet going through, because the rod when it punched through it didn't-- it's a very thin, elongated object, so it pierced through like a metal rod at a very high speed.
Liam: So the dragon got very lucky and it went through like that, and not like that.
Matt: If it would have hit-- at whatever angle it would be, even then, it's only that wide and it would still puncture a tiny slit, and due to the density of both the muscles of the creature and its body, it took damage and there's a little bit of blood coming from the wound, you imagine, but it's not like it's going to leave an open, cavernous hole.
Sam: It's a cut.
Matt: Yeah, it's a cut.
Sam: Got it.
Matt: But you did see where it (tearing noise) through.
Sam: And when it went out, I didn't see any daylight or anything. Just disappeared.
Matt: You just saw it (tearing noise) through the creature's stomach. You do see a little bit of blood beginning to pour out of where the wound was.
Sam: Okay. Oh boy.
Travis: Do it, baby.
Sam: I don't know, I got nothing. All right, I'll just try something and we'll see if it works and then I'll try something else next time. I won't die in one round, right? I'm going to Polymorph into a Tri-- not-a-ceratops. Into a small, poisonous snake.
Matt: Okay!
Sam: And I'm going to go straight into that wound.
Matt: Okay, well, before that happens you do take four points of acid damage from the stomach before you take the form, because that would be the top of the round. So, at which point you turn into a small poisonous snake, now floating amongst the acids, and find your way along the surface. And you're heading towards the wound?
Sam: I'm going into the wound.
Matt: Okay, all right--
Sam: With a swim speed of 30!
Matt: Right, you do. (laughter)
Matt: Let me check.
Sam: But I don't know if it's swimming, it's more squeezing.
Matt: Through the acid, it's swimming. Once you get to the actual wound, this is more squeezing. And that's going to be more of a strength-based element. So that being the case here, a poisonous snake, I'm going to need you to go ahead and roll a strength check to push against the wound.
Sam: Sure, man. This is a strong snake.
Laura: Really?
Sam: Natural one. (laughter)
Matt: Which, just as a heads up, is a minus four to its strength, so that's technically a negative three.
Sam: (bink) Going well, guys!
Matt: Yeah. You just dive in headfirst and with all your snaky might, you slither and slither and slither, just getting nowhere. No headway. This is bad. (laughter)
Liam: Why don't you bite it, dude?
Sam: Oh yeah! Sure, I'll take a bite.
Liam: Poisonous bite.
Matt: Sure, go for it. Roll for an attack.
Sam: 14 plus-- I have no idea.
Matt: Plus five.
Sam: Hey! That's a 19. That doesn't hit.
Matt: A 19? The inside of the stomach is not as well-armored as outer parts of the body. A 19 would hit. Go ahead and roll damage.
Sam: What do I roll?
Matt: This would be-- oh no, you don't roll. It takes one piercing damage. (laughter)
Sam: Guys, we knocked it down a point!
Matt: And it has to make a constitution saving throw versus your poison. That's an eight plus 14, at a DC of ten. So yeah, it doesn't take any additional-- oh, it takes half damage. So go ahead and roll 2d4.
Sam: Ooh! Seven.
Matt: It takes three points of poison damage. (laughter)
Sam: And it is considered grappled. Okay. Plan A, cross it off the list. (laughter)
Matt: All right. Top of the round. Okay, so, Umbrasyl is still flying up, looking down at its form, is glancing about...
Travis: Don't see me! Don't see me!
Laura: You're in its butt. How can it see you?
Matt: Grog. As you're holding onto the axe, you see before you, just pass underneath the leg and the front arms that are reaching down, this giant, dark, looming projection comes down and looks right towards you. The horned front of the dragon as Umbrasyl stares right into your face and goes, "There you are." (draws in breath, exhales) And unleashes a torrent of acid towards you. I need you to go ahead and make-- this is going to roll a dexterity saving throw. You have disadvantage.
Travis: I do?
Matt: Because you're currently holding onto the chain, but I believe you have advantage on them because you are a barbarian.
Travis: I have Danger Sense. So just one roll?
Matt: Yeah. So just roll.
Travis: That's not great. 11.
Ashley: Can I-- do I see them?
Matt: No! They are way over-- they're like a tiny little dragon speck in the distance. We'll get to you guys here in just a moment, but their situation is a little more dire and immediate, so I have to figure out what's going on with them right now.
Laura: What if we could've chased after them? Right away?
Matt: You can if you want to. Did you want to go after them?
Laura: Yeah.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Laura: I would have chased after them, immediately, when it took off.
Matt: Okay, we'll get to that in just a minute. As it is-- the dragon's speed is it can fly 80 feet per round.
Laura: That's really fast, though.
Matt: Yeah, and it's making double-dash manoeuvring here, even at your fly speed on the broom--
Laura: What do great eagles have? Giant eagles, I think, have really fast speed too.
Matt: Let's check that real fast. Giant eagles--
Marisha: 80.
Matt: 80 feet. So the eagles are able to keep up. Do you want something that way?
Laura: So, if the eagles were to pick up somebody--
Matt: First off, Grog, you take 62 points of acid damage.
Travis: Nice.
Laura: Wait, you have acid resis-- no, you don't, because Keyleth-- it went away.
Travis: It went away?
Laura: Yeah, remember? Because she used--
Matt: She took damage and it dropped.
Marisha: I took damage, I'm sorry. It wasn't my fault. I lost concentration. Blame the dragon that did 40 damage.
Matt: So, as the stream pours past you, you feel your flesh burning, and elements of your skin are actually sloughing off and plummeting beneath you like a thick oatmeal.
Laura: Gross!
Matt: You still maintain your grip on the axe through sheer force of anger and willpower. Umbrasyl slows down a little bit in not doing the double-dash maneuver. That's going to end Umbrasyl's turn. So you sent the eagles after--
Laura: Well no, I wanted the eagles to pick up Pike and Percy.
Matt: So the eagles swing by--
Marisha: Wait, not yet. Stone! Stone!
Taliesin: Throw her the teleport stone!
Ashley: Gatestone! I pull it out of my bag. Pass it to her.
Taliesin: I'm going to hop on an eagle.
Laura: I literally am sending the eagles as this is happening and I dash out of the tree on my broom, and go for the Immovable Rod, just long enough to stop and grab it and keep taking off after the dragon.
Matt: Okay, so you retrieve the rod, grab it, and head off in that direction. So we now have both of you, on eagle-back, heading off, with you trailing behind as you can't quite travel at the same speed as the eagles.
Taliesin: I'm going to try and clear my gun while I'm up there, too.
Matt: Okay. Keyleth, what are you doing?
Marisha: You've got a ride. Animal handling. I'm going to drop and I'll start focusing on the Gatestone.
Taliesin: So, situated, I'm just going to try and clear the gun and see if it's an easy fix.
Matt: Go for it.
Taliesin: Nope. Gun's broken.
Laura: It's broken?
Taliesin: Yeah, gun's broken. I've got another gun, but big gun's broken.
Matt: Yeah, Bad News is out. All right. As you're flying off you're having a hard time with the bumpy ride, as this eagle also has been near death due to being partially dissolved by the acidic attack from the dragon before. It wasn't the acid, it was something else that wrecked it.
Laura: No, it was a bite or a claw.
Matt: Yeah, I think it was a bite or a claw, because the acid would've destroyed it. So the eagle's heavily wounded, and due to it shuddering and trying to keep up it just causes you to end up bending a portion of the actual weapon.
Taliesin: Damn it. I put it away.
Matt: All right. So you guys are keeping up. You're concentrating on the stone.
Marisha: One minute, baby.
Matt: Bringing us back now. Grog, you're recovering from this attack.
Travis: I look down and I see my beautiful body tattoos melting away like instant oatmeal. Not even like the nice apples and cinnamon kind, it's like the maple brown sugar that no one--
Laura: That's my favorite kind of oatmeal.
Travis: Nobody likes that; you're alone in this. And it makes me so angry that I go into a rage?
Matt: Do recall, you do have one point of exhaustion since your frenzied rage did wear off beforehand.
Travis: Right, yeah.
Matt: So you go into a rage.
Laura: Oh but we have Heroes' Feast, is that good?
Matt: It doesn't help with that, no.
Travis: All right. So I go in a rage, and I would like to try and continue climbing up the remainder of the distance to Umbrasyl.
Matt: Okay. Athletics check, with advantage.
Travis: That was a one.
Laura: Oh, that's way better!
Travis: That's much better. That's a 29.
Matt: You find your way up, grabbing onto the edge of the tail, and you actually pull yourself up onto the base of the tail. You're on the back of Umbrasyl right now. The chain is still currently attached to its side.
Marisha: Khaleesi!
Travis: Mother of dragons! Do I have any more movement?
Matt: It's taken your whole turn to really get up there. Are you going to dislodge the Bloodaxe, or leave it there?
Travis: I'm going to dislodge it, because it was already so weak.
Matt: Okay, so go ahead and make your check to remove it. It's a DC 12, I think.
Travis: That's a one. Yep.
Matt: You pull on the chain, but the reason it managed to hold your weight this whole ride up was it was wedged pretty well into its armored hide. And thank god it did. However, at this point, it's proving that that is now coming back to haunt you, as it is really hard to pull it from where it's stuck in the dragon. That's going to be the end of your turn. Vax.
Liam: First turn I'm going to use the dragon blade to attack and slice downward and try to wedge that hole open a little bigger.
Matt: Go for it.
Liam: That hits. Well, I don't know if it hits. Nine plus my strength for this sword, right, not dexterity?
Matt: Correct. I'm letting this one be a finesse.
Liam: I probably hit him before. So that's a 25.
Matt: 25? You carve an opening in the side about a foot and a half in full length there. As you drag it you hear a roaring. Go ahead and roll damage on that.
Taliesin: It's 1d8 plus your dex--
Liam: Yeah, I know, I got that written down, thank you. 16.
Matt: 16? All righty.
Liam: And then, this is a game rules thing. Grog's within five feet of this thing and I'm no longer at disadvantage. Or am I?
Matt: This is less rules and more narrative. You don't understand the body or where you really are in the body of the dragon. He's not threatening the creature right now. If anything, it's potentially threatening you. This would not be a sneak attack.
Liam: I'm not arguing, I'm asking what's possible.
Matt: No worries.
Liam: I'll use the dagger to hit. Am I at disadvantage with the dagger still?
Matt: I'd say yes, because the only reason you didn't have disadvantage with the other blade is because it was within an existing wound and then you pulled back.
Liam: Then I miss.
Matt: Okay, the other dagger, you go ahead and stab again, this time it hits a dense part of muscle and does sink in, but not enough to do any serious damage from the inside.
Liam: And there's air queefing in and out of this slot? (laughter)
Matt: A little bit, yes. It's about that wide. You staying there?
Liam: Yes. No. I'm going to slide my body and try to stick head and dagger arm out of it and hang half in and half out, if possible.
Matt: Yeah. Go ahead and make a straight strength check.
Liam: 13.
Matt: 13? That's fine. Thankfully, the DC's lower because you managed to carve the large wound in. You plant your feet against the other muscle wall that you are between and you push off and get yourself through. And in the most awkward, tiny birth, just above your armpits, your head and arm emerge out the side. Immediately a gust of wind hits your hand as you realize and look down: you are hundreds of feet above the ground. Bramblewood right beneath you. But you are partially out of the dragon.
Laura: You can breathe!
Liam: (gasps for air)
Matt: Take a deep breath. You take three points of crushing damage as the muscle walls around you are still squeezing in on you in your current placement. That ends your turn. You! At the top of your round, your snake takes acid damage. Only one point of acid damage. How many hit points does your poisonous snake have?
Sam: I don't think he has very many.
Matt: It may have less than one hit point, in which case, you're just going to turn right back into Scanlan.
Sam: I think he's dead.
Matt: Let's find out. It has two hit points!
Sam: Oh god! Oh no, but wait, I took damage last round, too.
Matt: That was before you transformed. It was at the top of your round.
Sam: Hey, I'm still a snake! (laughter)
Sam: Well, I'm not going to try that any more. If I drop form, is that my whole round?
Matt: No, you just let it go.
Sam: I'm going to drop the snake. Snake was a try and fail.
Matt: It was a good idea. Just not a very strong snake.
Sam: I drop the snake, try to get that little bubble of air (gasps), and I'll fucking cast Bigby's Hand.
Matt: Okay! So, using that little pocket of air, you bring your hand up, you do your quick somatic components, shouting the phrase, and Bigby's Hand appears and is currently being squished between some of the walls of the stomach.
Sam: Can he move at all?
Matt: Yeah!
Sam: Okay. I would like to fist the wound. Jam it, find a finger and-- how you like that?
Taliesin: You're fingering the wound. Okay! (laughter)
Sam: This wound will never heal.
Matt: I don't-- yeah. (laughter)
Sam: So would it be a forceful hand?
Matt: This would be a very forceful hand. This would be the definition of Bigby's Forceful Hand. Go ahead and roll an athletics check for Bigby, which is strength 28, so add plus eight to the roll.
Sam: 12?!
Matt: Total of 12?
Sam: Yes!
Matt: The finger pushes partway in and gets about halfway up to its second knuckle. (laughter)
Matt: It is just chilling right there.
Sam: This is so embarrassing! Wow! (laughter)
Matt: I'm blushing, man!
Liam: All about phrasing.
Sam: Wow! Okay!
Matt: All right, that's your turn.
Sam: I have movement, right?
Matt: You do have movement, yes.
Sam: I can't move anywhere! I have climbing stuff with me. Can I move my arms at all?
Matt: You can move your arms, yeah.
Sam: I would like to take out a grappling hook and grab onto the inside lining of the stomach.
Matt: Okay, make a strength check.
Sam: Nope! Six!
Matt: Six. You take it and (ting, swish). It just slips along the very heavy mucous material lined interior of the stomach. There's a little scrape line, but that's about it.
Sam: I can't do anything! It's great.
Matt: Top of Umbrasyl's round. Breath weapon does not return. However, is going to use one of its legendary actions and attempt to beat its wings to shake you off of it, Grog.
Laura: Are you raging?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: I need you to go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw.
Travis: Which I have advantage on. 18.
Matt: 18. You take 15 points of bludgeoning damage, which is reduced by half, so you're only taking seven. However, you are knocked prone.
Travis: (laughing) On his back.
Matt: Yes, which causes you to begin tumbling off the back of the tail. The wind of it-- (thump thump)
Travis: Shit!
Matt: The chain of returning is still attached to you, however, and as you go tumbling off the back of the tail, it catches you, and you are now swinging towards the back of the creature, of the dragon now, back where you started. Only the dragon is very aware of your presence. But you didn't plummet to your death!
Travis: That's good!
Matt: That was the end of your turn. Now it's the top of Umbrasyl's turn.
Sam: These dragons are hard to kill!
Matt: Yeah, imagine that! At this point, now, as this has gone on for a little while as you guys began to ascend and it went upward, it's now partway up the mountainside. You can see the forest has gotten more sparse. There are trees scattered across the top of the mountaintop.
Liam: We're close to Gatshadow already?
Matt: You can see it. You're not there, but it's going across the forest top and it's coming towards the actual mountain base. It hasn't quite ascended it completely.
Laura: What about giant eagles with people on them?
Matt: They're keeping in tandem with it. They're not able to quite catch up entirely, just due to the nature of the fast dragon.
Liam: Arrow range?
Matt: Not for her, unfortunately, no.
Taliesin: We're not within 400 feet of it, are we?
Matt: You, at this point, jumping on, would just be on the outside of the range if you wanted to try. You're at disadvantage on these attacks because you are on the back of a flying, wounded bird.
Laura: Don't let the bird get hit by Umbrasyl!
Taliesin: Fuck it. Taking a shot. At least taking one shot to see what happens. Ooh yeah. Natural 20.
Matt: With disadvantage.
Travis: Do it again.
Taliesin: 18, that'll do. 27 to hit.
Matt: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
Taliesin: Oh, and he still has-- no, I lost Hex.
Matt: You lost Hex, yeah.
Liam: You're doing great, de Rolo, come on! Keep your head in the game.
Taliesin: 14 points of damage.
Matt: Gun goes off. You hear a whizz go by your ear as the bullet hits the side of Umbrasyl. (grunting) The head looks back towards the rest of you, now approaching at a distance.
Laura: Do not let the bird get hit! You will plummet to your fucking death.
Taliesin: I'm going to spend the rest of my attack pushing the eagle down to fly at tree level.
Matt: So, at the top of Umbrasyl's turn, as you guys are pushing forward and you're still concentrating, the dragon growls under its breath. (spellcasting) You can't hear it. You're too far away.
Ashley: She can read lips!
Laura: I'm so far away! I just want to know what he's saying.
Matt: The outer view of the dragon shimmers for a second and then vanishes from sight.
Liam: Are we visible?
Matt: No.
Liam: We're not like Wonder Woman inside the jet? What about my hand hanging out?
Matt: Yeah. You see the dragon.
Sam: What about Grog?
Matt: Grog is dangling from nothing right now. Grog is kiting through the air.
Taliesin: You have Hunter's Mark.
Ashley: So we can see Grog?
Matt: In theory, yeah, if you can keep a bead on him.
Travis: I'm enlarged.
Matt: A very heavy Grog.
Laura: Is he Hunter's Marked still--
Matt: He would be. You haven't taken a lot of damage yet, or at all.
Laura: I haven't taken any damage.
Matt: Then you still have Hunter's Mark on him, yeah. Continues upward. That comes to the next part. Grog, you're up.
Travis: I had one question. I drank that Potion of Speed. It hastes me for a minute. How many rounds is a minute?
Matt: That has gone away, unfortunately.
Travis: Well, there's nothing to do but to climb back up the chain!
Matt: Make an athletics check.
Travis: Up the chain! Fucking weiner snap. 15.
Matt: 15? All righty. You manage to pull yourself halfway up the chain. You get back to where you were towards the base of the tail. That's the extent of your round there. The wind resistance itself, you can see the axe itself, after you tried to tug it forward, did bring it a little loose. So its position is still a little precarious.
Travis: Might as well say something cool. I can do this all day! I'm really not confident.
Matt: All right. Vax.
Liam: I would like to use my movement, if I can, with the blade I used to go this way, and I cut a big foot-long thing. I want to try to use my movement to reverse the direction of the blade and stab inward.
Matt: It would be part of the attack to draw it out and attack. It wouldn't use your movement. It would be part of the attack to draw it out and attack with it. It wouldn't use your movement.
Liam: My dagger hand's the one that's out. I want to try to maneuver the sword around and stab inward and keep cutting bacon in here. I want to attack the dragon, but still from the inside with the hand that's inside.
Matt: Okay. You're in a weird position now where the blade's at your side, so pulling away from the body, there's very little strength to pull that way, since you punched through the wound. So you're essentially holding the blade right here.
Liam: Then if I did this, can I just continue to saw in the same direction and do an attack?
Matt: You'd be at a disadvantage on it.
Liam: Visual. I don't know what I'm seeing.
Matt: T You stabbed through, you cut a wound. Holding that blade, you punched through, and the thickness is about most of your body's length. So most of your body is still in the wound. You've just barely pushed through, and you're still holding the blade back this way. There's no real strength to attack from this position because you're being squished.
Liam: Then I'm going to attack at disadvantage with the dragon blade, and then I'm going to stab with the dagger that's outside.
Matt: Go for it.
Liam: Dragon blade on the inside rolled a 15.
Matt: 15?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: There's just not enough strength to get it though. You try and pull upward and the blade comes loose, comes towards your body, but doesn't actually find any additional part of the muscle to cut through.
Liam: Dagger on the outside is 21.
Matt: 21? Just scrapes across the hide. Not strong enough to pierce it from the outside. You do also take one point of bludgeoning damage as the wound tenses around you once more. Scanlan!
Sam: For my bonus action, I'm going to fist the dragon again! Just going to jam it in there!
Matt: Roll an athletics check with plus eight.
Sam: 20!
Matt: 20! The hand pushes into the wound, causing it to tear open and rupture part of the stomach. As it punches through, temporarily leaving an open wound in the side of its stomach area, Bigby's Hand is partially outside the dragon now.
Sam: Great!
Matt: It takes 11 points of damage from the wound. And you currently have a little bit of light that's visible before the wound closes.
Sam: Before the wound closes.
Matt: The muscles re-tense. You watch it punch through and everything (gasp). It's the moment of impact.
Sam: I'm going to jump in the hole.
Matt: You leap in after Bigby's Hand just in the wake of it slamming into the side of the muscle of the stomach walls. In that one moment, you're rushing past, you can feel the actual muscles tensing behind you. Go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw.
Sam: Dexterity saving throw. 18!
Matt: 18! Okay! You manage to leap behind Bigby's Hand and grab onto the side of it as the hand punches entirely out of the dragon's body, the wound slamming shut behind.
Sam: Oh god, I'm outside the dragon?!
Matt: You are now outside the dragon.
Sam: (screams) Shit!
Matt: Holding onto Bigby's Hand.
Sam: Is he flying? Does he stay still? What does he do?
Matt: He is flying.
Sam: He can fly?!
Matt: Bigby's Hand!
Sam: Not as fast as the dragon.
Matt: Bigby's Hand can move up to 60 feet, so no, it's slower than the dragon. Starting to drag a little bit behind as it's moving.
Sam: God. Okay! Hand can't do anything else, right?
Matt: No, that was its action. That's most of your turn, really, at this point. That was your movement to push through after the bonus attack, so you have your action. I'll give you your action.
Sam: You're not going to let me cast another spell, probably.
Matt: You have an action, so you could, technically. You look out as you punch through. You look down below you suddenly after you take a moment to look, and you can see part of Vax emerging from the side of the dragon. And then the whole dragon and Vax vanish.
Sam: Oh shit! Wait, I see Grog?
Matt: You do see Grog, dangling from the chain, slowly pulling his way up towards the back.
Travis: (screaming) Scanlan!
Sam: I'm holding onto the hand?
Travis: (screaming) What the fuck?!
Matt: You are now right there with Bigby's Hand. (laughter)
Sam: The Hand can't do anything else.
Matt: Not this turn, no.
Sam: Shit. I just got out of the dragon. I don't know what's going on. I didn't even know we were flying. I'm just going to shoot a Lightning Bolt at him.
Matt: Okay!
Sam: Yeah.
Matt: All right. Advantage on the dexterity saving throw. What's the DC of it? The DC of the Lightning Bolt?
Sam: It's my spell. It's not through the Hand Cone, I assume.
Matt: Nope, you are clutching both hands onto the side.
Sam: 18.
Matt: 18. It makes the save. Roll damage, and it takes half damage.
Sam: 26.
Matt: 26. All right, so it takes 13 points of lightning damage. (blast) The bolt streaks upward, hitting the sides of the wound that you just came out of it, and arcs up the side of the body. Most of it is absorbed from the hefty, scaled hide of the black dragon, but it does (unhappy groan) roil with pain. You hear it yelling, and with a very slight shifting of light, you notice the dragon is still there, and you recognize this. This is an Invisibility spell. That ends your turn.
Sam: I guess so.
Matt: So, the rest of you guys, trying to keep up. The dragon's far out of range of anything you have, and it's just seems to be coasting as fast as it can out of the way, so you have nothing, I don't think, that can really go past a 300, 400 foot range. So you're just keeping on that eagle, holding on. You as well, you're behind the others, just slowly falling behind.
Laura: How fast can my broom go?
Matt: I think it's 50 feet. I can look it up again real fast. It's not a racing broom. Quidditch broom. I'll find it for you.
Laura: And my boots of haste don't do shit to a broom.
Matt: I'm going to look it up right now, just to let you know, so we can all relax.
Travis: It's the fastest model yet! I love Harry Potter.
Matt: I gather that. (laughter)
Matt: I love it, too. Broom of Flying. Flying speed is 50 feet. You can't even see it now. Grog's just become this little speck in the distance. All right, so as that's going on, are you doing anything?
Taliesin: I'm going to keep my eyes peeled on what I can see and try to keep up as best I can at treeline, like below.
Matt: Back to the top of the round. The dragon, Umbrasyl, now (wings flapping). Even you are being dragged behind nothing, you can hear the wings beating. You still have full sight of the dragon at this point. The voice growls out of its throat, "Fine. Let's see how well you hold on, insects!" It begins to spin and do a barrel roll. I need both of you, as also its muscles tense, to roll strength saving throws.
Travis: I have advantage on those.
Liam: Six.
Matt: Six?
Travis: 26.
Matt: 26. You get swung around, the chain taking the brunt of all the weight across its back. (popping) Comes free. Thankfully, you were in an up arc, but you are now arcing in the air. You also get ejected from the wound from the muscles tensing behind, it almost squeezes you out. Before you can even get a grapple on, the dragon vanishes from sight and you're now falling backwards.
Liam: I'd like take a chance to say, here, that when I went into this dragon, I was lost, and a wanderer. As I am shat out its side, I come forth a paladin of the Raven Queen. I have multiclassed and leveled up. And the last thing I'm thinking as I shoot out this hole in its side is: if you have any wings to lend me, now is the time.
Matt: Okay. As you emerge from the body of Umbrasyl, there is a streak of shadow that scatters into a burst of darkened raven feathers that fill the air around you. You still plummet, but as a nature of your prayer, that brief moment of understanding, it appears there is some reaction. That'll be that element there.
Marisha: Where am I in my minute?
Matt: Oh, you're like 20 seconds in. 30 seconds in.
Ashley: Are they all falling?
Matt: You guys now watch as, suddenly, Grog and Vax just (rush of air). Vax appears out of nowhere and is falling. Scanlan's being held aloft by a distant Bigby's Hand, and Grog is arcing in the air. At that point now, Grog, Vax, what are you doing as you're falling backward?
Travis: I take out a case of fancy wine and-- (laughter)
Travis: I pull out a fancy robe, of which there are two, and pull it out. I'm going to drop the Bloodaxe. I'm going to grab both ends of the fancy robe and just make the shittiest parachute of all time.
Matt: (air puffs)
Travis: There ain't much else to do.
Marisha: Shitty G.I. Joes.
Matt: Yeah, it's like 25 cent quality, above you, Grog, as you squeeze your eyes and hold on. Plummeting down towards the Bramblewood. Vax.
Liam: Hey, I'm a brand new paladin. Lay on Hands, which is going to do fuck all for me, but is that a bonus action?
Matt: I believe it's an action.
Liam: An action? Okay. I'm going to cast Lay on Hands on myself. And I'm going throw my poison dagger at the dragon as I fall. That's a 23.
Matt: 23 does hit.
Liam: That is ten points of damage with poison on it. It's a DC of 15 for poison. I'm sure it makes it.
Matt: Yeah, it makes it. It would've had to roll a one to not make it, unfortunately.
Travis: Could I add one bonus thing at the end of mine?
Matt: Sure.
Travis: Can I see Scanlan and Bigby's Hand at all? Or is the world just a clusterfuck?
Matt: Make a perception check, just glancing around you.
Travis: Four.
Matt: Four. No. You see earth beneath you, sky above, mountain to your left, and the inevitable plummet coming at you.
Liam: I'm thinking about my mother as I fall backward through space.
Sam: Distance between me and them?
Matt: Vax is about 20 feet from you, Grog's about 60, 70 feet from you.
Sam: What's the range of-- shit.
Taliesin: 50 feet.
Travis: Remember, we're going to be going the same direction.
Marisha: They're both falling, yeah. Vax will hit the ground first.
Sam: Vax will?
Travis: I'm higher.
Matt: The dragon's moved ahead to this point now since you guys have fallen off.
Sam: Is anyone higher than me?
Matt: Grog is. Vax is a little bit below you.
Sam: And he's not flying or anything, is he?
Matt: He's trying. He's holding a scrap piece of fabric that's just (rustling fabric).
Travis: I've seen Percy make shit, I can do it, too! (blows puffs of air)
Taliesin: You're doing very well. You're doing very well.
Sam: Wow. This didn't go well.
Marisha: I'm hoping you can hold on for a minute.
Sam: Okay. Yeah! I'm going to drop Bigby's-- 60 feet is not plummeting speed? I can't catch up to them as they fall?
Matt: Right now, you could catch up to one of them.
Sam: All right. Because Grog is over me, right?
Matt: Yeah, Grog is in an arc, so you would have to meet him as he fell.
Sam: I'll try to catch him then.
Matt: Okay, so you clutch onto Bigby's Hand and move as he plummets.
Sam: Shit, wait. Wait.
Matt: What are you doing? What are you doing, Scanlan?
Sam: Shit. Vax is below me, though.
Liam: He said you can get to one of them, so it's just a Sophie's Choice.
Sam: It's a Sophie's Choice.
Marisha: But who's on the lowest hit points?
Sam: Yeah, I would go for Grog if he's above me, with the hand.
Matt: Okay. The hand comes forward, sends out this cupping motion, the fingers below. You, eyes closed, clenching tight, (impact). All of a sudden, the wind stops, and it's like you're being held by your mother again, a memory you haven't recalled since you were a child. You open your eyes slowly, and you're still above the ground! Holy shit! But there's a giant purple hand around you and a very freaked out Scanlan clutching the outside.
Travis: Look what you did!
Sam: Hi, friend. Shit. We've got to go to Vax. I'll start moving us slowly down, I guess.
Matt: That was the turn to even get to him and catch him.
Sam: Then-- fuck.
Matt: You still have an action if you have anything.
Sam: I can't see the dragon anymore, right?
Matt: No. You have a vague idea of where it might be.
Marisha: Do you still have Polymorph?
Sam: Yeah, concentration.
Marisha: Fuck.
Sam: Yep. I mean, I can make Grog deaf so he won't hear us die. (laughter)
Matt: That's useful.
Taliesin: That seems like a really good use.
Sam: I got Grog. Fuck. Okay. I'm going to drop Bigby's Hand and Polymorph Grog into an eagle.
Matt: Okay. So, as you look over at Scanlan, with a big look of relief and thank you, he gives you a cursory look as the hand vanishes.
Travis: What. What?! (screams)
Sam: Holding on to him!
Matt: He grabs you real fast, and suddenly you have feathers! What the shit! And, strangely, you become smarter! As giant eagles have an intelligence of eight.
Liam: Quick, come up with a plan!
Travis: It's a new day, baby.
Sam: His brain is just geometry.
Matt: It's a Beautiful Mind moment in the middle of the sky. Suddenly you understand, the instinct hits you, and (whoosh). You have wings. You feel Scanlan's tiny hands grasping the back of your neck.
Sam: And I just yell at him, dive, motherfucker, dive!
Travis: (caw)
Matt: All right. You guys start seeing this happen in the distance and a little sparkle of hope hits you, whatever it may be. Coming back around to the top, Umbrasyl is taking a double dash motion. He's past.
Liam: He got away.
Matt: Grog, it's your turn.
Travis: Can I see that flurry of black feathers streaking downwards of this guy?
Matt: You do, and it is a perpetual flurry. They're coming out of nowhere. It is this long, visual line of black feathers that are being tossed from beneath Vax's flapping cape.
Travis: We're going full Point Break terminal velocity, straight down towards Vax.
Sam: I hope I can hold on! There's nothing to grab onto, is there?
Matt: There's just heavy feathers and digging in.
Sam: Luckily, I have a grappling hook. (dink dink dink)
Travis: Maybe in my dive position I could squeeze your legs with my wings, how about that?
Laura: You're really smart. You would think to do that.
Travis: I would.
Ashley: Yeah, you would.
Travis: I would also think, what idiot was just flying behind the back of this dragon on a chain? What a fool.
Matt: So as you go into a full dive, that's 80 speed, that's 160 feet. (whoosh) You manage to just crest underneath the plummeting Vax, the trail of black feathers, trailed by a long line of brown feathers being plucked out from Scanlan, feverishly trying to grab onto your back for some sort of purchase. Pain. You deal with pain all the time. It doesn't dissolve your focus. Vax, I need you to go ahead and attempt to grab onto the eagle as it swoops beneath you. Go ahead and make a single strength saving throw.
Liam: No, wait, Luck! I have one last Luck.
Matt: This is the time to use it.
Laura: Oh my god!
Liam: 21.
Matt: As the eagle swoops underneath you, you reach out. You don't even see it, you're looking up into the sky as you plummet, the trail of feathers going past as you concentrate on the acceptance you've made to the Raven Queen, and the understanding that perhaps, if there is a chance to survive, let it be through this leap of faith you've taken in the direction of an entity that you've been so fearful of and scoffed at since she came to you in your dreams. A moment, you see the feathers begin to trail off and subside from beneath your cloak, and a voice whispers in your ear and says, "Left." Without thinking, your hand reaches out, without even seeing, and you (impact) grab the edge of Scanlan's cloak.
Sam: Oh no!
Matt: As you're dragged behind, you (choking) from behind.
Sam: It's worth it, it's worth it!
Matt: You can barely breathe as the eagle swoops up, you can feel the heartbeat, the blood flowing in the back of your head, your ears hot (heartbeat) as you slowly reach over and grab the back of the eagle. Is this Keyleth? You don't know. All you know is Scanlan swooped in and in this moment of need, seemingly, a prayer was answered. So what are you guys doing?
Laura: And you're itty bitty still!
Liam: I prefer raven-sized.
Matt: Yeah, he's tiny. That's the only reason I'm not having him tear you off the back of the eagle, because of the size.
Travis: Unless I hear otherwise, I'm making a controlled descent towards the ground.
Matt: Okay. You guys see this in the distance as now the eagle captures the falling Vax and then begins to head down towards the base of the mountain where the Bramblewood meets.
Laura: I guess we head down that direction.
Ashley: Yeah. Make the eagle follow.
Matt: Okay. You guys make your way downward towards the bottom. Keyleth, you finish your concentration on the stone. (whoosh) Suddenly, you step through, being pushed through a tunnel of blue light and energy, and for a moment, all you see before you is Vax's face, his tiny little raven-sized face.
Marisha: So cute!
Matt: (whoosh) As you guys watch Keyleth apparate right in front of Vax, and go speeding past you, as she's now plummeting from the air, having summoned to your side.
Marisha: I'm technically an earth elemental still.
Matt: You're still earth elemental? So yeah, you see Keyleth as a giant boulder that appears at the side. You have to dodge out of the way (whoosh) as this giant rock being, out of the corner of your eye, appears before you. However, she sinks straight past you. You're flying as low as you can, you're going terminal velocity, and there is this (rumble) rock entity plummeting at the same rate.
Taliesin: A meteor.
Marisha: You know, it was a good idea when he was still in the dragon.
Matt: Yeah, I know. It was.
Liam: (singing) I came in like a wrecking ball!
Matt: At about 200 feet up, you continue to plummet.
Marisha: 200 feet? That's all right.
Matt: All right. You're not doing anything else? You're going to take the fall?
Marisha: Well, what's below me?
Matt: The very edge of the Bramblewood and the base of the mountain. You're not quite sure where you'll land. You see treetops and rocks.
Taliesin: What's the worst that's going to happen?
Marisha: I would hit zero hit points as an earth elemental and go back to Keyleth.
Matt: And then the rest of the damage would carry over.
Marisha: Right, but 200 feet. That's survivable.
Matt: That's 20d6.
Sam: You'll be fine. What's that? 60 points.
Marisha: Yeah. It's roughly 60 points, and I've got 67 left as this earth elemental.
Matt: All right, so you're going to take it?
Marisha: Hang on, wait. Wait, wait. If I'm going to do this, I'm going to do it right. I'm going to ball up like a cannonball and light up my hands, that I keep forgetting because I didn't know I could do them in elemental form, by the way. Thought it was only beast form. I'm going to light myself on fire and go meteor.
Matt: All right. You guys watch as the earth elemental curls up, forms this streak of flame and smoke behind, and now a plummeting Keyleth meteor goes slamming into the base of the mountain just past you as you pull up from impacting at terminal velocity.
Marisha: I was trying to leave an impression. No pun intended.
Matt: You suffer 76 points of bludgeoning damage upon impact.
Sam: Of Jor-El damage. (laughter)
Matt: (boom) This giant crater is left around your form as now there is this somewhat smoke-swirled Keyleth sprawled out in the center of this.
Marisha: I drop, and I stand up, Keyleth, in the middle of a giant crater.
Matt: The rest of you all eventually catch up. The eagle-back carriers, you on broomback, finding your party bruised, hurt, but ultimately survived this moment of the encounter. As you've all had this moment to yourself, Vex, you hear a noise to your left coming from the exterior of the Bramblewood.
Laura: Can I see what it is?
Matt: You glance off to the side, and you can see, emerging, slowly from the forest, a single humanoid standing before you.
Sam: Is he single?
Matt: No. You see, slowly coming forward, a woman. An older woman, an older goliath woman, missing one eye and missing her forearm-- her left arm, right at the elbow. The right arm clutches a very tall quarterstaff that is being used as a walking stick as she wanders up. You can see dirt smeared in her face, darker dreadlocks pulled tight against the back of the head that dangle past the shoulders, tattoos similar to the ones that adorn Grog across the face and shoulders. She slowly walks towards the party. Let's go ahead and bring our guest for the evening out. You can go around the other way. Let's welcome Chris Perkins!
Liam: Welcome, Chris, welcome!
Taliesin: Is he coming to this side?
Matt: Right to the edge, next to you, Keyleth.
Sam: Do you know how to play this game?
Chris perkins: Keyleth meteor, what?
Marisha: Yeah, that's me.
Matt: As she steps up and emerges from the forest, everyone turns and sees the worry on Vex's face.
Laura: (laughs) Vax pours a drink.
Liam: It was very frightening.
Laura: Halt! Who are you?
Chris perkins: My name is Shale.
Laura: What's your business here?
Chris perkins: I was following a scouting party out to the mountain. But these old bones don't take me as far as fast as they used to.
Travis: Do I recognize Shale?
Matt: You do, actually. Not very well. Shale has been around longer than you have as part of the herd, but is mostly considered past her prime as a warrior. Since she lost her arm, was set to the side, and a lot of the herd seems to not value their elders when they become less powerful in battle, but even still, she carries a bit of spit and vinegar to her. But it's been a while since you've seen her, and to see her surviving out here, both curious and honorable.
Travis: Shale.
Sam: Sorry. You're still an eagle.
Matt: (caw)
Travis: (caw)
Sam: Grog, do you want to say something?
Chris perkins: I will brandish my quarterstaff, my rune-covered quarterstaff, and try to hold this big creature at bay.
Matt: Shale's holding her staff out.
Chris perkins: Stand down, bird!
Liam: I love you! Let me love you!
Sam: All right, all right. I'll drop the form. I'll drop the form.
Travis: Thank you, god. Shale.
Chris perkins: Grog? Is that you?
Travis: Yeah, it's me. I know, you can't tell.
Chris perkins: You're kind of a blur. What's on your face?
Travis: It's a beard.
Chris perkins: You've gotten big.
Travis: Yeah. Lots of lifting. Lots of running, getting strong.
Chris perkins: Last time I saw you, you were the runt of the goatball team.
Travis: Oh.
Laura: You were a runt, Grog?
Travis: No, when I was born, she means. When I was born.
Laura: Was he rather small?
Chris perkins: He was puny.
Travis: Puny compared to mountains and stuff.
Ashley: What's goatball?
Chris perkins: It's a game you play. You stand on pillars of rock, and you hurl balls at each other.
Laura: Made of goats?
Chris perkins: Made of goatskins. Skins, my dear.
Marisha: Sounds kind of fun.
Chris perkins: The object of the game is to knock the other opponents off their pillars.
Liam: That's more civilized than what we were imagining.
Travis: It's a lot of fun, actually.
Laura: Shale, what were you doing out here with a scouting party? It seems--
Chris perkins: We were spying on the dragon. Damnable beast.
Laura: Did you succeed?
Chris perkins: No. The scouting team did not fare well.
Marisha: Are any of them still alive?
Chris perkins: No. They're all dead.
Sam: How did you survive?
Chris perkins: I was slow and stupid. I shouldn't have gone at all. I couldn't keep up with them. By the time I got to them, they were corpses.
Sam: You sound like an excellent addition to our team, then.
Chris perkins: She says, I would have killed the dragon as soon as it came upon us, when we first arrived in Westruun, but that damn Kevdak formed an alliance with the beast.
Laura: Wait, you think you can kill a dragon?
Ashley: Wait, what did you just say? Oh.
Sam: We knew that.
Ashley: Yes. Realized it as I was saying it.
Chris perkins: That is how I wanted to die. Fighting the dragon.
Marisha: It's funny, we almost just died fighting the dragon. How ironic.
Travis: We put a good hurting on it, yeah. Do you-- I mean, not like I'm questioning what can you do, because I don't think it's very much.
Marisha: I'm actually great. I'm just in a smoldering meteor and look like a badass.
Matt: Which caught your attention, the large, crashing boom.
Chris perkins: That was it.
Liam: I yank on Vex's hand from down below and say, pick me up! Put me on your shoulder!
Laura: What's the matter? Can you not see anything down there? I pop Trinket out and put Vax on top of him. Don't you feel so tall now?
Liam: I am tall.
Marisha: How much longer is he going to be tiny?
Matt: How long does the potion last?
Liam: I rolled a three, so that's three hours.
Matt: Yeah, three hours.
Travis: Sweet.
Liam: We have to decide what to do. He's gone back to his hole. He's going to rest. He's going to heal.
Marisha: I just have such a hard time taking you seriously right now. I'm so sorry.
Travis: So you had to have been a part of this party for a reason. What's in your bag of tricks? What can you do?
Chris perkins: I smash things with my stick.
Travis: With your stick. Does magic come out of your stick?
Chris perkins: It is a magical staff.
Travis: Oh, well, that's good.
Sam: Yeah, we could use more of those.
Travis: Is it a magical staff of dragon killing?
Chris perkins: It will be if we get on with it.
Travis: I like that.
Liam: I like her, too.
Marisha: So, Shale, did you and your scouting party find out any additional information that might be handy?
Laura: Maybe how to get into the lair without it knowing?
Marisha: What she said.
Chris perkins: I know nothing of use.
Laura: That's wonderful.
Liam: You never made it up to the cave entrance, did you?
Chris perkins: I made it up to the dead ones. That's as far as I got.
Laura: How far were the dead ones?
Chris perkins: A ways.
Marisha: All right.
Sam: I hate to tell you this, but Kevdak is gone.
Chris perkins: No great loss.
Sam: Your whole herd may have perished fighting this same dragon.
Liam: Not all of them.
Marisha: A lot of them.
Travis: But it will all be worth it if we can remove the head of this shitty black dragon.
Chris perkins: I agree.
Laura: Plus, Zanror is still alive, as is his wife. I think.
Sam: Maybe.
Marisha: We hope.
Taliesin: Possibly.
Travis: So, how far would you think that we are from his lair?
Chris perkins: I'll just crane my neck up the mountain.
Matt: It's a sizable climb. Gatshadow-- While this portion is the south part of the Cliffkeep Mountains, which get higher the further north you go, this mountain is called Gatshadow because it is dark and ominous and stands out amongst the rest of the mountains. While the other ones crest at about maybe 4,000 feet up, this one's nearly a mile, a little over a mile high.
Laura: Well, we can obviously fly.
Matt: There are sparse trees, most of them dead or dried out towards the top, but other than that the vegetation is pretty sparse.
Travis: Look, I'm a little jacked up. I think those two are a little jacked up.
Marisha: I could use a short rest.
Travis: It's fair to assume that he will do the same thing, yeah?
Sam: Yeah.
Travis: Go brush his teeth, have a deuce, all that stuff.
Marisha: We're trying to catch the dragon while he's still debilitated, right?
Liam: The longer we wait, the harder it will be.
Ashley: What if I just heal everybody and we keep on?
Sam: Yeah, that's great.
Ashley: I don't want to lose the damage that's on him.
Sam: Yeah, heal us and let's keep going. Quickly. How long has it been, a minute? Two minutes?
Matt: Since you guys landed here? It's probably been about two, three minutes.
Sam: We've got to move.
Travis: Can we travel a mile up a mountain quickly?
Sam: We have eagles.
Matt: Even at your fastest pace, eagle speed...
Liam: The broom and the two eagles at this point?
Matt: The broom is slower than the eagles. Eagle speed you're looking at about-- I'm estimating somewhere between ten to 20 minutes.
Liam: That's enough for a short rest for it. He's not going to go back to full strength, but he's going to go back up a bit.
Laura: Would we know that?
Marisha: We don't know what he has access to.
Matt: You would know, being as dragons are your favored enemy, and you have information on that. Generally, they don't-- They themselves can recover over time, and if given a full day or so, they can largely recover from the wounds they have sustained almost entirely, especially a dragon as powerful as an ancient. You would know that, because they understand and fear their demise, or at least are arrogant enough to think it's not possible, they will have certain reserves to try and help them recover if they ever find themselves in a dire circumstance. Occasionally, depending on the intelligence of the dragon and what resources it has at its disposal.
Marisha: Reserves. What do you mean?
Laura: Healing stuff?
Matt: Some semblance of healing magic, items they may have acquired that can help. The longer you wait, the more it can recover, is essentially what it comes down to.
Liam: We need to go now. We need to go.
Sam: Should we mist form it there? Can we do that?
Laura: That takes too long to think about.
Marisha: I can get us there via trees.
Sam: But you'd need to know a tree that's there.
Marisha: I need to know a tree that's there. I could Scry, look for the closest tree, teleport us there, but by the time I'm getting there, I'm exhausted.
Liam: Are you able to see a tree from a great distance?
Marisha: If I Scry.
Liam: Not even by eyesight?
Marisha: I mean, I guess I can look around and take a guess.
Ashley: I'm going to cast Mass Cure Wounds on everybody.
Matt: All right. Go ahead and do that. And Shale, you feel nice and warm at full health as the Mass Cure Wounds tickles you.
Laura: Is your arm back?
Matt: Unfortunately, no. If only!
Sam: The temporary hit points never go back up, right?
Matt: Correct, no. They were just for that little bit of damage.
Chris perkins: Lost it in an avalanche, I did.
Sam: Today?
Chris perkins: No, turd.
Matt: The Scrying will take you about ten minutes or so.
Laura: Are we going to Scry it or are we just going to go? How long would it take if we just flew up? 20 minutes?
Matt: That's if you were all on eagle-back. Which you don't. You have eight people, and you currently have two summoned eagles.
Liam: Speed of the slowest.
Matt: Yeah, the speed of the slowest here, you're looking at walking up the mountain.
Marisha: Yeah. So I can teleport us closer and then walk, or we can take a very short rest so I can get my beast shaping back, and then could fly a few more of us. It's a gamble.
Chris perkins: You take your rest, love. I'll start up the mountain.
Matt: Shale walks away and starts hiking up the rocks at the very base of Gatshadow.
Travis: Can I just say that we agree that the reason we didn't do what Zanror wanted and go to the lair is because it's a fucking death trap?
Sam: Yes, but the dragon is injured now.
Travis: But he's going to heal up by the time we get there.
Sam: Not all the way.
Travis: Pretty good.
Liam: It's still the best chance we have. We have to kill it now.
Travis: In its lair?
Chris perkins: It's your destiny to fight the dragon, Grog.
Marisha: Wait, what? What was that, Shale? Is that true?
Chris perkins: No, it's not true. (laughter)
Ashley: Everybody is healed 27.
Chris perkins: It's just a thing old women say.
Marisha: Just let him believe it.
Liam: Kiki, may I have my-- Sorry. (higher voice) May I have my cloak back?
Marisha: Oh, yeah, sure.
Liam: Thank you. (flump, whoosh)
Matt: To attune to it will take you a short rest.
Marisha: So are we resting?
Matt: That's up to you guys.
Liam: I don't know. But I'm still putting it on.
Travis: When I turned into the eagle, what happened to the Bloodaxe and chain?
Matt: Actually, you check, and the equipment that you have attuned to you and attached go into the form with you, so at this moment you realize, "Oh, the axe!" You look behind you, and it's just been dragging behind you in the dirt, carving this path in the rocks and rubble.
Travis: Yeah. That's nifty.
Matt: Like a kid with a deflated balloon you're just dragging behind you.
Laura: Can I-- well, I can't sense anything about it with Hunter's Mark, I just know where he is.
Matt: You know where it is.
Laura: And he's up in his lair.
Matt: He is up at the top of Gatshadow, somewhere in that mountain.
Laura: Moving around, or is he chilling?
Matt: At the moment, seems chilling.
Sam: Let's go.
Matt: Short rest or not, what are you guys doing?
Marisha: How long would the hike up the mountain be? An hour?
Matt: It's about a mile up. You're looking at the better part of a day.
Sam: Oh, a mile up.
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: Unless we fly.
Taliesin: What if we take shifts with the eagles?
Matt: Take shifts with the eagles? Back and forth?
Taliesin: Eagles fly a group up, fly down, pick up another group and bring them?
Matt: Probably about an hour.
Taliesin: But that's an hour with a short rest for everybody as well.
Matt: If you're going to do it that way, yeah.
Liam: Half could rest at the top while the eagles fly back, and the ones at the bottom could rest.
Taliesin: So there's a short rest.
Liam: Shifts of resting, yeah.
Matt: You're still looking at about an hour and a half at that point, with people moving there and back and getting enough rest. You can't short rest on the trip, and the short rest is about an hour, half an hour.
Liam: Eagles drop off, they rest while the eagles return, and the people at the bottom rest while the eagles are making the trip, no?
Matt: Right, but you still have to have the eagles that went to the bottom to pick up the second team to get there, so you're still looking at about an hour and a half to two hours.
Laura: I could also use another spell and summon a couple more eagles.
Sam: Sure.
Laura: I could summon two more eagles.
Liam: That's worth it.
Laura: And that could get how many of us up?
Liam: All of us up at the same time.
Sam: But one is just for Grog, right?
Laura: But two more eagles would get all of us up?
Matt: It's a concentration spell. You can only have one of it up at a time.
Laura: It is?
Matt: Yeah. And it only lasts for an hour, and you've already been at this for probably about ten, 15 minutes.
Laura: So they're about to go away.
Matt: You have about another 40 minutes of the eagles.
Marisha: So we couldn't do round trips anyway. They'd dissipate.
Matt: You'd just have to recast it.
Marisha: Well, yeah.
Sam: That seems like our fastest option. What's the other option? A short rest and then we bamf.
Marisha: We rest and then go. If we rest for 30 minutes, and then I switch and then we have the eagles, then we can get up in another 30 minutes, and then it's an hour. Theoretically, short resting is our shortest.
Matt: You said you have Transport Via Plants, right?
Marisha: I do.
Matt: If you wanted to Scry up that mountain and look at one of the trees at the top, you could do that. That would be, technically, the fastest way.
Marisha: But then we'd still have to hike. How long would the hike be?
Matt: It depends on how close the nearest tree to the cavern would be.
Sam: Let's do that.
Marisha: I'm tapping myself-- I can do it, but I'm tapping myself out. I'm burning literally all my top level spells and I have no beast shapes left. But I can do it. It's what we think is most important.
Laura: What if we use the eagles, send them up. Once they're used up, they're gone at the top, and then I'll just summon two more and send everybody else up? Once the people make it up the top, that way it takes less time. A couple people hop on the eagles right now, because we only have a little bit of time left.
Marisha: Can I rest? Can I rest while the first round goes?
Matt: Sure.
Travis: We're fighting a dragon in its lair! In the worst place we could possibly fight it!
Sam: We've also dealt so much damage to it.
Matt: Umbrasyl was looking pretty rough.
Sam: I fisted through it!
Taliesin: He said looking pretty rough.
Travis: That's because he's a liar and a bringer of death, and he is smiling at you while he does it.
Taliesin: I know.
Sam: What are we going to do today with Chris Perkins? Talk, or go fucking kill a dragon?
Taliesin: Would you like a tour of Whitestone? It's really lovely this time of year.
Chris perkins: I'm judging you!
Liam: Grog, she's right. It is your destiny.
Travis: In your tiny voice.
Liam: What are you laughing at?
Laura: Everybody hop on an eagle.
Ashley: I hop on an eagle.
Taliesin: Hopping on an eagle.
Sam: Well, no, half of the people hop on an eagle.
Laura: Two of the halflings-- two of the gnomes can get on.
Ashley: Scanlan.
Sam: I'm in back?
Ashley: Yes.
Liam: I'm sort of a halfling. Can I get on too?
Matt: At your size? The three of you would probably be able to take one eagle, because you are tiny.
Sam: Oh, that's right, he's a little one.
Laura: All right. You guys go.
Liam: See you in a bit, sis! Bye, Keek!
Matt: So we'll say, for the purposes of this, it'll take an additional cast of your spell, so mark off a second casting of Conjure Woodland Beings. However, that brings-- What level is that?
Laura: That is level-- Oh, good. Level three.
Matt: Conjure Woodland Beings?
Laura: So I've got two level threes left. With my Pearl of power.
Matt: Conjure Woodland Beings is a 4th-level spell, Laura.
Laura: I have Conjure Animals, not Woodland Beings.
Matt: Animals, there we go. Sorry, so yeah, that is 3rd-level. So yeah, mark off your second casting there. You guys manage to make a short rest between the journeys, making your way up towards the dark, blackened rock peak of Gatshadow. We're going to take a short break here for restroom. We'll be back here in a few minutes. In the meantime we have an awesome video from Backblaze to show you guys--
Ashley: Yay!
Taliesin: It's really cute.
Marisha: It's for you guys!
Matt: We'll be back here in a few minutes guys, stay tuned for apparently the attack on Umbrasyl's lair. See you in a minute. [break]
Matt: Welcome back, everyone. We've had a little break here. A quick announcement for you guys, the rebroadcast tonight will be delayed for about 30 minutes as we have to shoot something directly after this so we can all go home. So, if you guys are in chat after and folks are showing up going, "Where's the rebroadcast?" Just let them know it'll be around, about a 20-30 minute break between. We appreciate you guys carrying that thread over to them when they arrive. So we've had a break. If you wanted to use any of your hit dice to heal up during the short rest, now's the time to do it. You've re-attuned to the Dragon Slayer Longsword. And just so you guys know, both Grog and Vax leveled up to 14 as well. Vax took a level of paladin during the short rest. Grog also took his 14th level as a barbarian. As a berserker, a lot of you know what that means.
Sam: I don't know what that means.
Liam: We'll find out. I'd like to re-attune to the Cloak of Displacement. And the Boots of Haste, are they spent for the day for anybody? If I were to wear them, could I get the juice or no? They're done?
Laura: They're too big for you, teeny.
Liam: They would shrink to me. I'm going to re-attune my Keen Dagger, then, for the moment. So it's Deathwalkers Ward, Keen Dagger, Cloak. Three items.
Matt: Okay. I'll let it happen. Usually, you attune one item in a short rest.
Liam: Oh, okay. No, I can do one.
Matt: I think it's fine for this. You get attuned as you walk up the rest of the way. It's fine.
Travis: I've rolled all nine of my hit dice.
Matt: So you're out of hit dice?
Travis: Yes.
Matt: All right. Everyone else good? Ready to jump back in?
Taliesin: Nope.
Matt: (laughs)
Sam: Does anyone need more healing? Are we okay?
Marisha: Yeah, we're good.
Laura: And because I Conjured Woodland Animals, I lost my Hunter's Mark.
Matt: Yes, you did, but you know loosely where it was.
Sam: All right, let's hurry.
Matt: As you guys slowly make your way up towards the peak of Gatshadow, you all come to rest maybe, from what best you can tell, is the entrance cavern that Umbrasyl currently calls its home. Across this blackened, dark craggy surface, you see clumps of dead, petrified trees. Leafless, gnarled, and devoid of any life. There are signs of melted stone, soot. Long ago, there may have been a fire that claimed the top of this mountain and set its visual presentation that got its name. However, this is your moment, should you wish to make your way towards your conflict with Umbrasyl. How do you wish to prepare?
Laura: I want to sleep for a day.
Marisha: Yeah. I want to rock back and forth in a corner.
Liam: I'd like to go stealth and I'd like to see-- is there one clear, main entrance to this place?
Matt: There is a cavern opening.
Liam: Yes.
Matt: There are a few small little inlets into the mountain at certain points, but the path that you guys land on that ends? You're going to have to climb around the mountain to get to the entrance of this. There is no walk-up path. Actually, just an opening on the side of the mountain.
Liam: So we're further down still. We're not near the entrance?
Matt: You're about 400 to 500 feet away from the entrance.
Laura: I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us.
Matt: You stealth ahead and look a little bit and you notice the path comes to an end. You probably have about a hundred feet that you have to scale the side of mountain to get to the entrance.
Liam: From where I am, I can tell that we need to climb around it. If I look very hard, do I see any little holes or cracks or anything above?
Matt: You see one other small entrance about maybe 60 feet below it, a little bit to the left.
Liam: All right.
Sam: Pretty cool sound effects
Chris perkins: It's freaking me out.
Laura: Is that your music?
Matt: That is not my music. That's the atmosphere.
Taliesin: Shale, Shale. The scouting party. Where did you find the bodies? Where were they left?
Matt: Which actually you-- this was probably a couple hundred feet back. They made it near the peak. However, they were spotted upon the approach, and you heard the battle. The very short battle that ensued. Heard the screams of them, far from your eyesight.
Chris perkins: I will have pointed them out, then.
Matt: Yeah.
Liam: So that's why I cast Pass Without a Trace on us.
Liam: How far above our position is that smaller entrance-- (noise of hissing gas)
Matt: It's all atmosphere, guys. I paid them to do it. I know. All right. Towards where the actual walkable portion of this mountain cliff ends, you have about 40 feet of scaleable wall, at an upward angle, before you can reach that small little inlet that you saw there. An additional 60 feet beyond that is the larger entrance where you saw, the best you can tell, Umbrasyl retreat towards-- or exit before, when you were watching him emerge from the mountain. That's it.
Liam: What do you think? Do you think I should climb in that little hole?
Laura: Do you want-- say that again?
Liam: There's a main entrance above. But there's also a smaller, little gap lower down. He cannot fit in there.
Marisha: I can try and scry inside the cavern.
Laura: See if it's something that would be worth--
Marisha: Get a battle perspective?
Laura: Yeah.
Marisha: All right. You have to give me a few minutes. Is everyone all right with that?
Laura: Can I use my ranger skills to try to camouflage us into the side of the mountain? To make us even more non-seeable?
Matt: Yeah. Totally. So we'll say for the purposes of that, anyone at this point who'd like to make a stealth check, to go ahead and keep yourselves hidden from any onlooking parties.
Marisha: Natural 20.
Laura: Add ten.
Liam: Natural 20!
Marisha: Hey!
Matt: Add ten for Pass Without a Trace.
Sam: 17.
Taliesin: 24.
Chris perkins: 22.
Travis: 16.
Ashley: 29.
All: Whoa!
Ashley: What?! (laughter)
Liam: Why, I do declare.
Ashley: Well, I do declare I'm invisible.
Matt: The armored cleric cannot be seen. (laughter)
Laura: 32.
Matt: With Vex's help, you guys manage to take bits of the mud, soot, and the burnt remnants of the once lush forest that dotted this mountainside, and darken your exteriors to help obscure the vision of anything that wished to pry, along with the magic drawing the shadows to your forms. You're pretty confident that most of you would be fairly difficult to be spotted by most creatures.
Liam: I would just like to point out that my complete total is 45.
Ashley: Of stealthing?
Laura: Thank you. Thank you for pointing that out.
Liam: Yes. It's mostly for your benefit.
Laura: I appreciate it.
Matt: That's ridiculous.
Ashley: How?
Laura: How?
Liam: Natural 20, plus my 15 benefit, plus Pass Without a Trace. Poof! (vanishing sound)
Matt: You've stealthed through time. People who had seen you previously in your past, have no recollection of ever actually seeing you. (laughter)
Liam: Marty McFly's holding a photograph.
Matt: Exactly. All right. So, what's up now?
Marisha: I take a little of the soot, and I give myself some druid battle make-up.
Matt: There you go, just smear it.
Laura: Yeah. Did you scry yet?
Marisha: I'm about to.
Laura: Okay. I do the same thing. I soot my face up, too. Let's all make battle paint while she's scrying.
Taliesin: Absolutely not. (laughter)
Marisha: Pretentious asshole.
Ashley: I want to do a hand. (laughter)
Laura: I get soot on my finger and walk up to Percy and just put a line from his forehead down his face.
Taliesin: I feel violated, but thank you.
Chris perkins: I'll ask Grog if he wants any soot on his face. I'll walk over.
Travis: I'll put soot on your face if you come near me with that wicked, wicked staff of yours.
Chris perkins: This is not wicked. It's just a staff. It doesn't even have a name.
Travis: What?! How could you have a staff and not give it a name?
Chris perkins: Only men name their things. (laughter)
Marisha: Yeah. My staff doesn't have a name. It's so true.
Chris perkins: You know, if you kill this dragon, you'll be the greatest goliath that's ever lived.
Travis: No.
Chris perkins: Yes!
Travis: Really?
Chris perkins: No one else has killed a dragon of this size. Not among us. Not among the Herd.
Ashley: Grog.
Travis: Pike killed a dragon.
Chris perkins: Did you, now?
Ashley: Well, we all did. But it wasn't this big.
Laura: It was pretty small.
Ashley: It was pretty-- it was a lot bigger than me.
Chris perkins: I'm sure that experience will come in handy.
Sam: All right, let's do this.
Marisha: All right. I scry. I focus really hard on the dragon.
Matt: Okay. On Umbrasyl?
Marisha: Yeah.
Sam: Do you need any of his stomach bile to help you scry?
Marisha: Sure! Can I have some of the-- I scrape a little stomach bile--
Sam: Does that help? Does that help?
Matt: Well, here. Let me pull up the actual specifics for Scrying here.
Chris perkins: This is going to go well, I can feel it.
Marisha: Wait. He's going to sense what I can scry, can't he? Maybe I can just try and scry inside the lair?
Matt: It largely depends.
Sam: What do you want to do?
Marisha: I mean, he knows we're coming, yeah?
Laura: Can you scry that little cavern to see where it leads to? Can you scry your mind up the cavern?
Marisha: Yeah. Actually, can I do that? Like it's a camera drone?
Matt: It's more like picking a location, as opposed to an actual--
Marisha: Sure. I want to try and focus on Umbrasyl's whereabouts, but I want to see if I can get a nice bird's-eye view of inside the cavern.
Matt: Okay. You are familiar with the target as you've done battles, that does adjust the saving throw for the scry. So, without further ado, what's the DC of your spells currently?
Marisha: 19.
Matt: 19. Hmm. As your eyes close, your vision projects itself beyond your form, beyond the craggy landscape of Gatshadow, out beyond the mountain pass that ends abruptly. Beyond the cavern entrance, you are pulled within the darkness. Suddenly, you find a little bit of light scatters across the damp stonework of the inside of this cavern. You see stalagmites. You see pools of murky, greenish-brackish liquid, ever so gently disturbed by the wind that curls in and out of this cavern. You see towards the back an elevated platform next to another pool, where a large outcropping of stone that has just slowly pulled itself out of the rock, nearly touching the very height of this cavern. You don't see anything in there. All you hear is (low breathing sound).
Sam: He's asleep.
Chris perkins: (loudly) What do you see?
Marisha: Ah! (laughter)
Marisha: Well, nothing now. That's it? That's all I see?
Matt: That's all you see.
Laura: Did you see Umbrasyl?
Marisha: No, but I heard him. He sounds very rough, or possibly sleeping? I don't know, there was a lot of heavy breathing. Very deep-- not, you know, shallow breathing. Not impassioned breathing, Scanlan.
Laura: Could he still be invisible?
Marisha: He could I guess still be invisible. Also the cave was covered in acid pools and dark and dingy and everything else we would expect.
Laura: Yeah.
Marisha: I know.
Travis: Let's do it.
Sam: Okay. We're going in the small hole or the big hole?
Marisha: I don't think he caught my presence. I don't think he's necessarily expecting us. We can have the element of surprise, here.
Liam: Let me check out that hole on top. You guys can watch me do it.
Laura: Go in the little hole, then.
Liam: I'm little now. It's a big hole. It's quite big, actually.
Laura: It's roomy.
Liam: I'd like to climb up to it.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead--
Liam: Spider-sense tingling the whole time.
Matt: All right. So you manage to find bits of rock and pull yourself across the way. It's not too long a distance but enough to the point where I need you to go ahead and make a basic strength check.
Liam: 14.
Matt: 14. Okay. It's hard and you feel part of your muscles build up lactic acid from the exertion, from the previous round with Umbrasyl and you not being necessarily the strongest individual of the troupe, but you do manage to scurry your way up to the edge of this small opening in the mountainside. Getting inside, you get a look: this hole continues for about 15 feet into the mountain before it ends abruptly. The only other thing you notice is there are currently four long-dead skeleton corpses within this hole. Perhaps some sort of mountain-climbing expedition or travelers that found their way there, and couldn't escape. There are remnants of a small camp. Perhaps a small fire that is long iced-over through winters past. A layer of dust sits on everything and other than the occasional gust of wind that finds its way in here, largely undisturbed for a long period of time.
Liam: I want to look through the remains.
Matt: Okay. You rummage through the remains. You find roughly 85 gold pieces amongst their corpses and spare change in silver and copper--
Liam: I don't take that.
Matt: Copper. The pennies of D&D. Poor things. Copper dragons everywhere are just so disappointed. You do find an oil lantern, climbing gear for four people, some long-spoiled rations. And you find a very moldy diary.
Liam: I take out the Flametongue Dagger and give myself some light.
Matt: As you're scanning through most of the pages that are still intact and not completely molded over or destroyed, it appears to be a journal that contains writings of what was an expedition to reach the peak of Gatshadow, because there was some sort of movement, some sort of activity up there that nobody could really discern. The rumors speak of some sort of creature that would stalk out in the night and steal mountain goats. (belches) Pardon me. Goats! Steal mountain goats, steal or find and kill anybody who lived in-- there used to be a smaller village that lived north on the mountainscape that is now abandoned because of this creature the folklore of the time said supposedly lived at the top of the mountain. It speaks of the entrance, the place that Umbrasyl now calls the lair, and this leads you to believe that this is a fresh lair. Umbrasyl did not appear to always live within Gatshadow, but is only currently making it its lair at the moment.
Liam: Is this a dead end? Does it look like it goes further in?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Liam: By the light of my dagger.
Matt: Actually, this would be investigation.
Liam: Investigation? All right. 20. No, wait-- Yeah, 20.
Matt: 20. Feeling along the walls, you find elements of the rocks that are easier to break off than others, but this is predominantly the end of this cavern.
Liam: It's a cave. Okay. I tell my sister  it's a dead end. It's nothing. Coming.
Matt: So Vax finds his way back to the group.
Sam: It's a dead end? Jesus. This ain't going to be good. Shale, would you like to lead the way?
Chris perkins: Yes. Now, I may not survive this. I'm quite old, and I can only see about 30 feet ahead of me--
Laura: Well then, maybe she doesn't lead the way. (laughter)
Liam: My sister and I should lead the way. You stick to Grog, will you, grandma?
Chris perkins: I whack him. (laughter)
Matt: (whack sound)
Liam: Wait! I don't get to dodge?
Matt: No. Because, unexpected, she is swift, and she is strong for being one-armed and of her age. The sting hits the side of your shoulder before you have a moment to really understand and your diminutive form is thrown about three or four feet back before you catch yourself.
Travis: (laughter)
Liam: I skitter off ahead of the group.
Marisha: I cast Protection from Acid on Grog, again.
Chris perkins: Now, if I don't survive, loves, I do have some magic on me. So this staff has runes. You can scratch them off and magical things will appear! And this horn, if you blow it real loud, it will let out a tremendous thunder that could bring down the entire cave.
Sam: I don't think you should be planning for your own death!
Laura: I'll take the horn.
Chris perkins: It might explode.
Sam: It might explode?!
Chris perkins: It's a little unstable.
Laura: Scanlan, you should take the horn.
Sam: She's not dead yet!
Laura: I'm saying when she dies. If she dies.
Sam: We're not going to divvy up her stuff! That's bad luck!
Liam: She's bequeathing it to you in her will.
Chris perkins: And this pendant here, which looks like a dragon tooth, it's a dragon tooth. And if you wear it, it will close your wounds.
Laura: Could I insight check her? I feel like she's lying through her teeth. (laughter)
Matt: Make an insight check.
Sam: Maybe we should just kill her now and take the stuff.
Laura: Natural 20.
Matt: Really? So, Chris?
Chris perkins: I'm being super sincere.
Laura: Oh. I really want all those things--
Chris perkins: She honestly believes. (laughter)
Marisha: Shale, you seem almost like you're--
Chris perkins: My hide armor ain't worth shit.
Marisha: As I was saying, you seem like you're almost expecting to die, or you're looking forward to it?
Chris perkins: Well, I'm very old. And if I could die fighting a dragon, well, there's no better way to go. If I don't die, great! Wonderful!
Marisha: All right. Just checking that we wouldn't disappoint you if you don't die.
Travis: Wait, just to be clear  if we kill the dragon, are you going to say you killed the dragon or would you say I killed the dragon? Who's going to be the greatest goliath?
Chris perkins: Why, you, of course.
Travis: Yeah?
Chris perkins: I'm past my prime.
Travis: We'll shake on it?
Chris perkins: I will shake on it.
Matt: Which is easy because you put out the proper hand for the one arm she has.
Chris perkins: You want to mess with her, put out your other hand. (laughter)
Marisha: Shale, what type of magic do you wield, exactly?
Chris perkins: I wield this staff.
Marisha: Okay. Very clear.
Taliesin: This is going to be great! I'm on board and committed to this. This is very exciting!
Sam: Thank you, Shale. Let's try to live.
Marisha: So remember, acid pools everywhere. Do we have any type of cohesive plan, or just--
Sam: We're just going to go in.
Taliesin: Just be very quiet.
Liam: I'm already looking for traps, looking for danger.
Matt: So you're coming up to the entrance.
Liam: I'm not going to go in the entrance, but I'm going to try to climb up and peer over the edge and look as carefully as I can.
Matt: Go ahead and make another strength check.
Liam: 17.
Matt: You manage to climb your way up to the larger mouth of the cavern. It's about 40 feet across at the very front of it. And about 50 feet up. It's this large--
Liam: 40 feet, 50 feet?
Matt: Yeah. And the rest of you guys? Are you pursuing?
Sam: I'm going to come.
Matt: Rest of you climbing along the mountain as well?
Sam: Wait, is that the way in?
Travis: Is there anything you can do to make the dragon visible with his invisibility? Set fire, or your faeries?
Marisha: I do have Faerie Fire. You combine the two things that you said and it's fantastic.
Travis: Totally meant to. Okay. I'm just climbing. I'll follow them.
Matt: All right. Everyone who's climbing, I need you to roll a strength check.
Marisha: Wait! Who's climbing where?
Matt: There's no actual walkway to it.
Laura: Does anybody want to ride the broom with me?
Taliesin: I'll ride the broom. I'm not a climber.
Sam: My Gloves of Swimming and Climbing, are those attuned items?
Matt: I don't think they are, no.
Sam: I'll put on my Gloves of Swimming and Climbing, which I got two years ago.
Travis: 26.
Marisha: 19.
Sam: I don't know what they do.
Matt: Advantage on the roll.
Sam: Oh, great! 16.
Matt: 16? Okay.
Chris perkins: 18.
Matt: 18. All right.
Ashley: 12.
Matt: Okay. And you're floating up?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: All of you begin to shimmy across the surface. The wind is piercingly cold. The clouds up here are dark and there isn't enough moisture to rain, but there are flashes of some sort of wild lightning storm that go off in the distance in the roiling clouds. As you're making your way across, Pike, your foot skips across one of the stones, it breaks and falls beneath you and you almost lose yourself. Grog grabs you, and holds you in place, and pulls you back up.
Ashley: Sorry, Grog.
Travis: Nobody saw anything.
Ashley: I thought I would be stronger, but I'm still not.
Travis: You're a champ.
Laura: Wait! Aren't you wearing the strength gauntlets?
Ashley: Yes, I am. That brought me to 12. (laughter)
Matt: You all slowly make your way to the very mouth of the cavern. You've been at this point, as well. You wanted to go ahead and make an investigation?
Liam: Scootching in, yeah.
Matt: All right, go for it.
Liam: 24.
Matt: 24. Feeling around the exterior, there are two rocks that are nearly identical, placed at each side of the cavern entrance. Upon approaching, their texture and their weathered appearance is far younger than the rest of the stone around them, and that catches your attention.
Liam: Do I need a further investigation check to discern their nature?
Matt: The nature is some semblance of a magical enchantment. This is a little beyond your understanding unless you want to try and roughshod it in the way you know how.
Travis: Call me up to the front. We got this.
Liam: Scanlan, do you want to grab that big...
Sam: Big what?
Liam: Shale.
Sam: Oh, Shale.
Liam: And yourself.
Sam: You got a trap up there, friend?
Liam: Something. There's rocks up here that look a little funky and I don't think they actually are rocks.
Sam: Rocks? Hey Keyleth, you should go. There are rocks. You could do something with rocks--
Marisha: I love rocks!
Sam: Yeah, I know. Go up there with Shale. Shale's a rock. Go.
Marisha: Okay. What's happening? Where am I?
Liam: Just come up a little bit slowly. There are a couple of rocks up here that look a little funny to me. Don't step on me.
Marisha: Oh right! You're so tiny right now. I keep forgetting that.
Chris perkins: You're very brave for someone so small!
Marisha: Do you want me to put you in a little pouch? Could be like a kangaroo?
Sam: We're going to die!
Liam: Another time.
Matt: As Keyleth and Shale approach the threshold that you're currently standing at, the rest of you are a little ways behind. He points out these two stones. Go ahead and both of you guys make an arcana check. Shale, just from what you've seen in the world.
Chris perkins: Right. 13.
Marisha: I think like, seven. Pretty sure my arcana-- It's seven.
Matt: Oh, druids. You ascertain, Shale, just from stumbling upon such constructions, this is-- There's some sort of magical essence to these rocks. It's old magic, which is the only reason you really recognize it. It's not the hoity-toity-learned-in-a-tower magic all the stupid people in the world tend to learn. This is old magic. That's all you were able to pick from it.
Liam: You know what it is?
Chris perkins: Old magic. (laughter)
Liam: Hey, dirty bard, could you come up here?
Sam: Oi! I'm here now. Sorry. I thought that the rock people could handle it.
Liam: All hands on deck.
Marisha: Scanlan, it's a very pretty rock--
Sam: 11 on arcana.
Matt: It's old magic.
Sam: This is old magic. (laughter)
Sam: Not the kind you learn in those hoity-toity towers.
Ashley: What's going on down there? (laughter)
Sam: Can't you just melt the rocks, Keyleth?
Marisha: Pike, these are very attractive rocks. What does it look like?
Sam: It looks like a rock. Melt it!
Marisha: No. What does it look like? Is it like a slate?
Matt: There are two stones about three to four foot in diameter that are almost matching, that are younger, less weathered than the rest of the stonework around them.
Chris perkins: Is there any way to circumvent them? Or are they in opposite sides?
Matt: They're on opposite sides. You could circumvent them, they're not in your path.
Marisha: I can alter their shape. I can melt, I can do something with them.
Liam: No. Just, they're not real. A few steps back. Trickfoot's--
Marisha: What do you mean, they're not real?
Ashley: I walk up.
Laura: Can you dispel that shit?
Ashley: Yes. Is it magic--?
Sam: It's old magic. (laughter)
Chris perkins: It's old magic. (laughter)
Taliesin: Not the kind of magic you learn in ivory towers.
Chris perkins: Older-than-me magic.
Ashley: That's just old. (laughter)
Sam: It sort of has that old smell to it.
Liam: Hey, fuck it. I'm going to take a good, hard look at this rock.
Marisha: Hang on. We might be able to circumvent it. Right? Can we go around it?
Ashley: I have Dispel Magic, but I wonder if we should use it.
Sam: Dispel that magic!
Ashley: But that's one of my last spells!
Laura: Well then, let's avoid them. Let's just go around them.
Marisha: Is there room on either side of them?
Matt: They are embedded in the sides of the wall. So you could pass through them, over them, however else you want to try and circumvent them.
Marisha: How about this? I'm going to cast Stoneshape, and can I carve out a little path around one of them, on the edge? Carve a little recess?
Matt: You can, yeah.
Sam: See? Rocks! I told you!
Marisha: Rocks!
Taliesin: Old rocks. Not the kind of rocks one finds in ivory towers.
Matt: Yes. Your 4th-level Stoneshape. You cause a portion of the rock wall at the side of the cavern to actually forge itself into a tunnel, circumventing the exterior rock on the left.
Laura: Could you just do that the entire way into the cavern?
Marisha: I can do it two more times. All the way into the cavern.
Sam: Okay. Let's go through the new hole.
Liam: I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to keep doing the same. Come on, you big giant dummy.
Laura: I'm on a broom, do you want to ride it with me? Just kidding-- Percy's already on.
Liam: I'll stealth ahead and look around.
Matt: Okay. So roll your stealth check.
Liam: A new stealth check?
Matt: Yeah, because you've come out of stealth and back into it.
Liam: Okay. Well, I still have Pass Without a Trace, right? So I'm at 40.
Matt: So you make your way into the next portion. You're actually able to start seeing--
Taliesin: Whoa! Slowly!
Liam: You people don't see shit.
Laura: Oh, that's acid!
Matt: --in a raised platform, in a pool of somewhat pungent-smelling liquid as you get even remotely close to it, the fume causes your sinuses to open and burn and tingle.
Liam: They barely get in.
Laura: Yeah. (cutesy voice) It's too small...
Liam: I'm just going to hold still for a second and listen. Do I hear anything?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Liam: 27.
Matt: 27? You hear a very faint breathing. Breathing that is trying to stay quiet, but by the sheer immensity of the beast creating the sound, you can pick up the very subtle movement of air through the normally still cavern. (faint breathing noise)
Liam: I'm going to quietly take-- I'm going to back up 15 feet. (whispers) For everyone who's next to me, and for those who are not, it is in here. It is awake. And it is waiting for us.
Chris perkins: What did he say?
Liam: Pike. Don't. Move.
Ashley: I'm so still.
Liam: Just coming running to go when shit goes down, but don't move.
Travis: (whispers) What about putting her on my back?
Liam: Grog, don't move yet. I'm going to go back in for another look.
Sam: Alone?
Matt: Stealth.
Liam: Well, yeah. I'm not a barbarian. I'm going to go along the edge closest to you and move back to where I stopped to listen.
Matt: About there would be in tandem with where you were.
Liam: And I'm going to go another ten feet in, looking.
Matt: As he curls back, the cavern is revealed further. The pool does come to an end. There are pieces of stone that jut out of the floor. You do see now, scattered across the grounds, occasionally a bit of shine, a little coin-- gold, silver-- elements of wealth that've been dragged deeper into the cavern that have left behind them some remnants in the process of being carried and carted in.
Liam: If I look back, can I see my sister from where I am?
Matt: Actually, no. Because she's really well stealthed.
Liam: She can't see me either?
Matt: No. You guys have no visual perspective on each other. You've all stealthed away from your own party.
Liam: Okay. There's a pool of acid right by me, yeah?
Matt: Yes, there is.
Liam: Is there dim light here?
Matt: The light grows dim at about this point, then it becomes darkness at about this point.
Liam: But you said that I can see a pool of liquid, right?
Matt: Yeah. What little bit of daylight that's coming in the cavern entrance would be over here.
Liam: Is the surface of the liquid flat as far as I can see?
Matt: What you can see, it is flat. There's a little, very faint breeze that occasionally comes through so there's a slight disturbance here and there, but no specific visual disturbance.
Liam: How far along that pool can I actually see? If you had to do a cut-off point?
Matt: Because of your darkvision, being an elf, you can see pretty much to the edge of this.
Liam: Okay. So it doesn't look like there's a big divot?
Matt: There's no displacement of the pool.
Liam: I'm going to creep along the wall towards that pillar. I'll stop in that corner, and then move towards you one. Does it give me a better view?
Matt: A little bit of a further view, just the cavern continues in that direction.
Liam: Can I still hear the same thing?
Matt: You can hear it very faintly. You can't quite make out the source. There is something about the room and the air that's travelling through here. The sound itself, you're just barely catching it and it seems to be reverberating to a small extent off the walls of this cavern, which carry sound very well.
Liam: What do I see if I look up?
Matt: You look up, you see about 60 feet, 70 feet in the air, just past where your vision begins to fade-- The only reason you know there's a ceiling there is because there are a few points of rock, the top of the cavern does descend into stalactites-- it is?
Chris perkins: Stalactites, yes.
Matt: Yes. Thank you.
Liam: There's no large outcrops that this thing could be sitting on?
Matt: Not from what you can see, no. The mineral build-up of the inside of this cavern leads to a direct, slick surface in the walls. The minerals rounded off most of the stone.
Liam: I'm going to backtrack. I'm going to find my sister. And I'm still very little. It's at the back of that cavern. It's not in the pool of acid that's near the front, and it's not just past that. It keeps going back. So if we're going to do this, and we're all just going to throw ourselves into it, and let the chips fall where they may. The best thing that I can do right now is take it unawares, hurt it for as much as I can--
Laura: Are you kidding me right now?
Liam: I'm not kidding you! I want to kill this thing. This is the first stepping stone, and I could potentially take it out. Catch it unawares before it vomits on all of you. I want to do it, and I just want to know that you're going to come in after and finish it if you need to. I told you what I want to do.
Laura: All right. I will give you a minute head start to get across the room. After that, I'm coming in. So you better hope you're at the dragon by that point.
Liam: I start off. Come back and tug. (whispers) Jenga.
Matt: Make a stealth check.
Liam: I'm going back to where I was.
Matt: All right. What is it?
Liam: With Pass Without a Trace? 43.
Matt: All right. So you're back where you were. The rest of you, what are you doing?
Chris perkins: Well, he's a mad little one, isn't he?
Sam: He's not usually little. (laughter)
Liam: I'd like to go around the column, and around the edge of the wall.
Matt: This opens up slightly more, and you get to see a portion of the mineral growth-- a lot of the moisture that has coalesced into the ceiling has come into a central point, and over time, it just built up these central columns of rock and natural materials. A few pools have gathered towards the base. You see portions of the ground where elements of the acrid liquid that filled the pool over here just dripped in. Whether they began this way or turned by the dragon's presence, you are unaware. But that's as far as you can see.
Liam: Further along the wall, that little rock-- yeah. And just a little bit past it. And then closer to you.
Matt: At this point, you can make out that additional pool of acid, the far back corner and a risen platform, you see the portion of the cavernous stone beginning to mass into a higher level towards the far back corner.
Liam: I listen.
Matt: Roll a perception check.
Liam: 20.
Matt: 20. You listen in... Silence. Stillness. The very faint whisper of wind far behind you.
Liam: Around the entire wall. Further, past that pool of acid, even. Further corner.
Sam: Has it been a minute yet?
Taliesin: About half a minute.
Matt: As you come around this corner, being as careful as you can, looking around you-- (impact). Your shoulder hits something.
Liam: Stab.
Matt: Roll initiative.
Liam: I'm going to call it. I mean, mostly I'm 14. I'll take it, that means 19.
Matt: All right. So you have just bumped into the currently invisible form of Umbrasyl lying in wait in the far corner of the cavern. That would be a 20 initiative from Umbrasyl.
Liam: Fuck. You.
Laura: How long has it been?
Matt: At this travel pace, it's been about 45 seconds or so.
Liam: Jenga! (laughter)
Matt: You hear "Jenga!" out of the back of the earring as, let's say the rest of you guys are right here.
Laura: I still want to be stealthed on the broom but I take off into the cavern.
Matt: I assume Trinket is in your necklace?
Laura: Yes.
Matt: All right. This is going to be you, with your big stick.
Chris perkins: Awesome!
Matt: Chilling here with the rest of the party. So, at the top of this round, you just hear the growl, the snarl. (snarling) You say "Jenga," blades already at the ready, you go to stab as (swooshing) all of a sudden, you hear this swishing sound of air being cut through at such a speed that it causes a high-pitched whine. Claws and teeth come spinning out of nowhere. You can't even see your attacker but you feel the brunt force behind each of these blows.
Liam: Because it's invisible, is there no Uncanny Dodge?
Matt: No, you've still got Uncanny Dodge on one of the attacks. Just from your roguish instincts.
Liam: Displacer Cloak.
Matt: Correct. It gets disadvantage on the first attack, which is going to be a bite. That's a natural 19, and a two! With the two, that brings it to a 17.
Liam: Nope.
Matt: So with that, you (whoosh) see for a split second, the ripple of teeth snap before you, missing your face by mere inches before they disappear once again. Two more claws (whoosh) towards you. The first one, that's a 19 again and a seven. That's going to be a 22.
Liam: Just hits. Uncanny Dodge.
Matt: Oh, your AC would be 20 because you're not hasted right now.
Liam: Oh, you're right. Thank you.
Matt: So that would put you at 18 points of slashing damage.
Liam: Halved to nine.
Matt: Halved to nine. Also your displacement is gone from your cloak.
Liam: For this round?
Matt: Yeah. For the next attack, it's a 19. Misses you? 20? Yeah. The second claw swings through, at this point, from the pain of the first strike of the dragon claw hits you, you back up to the very edge of the cave and duck out of the way as you hear the wind change. As you do, you hear the stone crash behind you as the claw misses you, slamming instead to the side of the cavern wall. It's now your turn.
Liam: I'm going to stay right here. I'm going to hold my turn until one of my friends is on top of this thing and then I'm going to stab it.
Matt: You hold your action until one of your friends is on it and then you move? Okay.
Liam: Not on it, but against it, attacking it. Melee attack.
Matt: So that ends your turn. Everyone else, I need you to roll initiative.
Marisha: Oh, shitballs!
Travis: Balls of shit.
Marisha: Whoa! Percy!
Matt: Your initiative from before was--?
Liam: 19.
Matt: So 25 to 20?
Laura: 22.
Taliesin: 30.
Marisha: He rolled a natural 20!
Matt: (laughs) Percy!
Laura: Are you on the broom with me still?
Taliesin: Yeah. I'm hanging so I can drop.
Matt: So that's 20. 20 to 15?
Chris perkins: Another 19.
Matt: Another 19! Nice!
Marisha: 17.
Ashley: 18.
Laura: Nice, Pike!
Matt: So Pike then Keyleth.
Travis: A mere 16.
Matt: Scanlan, what did you get? (laughter)
Sam: I got an eight.
Matt: And Scanlan taking the rear. As you guys hear the crashing of stone at the far corner accompanied directly after the whisper of Vax's cry-out of "Jenga!" you already know shit is going down. Percy, you're up first. Clutching the bottom of the broom that has not moved yet, what are you doing with your turn?
Taliesin: I'm going to drop down. I'll let go of the broom. I'm going to just fire blind where I heard the noise coming from.
Matt: So you're firing in this direction?
Taliesin: Yep.
Matt: Go ahead and make your attacks at disadvantage.
Taliesin: Disadvantage. That is a 25.
Matt: Due to the massive size of this currently still invisible entity, you do manage to catch an odd bullet towards its form. Go ahead and roll damage.
Taliesin: Oh my god. Ten points of piercing damage.
Matt: All righty. (gunshot sound) Gun goes off, echoes, little bit of dust comes loose from the ceiling and falls down as you ready for your next shot.
Taliesin: I'll take the next shot. Forget it. Might as well go for it.
Matt: At disadvantage.
Taliesin: That's 20.
Matt: This time, the shot goes the second time (gunshot sound) poofs against some stone in the distance, not hitting its mark.
Taliesin: Third shot for the run. Fucking--
Marisha: Natural 20.
Taliesin: And a one.
Matt: So with that, the third shot (click), nothing emerges from it. And you look down. It's not been a day for Percy.
Taliesin: It's not been a day for Percy. I'm going to start making a dash into the corner there, up in the--
Matt: Not a dash, because you used your action.
Taliesin: No, I'll make a run. Yes, to the wall.
Chris perkins: Is that some sort of weapon?
Taliesin: Not anymore, it's not!
Matt: As she takes her one good arm and cleans out, missing an eye now or maybe missing an eardrum. (laughs) That's going to end your turn, Percy?
Taliesin: Oh god, this is a terrible idea. I'm going to roll and hide behind that pillar behind me. If that's okay?
Matt: This one, right here?
Taliesin: Yeah. I've got to fix this.
Matt: That brings us to Vex.
Laura: Yes. I'm going to fly on my broom as far in as I can. And land, maybe on that? And just shoot arrows towards where I heard it coming from. I feel like I have one blazing bowstring left, because I used it once in the last battle, right?
Matt: You would still have one more use, yes.
Laura: Okay. Then I'm going to try it through the blazing bowstring.
Matt: Go for it. At disadvantage on this shot, as you cannot see the actual entity. You're firing into the darkness.
Liam: Natural 20. And another natural 20?
Laura: Piece of shit! 19.
Matt: 19? Nope!
Ashley: Oh! War God's Blessing.
Matt: Okay. As your reaction, you guide her-- though the blazing bowstring was unfortunately used on the first attack that missed.
Laura: That was just for the first attack. I rolled twice for disadvantage. So that's the blazing bowstring.
Matt: Okay, I misunderstood. As you go for the attack, you see the actual arrow bursting into flames, not quite sure where to fire. You're about to pull back and aim and Pike shouts to you, putting her hand out. Suddenly, a spark of divine energy hits the front of the bow and corrects its course, beyond your actual arm motion, and you release, based on the faith you have in Pike. The arrow strikes true. You hear a slight growling roar from the distance. Go ahead and roll damage.
Ashley: Strike good and true!
Laura: 22.
Matt: 22, nice.
Laura: On my first attack! If I release Trinket, is that an attack? Or is that a bonus action?
Matt: It would say in the actual item.
Laura: Raven's Slumber. You can make a melee attack. No, that's not it. Bonus action to release it! I'm going to use a bonus action, and I'm going to shout at Trinket to go run towards my brother. I'm going to attack it again.
Matt: You send Trinket out, ten feet in front. Trinket is going to go-- it's 40 feet, right?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Trinket rushes forward there. You go make your second attack. Trinket goes: (angry bear growls) big old grizzly bear charging into the darkness, growling echoing through the cavern.
Laura: Oh, disadvantage. 27.
Matt: 27 with disadvantage still hits, yeah. Your honed senses to dragon-kind, you can remember the mass, and general size and placement based on the sound you heard from the growls from the first impact you made. You just strike again in the same direction, hitting true. Roll damage.
Laura: 12.
Matt: 12 damage.
Laura: Is that sneak attack because my brother is next to it?
Liam: It's occupied with me.
Laura: So I would have gotten the sneak attack on both those? Or just on the one?
Matt: Just on the one. Yes, I'll allow it because he is currently threatening it. It was a lucky shot. It was a very lucky shot.
Laura: Additional five.
Matt: All righty, good to know. So, total of--
Laura: 17.
Matt: 17. Thank you. Both arrows done. Trinket rushing in--
Laura: I want to duck down if I can, behind that whatever that I'm standing on now.
Matt: You can duck down, but you've used most of your action in this turn to sail in, and you can't hide per se.
Laura: Okay. I just want to duck behind it so I'm away from anything flying at me.
Matt: Makes sense. All right, so we're now at 20. At this point in time, the roar hits (roaring), echoing through the cavern. As the echoing begins to vibrate and the noise doesn't subside, the low hum turns instead to a (buzzing) as seemingly out of the pool of acid, a cloud of biting, stinging insects emerges.
Marisha: He did Insect Plague.
Matt: (buzzing) Floats in this direction, getting the three of you right there. I'll say for the purposes of this that you guys are both in that radius. Anyway, this cloud of insects moves in to-- I need Percy, Shale, and Vex to make constitution saving throws.
Chris perkins: Aw, eight!
Taliesin: 21.
Laura: 18.
Matt: 18. So you guys both, being dexterous and quick, but also able to maintain your form-- the best you can at this turn-- manage to pull out of the way without too much impact. However, poor Shale is surrounded by the insects.
Chris perkins: Slow and half-deaf.
Matt: You take 12 points of piercing damage as the insects riddle you with bites and stings.
Sam: Shale, do you have any gold teeth or hidden savings accounts that we should also know about?
Laura: She can't hear you, she's deaf.
Matt: At this point now, you hear a few footfalls, Vax. You see a splash in the pool next to you that almost scatters against you, bits of it hitting the edge of your armor, but the armor absorbs the blow, being attuned towards acid resistance. A few other steps as it begins to walk away. I'll allow you to make an attack of opportunity with disadvantage--
Liam: With disadvantage, but-- Yeah, okay.
Matt: Yeah, as you sense that it's moving away, you wildly swing out in front of you.
Liam: Nah. 15.
Matt: 15. Whiffs on air. However, (heavy footfalls) moving forward. A voice comes roaring out into the area, "You dare soil my home after what you've done below?! I will watch you dissolve before I suck down your liquid forms!" I need Vex, Pike, Keyleth, Scanlan, and Percy to all make dexterity saving throws.
Taliesin: Do I not have cover?
Matt: Not enough to prevent this. It's a lobbed stream of liquid acid that comes and surrounds, corroding.
Laura: Do we get advantage on any of it?
Matt: Not unless you have something that gives you advantage on him.
Taliesin: I'm spending a Resolve because that was bullshit. Can I burn another Resolve? Goddamn it.
Matt: Nope. All right, so.
Sam: Can I use Cutting Words to buff my roll?
Matt: You use Cutting Words to reduce the damage.
Sam: But not to-- That seems right, yeah. All right. 18.
Matt: 18, all right. Hold on, I'll just double-check while you're saying this. Just to bring up the ability.
Sam: I should know this.
Matt: It would have to be a damage roll, because there's no attack roll. There's no other roll incorporated on this other than the damage roll.
Sam: Got it. It just happens.
Matt: Right. But it reduces the damage roll, which affects everybody.
Ashley: Wait! I think I cast Resistance. I cast it on Keyleth, I cast it on--
Laura: Me. And I think you cast it on Scanlan.
Matt: It's faded since it's a concentration spell.
Taliesin: Scanlan's got the armor.
Matt: Yeah. If you were to use Cutting Words on this, it would reduce the damage all of you would take from it.
Sam: All right, I will use Cutting Words to reduce the damage.
Matt: What are your cutting words, Scanlan?
Sam: My cutting words are, "Your lower intestine smells like shit!" (laughter)
Matt: Go ahead and roll your bardic inspiration die.
Sam: A ten? Shit roll. Three!
Matt: So 18 saving throw. What was yours?
Taliesin: Ten.
Matt: Keyleth?
Marisha: 14.
Matt: Vex? One. Pike?
Ashley: Seven.
Matt: Seven. Okay, reduced by three, you all suffer 47 points of acid damage.
Sam: Including me, with my acid armor?
Matt: You take half of that.
Laura: Aren't you glad I gave you the armor?
Matt: You take 23 points of acid damage. After its long, angry, boastful diatribe, as it rears back to blow, your words confuse it, and the spray seems a little off-center than what it intended. However, most of you are now currently dealing with the searing pain of the acid pressed against your bodies. Ending that turn, Vax, you're up.
Liam: Did I see where the ejection of acid came out from?
Matt: You did. It came from there, this area.
Liam: Am I still at a disadvantage even though I saw right where that crap came out?
Matt: Correct. Because you don't know if it moved away or not. You don't know exactly where it is. You just know it's somewhere in that vicinity.
Liam: I'm going to throw two daggers at it. I hope that Trinket's near it, but we'll see. So, at disadvantage. Bollocks! That's 15.
Matt: Nope.
Liam: 22.
Matt: 22 just hits. Trinket, however, is actually adjacent to Umbrasyl. So you could do sneak attack damage.
Marisha: Whoa! What's up?
Liam: Keen Dagger. It's 26.
Matt: 26. All right. So one dagger just vanishes into the darkness. The other one sticks into the hide for a second before disappearing in a plume of smoke, reappearing at the side of your belt. You hear a low (snarling grunt).
Liam: Can I use my movement to go along the back edge of the cave as far as I can? Directly opposite from my family.
Matt: All right. Looking at the rest of this cavern--
Laura: Look at all the gold, hiding over there!
Matt: There is what seems to be the majority of the funds that were gathered from Westruun, and whatever else of the previous dragon's hoard have currently been brought over to the new lair. Who knows how much has been--
Liam: I thought that was his magic healing spot, but I guessed wrong.
Matt: So, that end your turn?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: All right. Now it comes to Shale.
Chris perkins: I'm with insects, right?
Matt: You are currently surrounded by stinging, biting insects.
Chris perkins: Okay. I will stride forth. I'm slow and old. I move 20, so I'll use all my movement, 40, to advance.
Matt: There you go. You come pushing through, brushing them off with your stump and your staff, waving it in front. Angrily growling, you come to rest at the side of this one pillar that juts out of the ground, with Vex right above you.
Chris perkins: I'll dimly look into the darkness and see if I can see, hear, or there's just gray mist in front of my eyes right now.
Matt: You can't see anything. But you do hear right in front of you a growling, snarling bear. You see elements and flashes of the bear that you saw Vex summon forth from her throat.
Travis: And the dagger disappeared into something, right?
Chris perkins: All right. But I can't hear the dragon? At all? It's stomping around.
Matt: It's stomping around a little bit. You saw where the actual projectile came from, so you know it's somewhere in this vicinity.
Chris perkins: Well, you're not very brave, are you? Invisible! Hiding! Afraid to show your face? Taunt it. Oh, bollocks! (laughter)
Chris perkins: Well, that would be a nine.
Matt: A nine. You hear, slowly curling out from the darkness ahead of you, "Bravery means nothing. Survival and victory mean everything!"
Chris perkins: Oh, shut up, you flying suitcase!
Matt: And that's how you end a round. Pike, you're up.
Marisha: Oh, it's something my grandma would say. So good.
Ashley: Yeah. I'm going to hold my action and I'm going to backpack onto Grog.
Matt: Okay. So you move over and leap up onto Grog's back, holding tightly. What's the trigger for your action that you're holding?
Ashley: On his next attack on somebody.
Matt: The next time you sense the dragon is attacking somebody?
Ashley: Yes.
Matt: All right. What action are you holding? Is it a spell?
Ashley: Yes.
Matt: So you begin preparing the spell. You are now concentrating on it, as you're holding the back of Grog. Okay. Holding that bit, that brings us to Keyleth. What are you doing?
Marisha: If I move through Insect Plague, will I take damage? Or is it if I end in it?
Matt: You don't know.
Chris perkins: I seemed to waltz through it.
Marisha: That's true. You waltzed through it. And you didn't start in it, did you?
Chris perkins: I did.
Marisha: Oh. But you took the damage up top, you didn't take damage again after you got out of it. All right. I want to see if I can move. I'm having a hard time seeing, Matt. Can I get my full movement of 30 feet into this corner here?
Matt: Over here?
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: You're going to get up around there, unless you want to try and go over the top of the rocks. That way is going to require a climb check.
Marisha: Oh really, I can parkour it? Yeah!
Matt: All right, go ahead and make a strength check.
Marisha: 14.
Matt: Yeah, it's not too hard. You ran up, grab, leap over the side. You can get right there.
Marisha: Oh, okay. I think the dragon is roughly here?
Matt: In this vicinity. You can see Trinket is currently snarling and lashing out and biting in this area of the cavern.
Marisha: I'm really sorry, Grog. I'm going to cast Faerie Fire, roughly-- Yeah, somewhere where I think he is.
Laura: Why is that bad?
Marisha: Means you don't have acid resistance anymore. It's a concentration spell. But none of us can see him, yeah.
Matt: All righty. So, Faerie Fire. You guys watch as suddenly, this burst of somewhat violet-ish blue light, like a small, tiny explosion of glitter and starlight just hits the area and outlines the entirety of the large dragon Umbrasyl.
Marisha: And with my bonus action--
Matt: Yeah, failed saving throw.
Marisha: Damn right, he did. With my bonus action, I'm going to go into my--
Matt: Actually, you know what?
Marisha: He's going to do his thing, isn't he?
Ashley: You know, you don't need to.
Matt: Yeah, I do. Third and final legendary resistance. You get a glimpse of where Umbrasyl is and then the magic dissipates. Umbrasyl vanishes from sight.
Sam: Shit.
Taliesin: You've burned his third legendary action. You've burned it. It's gone.
Sam: Matt, did it also negate my disadvantage from Cutting Words, on the save?
Matt: He can succeed automatically. It's a choice to succeed.
Sam: Balls. So that's dead, too?
Matt: Nope.
Sam: Does he use the legendary action before he fails?
Matt: No. That's true. Yeah.
Sam: So it kills that too?
Matt: It does, yeah.
Sam: Nice. No, my thing's dead too. He double-fucked us.
Marisha: Great. Fuck you, asshole!
Laura: He doesn't save it like that?
Matt: Well, no. Essentially he rolled at disadvantage to make the saving throw. Failed it. And then decided to succeed using legendary resistance.
Marisha: Okay. But it's gone! They're gone.
Ashley: They're gone, gone?
Matt: As far as you know, from previous experience with dragons, there are no further uses of its legendary resistance.
Marisha: What a dick.
Matt: Does that end your turn, Keyleth? It's a level one spell, you still have more up your sleeves if you wanted to try it later.
Marisha: I know. I don't think I'm going to go into my beast shape form so I can do another spell next turn. Can I just tuck and see if I could take a bonus action to hide in this little nook and cranny here?
Matt: You can't use a bonus action to hide, unfortunately.
Marisha: Because I'm not a rogue?
Matt: Because you're not a rogue. Sorry, girl.
Marisha: Can I hug that pillar and say, (panting)?
Matt: You can totally do that. And you are currently hugging in the pillar going, (panting). At the end of Keyleth's turn, it's going to use two of its legendary actions to wing attack. It's going to beat its wings, everything within 15 feet, which right now would only be Trinket, has to go ahead and succeed on a dexterity saving throw. Go ahead and roll a dexterity saving throw for Trinket.
Laura: I'm going to roll the brown dice for Trinket. Dexterity? 12.
Matt: 12. Okay. So Trinket takes 15 points of bludgeoning damage--
Laura: He's resistant to bludgeoning!
Matt: Because of the armor?
Laura: Yes!
Matt: So takes seven points of bludgeoning damage. However, he is still knocked prone from the blast of wind that whooshes through the entirety of the cavern, causing dust to raise up. The cloud of insects gets shifted a little bit before having to reform back into its place from the sheer force. In doing so, suddenly, there's a rush of air, and two giant slamming sounds, as feet have placed themselves right up front with Shale and Vax. Vex. I've got a lot to concentrate on.
Sam: When I die, I'm coming back as a character named Vix.
Matt: Then you can find another Dungeon Master. All right, so that ends Keyleth's turn. Grog, you're up.
Travis: I take the tiny Pike backpack, and I would like to run along the right, the farther wall from you. Opposite direction.
Matt: This way?
Travis: Yes.
Matt: All right.
Travis: 50 feet, using diagonals to try and get as far around that pool as I can.
Matt: That's about as far as you can get there. So that's movement with Pike on your back. So, that's your movement?
Travis: Yep. And I'll use my bonus action to go into a rage.
Matt: All right. (growling)
Travis: Hey Pike, gimme a slap!
Ashley: (slap)
Travis: (growls)
Matt: Sends you into the rage. You still have your action. Anything you want to do?
Travis: Nope.
Matt: Are you holding your action for any particular thing?
Travis: Well, I can't really hit him from here.
Matt: All right. That ends Grog's turn. Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: I can't see him, right?
Matt: Not from what you can tell, no.
Sam: Balls. I can see Vex, right? And Shale? Oh, shit. I can't do much without seeing him. Oh, here's what I will do: I'll start by inspiring Shale. I will just step out and sing, (singing) And I will always buff you! And then I will pick a place and cast Stinking Cloud.
Matt: Okay. You take your d10 inspiration die.
Chris perkins: Excellent.
Matt: And Stinking Cloud. Haven't seen that in a while.
Sam: No! Oh well, it's too late, I already said it.
Matt: Stinking Cloud. Where are you setting it?
Sam: Can I have a pointer? Well, I'll just come over. Right here.
Matt: Right there? All right. We'll put this over here to keep track of the Stinking Cloud, we'll just know the insects are in this vicinity as most people have passed beyond it. With that, Umbrasyl is going to attempt a constitution saving throw. Three plus 14, that's a 17. What's the DC?
Sam: 20.
Matt: All right. That will technically be at the start of its turn, but we will carry that over. All right. The cloud appears in this space. You can already hear (coughing). Are you going to move or stay where you are?
Sam: There's no more cloud of insects, yeah?
Matt: It's still in this vicinity.
Sam: Is there any way to avoid it? Move up to where Kiki is or anything?
Matt: Yeah, if you want to make a strength check to climb.
Sam: All right, I'll do that. I'll move up to where Kiki is. 17.
Matt: 17. Yeah, you actually hopscotch up, leap over Percy and get up on top next to her over there.
Sam: Oh, Percy! Didn't notice your bald spot there.
Taliesin: It just grows in lighter.
Sam: Sure.
Matt: All right. That ends your turn, Scanlan. With that, it's going to use its third legendary action this turn to attempt a tail attack against you, Vex.
Laura: Thank you.
Matt: You're welcome.
Liam: That's Vix.
Matt: I will stab you. That is a 19 to hit.
Laura: Nope. 20.
Matt: 20! With that, you dodge out of the way. You feel the impact of some large, heavy slam onto the stone right next to you. Pieces of it break off, and then withdraws, barely dodging it in time. All right, that ends--
Ashley: Since he made an attack, can I?
Matt: Yes, you can.
Ashley: I would like to Command him to be visible. Reveal himself.
Matt: What's the word?
Ashley: Reveal! Appear!
Matt: Appear. There you go! Oh, that's cocked. All right. That is a19 plus 11. I'm pretty sure it makes the save.
Ashley: Fuck you!
Matt: Sorry.
Ashley: Do I still get a bonus action?
Matt: That would've been during your turn. You can only hold your action.
Ashley: (snarls frustratedly)
Matt: Good try. Brings us to the top. Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: Oh god! Okay, I'm going to take a second to try and pray that my second gun doesn't break because that's going to get really ugly! And it doesn't! My gun is fine.
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: My gun is fine. But that's it. I'm going to start running straight down, as far as my legs will take me. Not that way, towards the pool.
Matt: Towards the pool?
Taliesin: Right there. Oh no, that's the insects, that's right. So, yeah.
Marisha: As long as you get out of it.
Taliesin: I'm going to roll around to the stone to the right, then. As far as I can go.
Matt: You can get there. You're outside of the insect cloud, not a worry. As you're running, you're cleaning it, polishing, loading it. Okay, looks good.
Taliesin: Oh, yes. I'm going to spend my bonus action to do a quick heal.
Matt: Okay, your Second Wind?
Taliesin: My Second Wind.
Matt: Go for it.
Taliesin: Oh, god. That was awful. That's okay. So, yeah. Good. You can move on, sorry.
Matt: Okay. Vex.
Laura: Do I have any kind of sense of-- Ugh, your Stinking Cloud is right there.
Matt: Yeah. You do see some elements of the cloud are displaced in places. It's not showing you exactly where it is, but you are aware that the entity of Umbrasyl is directly in front of Shale, and nearly directly in front of you.
Marisha: Enough to negate the disadvantage?
Matt: No. Not to mention the fact that you are technically in its melee range. So any of your ranged attacks--
Laura: Are at disadvantage again, right?
Matt: Unless it's five foot. Is it five foot, or is it melee? Trying to remember. I think it's five feet. But regardless, it's close to you, it's bad news.
Laura: If Trinket gets up, does that use any of my stuff? Trinket can move freely--
Matt: Trinket can move independently of you.
Laura: So Trinket is going to get up.
Matt: It's half-movement, yeah.
Laura: And he's going to bite Umbrasyl's tail to try to distract him, so I can run between his legs.
Matt: Okay. So Trinket's going to go ahead and-- roll a perception check for Trinket.
Liam: Trinket, snack attack!
Laura: Oh, he's got a keen sense of smell, so he's got advantage on smell perception.
Matt: But there is a Stinking Cloud right there. Roll again. We'll see if Trinket can discern between--
Laura: Well, I rolled a 15. And I don't know what I add to it.
Matt: That would be Trinket's wisdom--
Laura: --oh, perception, seven. So 22
Matt: 22. Okay. Trinket (bear sniffs and growl) runs past here, but can only make 20 feet of its movement because he used the rest to get out of prone. However, strafes aside and begins reaching out and starts snapping, so you want to give Trinket--?
Laura: He's going to attack him.
Matt: Okay. As part of your attack action? Is that what you're doing?
Laura: Yeah, I'm going to have Trinket do one of his attacks so I can move and run.
Matt: As your bonus action on it? Okay, go for it. Have Trinket roll for an attack. With disadvantage because it is invisible.
Laura: That doesn't count? I feel like it still counts, though. It's only 15.
Matt: 15. Trinket slashes out in the air. With the obfuscation of the Stinking Cloud and the invisible dragon, Trinket's just getting mouthfuls of air.
Laura: What does Stinking Cloud do to me?
Marisha: Makes you sick.
Sam: Makes you sick.
Laura: Fuck. I try to run away. I try to run around and run past Umbrasyl.
Sam: You're not in the cloud.
Laura: But I would go through it if I tried to run between its legs. I'll just try to run along to the side.
Matt: On the broom, still?
Laura: Sure! Why the fuck not?! I'm on the broom. Does it matter?
Matt: I mean, that will give you a little more action, you just can't attack from the broom because you'll have disadvantage on your attacks since you haven't finished your set-up yet.
Laura: Jesus. I just want to run, on the broom, and use my bonus action. Is that as far as I can get?
Matt: As far as you can get on your regular feet.
Laura: On my broom, though?
Matt: There.
Laura: And can I use my bonus action to hide? Can I try to hide?
Matt: You are completely out in the open. You have no way of hiding right now. You be can like, "Hide! You don't see me!"
Liam: You can dash and get further away.
Laura: I'm going to dash and I'm going to get further away.
Liam: Rogue bonus action? Hide, dash, disengage.
Matt: Yes, you can.
Laura: Yeah! I'm going to hide behind those things.
Matt: There?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Okay, you can get there. However, as you rush by, Umbrasyl does get an attack of opportunity on you. He's going to make a bite as you rush by. That is going to be a 30 to hit?
Laura: I think that hits.
Matt: All right.
Ashley: Isn't it at a disadvantage since he's in smoke?
Matt: Huh?
Laura: Because he's in farts?
Matt: No. That's not quite what it does. (laughter)
Matt: Oh, that's a d10. Sorry. You take 25 points of piercing damage. Plus an additional eight points of acid damage from the inside of its mouth.
Laura: Cool. Tight, tight.
Matt: A total of 33 points of damage as you rush past. All right, that ends your turn, Vex?
Laura: Oh, that it does.
Matt: All right. The insect cloud fades away, insects just dying off and dropping to the ground in piles of currently twitching insects. However, the acid pools suddenly begin to rumble and expand and reach out.
Laura: I'm glad I hid by another acid pool.
Matt: Any creature within 20 feet of the pool has to make a strength saving throw. So that will be Shale, Grog, Pike and Vex.
Laura: Yay.
Chris perkins: Five!
Sam: You have inspiration, if you want to use it.
Ashley: What are we rolling for?
Laura: A strength or a dex saving throw?
Matt: Strength.
Travis: 23.
Matt: 23, good to know. Pike?
Ashley: 21.
Matt: All right.
Laura: 13.
Matt: 13. And? Five. All right, so you guys both manage to, as the pool swishes out and comes up to your knees, Grog, and you just pull back and lean against the wall. As the pool subsides back, no immediate effect. Just barely manages to catch you. However, both Shale and Vax are pulled 20 feet into the pool--
Laura: Vex.
Matt: I'm sorry. Vex. I keep saying it now. Over and over again. Pulled into the actual acid pool.
Laura: It's like adding insult to injury. You're going to die and I'm going to call you your brother the entire time.
Matt: Yep. I'm sorry about that. You both are knocked prone and pulled into the water. Because it is an acid pit, you both also suffer 12 points of acid damage. Both Shale and Vex.
Marisha: That's a thing that can happen. All right.
Matt: All right. Now Umbrasyl, who failed the saving throw--
Sam: Gets to spend his entire turn coughing.
Matt: I can't believe Stinking Cloud worked.
Sam: Spends his entire turn.
Matt: The creature spends its action retching and reeling.
Liam: I hope he coughs his innards out the hole in his gut. Dragon hernia.
Matt: Yep. So the action is spent, the dragon is just (coughing), which is good because it rolled a five and got its breath weapon back. But it can't use it this turn because it's coughing and "You-- I will-- " It rears back, about to spit the acid before (coughs) and bits of it come streaming out of the nose, like the milk-in-the-nostrils thing except for it's acid. That's the dragon. Okay. That ends its action. It is going to move out, see if it's-- I forgot to roll concentration for the Invisibility on the last attack that happened. I just rolled a one. With that, it appears once again on the map. The Invisibility spell no longer there.
Marisha: Oh, thank god!
Laura: Now we can watch it kill us.
Matt: It's going to stomp over, out of the cloud, right there.
Sam: Does Trinket get an attack?
Matt: He does, actually. Go ahead and roll for Trinket.
Laura: Yeah, he does! I don't know which one to roll here. They've all been betraying me. 17.
Matt: 17? That misses. Or it hits and Trinket's claws streak across the back of the dragon's hide. No damage sustained. But good job, Trinket. All right, so--
Laura: He's trying, man. He's out. He's so brave.
Matt: He's doing great. Vax, you're up.
Liam: Okay. I'm going to dart out behind the pillar of stone there. And I'm going to chuck a dagger at it.
Matt: All right. What's the far range on it?
Liam: 60. I'm a Sharpshooter, so there's no disadvantage.
Matt: He's out of range.
Liam: Then I'll move closer. I mean, I know how far I can throw a dagger, so I want to get up close enough to be within range to throw a dagger.
Matt: Still can't get close enough, not with your full movement. You can move 30 feet.
Liam: Where are you? You're in the acid?
Laura: I am in the acid.
Liam: Oh! I'm going to go to my sister, I'm going to drag her out and I'm going to pop the one healing potion I have down her gullet.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: I'm going to pull her behind, so we're both behind that pillar.
Matt: Okay, so you pull her behind the pillar. You go ahead and feed her the healing potion. That is your turn. He dragged you out of the acid pool.
Liam: Potion of greater healing.
Matt: All right, so that is a 4d4 plus four healing to you. That ends Vax's turn. Shale, you're up.
Chris perkins: All right. I'm going to stand up if I can and make my way back onto firm rock. Do I take any damage when I start my turn?
Matt: You do, actually. You take six points of acid damage. You've now stepped up right there. The dragon is fully visible to you.
Chris perkins: Pick on someone your own size! And I whack him on the derriere with my staff.
Matt: Go for it. You have three attacks, correct?
Chris perkins: The first one is a very sad 14. I'm not going to waste the d10 on that.
Matt: Across the hide, no damage.
Chris perkins: Oh my god!
Marisha: No, Chris, no.
Sam: Inspiration?
Chris perkins: Natural one.
Matt: As a level 13 fighter, don't you get a third attack with your action?
Chris perkins: What's that? Oh, yes, you're right. That one, I rolled a 19. I will spend the inspiration die and turn it into a 26.
Matt: Okay. Roll damage with the quarterstaff.
Chris perkins: I do 11 points of whacky-whacky damage and try to bait this thing into turning on me.
Matt: Okay.
Chris perkins: I will also use my second wind.
Matt: All right. Go for it.
Chris perkins: To regain 15 hit points.
Matt: 15 hit points to you, go for it. Ending Shale's turn, that brings us to Pike. But at the end of Shale's turn, the dragon is going to use a legendary action to attempt a tail attack against you, Scanlan, as you are the source of the Stinking Cloud that caused it to cough. It goes, (growls) "Foolish bard, get back into my stomach!" And as it whips around, its tail comes streaking overhead and it rolls a natural one! (cheering)
Matt: As it spins around, that's when your staff actually hits the back of its hide. As it does, it gooses it a little, in a sensitive place, and the tail arcs strangely and slams into the stone, next to you, missing you by about six inches.
Sam: Ah! Great. I'll take it.
Matt: Pike, it's your turn.
Ashley: All right. (sing-song) I'm going to Guiding Bolt him right up the butt! (laughter)
Matt: You're in the position for it.
Ashley: Yep!
Matt: What level are you casting Guiding Bolt?
Ashley: Third.
Matt: Third level on Guiding Bolt. All right. That will put it at 6d6. So go ahead and roll a spell attack.
Ashley: Natural 20.
Matt: Go ahead and roll 6d6 and we'll double it.
Ashley: And double it?
Matt: It's a critical hit.
Ashley: I've never done that before!
Chris perkins: Right up the butt!
Marisha: Monstah! Kill him!
Liam: Kan-cho!
Taliesin: Kan-cho!
Marisha: Kan-cho!
Ashley: Oh my god, 24! One more! So, 50 points.
Matt: 50 points of radiant damage right up Umbrasyl's posterior. Suddenly as Pike, still clutching onto the back of Grog, you reach and grab the symbol of Sarenrae, leaving your sword to the side of your sheath, hold it forward. And as you do, you concentrate, a glowing beam of radiant energy shoots forward just as Shale knocks the backside of Umbrasyl. The tail streaks overhead to hit Scanlan, leaves you a nice, direct shot right at the dragon rump. There's a dull (impact) sound, and Umbrasyl sits straight up for a second (confused noise, explosion) as there's a burst of divine, explosive energy right in the posterior (painful growl). Looking back, there's now a shiny glow, pulsing from the back of Umbrasyl's body. And the next attack has advantage against Umbrasyl.
Ashley: Still alive!
Matt: That's your action. You still have your movement and bonus, if you want.
Ashley: Okay. I think I'm going to stay, and then bonus action, I'm going to throw up a Spiritual Weapon.
Matt: Okay. Where do you want your Spiritual Weapon to go? What level is Spiritual Weapon, Second level? Yep.
Ashley: Yeah. A really large meathook.
Matt: All right. Where are you setting it?
Ashley: Right at his back.
Matt: All right. Sitting right there at the tail of Umbrasyl, this giant, glowing, radiant meathook appears and makes its strike. Go ahead and make your spell attack against Umbrasyl.
Ashley: 27.
Matt: All right. That hits. Go ahead and roll damage. It's a 1d8 plus five.
Ashley: Ten.
Matt: Nice, all right. Going to stay where you are? Or you going to move?
Ashley: I'm going to stay with my Grog.
Matt: So you're still piggybacking on Grog. Got it. Okay, that ends Pike's turn. Keyleth, you're up. Actually, at the end of Pike's turn--
Ashley: You know what, I'm sorry, I'm going to get off his back.
Matt: Okay. You're staying where you are, though?
Ashley: Yeah.
Matt: Okay, so you'll be there. At the end of your turn, Umbrasyl's going to use another legendary action to make a second tail attack at Scanlan again, frustrated by this whole circumstance.
Sam: I'm sure he is.
Matt: That's a 20.
Sam: Can I use Cutting Words?
Matt: You may, if you want to.
Sam: All right.
Matt: It's a natural 20.
Sam: Oh?!
Matt: You could reduce the damage though, with your Cutting Words.
Sam: All right, I'll do that.
Matt: Probably for the best. For that, you suffer 28 points of bludgeoning damage. As the tail swoops down, finding its mark, slamming into you, sending you against the wall of the stonework, and you stumble forward back into place, feeling already the impact of the bludgeoning wound.
Sam: That's a four, so.
Matt: So you reduce that to 24.
Taliesin: That halved? No, that's not halved. Sorry-- brain!
Matt: So 24 points of bludgeoning damage from the attack. However, Umbrasyl's next saving throw is at a disadvantage because of Mythcarver. Now, Keyleth, what are you doing?
Marisha: Okay. Faerie Fire (poof) right in front of me. Right on top of him. It gives everybody advantage on attacks against him.
Matt: Yes, it does.
Laura: That's great.
Marisha: I hope he's got enough hit points to make it worth it.
Matt: With disadvantage on the saving throw.
Marisha: Yeah, take it, bitch! Glitter bomb! It's like a Kesha music video.
Matt: So that's a four plus nine because of the disadvantage. I rolled a ten and a four. That will bring it to 13. It does not succeed. You watch as a second burst of purplish energy surrounds Umbrasyl, radiating a glow.
Chris perkins: Who's the prettiest dragon?
Marisha: You're so pretty!
Matt: Gilmore would love this right now. "Fancy dragon! Now we're talking!" You went from being not able to see the dragon to very much being able to see the dragon. All right.
Marisha: I'm going to use my bonus action to turn into a water elemental.
Matt: Okay! Look at you being a druid and shit.
Marisha: Yeah. That's how I roll.
Travis: Get it, girl! Get it, get it, girl!
Marisha: Get it, girl! Get it, get it, girl!
Matt: Water elemental Keyleth. Are you going to stay there?
Marisha: Can I move?
Matt: If you'd like to.
Marisha: Am I in his range of attack?
Matt: You gather, yes. Pretty big range.
Marisha: Honestly, Umbrasyl is so fucking big, I can't see what's going on in front of me.
Matt: You're right there.
Marisha: Is Scanlan in front of me?
Matt: Scanlan is right next to you, to the right.
Marisha: Can I step in the front and shield Scanlan?
Matt: Unfortunately, the cliff ends right there. So you couldn't get in front of Scanlan without dropping onto a lower platform.
Marisha: What about anybody else?
Matt: Percy is down there. You could fill some of Umbrasyl's space but you're not going to be able to guard anybody from an attack, unfortunately. Especially being an entity made of water, not a whole lot of defensive strategy in there.
Marisha: Okay. I'm next to Shale as well, right? We're all in the shit together?
Matt: Shale's over here.
Marisha: Oh, Shale's over there.
Matt: Flanking from the side.
Marisha: You know what, I'm just going to stay there!
Matt: All right. Grog, you're up.
Travis: I would like to run along the side of the pool, and up on his left side, closest to the entrance of the cave. Right there would be delicious.
Matt: There you go.
Travis: I would like to go into a frenzied rage. A regular strike on the first.
Matt: You already have advantage on all the attacks because of Faerie Fire. So you don't need--
Travis: Yeah, not reckless. Not great weapon.
Matt: Yeah. Go for it.
Taliesin: Is that a 20?
Ashley: Oh, oh! That would be a natural 20!
Sam: Oh! That's not going to be good for him.
Matt: Barbarian crits, man.
Travis: I keep rolling, yeah?
Matt: Well, do the damage for the critical, yeah.
Taliesin: This and the next round are going to be really ugly.
Marisha: Kill it. Fucking kill it!
Travis: 24.
Matt: 24. Okay.
Travis: Is the roll and then, what? Double it or add another--?
Matt: The dice roll is? Well, you roll 1d12. What was that, the first d12 you rolled?
Travis: That was a 15. Oh, the dice roll? 12.
Matt: 12. So make a-- it was a 12?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: Oh, shit! Okay, that's a 24. And then you add your modifier. And then roll two more d12s. So, that's 24 plus, is that seven?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: Plus the two for the axe. Oh my god! That'll be at 33. Plus the necrotic-- oh, fuck! And that's doubled too.
Travis: So that's an 11 for the second d12.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Should we write these numbers down?
Matt: Yeah, we have to now. So it's 24 plus two for the axe, plus seven for the strength.
Travis: Plus five for the necrotic--
Matt: Hold on, getting there. We're getting there. It's getting math crunchy here, guys. So 24 plus nine, so that's 33, plus-- the necrotic?
Travis: Five.
Matt: Times two, which is ten. That's 43, plus the two other d12s, which is an 11. So that's 54. Plus your last d12.
Travis: It's a ten.
Matt: You did 64 points of damage with this one critical hit.
Ashley: He's a monstah!
Travis: Monstah!
Marisha: Monstah!
Laura: Monstah!
Matt: All right. So that's your first attack.
Travis: Yeah.
Chris perkins: Dragon's like, hello!
Marisha: Disco dragon!
Travis: 20.
Matt: 20. The first strike swings wide and slams deep into an already open wound left by a rogue earlier in the sky. This time, the axe sinks deep into its body, and Umbrasyl roars out in immense pain. You see spittle and blood both being jettisoned from its mouth under the sheer pain that it's feeling. You take the axe, and you push even deeper, and push even deeper and withdraw. As you do, the blade is entirely covered in deep purplish-black dragon blood. You swing for a second strike. This time it puts its claw out and catches the axe in the middle of the air. You manage to wrench it free from its grasp, but it turns its head toward you, angrily.
Ashley: Can I use War God's Blessing again?
Matt: That is Channel Divinity? I'll go ahead and double-check here real fast.
Marisha: We also have Heroes' Feast up, by the way, if that makes any amount of difference.
Matt: It won't do anything. It helped you with the temporary hit points, it helped you with--
Sam: Fear?
Marisha: Fear?
Liam: Fear?
Matt: It helped you with the fear-resistance to begin with. That was a big one. Channel Divinity, War God's Blessing and you can Channel Divinity twice. So you can do it a second time, you can. Wait, didn't you use it-- between rests, yeah. You could do it a second time if you want to.
Ashley: Yeah!
Matt: All right. So with that, with a plus ten brings it to 30. So, as Umbrasyl grabs the axe, stopping it in mid-air, you just grin, reach forward with the axe, and push it into its actual claw. Go ahead and roll damage.
Travis: You nasty, boy! 27.
Matt: 27 points of damage. All right. And do you want to use your bonus action?
Travis: I do.
Matt: Yes, you do.
Travis: Let's do it great weapon master, just for kicks.
Matt: All right.
Travis: 26 minus five is 21.
Matt: 21. As you push the blade into Umbrasyl's hand, (angry snarl) it rears back its head and snaps toward you. You duck out of the way, pull the blade back and go for a third strike. This time however, it actually rears its torso up, putting its claws in the air, and you (slicing) find air right beneath it. Does not strike true.
Travis: Cool. Good beans.
Matt: Yeah. That finishes Grog's turn. At the end of Grog's turn, it's going to use its third legendary action to go ahead and make a-- Actually, no, its going to hold onto that legendary action. All right, that brings us to Scanlan.
Sam: Jesus, it's not dead yet?
Matt: Scanlan, because you took the tail attack earlier, I'll have you roll a concentration check for Stinking Cloud. You have advantage on it though, so add your constitution bonus.
Sam: 20.
Matt: Yeah, you're fine.
Sam: Great. I've got my Stinking Cloud, still. I would like to move the Stinking Cloud. Oh! No, I can't do that.
Matt: You can.
Sam: You can move a Stinking Cloud?
Matt: I think it moves from a short breeze, actually.
Sam: Eh, it's fine.
Matt: Older versions, I think you could.
Sam: I don't want the Stinking Cloud to move. All right, he's right on us, he's got a legendary action. This is not good. Okay, I will reintroduce him to Bigby's Hand, (singing) Bigby's Hand! And I'm going to use it as an-- Ugh, so weak! Interposing Hand.
Matt: Bigby's Interposing Hand, all righty.
Laura: What is that?
Sam: It will block him. It's a talk-to-the-hand move.
Matt: The idea is, you can use your bonus action to set it each turn to what you want it to do. So right now, you're having it as an Interposing Hand. So, yeah. It prevents it from moving--
Sam: Wait, just moving? It can still attack?
Matt: The Interposing Hand interposes between you and a creature you choose until you give it a different command. It stays between the two of you, providing you half-cover against the target. So it helps from ranged attacks.
Sam: Oh. But it won't block an attack. So in that case, I'll just attack with it.
Matt: Okay, so you're just going to go and Clenched Fist?
Sam: I'm going to try to finger it right in the hole that I came out of before.
Matt: Of course you are! Go ahead and make a melee spell attack.
Sam: He's the Bigby and the dike!
Matt: That would be over here
Sam: What do I roll? d20?
Matt: d20, add your spell attack modifier.
Sam: Oh! 27. Oh! With advantage? 27.
Matt: 27, that hits. Go ahead and roll 4d8 force damage, as Bigby angrily jams the magical finger back into the wound.
Ashley: Rage fingering?
Liam: This dragon is being violated in so many ways.
Sam: It's just ten. 4d8 plus what?
Matt: It's 4d8 force damage.
Sam: That's it, ten.
Matt: Ten points of force damage.
Sam: Yes.
Liam: Not like this!
Matt: All right, Scanlan, are you going to move or stay where you are?
Sam: If I move, he'll kill me, so I won't. Instead, I will-- where's Vax?
Matt: Vax is over here.
Sam: Way over there?!
Liam: Playing medic with my sister.
Laura: Hey!
Sam: Jesus. Who can I inspire? I guess I'll inspire good old Shale again. You don't need inspiration, you're fine! This is an old lady! I'll turn to Shale and say, I don't normally do this, but I find you so attractive! For an old lady!
Chris perkins: Focus on the dragon!
Sam: I can't! With your eyes-- eye? Eye so beautiful! So twinkling when it looks at me! I just want you to hold me in your arm tonight! (laughter)
Chris perkins: Have you ever had sex? (laughter)
Sam: No!
Taliesin: It was just hanging there!
Sam: Yes, I've had sex, Shale! I have a daughter.
Matt: He says this as a giant Bigby's Hand is just (impact sounds) at the side of a giant, black dragon. That brings us to the top of the initiative round. Percy, it's your turn. Oh my god.
Taliesin: Okay. How close am I to this dragon?
Matt: You are about ten feet from it right now.
Taliesin: I'm walking right the fuck up to it.
Matt: Okay, Percy. You walk right up to the dragon.
Taliesin: I'm pulling out the sword. And I'm going to fucking town, screaming like a little girl the entire time.
Marisha: Kill it! Advantage!
Taliesin: With advantage.
Marisha: All day! Advantage all day!
Laura: Kill that fucking dragon.
Taliesin: 26!
Matt: 26 hits.
Taliesin: All right, first damage. 23 points of damage.
Matt: 23 points of damage, all right.
Taliesin: For shot number one. Shot number two.
Marisha: Big money, no whammies. That's good!
Taliesin: Natural 20.
Marisha: Sorry, excitement.
Taliesin: Ten, 16, 16 times two is 32. 39, that's 39 points of damage. Number three! Oh, it gets worse. I'm going to die. Okay, I can do better than that. No, he can't. 22.
Matt: 22 just hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
Taliesin: That's 18 points of slashing damage.
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: Action surge, motherfucker!
Matt: Go for it.
Chris perkins: Going Ginsu on this dragon.
Matt: I know, seriously.
Taliesin: It is not an awesome hit, it's just a hit. I'm really excited. 18 points of damage.
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: Shot number two.
Sam: Oh my god.
Taliesin: That's a hit.
Laura: Natural 20?
Taliesin: Natural 20. This is to make up for all these fucking ones.
Laura: Why doesn't Percy just always attack melee?
Marisha: He's bad at it most of the time.
Taliesin: 47 points of damage. Final attack.
Sam: Wait, what?
Liam: How is this possible?
Marisha: Because he's a fighter, he gets three attacks per round.
Taliesin: Plus an action surge for a second attack set of three. So I'm basically going-- Yeah.
Marisha: It's like a John Wu film.
Taliesin: It's just a fucking John Wu attack. Oh my god, it hit. Just barely, because it was a one, otherwise. And that final hit is-- oh, that's good. 27 points of damage, and I'm done.
Matt: As you unload on Umbrasyl, the pent-up anger and frustration, you start slashing over and over again. You guys watch as the blade shines in the air in the presence of its naturally designed enemy. You see at the corners of his outfit little tufts of dark smoke beginning to appear. The scar of Orthax still shows when the fury builds within Percy. As each blow strikes, cutting away hunks and bits of dragon flesh and scale, Umbrasyl is heavily wounded and looking desperate. That ends your turn, I believe?
Laura: Oh my god, he's still alive?
Matt: You guys gave it time to rest.
Taliesin: Fuck it, bonus action, I'm putting on the mask and standing my ground. Fuck it.
Matt: Amazing what a dragon can do in two hours.
Taliesin: Yeah, I'm done.
Matt: All right. Vex.
Laura: Hi. Okay. I'm going to--
Matt: Actually, at the end of Percy's turn, he's going to use his third legendary action, knowing the source of the Faerie Fire and extremely frustrated by the fact that it has lent to a very difficult round, it turns towards the now water elemental quivering before it, and the tail comes down to smash towards your liquid form.
Marisha: (burbling)
Matt: Speaking of natural 20s.
Taliesin: It's okay.
Marisha: Come on, bitch. Come on.
Taliesin: You're fine.
Marisha: Totally fine. I'm an elemental for a reason.
Taliesin: You are totally fucking fine.
Matt: 32 points of bludgeoning damage.
Marisha: Halved.
Matt: Halved, because of your elemental. Does water elemental have resistance to damage?
Marisha: Yeah, it has damage resistance against acid, bludgeoning, piercing, slashing from non-magical weapons.
Matt: All right, so half that. So 32 made to 16. 16 points of bludgeoning damage. I need you to go ahead and roll a concentration check.
Marisha: What did you say?
Matt: Roll a concentration check. So roll a d20 and add your constitution modifier.
Taliesin: Even if it goes, it was worth it.
Marisha: Not bad, not bad. Hang on, sorry. Just my straight modifier, it's not a save? Okay, 18!
Matt: You maintain concentration. You needed to beat the 16.
Marisha: Whoa, daddy. All right.
Matt: Well, half the damage. No, it would've been ten, actually, because it's half the damage you receive.
Marisha: Half the damage I receive, so yeah, I'm good. I'm golden.
Matt: All right, cool. So Vex, what are you doing?
Laura: Oh, jeez. Who all is within five feet of it? Is everybody within five feet of it?
Matt: A lot of them are. Pretty much the whole party aside from Pike, you, and your brother.
Laura: Then I'm just going to attack it twice.
Taliesin: With advantage.
Sam: Oi, Matt. My Bigby's is concentration, so that cloud's gone, by the way.
Matt: Correct, thank you.
Laura: 19 plus 12 hits.
Sam: Did you shoot it in the back?
Matt: Yes, it does. Go ahead and roll damage.
Laura: Can I Hunter's Mark him?
Matt: As a bonus action?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: All right. Good memory on that one.
Laura: 19 on the first hit.
Matt: 19 damage? All right.
Laura: Then the second one hits as well, 17 plus 12.
Matt: Yep. Go ahead and roll damage for the second hit.
Laura: 23.
Matt: 23. All right. So, ending your turn, comes to the top of the round. Umbrasyl, now gripping into the stone, "I will not fall!" Suddenly, darkness begins to sweep into the area. In this area, a 15-foot radius all completely around Umbrasyl, all of you in this area, your vision goes dark.
Liam: Cancels out Faerie Fire and the golden butt?
Matt: Cancels out Faerie Fire. This is magical darkness.
Sam: It's not a spell, right?
Liam: For those of us on the outside, do we see a bubble of darkness where Key and the others--
Sam: A spell, Matt?
Matt: No, this is an effect of the lair. Actually, Faerie Fire would still affect it if you attacked it, per se, but it doesn't reveal its location currently within the darkness. However, it is technically larger than the darkness. Regardless, all of you guys that are in there, it would negate the advantage you would have from Faerie Fire. It would just be a central attack.
Marisha: So it wouldn't give us disadvantage, it would just be straight rolls?
Matt: A little bit of it's piercing through, because it is magic on magic. However, the rest of you see most of the party disappear into a giant sphere of magical darkness that fills the space.
Laura: So we on the outside, we can't use Faerie Fire? It's just a bubble of dark? Or do we see Umbrasyl peeking out?
Liam: He said he's bigger than the dark, so we see his head coming out.
Matt: You see the wings poking out the sides of it. You still see where he would be. Okay, so with that, Umbrasyl is going to go ahead and take a risk. He's going to lift his wings and head upward to move into an advantageous position.
Sam: No, it's not!
Marisha: Come on. Come on, Scanlan.
Sam: I'm going to say, you leave when Burt Reynolds says you can fucking leave! And I will Bigby's Hand, and I will bring him back down, because I get a spell on his retreat.
Taliesin: I love watching him look at the phone.
Marisha: Consult the helix.
Matt: Unfortunately, you have to be grasping it or grappling it to attempt to--
Sam: No, I get a full spell action. It's my lore feature. I get to cast a brand new fucking spell when he lifts off.
Matt: Which one?
Sam: College of Lore. If he retreats, I get to cast a spell. This is the exact same thing that happened last time.
Matt: Trying to remember how this works. College of Lore. I don't know if it is. Because what you do is you grapple--
Sam: Oh, no, it's a War Caster feature.
Matt: Oh, War Caster! Thank you, that clarifies it. I was like, I don't see this in the College of Lore! You're confusing me! So as a War Caster, when a hostile creature's movement provokes an opportunity attack from you, you can use your reaction to cast a spell at the creature rather than making an opportunity attack. So yeah, if you wanted to go ahead and attempt to grapple--
Sam: I will grapple him and pull him back down.
Matt: You can totally attempt that. Bigby, go ahead and make a strength athletics check to beat a dragon's strength. Bigby is just slightly under the strength of the dragon, so let's see. It's a roll-off.
Sam: It's a roll-off! Oh my god. This is a critical roll. That's a two.
Matt: It was a 19 on my end. Natural 19. As Bigby's Hand reaches forward, the angry, wounded, frustrated, furious Umbrasyl just kicks the hand away, pulling up.
Taliesin: Do we get an attack of opportunity?
Matt: Attack of opportunity from you, you, you, and you.
Marisha: Down, bitch, down!
Ashley: And the Spiritual Weapon, right? And the Spiritual Weapon?
Matt: No, it does not get attacks of opportunity.
Marisha: Without advantage, even though he's retreating?
Matt: Without advantage, because of the magical darkness that has surrounded you guys.
Marisha: Even though he's retreating in Faerie Fire? That doesn't double it?
Matt: The darkness would give you disadvantage, the Faerie Fire negates that. I'm letting you do this.
Marisha: Okay. Letting you do this! Be thankful of what you have! 22 exactly.
Matt: That hits.
Taliesin: 20.
Chris perkins: My staff bounces right off.
Matt: Okay. Grog?
Travis: 23.
Matt: All right, so Grog and Keyleth both get a hit in. Go ahead and roll damage.
Marisha: Shit. Balls. Low. Shit. Eight damage from the elemental.
Travis: 20.
Matt: 20, all right.
Travis: 25. Plus the necrotic.
Matt: Good to know.
Marisha: And we decided I don't get my fire hands when I'm a water elemental?
Matt: Because that's bullshit.
Marisha: Yeah, all right.
Taliesin: That would just be steam.
Matt: So as you swing out, you arc, and the axe strikes across the back of Umbrasyl's hide. You slam with your water elemental form. The flight is staggered, and barely lands on his feet. Umbrasyl, "I will take you all down!" Unleashes.
Marisha: Here it comes.
Matt: I need a dexterity saving throw from Shale, Percy, Keyleth, and Scanlan.
Laura: Oh, it's that whole table!
Sam: Seven!
Chris perkins: 24.
Marisha: 12.
Taliesin: 18.
Matt: All right. Shale actually succeeded on that one. DC 23.
Marisha: DC 23!
Matt: So you take half damage on that one. That's going to be, doing the dice rolls here. So that's 62 points of acid damage down to 31 to Shale, and 31 to you because you're resistant. So 62 points of acid damage to both of you guys.
Sam: My armor, does that do anything?
Matt: Your armor takes it by half, so you would take 31.
Taliesin: 62? Okay.
Chris perkins: Cursed lizard, we're going to give all your treasure to the poor!
Matt: And with that, it takes the rest of its action to move further back at its 80 foot flight, and it's going to end up right about there.
Sam: It's too big to fit in its own house.
Matt: I know! Leaving the Spiritual Weapon there. All right, that's going to end its turn. That now brings it to Vax.
Liam: The twins still have advantage because it's got the Faerie Fire on it, right? You said everyone in it?
Matt: Oh, you need to make a concentration check, by the way, from the damage you just took.
Marisha: Did he get out of the darkness?
Matt: He did.
Marisha: Ooh, ouch, not good at all. What am I making, just a constitution check?
Matt: Add your constitution modifier.
Marisha: I don't think it's going to be enough. Eight.
Matt: The Faerie Fire fades as the acid consumes you, no longer affected by it.
Marisha: Shit.
Matt: All right. Vax, it's your turn. To answer your question, no.
Liam: Nobody's near it anymore, right?
Matt: Nope.
Liam: Okay. I would like to scrabble up behind it, as close to its treasure pile as I can get.
Matt: Okay, that would be about there.
Liam: And I'm going to throw. Shit. No, cancel that. I'd like to run up its tail.
Matt: Okay. You go rushing, clambering onto the back of its tail. It swoops around and sees you doing so, but you're already quick and on it. What are you going to do?
Liam: I'm going to hold my action until somebody gets up on this motherfucker, and as soon as somebody gets close and catches his attention I'm going to stab into it.
Matt: Okay. Good to know. All right, that takes the end of Vax's turn. Shale, you're up.
Chris perkins: I stride up to the dragon and smack it on the nose.
Travis: Atta girl, Shale!
Matt: Speed of 20 feet, you said?
Chris perkins: Yeah.
Matt: You can't quite get to it, unfortunately. That's about as far as you can move this turn. You can dash if you want to, but even so, you still can't quite get to it.
Chris perkins: All right then. I will use all my action to get as close to it as I can.
Matt: Okay, there we go. All right! Ending Shale's turn. Pike, you're up.
Ashley: Okay. I didn't realize I was up so quickly. All right.
Chris perkins: Although, actually, I have action surge.
Matt: You do, actually.
Chris perkins: So I will then whack him on the nose.
Matt: That's true.
Marisha: Fuck yes.
Chris perkins: All right, so that's going to be--
Taliesin: I have 13 hit points.
Sam: 13? I thought that said 93.
Taliesin: I count up.
Chris perkins: 22.
Matt: 22, that just barely hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
Chris perkins: So I whack it for nine.
Matt: Nine points of damage, got it.
Liam: I'm above it. Do I get advantage for that?
Matt: Technically, because you are behind, you are flanking it, so as we'll use the flanking rules for this, you do have advantage on the attack.
Liam: Okay, so, good. 29.
Matt: 29 hits. Go ahead and roll damage with sneak attack.
Liam: 24.
Matt: 24, all righty.
Liam: And is the bonus action gone because of holding the action?
Matt: Correct, yeah, you just get the one action to hold.
Liam: Add one point to that. It was the keen dagger.
Matt: So as part of your action surge, you get two more attacks.
Liam: I didn't add the damage! Add eight to that. Not one, add eight to that. Sorry.
Sam: Add seven more. Then add three.
Chris perkins: Nope, and nope.
Sam: You have inspiration!
Chris perkins: I used it already.
Sam: Goddamn it!
Chris perkins: But thank you, it was very helpful.
Sam: You're useless!
Chris perkins: A fickle lover.
Matt: The one hit, it snorts in reaction to it. As it pulls back, you swing twice more, pretty sure the head was in the same place it was going to be, but unfortunately, meet air. Curse your sight!
Chris perkins: He had a bit of an itch on his back, that's what it was.
Matt: Caught the attention. All right, that brings us to Pike. What are you doing?
Ashley: I'm going to cast Prayer of Healing over to everybody over there. So, Keyleth, Percy, Scanlan, Shale.
Marisha: Awesome. I'm into this.
Chris perkins: I'm sort of right under the dragon. I'm actually quite far.
Ashley: Yeah, she's gone. Who's that down there? That's you, Percy, right?
Taliesin: Trinket.
Matt: What level is Prayer of Healing?
Ashley: I'm going to do it at fifth level. It's a second level, but I'm going to do it at fifth level.
Matt: Within 30 feet of you, so five, ten, 15, 20, 25, 30.
Sam: You can heal my hand.
Liam: You could also run closer and do it.
Ashley: Okay. Yeah, I'll run closer. And I'll run around, not into the pool of acid death.
Matt: That's as close as you can get right now.
Sam: Is that close?
Liam: It's close enough for Scanlan.
Matt: It's enough for Scanlan and Keyleth.
Sam: Don't do it.
Marisha: Percy needs it.
Ashley: Percy needs it?
Matt: Percy's not in range.
Ashley: Fuck. Can I go the other way around?
Sam: You can go through the acid.
Taliesin: No.
Travis: It was only 12 points of damage.
Ashley: I don't have a lot left. All right, then.
Taliesin: It's okay.
Liam: Do what you can.
Ashley: Okay. Fuck. Can I stay where I was at, then?
Matt: You can. Stay right there.
Ashley: Okay. Sorry, I'm going to not do that. I'm going to Guiding Bolt then.
Matt: Okay. You can just barely make out the position of where Umbrasyl is. You can go ahead and make the attack, but it's going to get cover bonus to the range.
Ashley: Can I peek out? Can I move out?
Matt: You can move here if you want to, and it'll help a little bit. It'll only give it a minor bonus. Go ahead and make your attack.
Ashley: What's that?
Matt: Go ahead and make your spell attack. Is this basic level Guiding Bolt?
Ashley: Basic level Guiding Bolt.
Matt: Okay.
Ashley: Nope. Doesn't hit.
Matt: You try and reach around and as it's moving its wings about, you manage to strike the stone just blocking half of its form. It splashes with energy and dissipates with no effect, unfortunately.
Ashley: All right. Can I tuck back in?
Matt: Yeah.
Ashley: And I'm going to move the Spiritual Weapon with my bonus attack, or can I not do that?
Matt: You can do that, yeah. 20 feet? To there.
Ashley: Okay. That's it. That's what I can do.
Matt: Is that as far as you can move it? Spiritual Weapon can move, I believe it's 20 feet. Yeah, that's as far as you can get it.
Ashley: No, 60 feet!
Matt: The range of the spell is 60 feet, but as a bonus action, you can move it 20 feet and repeat the attack.
Ashley: Oh.
Matt: Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: I'm up? No shit. Wow. Okay. It's really far away though now, yeah?
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: Way more than 30 feet, right?
Matt: Yep.
Marisha: What is he? How far away is he from me?
Matt: You're not sure.
Liam: He's about 40 or 50 feet or something.
Marisha: Yeah. You're holding your action for someone to get up close.
Laura: He already did it.
Marisha: Oh, you already did it. Yeah, I guess I'm going to dash and see if I can get to him.
Matt: Okay, what's your movement as a water elemental?
Marisha: 30 feet.
Matt: 30 feet. 60, you're so close. Fucking dragon wings. There you go, you're so close. We'll say you're there, that's fine. That ends your turn, Keyleth?
Marisha: I guess so.
Matt: All right. Grog, you're up.
Travis: I would like to stride over to Bigby's Hand, and can I take out a level-- It's not level two, what do you call it? Not superior, but the middle one.
Sam: Moderate?
Travis: Can I take a moderate healing potion?
Matt: There's healing and then greater healing, so I imagine it would probably be greater healing.
Travis: Can I take the greater healing potion and chuck it to Percy?
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: Just a toss while standing at Bigby's Hand?
Matt: Sure. Go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw to catch the tossed potion at that distance.
Taliesin: Natural 20.
Matt: You don't even look.
Travis: And I will hold my attack.
Matt: You can keep moving if you want.
Travis: I want to stay right by Bigby's Hand. I'll hold my attack until Bigby's Hand twitches.
Matt: All right. Finishing Grog's turn, Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: I will inspire Grog with a little ditty that I like to call, Who Let the Grogs Out?
All: Who? Who who who who?
Sam: Who let the Grogs out?
All: Who? Who who who who?
Matt: I'm conflicted in giving that inspiration. Take it, it's fine.
Sam: I can try a different one, if you'd like.
Matt: No, it's perfect.
Sam: And I will pick him up, with his blessing.
Travis: Please.
Sam: And throw him at the dragon.
Matt: Throw?
Sam: Or, you know, send him.
Matt: Okay, so Bigby's Hand will move with you 60 feet.
Sam: You want to go up to his head?
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: All right, yeah. He's going up top.
Matt: Okay. We'll go ahead and use some of the platforms today.
Laura: Yeah! Cut his horns off!
Liam: Don't land on me.
Ashley: Kill him!
Laura: Cut his wings off!
Ashley: Tear his head off!
Laura: Jump off those head things!
Taliesin: We have done a lot of damage to this thing.
Matt: Problem with leaving it to heal, man.
Sam: He's only got 400 hit points left.
Laura: He's looking rough.
Matt: Should be more like there, we'll say.
Sam: Release the hounds.
Travis: Can I make two reckless attacks?
Matt: You may.
Laura: Reckless?
Travis: Yes, reckless. I'll use the inspiration die. That's a ten, so that's a 29.
Matt: 29 hits.
Sam: Yeah! That helped.
Travis: 23.
Laura: Plus necrotic.
Travis: 26.
Matt: 26, got it. All right, second attack.
Travis: 24.
Matt: Both hit. Go ahead and roll damage.
Travis: 24.
Laura: Plus necrotic.
Travis: Thank you. 29. I'm not used to that.
Matt: All right. As Bigby's Hand lifts you up, you reach out and swing with the axe, one hit, a second hit, both streaking across the face, the second one actually cutting through one of the eyes. The eye bursts against the blade of bloodaxe, and you can see now the fluids and material that once were contained within are now spilling down the side of Umbrasyl's face.
Travis: Ain't you pretty?
Matt: All right, Scanlan.
Sam: What, me?
Matt: That was your bonus action.
Sam: Oh! Well, okay. I didn't know that. I will try something else then. I will send-- shit. I will send my Lightning Bolt. Can I see any part of him that's not inhabited by one of my allies?
Matt: I'd say there's an arc you could probably hit, yeah.
Sam: Right in the heart?
Matt: Sure. The heart region of the dragon.
Sam: I'm going to shoot him right through the heart with lightning.
Matt: All right. That is a dexterity 21 save, so I'm pretty sure it's halved.
Sam: Yeah, that saves.
Matt: Go ahead and roll 8d6, half damage.
Liam: Shot through the heart!
Sam: I don't know that song, I don't know what that is. I don't know that song. 24, so just 12.
Matt: 12 points of lightning damage. All right. The bolt of lightning bursts through the body. All righty. That comes to the top of the round. At the end of Scanlan's turn, it's going to use a legendary action to strike down, with the tail, onto Vax behind, as you are already in that vicinity.
Liam: Dex save?
Matt: No, this is instead going to be a 26 to hit.
Liam: Yeah, that-- oh, displacer cloak. Did you do that at disadvantage?
Matt: That is instead a 24 to hit.
Liam: That does hit. I'll use Uncanny Dodge, though.
Matt: All right. So what would be 18 damage, you take nine instead from the tail. Percy.
Taliesin: I'm going to take three shots from where I'm at. First, I'm going to use my bonus action to chug down that potion I just got. What's the superior worth?
Sam: Greater.
Matt: It's a greater, yes. 4d4 plus four.
Taliesin: 4d4 plus four. Where are my d4s at? I'll just do this four times. 13 points up, so that's a little bit better. All right, I'm going to take shot number one. I'm going to do a called shot to the face. I'm going to hit his other eye. Come on. Natural 20.
Sam: I feel like we need to retire the dice.
Taliesin: Fuck no! No, I love this die.
Marisha: You witnessed it!
Chris perkins: Yeah!
Marisha: You're a third party, it's good.
Travis: Have you and Wheaton ever touched?
Taliesin: Yeah, and I had a really bad day afterward. Let me tell you. That didn't turn out too well. That's just 16 points of damage, and I don't think I get anything bonus for this, he has to make a constitution saving throw.
Chris perkins: Eyeball saving throw.
Taliesin: Or he's going to have disadvantage on all of his attacks for the next turn.
Matt: Okay, that is nine plus 14, 23.
Taliesin: Yeah, no, he's fine.
Matt: Dragons.
Taliesin: I know. It was worth a shot. I'm going to take another shot. Fuck it, I'm just going to go for a sharpshooter, to try and do a little bit more damage to this, and I'm going to burn another grit and get advantage on it.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: So advantage sharpshooter. And that's a good thing, because that was terrible. And that was also terrible. So I miss.
Matt: All right, second shot. The first one (boom) slams and blasts near the ocular socket of Umbrasyl, shattering the bone, but not actually damaging the eye. The second shot manages to go through the wing, but unfortunately, the area was already damaged, and it's minimal in the effect on the dragon. Third strike?
Taliesin: Yeah, third strike. Here we go. Actually, you know what, I'm going to go for advantage. I'm going to go for sharpshooter advantage one more time, just for shits and giggles. Jesus. Do I call it?
Matt: It fell to the table.
Taliesin: So, yeah, I miss.
Matt: Two other shots, unfortunately, (bang).
Taliesin: I'm going to hide. I'm going to pull top right, and go up. I'm going up and I'm getting the fuck back there, as far back as I can get.
Matt: Okay. End of Percy's turn, going to use another legendary action to slam with the tail once again towards you, Vax. This is going to be--
Liam: This is in the same round, so there's no more disadvantage.
Matt: Correct. 25?
Liam: Sure. And do I blow Uncanny Dodge now?
Matt: You only get one reaction, so yeah. That's going to be 22 points of bludgeoning damage. Whack! The tail comes down and slams into you, putting you face-first into the stone. You can feel the blood run from your nose from the impact as the tail picks back up again. Vex, you're up.
Laura: I'm going to attack him a couple times. How about that? No advantage anymore, though, huh?
Marisha: No, it failed.
Laura: 18 on the first one doesn't hit.
Matt: Arrow just splinters across the dragon's hide.
Laura: That first one was way better, I should've kept it!
Matt: What was the second one?
Laura: The second one was 16.
Matt: 16, the second arrow strikes the side of Umbrasyl's face. Unfortunately, once again, the wood shaft streaks across, broken and destroyed by the impact. That ends your turn.
Laura: No, I still have a bonus action, so I'm going to hide with my bonus action.
Matt: Okay, you can do that, roll stealth. Did you add sneak attack? Oh, no, because nothing hit. Sorry.
Laura: Really?
Matt: Sorry, I was trying to be mindful.
Laura: Did you really just do that?
Matt: Trying to help. Failing miserably, but trying.
Laura: Do I still have Pass Without Trace?
Matt: No. Hunter's Mark got rid of that.
Laura: 20.
Matt: Okay, good to know. Top of the round. Magical darkness fills this entire sphere once more, encapsulating Grog, Vax, and everybody else in the area of the dragon. Vision is taken. You are all considered blind and have disadvantage on any attack rolls.
Laura: Who all?
Matt: Dragon does not seem to be--
Liam: And is it we're blinded, or we're blind where we are?
Matt: Blind where you are.
Travis: Dragon does not seem to be--?
Matt: Affected by it.
Laura: I'm not affected by that, though, because I'm outside of the bubble?
Matt: Correct, yes. Actually, let me see something.
Travis: That dumb grin.
Matt: With a five. Yep.
Marisha: Breath recharged.
Matt: Umbrasyl is going to turn up towards you, Grog. The head peeks out of the darkness for a second, right before it fills your space, and it just says, "I will finish this." You hear a familiar sound of gurgling, and then (liquid spray) out another time. This is going to go for everything in that vicinity. That's going to be Keyleth, Shale, Grog, Trinket, and Percy.
Taliesin: Did I not get cover?
Matt: You couldn't move that far, unfortunately. That's as far as you could go with your movement.
Taliesin: Okay.
Matt: So I need a dexterity saving throw from all of you guys.
Marisha: Fuck.
Taliesin: Blowing my last reroll. That's better.
Marisha: It's like a 23 save, right?
Matt: Yeah.
Taliesin: Fuck no. I mean, I rolled good, but--
Marisha: But it doesn't matter.
Travis: 18.
Chris perkins: Ten.
Marisha: Six.
Taliesin: That's 20.
Matt: And Trinket? Oh.
Sam: I guess I should do a Cutting Words, just to help a little bit.
Matt: What's the range on Cutting Words, unfortunately?
Sam: Probably 60, 30? Is he further than that? Damn it.
Matt: Unfortunately. The distance of the bard. Just to make sure. 60 feet, yeah. So that's 66 points of acid damage to Grog, Shale, halved to you, and 66 to Percy.
Laura: Trinket's unconscious.
Matt: Trinket is unconscious and dissolving.
Taliesin: I'm unconscious.
Matt: Percy is unconscious and dissolving. Grog?
Travis: I'm good.
Matt: You're good. Hit points.
Travis: I have a question. Because he attacked me, do I get my retaliation attack on him?
Matt: Yes, you do.
Marisha: Kill him, motherfucker! Kill him!
Matt: Shale, what are you at?
Chris perkins: This will depend on this roll. I've got Stone's Endurance, so I'm going to try to use my reaction to reduce the damage, and I reduce it by enough to keep me up.
Matt: Fantastic! She's got grit! She's got perseverance!
Sam: So sexy!
Chris perkins: I'm at two hit points.
Matt: All right, Grog, go for it. Not with advantage.
Travis: It's not reckless?
Matt: The reckless is for your actual attack round.
Travis: The first one was an 18.
Matt: I'm pretty sure it is. Let me double check. Just so the internet doesn't yell at me. It's going to yell at me anyway, it always yells at me.
Taliesin: I believe in you.
Travis: It's a 27, so.
Marisha: This fucker's got to be close to death, right?
Taliesin: Nope.
Matt: During this turn, not round, so yeah.
Travis: That was a 27 for the first one.
Matt: 27 was the hit? That hits. Roll damage.
Travis: 18.
Laura: Plus necrotic.
Travis: Thank you. 22.
Matt: 22. How do you want to do this? (cheering)
Travis: Did the fucking necrotic do it? (screaming)
Sam: Oh, god.
Matt: So. Held aloft by Bigby's Hand, acid sprayed in your face, two of your friends on the ground, unconscious and dissolving, in the center of the dragon's lair, Grog Strongjaw, how do you want to do this?
Travis: I rear back with the bloodaxe and I swing for the hinge right where his upper and lower jaw meet, and I'd like to cleave up under his skull into his brain.
Matt: As you lunge forward, the darkness fills you, but the feral instinct that you've grown up with is enough to know the source of that pain, the source of that acid, is also the source of victory. And as you swing wide, the jaw, still extended from the blast of acid, you push through it, as it's spraying into you, and the sheer force of your blade hits the edge of the jaw, and you push, and you hear from the back of the throat, as the acid is projected, the gurgle of horrible, shrieking pain. (groan) The stream stops as the blade goes towards the base of the skull, pushing forward and upward. You divide the actual mouth of Umbrasyl like that. The darkness (whoosh) flicks out, as you guys watch Grog descending, putting your foot now onto the front of the dragon's neck, you stand up, getting hold onto where the wound is there, still living, the one working eye flitting about wildly, you reach up and grab the edge of the nose, bring the axe up with the other hand, and slam again, and again, and as you do, the eye rolls back. The whole body begins to fall limp as it crumples backward. Vax, I need you to go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw.
Taliesin: Oh, yeah, I am very unconscious.
Ashley: You'll be okay. I've got you.
Liam: 25.
Matt: 25. Okay, you dodge out of the way as the dragon plummets to the ground. (heavy impact) What was Trinket's maximum hit points?
Laura: It was 60.
Matt: Let me check something here.
Laura: But he was at 53 when he got hit.
Matt: The remaining damage. Yeah, you're fine.
Travis: Night saved.
Matt: Umbrasyl's body hits the ground, the two arms reach up, and the body still continues to pull itself backwards. You pull out of the way. The head lolls around, the jaw now grossly, cartoonishly open, giving out these horrible choking sounds, as the blood and bile and acid all mingle. It tries to talk. The bubbles continue coming forward before it stumbles, the arms sprawled out, its head falls limp to the side as the eye twitches and then falls still.
Ashley: I run over to Percy.
Laura: I run over to Trinket.
Marisha: I drop my water elemental form.
Ashley: I touch Percy and I cast Heal on him.
Marisha: Nice.
Laura: I cast Cure Wounds on Trinket.
Matt: As you stand there, Shale, watching the dragon fall as Grog Strongjaw, the once runt of the Herd of Storms, slams the blade over and over again in the dragon's head, a little part of you is a little jealous, and another part proud, and a little sad that this was not the time for you to lose your life in battle against a mighty dragon.
Ashley: Oh, Shale.
Liam: Can you believe it?
Sam: Shale jumps into acid.
Liam: Just walks in.
Chris perkins: Dissolves.
Matt: (sizzle) I can make that joke in two weeks! As you go and bring Trinket around for a second, using the last bit of the magic that's been afforded to you as a ranger, Trinket comes to. (bear grunt) A lot of the fur has been singed off, and spotted flesh with acid burn, but is conscious and alive, and weak, Trinket leans forward as you're cradling his head and licks the side of your face and tucks his nose into the side of your shoulder.
Laura: You were so brave in here!
Matt: (bear grunt) You go ahead and help Percy get off the ground. You come to consciousness again and you see Pike's hand touching yours as she lifts you. Suddenly, a surge of invigoration hits your body, and you find yourself feeling a lot better than you did a few moments ago.
Taliesin: Yeah, what am I at?
Ashley: 70 hit points.
Laura: That's major.
Matt: Heal, man. Clerics don't fuck around.
Ashley: I saved it just in case.
Laura: Holy shit, Grog!
Marisha: Holy shit, Grog!
Ashley: Grog! I run over to Grog and I jump up on his leg, I'm going to sit on his foot.
Travis: Monstah!
Ashley: Yeah, monstah!
Chris perkins: I will remove my dragon tooth necklace and pass it off to Grog.
Travis: No, Shale.
Chris perkins: You must take this. You've got many more battles left in you. This is going to serve you better than it ever served me. And just so you know, I don't know what the Herd would do, but if you ever go into battle again against other dragons, you know who to call. I'll be ready.
Travis: Yeah. The wielder of the magic stick of nose-whappiness. I will wear this with honor.
Chris perkins: All right. So whenever you, by the way, whenever you spend hit dice to regain hit points, you double the number of hit points restored.
Travis: With the necklace?
Chris perkins: Yes.
Travis: Oh, snap!
Ashley: You what?
Chris perkins: Double your hit points you restore.
Travis: I thought it was bullshit, but it's not! Dope!
Liam: You finally have some hit points.
Laura: You know, if you seek another dragon to kill, you might meet us in Whitestone. We're forming an army there.
Chris perkins: I just might.
Marisha: Keyleth drops elemental form and goes over to Vax and grabs him by the face.
Liam: You'd have to lean over for that.
Sam: He's a little boy!
Laura: It's like kissing a child.
Chris perkins: He's like a little voodoo doll of Vax.
Liam: I'm not pygmied or anything, I'm like a doll.
Laura: Keep it going, Keyleth. Just mug down with him.
Liam: Maybe this should wait till later?
Marisha: I tap him on the face, and say  So glad you're not dead. And I walk away.
Liam: I'm going to shake that off, and then I'm going to do a once around the entire chamber and look around for any traps I can find, especially around that pile up top, but also, I don't know that they'll be here, but see if there's anything like what we saw in Krieg's cave with the crystals in the wall. Little peeky stones.
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Laura: Can I look for those, too, since dragons?
Liam: 22.
Laura: Oh, he probably doesn't need my help. I get advantage on all dragon things.
Matt: You do.
Laura: It doesn't matter. I rolled shit, twice. 12.
Matt: 12, okay. You guys spend the better part of the next 15 or so minutes glancing around and trying to find any sign of these strange obsidian spheres that were previously in the lair of Krieg, or Brimscythe. After coasting through the crates and barrels, gold piles, the various artifacts and trinkets and things that are strewn about this back corner, no sign of anything like that.
Liam: What about weaponry in that pile of shit?
Laura: What about all the stuff in that pile of shit?
Travis: You want to rage loot?
Matt: There's a lot of things in there.
Liam: I was first on the pile. Are there any weapons in there?
Matt: There are weapons. There are two glaives, polearm glaives. There appear to be a number of pieces of ornamental armor, very beautiful, made of gold and platinum, that were either used for ceremonial reasons or just adorning some sort of popular hall.
Marisha: Keyleth walks over and pulls out her Hunk of Quall.
Sam: Yeah, Quall it up.
Marisha: I'm going to Quall it up all over top of the gold, see if anything lights up with my Wi-Fi detector. Since that's what I feel like it is.
Matt: Strangely enough, no. Nothing seems to glow in the vicinity of the Hunk of Quall.
Liam: And no other blades?
Matt: There are two glaives. Pulling the list up here. Going through the whole hoard, because it is 11:20, we may pick up the actual looting element at the beginning of next session. We'll be here for a while if you want to do that.
Laura: I like the sound of that.
Marisha: We have to go back and get Fassbender.
Laura: Yeah, we're totally going to go back. We're going to return a lot of this gold to Whiterun. Westruun. All the towns.
Sam: Well, all the gold that we can definitely prove came from Westruun, we'll bring back.
Laura: I agree.
Sam: With Westruun markings.
Laura: All the other gold that's just sitting around, I mean, we should probably just take to help the battles.
Travis: Plus it would be nice to give Shale some gold to take back to the Herd.
Sam: Who?
Travis: Shale.
Sam: The Herd? I thought the Herd's-- Okay.
Travis: There was a great remnant. The Herd will live again, and with Shale's wisdom.
Marisha: There were still a few members of the Herd still alive. A good half dozen.
Travis: Zanror's baby mama is still preggo.
Marisha: Yeah, exactly.
Liam: It's also very lean times in Westruun. Most of this gold should go back to Westruun.
Laura: Most of it.
Marisha: Did we contribute any of our own gold into this pile?
Liam: That's back in Westruun.
Chris perkins: I can return with the remnants of the Herd and gather up whatever you don't take.
Laura: And bring it back to Westruun.
Sam: We'll divvy it up later.
Marisha: Let's divvy it up.
Liam: If we take most of the gold that came from Westruun, we're a big pack of assholes.
Laura: I said we weren't going to! We're going to take it back to Westruun.
Sam: You're a tiny pack of assholes right now.
Marisha: Is he still tiny? He's still tiny.
Laura: Three hours.
Liam: Probably another two hours.
Laura: It's only been an hour? No.
Matt: You have, probably another 20, 30 minutes or so before it fades.
Marisha: We need Fassbender.
Travis: Keyleth, you're going to butcher this dragon, right?
Marisha: Yes. 100 percent. I start going to town on it.
Laura: Because this is going to be worth a lot of fucking money.
Marisha: Yeah. Percy, do you have any extra vials? Empty vials for blood?
Laura: We should get some of the blood and put it in the Bag of Colding.
Marisha: Hey, Percy! So glad you're alive and not burning in acid. Do you have any extra vials?
Taliesin: Do I?
Matt: Checking in your various pieces of equipment you have on you, as opposed to what you have stored elsewhere, you had a few vials. They are a little jangly when you reach for them, and you realize they've been crushed.
Taliesin: We have some empty potion bottles.
Liam: I hand mine over from the one I gave Vex.
Taliesin: The one I used as well.
Matt: Go ahead and make a nature check.
Marisha: I'll take that 16 for a 27. Nature check, yeah? 27.
Matt: All right. So as you guys are gathering the elements of this dragon's hoard, gathering the equipment, the art pieces, the relics, all things that were part of this-- and it is, especially since you know, as far as dragon hoards go, especially for an ancient dragon, it isn't huge. And with the recent moving in, you get the idea that this dragon's true hoard probably exists elsewhere. This was either a temporary lair, or was intended to be the new lair, and the process of transitioning hadn't quite begun. Most of the gold here seems to have been what was given to Umbrasyl by the Herd once they had taken over Westruun.
Liam: Maybe he has to give it to Thordak in a dragon pyramid scheme.
Laura: We don't find any of those glyphs like there were in--
Taliesin: We already looked for those.
Laura: Not the circles, I meant the transportation glyph that we beamed into his--
Matt: That you saw in Krieg's lair? No. You do know, from having one made by Allura within your keep before, that they take quite some time to ingrain. Dragon's only really had over a week or so. So, gathering up the materials, the remnants of that hoard, you guys descend down the mountain if you wish, or is there anything else you wish to accomplish within the actual lair?
Marisha: I want to harvest some scales, some blood, and some teeth.
Matt: Right, based on the roll you made. So we have two empty vials that you managed to acquire.
Marisha: Plus he had three in his Bag of Holding.
Liam: Can I help her out?
Matt: Yeah. It's difficult because, with the nature of Umbrasyl's death, as well as being a creature that is naturally caustic and acidic in a large portion of its body, there was a mixing of a lot of the blood that has caused it to become impure while vialing it, so you get three vials of the blood that are still pure and viable. Everything else seems to dissolve through the glass upon contact.
Laura: I can put it in the Bag of Colding, and then it'll keep it.
Taliesin: I can assist with any of the cutting, because I've got the fuck-all sword.
Marisha: I hand the three vials of blood to Vex to put in the Bag of Colding.
Matt: Many dragon's teeth were sundered in the ravaging of Umbrasyl at Grog's furious storm of axe blade strikes. However, you do manage to harvest from the body, unscathed, 14 ancient black dragon teeth.
Marisha: We should make some sweet necklaces. Any scales?
Matt: Quite a lot of scales here, yes. It's going to take you a long time to harvest what you can off this body. A lot of the areas have been damaged from the various wounds and such. How much time do you want to spend to harvest scales?
Liam: Do you think we should just camp here for the night?
Taliesin: We could just camp here for the night.
Laura: As long as the other dragons don't realize that we've just done this. Would I know if they would know?
Matt: You have no idea.
Laura: I don't know if it's actually safe to just hang out in this dragon's lair.
Taliesin: You know what we can do, is we can make the magic mansion in that cave off to the side, in the very back of it.
Laura: That's a wonderful idea.
Ashley: And that magic trap, we didn't set it off.
Taliesin: We haven't sprung the magic trap, either, so that's just none the wiser.
Sam: Okay.
Marisha: All right. I'll spend as much time then, I'll stay up as long as I can throughout the night. If I hear any disturbances I'll come back to the mansion.
Taliesin: I'll help.
Chris perkins: Once we get to the mansion, Shale will bid the group farewell and head down to Westruun to let the rest of the Herd know what's happened, about the great triumph of the bearded king.
Laura: Yeah!
Matt: As you come down and--
Chris perkins: I'm killed by an owlbear.
Matt: Ravaged and eaten horribly in the Bramblewood, never to be seen again!
Chris perkins: Nobody hears the tale of the bearded king!
Travis: Son of a bitch!
Taliesin: Forever, the Herd will just say, Grog, that asshole.
Marisha: Such a dick.
Matt: No, you come down and as you speak with the remnants of the Herd of Storms, many of which, a number of them did survive the battle, though scarred horribly, and many did lose their life in the battle with Umbrasyl. Zanror, Worra, recovering all right. However, the number's now thinned down to a simple 12 members of the Herd. As you speak with Zanror, he looks to you and says, "Shale. You live."
Chris perkins: Obviously.
Matt: "Have you word of the mountain? The dragon?"
Chris perkins: I toss one of its teeth at him. He will trouble us no more. He is a bygone.
Matt: "Good. Good." He takes the tooth and gives it to Worra. "Well."
Chris perkins: It's the work of those adventurers.
Matt: "Vox Machina, they call themselves."
Chris perkins: They are truly great.
Matt: "Good. We need greatness in this world. We--"
Chris perkins: Don't be so glum, you old fool.
Matt: He grins to himself.
Chris perkins: This is a day of glory. A great battle has been won.
Matt: "It is. But there's been a lot of cost in it, too."
Chris perkins: There's always cost. We will all die, it just depends on how. We died fighting a dragon, and we lived fighting a dragon. What more do you want? That's the smile I want to see.
Matt: "I'm glad you're back, Shale. Your wisdom stays strong."
Chris perkins: Well, now that Kevdak's out of the way, maybe people will listen to what I have to say for a change.
Matt: "We've been talking here. I think the Herd of Storms died in battle with the dragon. There's not many of us left."
Chris perkins: But there are other herds.
Matt: "There are. And while we lost the Rivermaw, I think maybe it's time we went and joined them."
Chris perkins: I like that idea.
Matt: "They're damper lands. Better for raising children. Take a break from all this warring and go back to a simple life. Will you come with us, Shale?"
Chris perkins: Of course.
Matt: "Good. We'll set out tomorrow. At dawn, we plan."
Sam: He's learned!
Matt: You guys set up for the evening, resting your sore, bruised bodies, smelling the ruin of the black dragon as you prepare for an evening's rest, well-earned. We will close this evening's session. Well fought, guys!
Travis: Holy shit.
Marisha: We didn't die!
Liam: Scanlan, is there a hot springs in this mansion?
Sam: There can be whatever you want.
Liam: We need to bathe, soak. We need a good soak to get the stink off.
Matt: It's amazing. You imagine why he didn't mention it before, but Scanlan does indeed have a hot spring in his magnificent mansion.
Travis: It's amazing!
Matt: No, it's magnificent. Guys, a big thank you and round of applause for Chris Perkins!
Chris perkins: Thanks for having me! It's a great honor to be here. Thank you.
Matt: All right, well. We'll pick this back up again next week on Thursday to see what the next adventure holds for Vox Machina now that one of the four Conclave remaining have fallen! I can tell you with the death of one dragon, I doubt the others, upon hearing of it, will be anywhere near as careless as Umbrasyl was. But there are more Vestiges to find, more allies to acquire. Who knows what other dangers lie in the realms of Tal'Dorei and beyond, outside of the Conclave's threat? We shall see in the weeks to come. Guys, thank you so much for staying up with us tonight. Rest well, and is it Thursday yet? See you guys next week. [end of captions]

[START OF EPISODE]
Sound: (cheering)
Kevin: All right! (cheers) Welcome! Is my mic on? It's on, whoa, yeah, welcome to the very first inaugural premiere edition of Critical Role live! Guys, my name's Kevin. I am the social media director for Geek and Sundry-- yes, thank you very much, I am indeed a very cool person. I've been with Geek and Sundry for about eight months now, it was really intimidating at first because I kept mixing up Vax and Vex. Yeah, I still mix up Vax and Vex. But okay, what I was going to say was that Critical Role fans are the warmest, most welcoming fans. (cheering)
Kevin: Yeah! Except for that guy. Right? But no, I love you guys, give yourselves a big hand, thank you so much. (cheering)
Kevin: I want you guys to know, this is our first time doing this, this is as I said the first inaugural premiere, they're all synonyms, right? So if you're like me you're extremely excited. But please remember that all the people at home are still watching, say hi to the people at home, hi people at home.
Audience: Hi!
Kevin: Right? So please do me a favor, put your phones on silent, all right? The house lights are going to be kind of dim, so you can use your phones, you can tweet, you can do social media posts, whatever you want, if there's a Cubone somewhere please let me know, tweet at me. I need like ten Cubones. So yeah, just put everything on silent and be silent about it. You can tweet about the show, please use the hashtag #CriticalRoleLive, surprisingly enough. Do me another favor, don't do the concert pic thing where you put your phone up and record for ten minutes at a time, because there are people behind you, as you may or may not know, so I'd really appreciate that. The other thing is, this not a Rocky Horror thing, so don't shout out like, I would like to rage. Don't do that stuff, don't "how do you want to do this?" Don't do that stuff. Be respectful of the people on stage. Think of this as a funny play. You can laugh, you can woo, but maybe don't shout out suggestions. Especially the suggestions that I know a lot of you have in your heads, right? Wait, I have one other thing. There's a merch thing. The merch table's going to be open after the show, is that right? Yes. After the show, the merch table's going to be open, so if you didn't get a chance to get merch, you're going to get another chance to get merch, so don't worry about that. Is there something else? VIPs will get your posters after, so if you're a VIP, you'll get a poster, just come-- where? Upstairs. Okay. Don't worry. Right. Thank you. Let's hear it for Claudia once again, guys. (cheering)
Kevin: All right, so, do you guys want to bring them out? (cheering)
Kevin: All right. Let's start with the master of dick-lightning and shit-scrying, playing Scanlan Shorthalt, Mr. Sam Riegel! (cheering)
Kevin: All right!
Sam: Thanks! You get a car! You get a car! You get a car!
Kevin: Guys, get your tickets to the gun show, because the gun show's coming to town. Playing Percival Fredrickstein von Mussel Klossowski de Rolo III of Whitestone. Yeah, right, right. Taliesin, let's bring him out, Taliesin Jaffe! (cheering)
Kevin: Guys, put your hands together, put your antlers on your head, for Keyleth. Marisha Ray! (cheering)

Marisha: I'm an independent woman, all right?
Taliesin: Never mind, I give up.
Kevin: All right, let's bring out the man I have a massive man-crush on--
Sam: I'm already here!
Kevin: Liam O'Brien as Vax'ildan! (cheering)
Liam: What the hell!
Kevin: This next woman was stuffing exotic animals into tiny balls before it was cool. Laura Bailey as Vex'ahlia! (cheering)
Kevin: She's got the hipster glasses to prove it.
Laura: Yeah, that's right. It's not for seeing at all, I don't...
Kevin: And the next guy, the next guy, get out your tubs of mayo for Mr. Travis Willingham as Grog freaking Strongjaw! (cheering and chanting)
Kevin: All right, let's, let's bring it down. Guys, there are certain names that people whisper with reverence. Because those names belong to the breakthrough artists in their field. Jim Henson, Bob Dylan, Madame Curie. (laughter)
Kevin: Tonight we have one of those names with us. You may know him. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Matt Mercer. (cheering)
Matt: Oh boy. That's a lot, that's a lot of people.
Laura: Oh my gosh.
Matt: All righty, let me shore up my positioning here on the camera for you fine folks and open my energy drink because that's what makes this show happen.
Travis: Caffeine and drugs.
Matt: (shushing noises) Anyway, welcome everybody to our first Critical Role live, all of you folks there on the internet and everyone here in person in Los Angeles, California. (cheering)
Matt: Welcome to Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors get together, roll dice, and play Dungeons and Dragons. Tonight we have a fantastic pick-up of last week's story where the adventuring party Vox Machina found themselves wandering through the Feywild. However, before that happens, let us get to our fantastic sponsor for the evening. Once again, this episode is brought to you by Loot Crate, they've been awesome. So thank you guys so much. (cheering)
Matt: The current Loot Crate theme for July is Futuristic, includes a lot of awesome Rick and Morty, Futurama, Mega Man, Valiant Comic stuff, Star Trek, that fun element there. We've got music playing, it's on. Oh man, I feel like things are happening.
Sam: Music's working?
Laura: Music works, you guys, music works.
Matt: There we go. Perfect. Tech stuff is coming together. Yeah, so Futuristic is their crate theme this month. We also have the anime Loot Crate is themed Squadron. Has a bunch of stuff from Gundam, Gate, Arpeggio of Blue Steel, Antimagic Academy, a lot of exclusive stuff, of course you guys can go ahead and get $3 off a subscription by going to lootcrate.com/criticalrole and putting in "criticalrole," one word, in your nice little Loot Crate subscription bonus.
Travis: I chew on Goku's head a lot. I'm a fixated-- it's cool.
Matt: And the paint is actually healthy to eat, apparently. That's not at all the reason why Grog's intelligence is that low. So, if you haven't checked it out yet, check out Loot Crate, thank you guys so much for sponsoring our show, we love you. Great. So. Next up we have-- we recently had a t-shirt contest, didn't we? Laura, if you want to take that away for me.
Laura: Oh, this? Okay, so I get to announce who the official winner is?
Matt: You do, actually, yeah.
Laura: Oh my gosh, this is so exciting. Okay. So the official winner of the first Critter contest is... Against the Chroma Conclave, designed by Antmageddon! (cheering)
Laura: So! As of right now, that shirt is available in the Geek and Sundry store for preorder. It's going to be there for I think two weeks? And it's available in sizes small through 3XL, which we're really excited about. And yeah, so that's that, so.
Travis: Go get one!
Laura: Go you guys for voting on that, you rock, even with shenanigans.
Matt: There were so many amazing contenders for that contest that the community puts out, so we--
Marisha: And we got hacked, which means we made it.
Matt: Yay! Next announcement I have, when I arrived here I discovered that there was an actual PokeGym as a part of this mall, I'd like to ask Team Valor to go ahead and make sure that shit leaves red. (cheering and booing)
Travis: What a response!
Laura: That was a mixed reaction.
Matt: Look, the whole San Fernando Valley's blue, okay, give me something! All right, anyway. Yeah, it's become a thing. And we have another cool announcement. Travis, do you want to take it away on that one?
Travis: Yes we do, the response to this live event was so amazing that we are super stoked to announce that we are going to also be doing Critical Role live in Indianapolis during GenCon on August 6, Saturday night. Tickets will go on sale- I think they're on sale now.
Laura: Right now.
Travis: Right now, so if you want to like, silently on your phone or just ignore it because it's a much bigger venue, so tickets should be available, but we're all going to be in Indianapolis on Saturday night and GenCon to roll some dice with you bitches live. (cheering)
Matt: Hell yeah. So if this wasn't nerve-wracking enough for me, we have another one in a couple of weeks.
Travis: Pressure's on, dude, pressure's on!
Matt: But I'm super stoked, it's going to be my first time at GenCon, I've been wanting to go for many years and this is a nice way to go, I guess. So. Check it out. Hopefully we'll see you guys there. That brings us to the end of our announcements and will bring us down--
Laura: Wait. Before we go into not-regular announcements, should we make sure that people know that we're not having an episode next week because of Comic-Con?
Matt: That's true, actually, yeah.
Sam: Way to bring down the room.
Laura: I'm sorry, guys.
Matt: Because all the company, everyone's going to be at Comic-Con doing panels and scheduling and stuff, there will be no episode next week, but I promise that we'll make the episode the week after that extra cool. (cheering)
Matt: I hope. So yeah, let's go ahead and dive into tonight's episode of Critical Role. [dramatic music]
Sam: We're on! (cheering)
Matt: All right, all right, we've got to do a story here! It's appreciated, but--
Sam: We should probably just finish.
Matt: All right, so, bringing us in now, back to tonight's episode of Critical Role. Guys, pay attention.
Liam: Illithid syphilis.
Matt: The camera's already on.
Liam: Yeah. Okay.
Matt: So. Our intrepid band of adventurers, Vox Machina, found themselves recently traversing the Feywild in search of another Vestige of Divergence. In doing so, they managed to find an old friend in the nymph Nahla, acquired some information, trading a book, and found their way towards the ever-shifting grasses northward in search of where the Divergence, the object of the Divergence lies. In doing so, they found a new ally, a new friend. A little satyr by the name of, where is it here--
All: Garmelie.
Matt: Garmelie, thank you. Now Garmelie, who had made some really interesting sketches of the party upon being caught was then dragged into Scanlan's magnificent mansion, at which Pike asked him to make a fantastic mural for the interior of that place, which I think still resides there to this day. And on the internet, as we've discovered. Upon traveling further north, hopefully to find their final destination in the form of the Shademirk Bog, where the Fenthras bow seemingly exists, you instead came upon Syngorn, the city from the youthful days of Vex and Vax. Upon speaking to the head-- pardon me; you see, all the nerves gets the belching out. It works out well. Upon encountering Watcher Iova watching the gate, recognizing the twins, let them within the actual city of Syngorn. And that is where we left off. So, as you guys walk through the beautiful verdant city, tall seemingly endless trees around you, many buildings naturally formed and built from smoothly carved stone, various ancient sigils carved throughout the entire cityscape, the very heavy-armored Verdant Guard gathered in places, and a general air of intensity and building military might within the city of Syngorn, you have your invisible companion Garmelie, who at some point in the near future agreed to tell you what it is he wishes you to steal for him as part of the deal that was made by the twins. So. What would you like to do?
Liam: I feel like I should be very stern right now, but I can't stop smiling.
Travis: You're gloomy. Lock it up, here we go.
Laura: I feel like the first thing we need to do is go see our father.
Liam: Right off the bat?
Laura: He's the one that's going to give us access to the rest of the city.
Liam: All right. Is Iova still here, or has she trundled off?
Matt: She's walked off. She literally let you guys in the city and went, do what you've got to do, and then turned away and the rest of the guards--
Laura: Oh seriously, so like... no, no the guard is following us.
Liam: And we remember where we're going, right, because it's all the same as it was.
Matt: The city is the same as it was.
Liam: Well, I imagine we'd go to his home. Our home. His home.
Laura: What time is it? I mean, we don't know what time it is.
Taliesin: It's dusk.
Laura: Thank you, Percy.
Sam: But we just woke up.
Laura: All right. Okay.
Liam: Look at all those elves.
Laura: So many elves.
Travis: Is the little satyr-- is he holding onto my skirts, basically?
Matt: You actually don't feel a general presence, and then as you move you feel a slight tug at your belt.
Travis: Right, so can I like, how far away is that guard that's on our tail?
Matt: About 15, 20 feet back.
Travis: Oh yeah. Can I like super slyly whisper, okay, so at any point are you going to tell us what it is you want us to fucking steal?
Matt: You hear a whispered voice that curls up by your ear, strangely given the fact that he's so small, so the voice is being thrown right into the side of your eardrum, goes, "Just be quiet! Find a place in which we can speak privately, and then I will be happy to tell you. Shh! Stop talking to the air; it upsets them."
Travis: It's really quite normal for me.
Laura: Hey, Grog. You should really watch that gas of yours with him back there.
Travis: Oh, you're so right. Hey, pull my finger. (fart sound)
Matt: (coughs)
Travis: Yeah. That's the family reserve. Oh, he said we're supposed to find somewhere quiet to talk.
Liam: Maybe we should do that first, actually.
Laura: We have guards fucking following us. We have to go find our father.
Taliesin: We also don't know where we're sleeping tonight, or whether or not it's even permissible. We should probably have a conversation with whoever's in charge. Is your father in charge?
Liam: No.
Laura: Ish.
Taliesin: Ish.
Liam: He's a bureaucrat.
Taliesin: Excellent. (laughter)
Liam: All right, let's go see Dad, then.
Marisha: (whispers) Grog.
Travis: What?
Marisha: (whispers) Your pants, they're sagging a little bit, why?
Travis: What?
Marisha: (whispers) They're sagging.
Travis: Oh, it's like the new rage amongst the kids. It gives me super street cred.
Marisha: Where's Garmelie?
Laura: Keyleth, shut up about Garmelie!
Travis: Yeah, ix-nay on the Garmelie-- I think I'm doing Pig Latin wrong. Yeah.
Liam: It's this way. And I start walking off towards Dad's house.
Taliesin: I'm going to follow the twins.
Sam: Sounds good.
Marisha: I look regal and as we pass elves I say, good day.
Matt: The few that look in your direction, Keyleth, take a moment to nod, look you over and then continue walking, seemingly perturbed by the sudden interaction and the immediate realization that you're not of full blood.
Laura: Yeah, sorry Keyleth, your ears aren't large enough.
Marisha: That's not normally what people tell me.
Sam: It's not the size of your ears...
Marisha: That's right.
Matt: So. As you guys continue following Vax'ildan towards the abode of their father, you keep an eye out towards the rest of Syngorn proper. You see the further into the city you go, interspersed with a few Emon guards, you see a handful of individuals that are human, and they're dressed in the actual attire of the guards of Emon, and they're intermingling right now with the Verdant Guard, the military might within Syngorn.
Marisha: What were the name of the guards in Emon? Did they have a name?
Matt: The Emon guard.
Marisha: Yeah, totally.
Matt: There is a name, and it's somewhere in my notes but we're good.
Taliesin: From this perspective, I can see your panic folder. It's so exciting. That's where the magic happens.
Marisha: Yeah, that's true, we never really see that!
Taliesin: This is exciting for us. (laughter)
Matt: So. You guys continue making your way towards the abode. After traversing on the outskirts of what would be the tangleward side of the city, the eastern side, you travel in through an area of buildings that are very beautifully crafted, many of which seem to have stemmed from some sort of a tree growth, but upon closer look you can see that it's actually carved stone to resemble a tree. And then it eventually rises up into a somewhat spherical building, and there are many that build off of that to create this kind of neighborhood of various elven abodes within Syngorn.
Liam: Fucking hate this place.
Laura: Me, too. It's hideous.
Marisha: This is gorgeous. Look at the craftsmanship. It's incredible.
Sam: Good day.
Marisha: Good day.
Matt: You make your way towards the end of this particular-- (laughter)
Matt: The guards still keeping track behind you. You find your way to the end of the main road, and it splits into two smaller avenues. You know to take the left that leads deeper into the more political family houses of Syngorn. While your family is not a political house per se, your father, as an ambassador to Emon, was given a home in this location. It is your old home, although it appears to have been even further renovated and is much nicer than you remember, but the door is closed and the dusk sun leads you to pause as you look upon the outside of this abode you have not seen in many, many years.
Sam: Do you want me to burn it down?
Laura: Yes.
Travis: No, just seriously, you seem super gloomy. Are we getting in a fight?
Laura: No. No fights.
Matt: The guards now step up and flank a little bit, keeping a close eye as you've now approached and effectively knocked on the handle of a relatively middle-to-high-ranking individual within Syngorean society. Eventually the door opens and you see a woman standing there: bright blonde hair, braided and tied up in the back. She's wearing more of a work-gown for the day. You recognize her as Devana, the new wife of Syldor, the one that you had once met before in Emon when you guys came upon your father last time. As the door opens up, she looks out for a second, taking in the whole group that has gathered on the outside of their home and goes, "My god. Vax'ildan, Vex'ahlia, we weren't expecting you!"
Laura: No. I can't imagine you were. Is he here?
Matt: "He is."
Laura: What time is it?
Matt: She glances out, looks up. "That's always a good question. The longer we stay in these realms, the more confused my daughter becomes."
Liam: How long has that been?
Matt: "Weeks now, I assume. Best that our timepieces can keep."
Laura: Is Velora around?
Matt: "She is, would you like to see her?"
Laura: Of course.
Matt: "Come in. Is it just you two?"
Laura: No.
Liam: No.
Laura: It's everyone.
Travis: Hi.
Laura: And Trinket, you remember Trinket.
Matt: (bear noises) Nudges your arm to the side and comes forward and sniffs out to Devana. She shrinks back a little bit and reaches her hand out to the nose and taps the edge of Trinket's face, and Trinket licks her fingers.
Marisha: Good day.
Sam: Good day.
Marisha: Good day. They respond better if you say "good day" and if you have your head up.
Travis: If we say "bidet?"
Marisha: Bidet, yes. Good day.
Travis: Bidet.
Taliesin: So close. So very close.
Matt: The two guards closest to you, within their helmets their eyes narrow, they look at each other and shake their heads.
Travis: Oh, bidet.
Liam: Your accent is perfect. Don't change a thing.
Matt: Devana goes, "Very well. If you would all proceed to be quiet if you could, Syldor is working. And you may stay outside," she says to the guards. And they both, "We were given orders, milady, to--" "I understand that. But this is already a lot of people in our home. Stay close within earshot, it'll be fine. I trust them." The guards, (sighs)
Laura: I wink at them as I walk inside.
Matt: No reaction whatsoever. You guys make your way into the home and are immediately caught with a very strong smell of cedar. It's a very pleasant-smelling home, and the hearth is warm. It's everything you wanted your home to be, and it immediately hits you to walk in here and see this kind of life away from a life, seeing elements of it that remind you of your childhood, things about it that flag memories to your head of good times and bad, in just a few mere moments. And at that same time, there's a sadness because so much of it has changed, so much of it seems better than the memory. And for a moment there, you feel a little tinge of wondering how different it might've been. At which point that thought process is broken as Devana steps in and goes, "Would anyone like tea, perhaps?"
Sam: Sure, yes, do you have an oolong?
Marisha: Maybe a chamomile, it would be great.
Matt: "Something like that, yes. It's been a little scarce in the Feywilds. More difficult to farm herbs here than you'd think."
Marisha: Oh, here. I pull out some herbs that I brought from my garden. Some glisfoil and other things.
Matt: "Thank you. Appreciate that."
Marisha: They won't scream at you when you pick them. Good. It's good.
Matt: "Thank you. What was your name again?"
Marisha: Oh, I'm Keyleth of the Ashari.
Matt: "A pleasure to meet you again--"
Marisha: Good day.
Matt: "That's, that's really not necessary in my home. You, sir, your name?"
Taliesin: Whatever's available would be just fine.
Sam: I think she means your name.
Marisha: I think she means your name.
Matt: "That's a curious title."
Marisha: But you can call him whatever's available, as well.
Matt: "Very well, coffee table. What's your name?" (laughter)
Liam: It's easier than the actual name.
Taliesin: For you, it is just Percival, and I am another visiting royal from man's world.
Matt: "All right. You, sir?"
Sam: I am called the Kingslayer, Chuck Norris, Burt Reynolds. I have many names. You see, when you've traveled a road as long as I have--
Matt: "Black tea, got it. And you, sir, the large one?"
Travis: Oh, yeah. Bidet. The name is Grog.
Matt: "Very well. I'll return with Syldor once he knows you're here. It may be a while if you don't mind waiting, but the tea will come out posthaste."
Laura: And Velora? Where's she?
Matt: "Let me get her for you, she'll be very like to see both of you, she asks from time to time." She brushes a little lock of hair that's fallen in front of her face behind her ear, and smiles and darts off towards the kitchen. A few moments pass with you guys sitting in awkward silence, looking about the space in the vicinity. Looks to the twins. Eventually Devana comes out and sets tea for all of you across the central table in this meeting area, and behind her you see, clutching the edge of the skirt, you see this tiny, long brown hair that is braided, but the braid's coming undone, tomboyish looking elven girl that peeks around the side of her dress and hides again behind the back. [high-pitched noise]
Matt: Welcome back, sorry about that. (cheering)
Sam: What a battle!
Matt: The technical aspects. We're working through it, but we got through it, thank you for your patience. So the last few minutes, we're not quite sure how much you guys may have missed, but the party wiped. We're rolling up new characters. No, for the Monday episode we'll go ahead and make sure to splice in anything that may have been missed for the past minute. But the party had come to the home of Syldor, the father of Vax and Vex. They had a brief discussion with Devana, his new wife. They were given tea after introductions and then briefly discussed the merits of being a warrior with their half-sister Velora Vessar, and upon discussing apparently a war of some kind, Syldor made his way into the room, and you look and you see the long dark hair of Syldor, his pale complexion, his stern face, staring back at you all from within the doorway as he closes it behind him and steps into the room. You see Devana sits up now and comes over to him and says, "My dear, would you like us to leave you alone?" He goes, "Don't worry, it will be fine. Have a seat. Besides, we're all family. Well, some of us, at least." And he looks over to Grog.
Travis: Bidet. (laughter)
Matt: "Good day, indeed." He comes up and sits, and he's wearing long, dark brown robes with golden and red embroidery on the side, but it's very casual home wear, and he sits down, pulling up a chair across from you guys in this area, and takes one of the cups of tea and sips it. And you can see there's an intensity to his face. He's here, and he looks like he's partially inconvenienced by your presence like he always did, but he also looks like he hasn't slept well, there's some dark circles under his eyes and he seems a little distracted for such a climactic re-meeting.
Laura: Surprise!
Matt: "Surprise, indeed. So. It's good to see you both. Glad you're in good health. You've come quite a ways to come speak with me, being as we currently reside within the Feywild."
Liam: It's a little bit further than we thought we'd have to travel, why... the presence around the city we're seeing? We understand why you fled, but what's going on?
Matt: "Look. We had the entire Fort Daxio army down here and we were to give aid to push into the nearby mountain range where apparently there was an influx of lizardfolk, had been a continuous problem, and apparently a break had been seen somewhere. However, we had sent most of our forces into the mountain range and then received word that three great drakes were making their way straight toward Syngorn after the destruction of Emon. Knowing that, we had no recourse but to flee and prepare when it was time. Had we stood our ground, we would be the same burning crater that your fair city is now."
Laura: So you intend to go back? You're amassing this army to go back and join the fight.
Matt: "That is exactly what we're doing. The remnants of the Emon army we currently have here in the city, we've been building armor and weapons to make sure the most sure-footed and strong-of-arm men and women of our fair city can make it to that battlefield and tear that beast down."
Laura: That's wonderful news.
Matt: "Good. Why are you here?"
Taliesin: We are here on a very similar range of business, to be honest.
Matt: "And you are?"
Taliesin: Ah, yes. Percival Fredrickstein von Mussel Klossowski de Rolo III of the royal house of Whitestone, representative of man's world, here on very important business dealing with dragons. We are looking for some objects: a few things that may help us in our fight against these dragons that have attacked us. We've already made headway against them, and we've already made headway on our quest to destroy them. Any help that your wonderful city could provide would be most agreeable.
Matt: "Well. We currently have all of our resources engaged in our plans of attack. There is not much we could offer you other than, if you wish to stay here within the city, we could provide a place to sleep, food, and when the time is right you may join our ranks into the fray."
Liam: We've come to the Feywild for something specific.
Marisha: We're trying to head to the Shademirk Bog.
Matt: "Why on earth would you be heading to the Shademirk?"
Marisha: We're looking for the bow of Fenthras. It supposedly lives inside of a cancerous tree.
Matt: "Right. Well. Good luck with that."
Laura: Do you think it's possible?
Matt: "I think it's a fool's errand to chase a fleeting rumor into a location that is known to devour and destroy anyone who steps within its bounds. But by all means, you've always been ones seeking the darkness."
Liam: He and I are wearing fleeting rumors. That one's got one hidden up his butt. (laughter)
Matt: You hear Velora chuckle. Devana's like, "Shh! Quiet!"
Laura: I want to pull Velora over and sit her in my lap.
Matt: She (raspberry noise) at her mom as you pick her up there. You can see Devana smiles as she does so.
Liam: Syldor, we have killed two of these dragons already. Nothing could please me more to hear that you are amassing forces here to go back; that is possibly the greatest thing I've ever heard you say to me.
Laura: I want to insight check him and see if he's really saying--
Travis: Yeah, do that shit!
Matt: Roll an insight check.
Liam: Him or me?
Laura: 26 on him!
Matt: All right. I'd whisper, but the microphone makes it useless. It's fine. He appears tired, he appears like a lot of his intention and time has been put towards something important--
Laura: Being a giant dick?
Matt: Possibly. But he doesn't appear to be lying or fudging the truth at all, he's just tired. He says, "Look. There are a lot of pieces at work here. If you have your own path, by all means. And while I have heard of some of your exploits, and I am quite impressed, I hate to be blunt, but it's difficult and strange to mingle family new and old. Your presence here brings up difficult memories for me."
Laura: Oh, you poor man.
Liam: Don't worry. We're not here to look for family. That would entail some amount of investment on either our side or yours. There is clearly none. We are here to do business. Do you know where the bog is?
Matt: "Yes. It's duskward of here."
Sam: Duskward.
Travis: Fucking shit.
Liam: Well, some people go this way, and some people go that way, and some people go both ways.
Marisha: It's like being on a ship forever.
Matt: "I have not traversed this land extensively. I've been here working along with the heads of the city to make sure we are ready for this attack."
Laura: When do you plan to attack?
Matt: "A few weeks."
Laura: You're joining other armies. You don't plan to fight Thordak on your own?
Matt: "Well. There is an attempt to join up with the remnants of the Fort Daxio force. They have not gone to Emon themselves and they currently reside camped out near where Syngorn usually is. We have a few groups that are set on the other side of the veil in the prime realm and they are keeping an eye out for this. A few scouting parties are in Emon as we speak, trying to gather intel on Thordak himself. Once we have that information and we can formulate what to expect, then we can attack."
Marisha: So you're trying to go after Thordak himself. That's your first target, Thordak?
Matt: "He's currently the largest threat to our safety, our home, and our return. Don't think this is the first time a red dragon of that size has been felled. There have been ancient ages of various deaths from his people. It's not impossible, but we need to be ready."
Travis: Just a heads-up, pro tip  dragons can fly. (laughter)
Matt: "And I take it you're their leader."
Travis: Of the dragons? (laughter)
Matt: He very slowly sighs while grabbing his tea.
Travis: I've clearly lost your father. It's all right.
Laura: His intelligence is very low, Grog.
Taliesin: In the interest of dealing with Thordak, we are going to need access to libraries, any of your people who may know something about this bog, and accommodations befitting those of us who are titled.
Sam: As well as access to certain parts of the city. We need some items to acquire within the city before we set out.
Marisha: Also, it would be nice to find shelter for those of us who are not titled.
Sam: And I had asked for an oolong tea. (laughter)
Sam: This is more of an assam, I would say? A black tea.
Taliesin: This is technically what you do, though, isn't it?
Matt: Devana says, "I'm terribly sorry, I didn't mean that--"
Marisha: No, not you.
Matt: Syldor crosses his fingers together and, "I can give you a letter that will grant you entry to a few of our general storehouses. However, most of you are outsiders and others have been ostracized in their own right."
Taliesin: But you will respect titled entry. Those of us who are court can converse with court.
Matt: "Your title, your court, is unfamiliar with me. I doubt it will hold sway within this town, this city, this entire realm. But you speak of great importance, are you the leader of this troop, he who brings up words of courts and titles?"
Taliesin: For the moment, why not? I will say, I know the Feywild by reputation, and by reputation you are known for your manners, and any kingdom should be measured by manners as the currency that is the easiest to come across.
Matt: "Manners, by the way, are extremely effective in times of peace. This is not one of those times. However, I appreciate that you at least acknowledge the way things sometimes work. So. Daughter. Son. What else do you need of me?"
Liam: Honestly? Nothing.
Laura: We don't need or want anything from you.
Matt: "Yet you still came to my home."
Laura: Oh, well. Yeah. We got what we wanted, which is access to the city.
Liam: We're not here to be friends or rekindle anything, but it seems like we want the same thing, in a roundabout way. We want to end these dragons. We want to return the world to what it once was. Any help you can give in spite of our past, in spite of all the bullshit between us will be appreciated by more than just she and I.
Laura: We know you have no love for us. Think of those you do love. And I hug Velora. Don't you want to make her safe?
Matt: "That's exactly what I intend to do. If you wish to help in that, then so be it. I'll pull what I can within the city. (sighs) Just leave me to my business, please." You see for a moment there, for all the facade, all the front that he puts up, that strong distance facade, you see the fatigue break through, and there's a, like a dark heartbreak. "This is a greater threat than we've ever faced in our lifetime, and many of those in this city have lived quite a while. We have to do things right. Don't be foolish. Too many lives have been lost at the hands of these dragons, some closer than others."
Laura: Do you know of anyone that has traversed more of the Feywild, that would know of what we might expect?
Matt: "One who's seen the most would be the High Warden. I could probably get you passage to see her, but you're going to be heavily guarded." You guys do know the High Warden, Tyrelda is her name, and she is actually of the bloodline of Gynlara who founded Syngorn centuries ago. She currently is essentially the de facto leader, though in terms of public, she is the final decision-maker on most of Syngorn's political and social endeavors. "Will that suffice?"
Liam: It will.
Laura: It will.
Sam: Good day.
Marisha: Good day. (laughter)
Matt: "Curious manners, your friends." He takes his tea and pours another cupful, and leans back in his chair. "Two dragons you say you've killed."
Liam: That's right.
Laura: More than that, isn't it?
Travis: Of the Conclave.
Laura: Of the Conclave, we've killed two.
Matt: "Which ones?"
Laura: Umbrasyl. And. What was the other one?
Liam: Blitzen?
Laura: Blitzen, Donner? What was the name of the other one? Oh, it was General Krieg!
Marisha: Yeah, that one.
Laura: The blue one.
Marisha: And then we've also killed a white one.
Sam: We thought so little of him we didn't even remember his name. (laughter)
Liam: Brimscythe?
Marisha: Brimscythe. That's the one.
Sam: But also we respect him enough to learn his name.
Matt: "Well, your story has charm. I have to admit, I have gotten word of at least one dragon felled on the other side."
Marisha: I pull out a dragon's tooth from Umbrasyl out of my pocket and I toss it to him. That's the result of the doings of your children. You should be very proud.
Matt: "I am proud. I. Am proud. But the city lives differently. Understand the difficulty that your presence puts upon our family with you being here. I mean no disrespect, and it's fine in this trying time. But while you two may have undergone much ridicule in your youth, I saved you from the brunt of it."
Laura: You-- headphones, dear-- you fucked some random woman in a city you passed through, and you expect us to feel sorry for you?
Liam: You should've left us to be with our mother when she died!
Laura: Why? Why pull us away from her if you had no love? We would have been happy with her.
Matt: "Because I had hope that you would be worth more, given that you had my blood in your veins, than to waste away in some small hovel."
Laura: If I could pull the blood of you from my veins and give it back, I would. I want no part of you.
Matt: "There are many things we wish for but we have no choice but to take what we are given and make the best with what we have. Even with this rift, there is still a part of me that cares for you both and is genuinely happy that you live. And that you rise. And that you prove what the rest of these fools in this city said you were incapable of. Yes, I am prejudiced. But I still fight it every day. And I'm not going to lie, every time that my daughter, your half-sister, laughs and plays stealthy Vax and Vex on her own, it makes me smile. You inspire those outside of our city walls with your doings. I think that's rather large of you. As foolish and as damned deadly as some of these endeavors may be, you inspire. That's more than I've done in my lifetime. So. Care not what I think. Care not how your mother died. Just avenge it. For both of us. Show your little sister that you can rise up and destroy whatever comes in your way. Hate me all you want. It's only half-scorn from me. I live with my regrets. I tried to bring you up right. But that upbringing was not right for you. And by the time I tried to return you, it was too late. I'm sorry. That's all I can say." Devana goes, "Anyone want any more tea? Oolong, you said."
Sam: You got it!
Matt: "Right, yes." And she leaves, awkwardly.
Travis: Just so you know, what they did against the dragons was incredible. All of the rest of us were like, "Ah! Oh, we're dying! We don't have anything we can do!" And then they were like "Kill! Stab!" And then--
Marisha: Percy! No, don't die!
Taliesin: What are you doing?
Marisha: I'm being blood out of your jugular, just go with it.
Travis: And then they killed them all! It's the only reason we're alive, really.
Sam: It's true. Vax wanted to go inside the dragon, I was like, no! No, let's do it! (laughter)
Sam: Cut his way out, went back and saved me. Crazy.
Matt: "That does indeed sound quite crazy."
Travis: I mean, the balls on this one-- this one.
Matt: "Let's be honest, Grog. They both have--"
Travis: Lord Grog Peanut Butter of Strongjaw. I'm titled.
Matt: "I'd say they've both proven to have more balls than most of those in our city."
Liam: Look, we're never going to be a happy family.
Matt: "No. That is right."
Liam: But if you want to make reparations, help us on our path. It will only help you on yours.
Matt: He stands up from his chair and walks his way back to his study and closes the door behind him.
Laura: Well, fuck. Guess he's not into us now.
Travis: I thought we weren't getting in a fight!
Taliesin: No, this is good.
Sam: Do you want me to take a dump somewhere?
Taliesin: Not yet.
Laura: Oh, headphones, darling.
Sam: Oh, sorry.
Matt: She pulls your hand down, looks at you, says, "Take a dump!"
Laura: Oh, shit. I mean, shoot!
Matt: "I like him."
Sam: That's gnomish. Doesn't mean the same thing.
Matt: She's now transfixed on Scanlan.
Laura: Darling, he takes blue sparkly poos!
Matt: "Blue sparkle poos? Can you teach me?" (laughter)
Sam: Do you have any blueberries?
Matt: "I'm going to ask my mom if we've got blueberries."
Travis: Holy shit.
Matt: She runs off to the kitchen. A few minutes pass, and Devana comes out holding the tea on the cart and goes, "Who taught my daughter to say 'blue sparkly poo?'"
Laura: I don't know what you're talking about.
Marisha: Is that a swear word?
Laura: You should really control the people in this city from talking about that, because it's weird.
Sam: She got it at preschool.
Taliesin: So many soldiers everywhere.
Matt: "Velora, go to your room."
Marisha: I've never heard a soldier say, "Ah, blue sparkly poo!" I feel like she didn't get that from a soldier.
Taliesin: You've never really been in war, have you?
Matt: The door opens from the far study, and you see Syldor walk back in holding what looks to be a rolled-up piece of paper with a seal on it. He heads over and tosses it onto the table. "That will grant you passage through the city. That will grant you a single meeting with the High Warden. That's the most my power can do at this time."
Laura: This is a belt buckle, why are you passing me this?
Liam: (stage-whispering) We're playing pretend.
Laura: Okay, oh, it's a sealed scroll now.
Taliesin: May I see that really quickly? Don't throw it! Pretend!
Marisha: Pretend. I'm pretend handing it off.
Sam: Ooh, good object work.
Liam: Now get in the canoe!
Laura: Yes, yes.
Taliesin: Right, they're all elves. I can't look at them.
Sam: Oh, it flew away!
Taliesin: This grants an audience for all of us, then?
Matt: "Yes."
Taliesin: You're going to have to amend that one name, though, just to be fair. It's Lady Vex'ahlia.
Matt: "Lady?"
Taliesin: Lady Vex'ahlia, Baroness of the Third House of Whitestone and Grand Mistress of the Grey Hunt. (cheering)
Taliesin: So good sir, despite your relationship with her, do watch your manners.
Sam: Tea spit take!
Matt: "My apologies, Lady Vex'ahlia."
Laura: Well, you didn't know. (laughter)
Matt: You can see, there's confused surprise, but a smile does curl across the corner of his mouth. "I will make the amendment immediately." And he stands back up, takes it from Percival and makes his way back to the room.
Liam: Darth Vader.
Matt: He returns, hands you the amended paper. "Good luck."
Laura: This is a belt buckle-- oh. (laughter)
Matt: It's a gift from your mother.
Travis: You should thank Percy.
Matt: "If you do intend to make your way towards the Shademirk, be careful. Be safe. And if anything comes your way that you feel you are incapable of handling, run. We don't need heroes right now, we need survivors."
Travis: No promises?
Matt: He shoots you a very dark look.
Travis: Right. Sorry. The House of Peanut Butter will continue its bloodline. I don't know.
Matt: "I will send word. Where can I send word to retrieve you when the time is ready for us to attack?"
Sam: Do we have accommodations in the city?
Laura: Yes, but we'll be in Whitestone.
Matt: "I will send word to Whitestone when we plan to return to the Prime Material, and preparing our forces for attack upon Thordak in Emon."
Marisha: If not, reach out to Allura of Emon.
Matt: "I know Allura well, and I can reach to her."
Marisha: I had a feeling you did. (laughter)
Sam: Are you hitting on their dad?
Matt: "Anyway."
Marisha: Does everything look like hitting on people to you, Scanlan?
Sam: It does.
Matt: It's the Scanlan filter. It's on Snapchat.
Marisha: Take off the beer goggles, take them off! Those are plus-two magical beer goggles. Take them off!
Matt: He stands up and at this point Devana enters beside him, puts her hand on his shoulder. He looks to you with his hands crossed before him and goes, "I wish you luck and safe journeys. I appreciate you coming by. It was good to see you both."
Liam: Where did our sister go?
Matt: Turns and Devana goes, "She's in her room for using bad language."
Laura: Poo is a really terrible word to say, I think. Good thing she didn't say any of the other words that she heard in here.
Matt: "Hold on." And she leaves and comes back, this time pushing Velora from the back, and Velora walks up pouting with her arms crossed, holding her little owlbear under her arm.
Liam: Come here.
Matt: She runs up and gives you a big hug. "Are you leaving?"
Liam: Yeah, just for a little bit, though.
Matt: "You just got here!"
Liam: I know. Listen, do me a favor? Keep scraping up those knees, will you? You crawl anywhere you want in this city, the higher the better. And listen to your parents some of the time. But not all of the time.
Matt: "I can already do that."
Laura: Oh, and!
Matt: She gives you a little kiss on the cheek and then runs up and puts her arms around you and almost pushes you back, she's bigger than you remember.
Laura: She is. I pull out one of my owlbear feathers that I picked up with Zahra and I tuck it behind her ear.
Matt: "What's this?"
Laura: It's an owlbear feather. I know! (laughter)
Matt: She steps back down and looks at her little plushie and--
Laura: You keep that behind your ear, and you wear your necklace, and you never forget that Vex and Vax love you very, very much, dear.
Liam: Listen to us. You are not our half-sister. You are our sister.
Matt: She runs up and hugs you both, one in each arm, and then steps back down. "Thank you. Come back soon, please!"
Laura: Of course, come visit me in my baroness... isity.
Matt: She runs back to her mom's side and looks at her mom and goes, "Poo." (laughter)
Matt: Devana rolls her eyes and goes, "Ugh. Thank you. So much."
Liam: Shit's a good word, too.
Matt: Covers her ears.
Travis: Are we doing that now? Penis wiggle! (laughter)
Matt: You see Devana's looking cornered, it's like, (shushing noises). Syldor actually starts laughing. "I hope that's good day, then!"
Sam: Good day.
Laura: Good day.
Travis: Bidet.
Marisha: Good day.
Taliesin: Good day.
Matt: "Good day." And Syldor bows, you all slowly leave the door, and right before the door closes behind you hear a little voice go, "Shit." (laughter)
Matt: "No!" The door closes.
Marisha: We're those terrible-influence side of the family, aren't we?
Laura: I run up and I give Percy the biggest hug. Percival!
Taliesin: It's the gift of smugness, it never goes away.
Laura: Wait, is it real-- no. Was it all just to--
Taliesin: No, I actually, it occurs to me that we did kill two of the three barons of Whitestone the last time that we were there. (laughter)
Taliesin: There's no house and there's no money--
Marisha: It's the one Scanlan burned.
Taliesin: It's the one that Scanlan burned.
Sam: Oh, you're the lady of the house that I burned down.
Taliesin: And there's just a crypt and that's being used for other things, but--
Marisha: But you have a title!
Taliesin: But you do have a title, at the very least. And once a year, you have to do something ridiculous.
Laura: Even so, Percy.
Taliesin: You're welcome.
Laura: I thank you so much.
Taliesin: Use it in good health.
Travis: I lean over to Scanlan and I say, did you notice that their dad was saying "bidet" wrong?
Sam: I did. I did.
Travis: I thought he was like a highfalutin type.
Sam: You should just say it even louder to make sure people know the correct pronunciation.
Travis: I know. We could be a force for good in and outside of the city. Bidet!
Sam: Bidet!
Matt: The guards that are waiting for you outside of the house just sigh very loudly. (sighs)
Travis: Change is hard.
Matt: All right, so you have your parchment. Within the next half-hour or so it's not difficult for you guys to go ahead and find sleeping arrangements for the evening within Syngorn. You're met for the most part with standoffishness and curiosity with your approach, but upon showing the paper there is a sudden realization and a formality that is brought to the conversation, and it's, you can't help but enjoy it, the two of you. You haven't walked through Syngorn and been forcing people to show you the respect you've always wanted, and there is something slightly cathartic about that. But you manage to find accommodations for the evening's rest. The guards proceed up into the secondary floor where your room is kept. Will not enter the room, but notify you that they will be staying outside of the doorway to ensure that both you are protected and that you don't do anything crazy in the night.
Travis: What?
Laura: That's stupid.
Marisha: We're respectable.
Taliesin: It's adorable that they think they could stop us if we tried.
Marisha: I know! Are we all in rooms next to each other, are we in one room?
Matt: It's a series of rooms within what looks like it was at one time a military barracks that has since been renovated. It's not really an inn or tavern; there aren't a lot of travelers that come through Syngorn that don't actually live there or have a home, so it's more being used for storage, but they cleared out an area and they put up beds and it looks-- Syngorn storage room is pretty nice by the standards of like Kymal or Westruun, so it's not too bad.
Taliesin: There's some art nouveau happening. That's all I can really ask.
Marisha: Have they already locked us in our rooms?
Matt: No, you've just gotten to your rooms now, so.
Travis: We're a very religious group and we like to have a family prayer.
Laura: Speaking of, wait. Where the fuck is Pike?
Sam: Oh shit.
Marisha: She was right behind us!
Matt: You all, you all realize in the chaos and the tension of meeting your father--
Liam: Must've gotten lost!
Travis: No, she's here.
Matt: You catch a sudden flicker of divine energy in the space of the hallway near you. The guards step back, looking a bit freaked out and grabbing their weaponry, and you see a burst of Pike's face coming through, her divine form, and she says, "I'm sorry--" (static) Disappears, comes back. "The walls--can't maintain--" And her form vanishes once again.
Travis: Fucking Verizon. (laughter)
Laura: Great, now we'll never have them as a sponsor. Thank you, Travis.
Liam: Go T-Mobile.
Matt: Go AT-- No.
Marisha: So can we have like a little family pow-wow in maybe one of the rooms before we all tuck in for the night and you put the masking tape over each of our doors so we don't sneak into each other's rooms. High school field trip, yeah?
Sam: I don't know any of those words.
Matt: "Do as you wish, we'll be here if you need us."
Travis: Do you need anything, drinks?
Sam: We need to talk to the little fucker.
Travis: Then-- oh, what? Oh, yeah! Well, let's all head inside for prayer.
Laura: Actually--
Taliesin: We'll need food and drink.
Laura: Guard! One of you, could you go get us some food? We're very hungry.
Marisha: And wine? Maybe some wine?
Laura: As a baroness, I'm very used to getting food when I want it.
Matt: One of the guards steps forward and says, "Let me see that parchment once more, please?"
Travis: That's not it.
Matt: That's a belt buckle. (laughter)
Liam: My belt buckle!
Matt: Rolls it back up, hands it back. "I will retrieve your necessary meal, drink, and other requests you may have."
Liam: Chicken, please.
Laura: Thank you. I want anything but chicken.
Matt: "Noted and noted." And he turns around and leaves the three other guards standing outside of your rooms to do about as you please.
Sam: Right, so we pick the biggest room and we all enter it.
Matt: It's a two-bedroom, opposite sides, and there is a window that has a beautiful view of the central lake that sits at the center of Syngorn, the entire city's built around, before it meets the base of the mountain range that it's buttressed against.
Sam: Titicaca.
Matt: That sounds Elvish, but it's not.
Sam: No, I just like saying that.
Matt: Door closes behind you guys.
Travis: Gormidi?
Matt: There's a little flash, a sparkle of arcane light as the satyr form goes, (breathes heavily) "That was a little harrowing. You didn't tell me you were going to bring me into the belly of the beast so soon, we didn't even talk about-- that was really good tea, by the way; that was quite delicious."
Taliesin: You were drinking our tea?
Matt: "Very quietly."
Marisha: I was wondering where my tea went.
Travis: Now, hold on. Did you steal anything while you were in there?
Matt: "No!"
Marisha: Garmelie...
Matt: "No!"
Sam: Insight-check him.
Travis: Insight-check that bitch!
Sam: Natural one. (laughter)
Matt: He is about as hard to read as anyone you've come across in the Feywild.
Marisha: Can I try?
Matt: Sure.
Laura: I feel like we don't need an insight check to know he was lying.
Marisha: Oh, I got a 17. I'm way more better than Scanlan. Natural insight. 28.
Matt: 28. Through his teeth.
Marisha: I do a little entangling underneath of him and start checking his pockets, TSA style. Start giving him the frisk.
Matt: These vines wrap up around his legs and he's like, "Oh, I was just!"
Marisha: Into the pockets.
Travis: Just let it happen.
Laura: Where are the pockets?
Matt: In his vest.
Marisha: In his vest pockets.
Taliesin: There better not be an owlbear in there or I'm going to be very upset.
Matt: No, you reach into one pocket, it's empty. You reach into the other, and your arm goes quite far into the pocket, farther than it should--
Marisha: You little devil.
Matt: "What? This is extremely degrading! We had a deal." It's empty.
Marisha: Is this a pocket of holding? I think about the fancy silverware that I might've seen in Syldor's house.
Matt: Nothing. Just an empty space.
Travis: Come on, keep going.
Marisha: I think of fancy teacups, because he mentioned drinking tea.
Matt: (melodically) Nothing!
Marisha: Goddamn it.
Travis: You've never stolen anything, shit!
Laura: Think of gold. Think of gold, Keyleth.
Taliesin: I cast Friends.
Marisha: I think of gold? Oh, I think of gold. Sorry, I'm not materialistic.
Taliesin: We're going to have to have a working relationship.
Laura: Why do you say that like it was a bad thing?
Marisha: I mean, I'm not. I'm a Barbie girl in a Barbie world. (laughter)
Matt: He smacks the side of your arm and is like, "Get your hand out of my pocket!"
Marisha: Ow!
Liam: Keyleth. Check the fur.
Laura: No, don't check the fur.
Matt: "Excuse me?!"
Taliesin: Let's give him a chance to 'fess up.
Matt: "This is not why we're here to talk. We are here to discuss the elements of our agreement. Two things I require your aid in taking, and then I show you to the outskirts of the Shademirk."
Laura: I feel like now we already know where the outskirts of the Shademirk are.
Matt: "But do you know of the dangers that are on your way?"
Sam: Yeah, you told us about all three dangers that we have to face.
Marisha: That's true. I have them written down. (laughter)
Marisha: The Hut of Wodenna, the Last Camp of Sorudun the Happy, and the theatre.
Matt: "And you think those are all the dangers?! There are so many! It's a dangerous place! Stop touching me!"
Travis: All right, hands off him.
Sam: Just tell us what the two things are we that we need to steal.
Matt: "All right. I require a piece of a threshold crest."
Laura: What the fuck is that?
Marisha: Of a threshold crest?
Liam: Giant stones on the outside of the city.
Matt: "Threshold crest." Which you recall are the blue stones that are in the wall around the city.
Laura: That's the stupidest thing.
Marisha: Oh no!
Matt: "Why is that stupid?"
Laura: Because then they can't go back!
Matt: "You don't have to get it from the wall. I'm sure they build it from something and there might be a reserve somewhere."
Marisha: Right, in the other dimension that they came from. You realize Syngorn didn't originate here in the Feywild, right?
Matt: "I understand, but just..."
Marisha: Oh, lord have-- oh, sweet Sarenrae.
Taliesin: Wait, okay, a threshold-- a piece?
Matt: "A piece of a threshold crest. Just but a sliver."
Liam: The same material?
Matt: "The same material enchanted that is functionally able to be utilized in the same fashion."
Travis: No problem. What else?
Matt: "Great. I also want the High Warden Tyrelda's hat."
Travis: Her hat?
Laura: Do we know what her hat looks like?
Matt: You do, actually.
Laura: What does it look like?
Matt: It's a pointed, small tricorn made of green velvet that she wears when she goes on like excursions outside of the city.
Marisha: Oh my god, she's got a pirate tri-corner hat?
Matt: It's small and very long. Imagine a pirate hat with a little more of an elven sleekness to it.
Laura: Wait, like a Robin Hood hat? Like Peter Pan!
Marisha: Oh my god, like Peter Pan!
Matt: Sure, yeah!
Liam: I wasn't looking forward to this moment, but that actually sounds like fun.
Laura: That's it, that's all you need?
Matt: "That's all! And I will fulfill my side of the deal."
Marisha: I have a vague idea of why you might want a piece of the threshold crest, but why would you want the High Warden's hat?
Matt: "Because I have my reasons."
Taliesin: So. Are you going to give us what you stole now? We have an arrangement.
Matt: "We do have an arrangement."
Taliesin: It's only fair. Come on.
Matt: Reaches into his pocket and pulls out what looks to be a very finely sculpted bronze statue of Syldor that was gifted for essentially his work with Emon and establishing better trade routes between that city and this city. It's basically a good job, salesman of the year award of Syldor's.
Marisha: They stole his Emmy?
Matt: Kind of, yeah.
Laura: No, it's like they stole his gold watch.
Liam: I yoink it out of his hand. I'll take that. I got it right here.
Sam: It's a belt buckle.
Liam: Right on my belt.
Travis: So weird, you pickpocketed the thing that wasn't even expensive.
Laura: Why did you take that?
Sam: He can't help it, he's a klepto.
Matt: "No! It was there and nobody was looking."
Marisha: Because it ultimately doesn't matter. You know how awards work. Come on.
Matt: "Regardless, we have business to tend to. Come, we have a hat to catch!"
Liam: Oh, you want to come along?
Marisha: Oh, hang on, before we all leave. Vex and Vax, what did your dad do back in the day? Because he knows Allura and he talked about knowing Thordak.
Laura: He's an ambassador to the city.
Marisha: Does he have any type of fighting capabilities?
Laura: Ugh. If he does, we never saw it.
Liam: Yeah, he'll bore you to death.
Laura: Yeah, he can talk a lot.
Marisha: Because it sounds like he was a part of the mission to lock in Thordak 11 or so years ago.
Laura: What? No way.
Marisha: He mentioned that he's been down this road before.
Laura: He knows Allura because he knew the Council members. He was the one that sent us off to find...
Liam: He's a traveling salesman that sells politics. He's not anything all that fancy.
Marisha: Well, if he sells politics, there could be a lot in selling war against a dragon. I'm not trying to be a dick, but your father was kind of a dick so I'm just questioning it.
Laura: No, he's an asshole. That's totally fine.
Marisha: I'm not trying to talk shit about your family.
Laura: No, feel free.
Marisha: Okay.
Travis: Y'all should totally fight right now. Just fight in the room while we're all here and take off your clothes.
Marisha: I'm just saying.
Travis: Only way to solve it.
Laura: Totally, totally.
Travis: Yep.
Taliesin: No, that's a very dark and disturbing thought. I'm very impressed.
Marisha: Thank you! I've been learning from you.
Taliesin: Thank you. Now I feel guilty.
Marisha: I don't mean to question to him, he just said a few things that raised a few hairs on the back of my spine.
Laura: Well, maybe we can ask him about it?
Travis: You have hair on your spine?
Marisha: About this time I use Alter Self to go a little half-Minxie and get those-- like when a dog is pissed off and it puffs up the hair, towards Grog.
Matt: She shows you this emerging patch of fur that is like, shh, pushing out the back of her shoulders.
Laura: That's real sexy.
Travis: Pretty sweet.
Laura: Pretty hot.
Taliesin: It is a very fair point, although I would say I think it would be best to talk to Allura about your father rather than talk to him again, I think he's possibly had enough of us for a while.
Travis: So we have the meeting, we go get the tricorn hat from her, like, boudoir and then we go get the crest on the way out, right?
Sam: Maybe we can even find a clue about where this crest thing is from the meeting.
Matt: "Grand! That's a great idea! That's a great idea."
Laura: Should we sleep before the meeting?
Taliesin: I think the meeting is actually tomorrow.
Laura: Yes.
Sam: It just says we get one meeting, I don't think it's been "sheduled" yet. Should we go "shedule" it?
Laura: Let's "shedule" the meeting.
Travis: Or maybe we could send one of the shitty guards to go "shedule" it for us.
Laura: Is he back from getting us food? Oh no, I hope he's not, because I want to send a second one out there.
Sam: Ooh! Because you're a lady.
Laura: Because I'm a baroness.
Travis: I don't think they're going to leave us all alone.
Taliesin: I have made such a terrible mistake. (laughter)
Matt: You go and check, you check the hallway, and the guard hasn't returned and the three suddenly spin around as the door opens.
Laura: Hello! We require a meeting with the High Warden.
Marisha: I do a little gust cantrip from behind the door to make her hair blow in the wind. (laughter)
Matt: "I need to take this with me. To make the meeting schedulable."
Taliesin: Yes, of course.
Laura: "Shedulable."
Matt: "Shedulable."
Travis: Bidet!
Sam: When would we like the meeting? Tonight or tomorrow?
Laura: Tomorrow.
Liam: Tomorrow.
Matt: You guys did wake up about four hours ago?
Liam: Did we?
Sam: Today! Later today.
Taliesin: We'll take the meeting today.
Sam: Right after siesta.
Liam: It's like northern Alaska.
Matt: "Very well. I'll return." He turns around and leaves and the two guards look at each other like, thank god it wasn't us. They both stand at the ready as he goes.
Taliesin: Let that be a lesson to the two of you about making fun of a foreigner's accent. I'm watching you.
Matt: As the door slowly closes.
Taliesin: Schedulable!
Matt: The faun, of which is currently-- Garmelie is up on one of the beds right now, stretched out. "So! What are you waiting for?"
Laura: That's your bed, Keyleth.
Marisha: Aw, man.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Brings up one leg.
Laura: Trinket jumps up on the bed and snuggles in with him.
Matt: "No, don't, ugh!" (bear noises)
Marisha: Aw, they're shedding on it!
Matt: (creak, crash) The bottom cracks and the bed actually falls flat on the ground. The springs destroyed.
Taliesin: It's all right, it's a futon now. It's like college.
Travis: Have we seen any of these threshold crests on our way in?
Liam: Yeah, we walked past some.
Marisha: They're those little blue stones that are keeping the city here.
Travis: Don't say it like it's obvious. I don't pay attention to shit.
Laura: But we just need a sliver of one.
Travis: Right, so like, I could take Vax's head and smash it against one and then pick up the pieces. No, that's a bad thing from your frown.
Marisha: Although Grog doesn't have the worst idea. And I don't mean smashing Vax's head. That's not what I mean. But don't we have some hidden gems, because I'm really terrified if we start hacking away at these stones what might happen.
Laura: They might not be able to return.
Marisha: So maybe we can do something kind of fakey.
Sam: He's in the room. (laughter)
Marisha: Is he asleep? He's asleep, right?
Matt: No, he's currently partially crushed by Trinket on the bed and goes like, "I can hear you!"
Travis: I mean, we have jewels and shit, just stuff hanging around, but what does that do?
Sam: No, how do we know if we can chip a piece off without ruining it?
Laura: I wouldn't risk it.
Liam: I think we should talk to some people and ask a couple of questions around town first.
Laura: Yeah. Maybe somebody, maybe the High Warden knows. Maybe we can sneak it out of there or something.
Liam: Just drop it in passing.
Travis: Ooh! Like a souvenir. "Can we have a piece of your threshold crest?"
Laura: Exactly like that, Grog, exactly like that.
Travis: Shit, I have got all the good ideas today. (laughter)
Travis: I'm the leader. So what do we do until the guard comes back?
Matt: The door opens, the guard comes around with food and hands it out to the rest of--
Laura: Does anybody have money for a tip? Because I think you're supposed to tip them.
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: "You're not supposed to tip your guards." (boof) Slams the door behind.
Marisha: That's an Emon tradition. We're overseas, remember.
Taliesin: I like it here.
Matt: All right. You finish your meal.
Laura: It's delicious!
Matt: And prepare yourselves for an excursion into the city of Syngorn to seemingly steal a piece of the threshold crest and the High Warden Tyrelda's travel hat.
Marisha: I turn into Minxie and resign to the idea that I'm going to be sleeping with Garmelie and Trinket and just cuddle next to them in Minxie mode.
Laura: Are you coming with us, though, Keyleth?
Marisha: Oh, we're not sleeping?
Sam: No. It's like one in the afternoon, so we'll probably just go.
Liam: But you know, blow a couple more spells.
Matt: So that's one use of your beast form.
Laura: Just come on, then.
Marisha: I'll come on.
Liam: Just save it. You can stay like that, just walk close to me.
Marisha: Am I going to freak people out if I walk around like this?
Taliesin: God, I hope so.
Laura: Fuck them, that's what I say.
Matt: All right. You guys make your way outside into the city streets of Syngorn to hopefully wait for the other guard, who returns about ten minutes later to tell you, "It has been 'sheduled.'"
Travis: Ah, very good.
Matt: "As soon as you wish, attend to the central palace and there you will be greeted."
Laura: Okay.
Travis: Yep.
Matt: "Are you leaving now?"
Sam: Yes.
Travis: Well, we waste no time.
Matt: Makes a big whistle and the other guards come down, and collectively you now have four guards watching you guys.
Travis: Four?
Laura: Yeah. There were four of them.
Marisha: I drop Minxie form, because that seems very aggressive.
Sam: As we walk I say to Vax  Oi, Vax. What is the reason for this meeting? When we get in there, what do we say to her?
Marisha: Can we have your hat?
Liam: I don't think we should lead with that. Maybe work our way around to it. Well, I would like advice other than this little hairy man for how to get to the bog.
Laura: And also what we might face.
Liam: Yes.
Laura: And how we can fight what we might face.
Marisha: She might know about Fenthras and the bow.
Laura: Yes, exactly.
Travis: Wait, Scanlan, can't you go invisible too? What if you two little buggers just went off and like found it on your own while we were distracting Captain Fancy Hat.
Sam: Find Fenthras on our own, what?
Travis: Yeah, you go invisible along with Fauny Tim over here and you just go find the fucking hat.
Sam: Oh, the hat.
Travis: Yeah.
Marisha: What if she's wearing the hat? What if the hat is on her head?
Travis: We kill everybody. (laughter)
Taliesin: To be fair, that usually is the plan.
Matt: And thus ended the story of Vox Machina, murdered terribly in the streets of Syngorn by their own people.
Taliesin: Clutching a hat.
Travis: Tarantino film.
Matt: As you guys make your way towards the palace, formulating your plan, we're going to go ahead and take a quick bathroom break here. Guys, about ten, 15 minutes or so, we'll be back here in just a little bit. So use your restrooms, stretch your legs and come back. We'll see you all here in a few minutes. [no audio] (cheering)
Matt: That's a lot of people. Welcome back. First off, I want to say a big thanks to Amanda Mclean for making our awesome graphic for our intermission, thank you Amanda, appreciate that. (cheering)
Matt: We are back. Brought to you by Loot Crate. Let's dive back in, as you guys make your way through the city of Syngorn towards the palace to what would be the northern side of the city. Eventually you come upon the large, slightly swirling stairs that lead to the front of the large brass and ivory surrounded doorway that leads to the interior. You guys have not actually been inside this palace before; you've only seen it from a distance, as your father would not let you in too close to the center of the city. As you make your way up the stairs, you can see guards, the Verdant Guards step out in an aggressive and defensive way, but the guards to your sides immediately put their hands up and signal them to put their arms down and to stand at ease. You guys are brought to the front, the doors open, and a small elderly elvish gentleman comes out, his long white hair almost touching the ground as he shuffles up. He brings a small monocle up to the side of his face. "Yes? Do you have business in the palace?"
Liam: G'day mate.
Marisha: Good day.
Laura: We do. We have a meeting with the High Warden Tyrelda.
Matt: "Let me see your papers. Oh, I see they're right here. Very well. Follow me, please." He turns around and walks his way into the building. You all follow suit and are led through the main entryway to the palace itself. On the inside you can see these giant archways that the pillars that hold them up look like trees that spread to the top like the stone boughs actually hold a canopy made of marble with beautiful portraits and long artistic renditions of the creation of Syngorn, the people, each bloodline that has progressed and taken on the central political structure of the city. As it goes, you can see busts of people who have been of historical importance to Syngorn, and eventually you're brought to the very end of this hallway. Amongst a series of other offshoot hallways and doors, there is the next portion of this journey, this large central chamber. The door is already partially ajar. You are led into what seems to be the equivalent of a throne room, but it appears that there is a half-circle table in the center of the room and a series of chairs that now sit empty across from one side. Your side. The other side of the table, you see sitting quietly and patiently, an older elven woman, you can see the grey in her hair and the crow's-nests at the corner of her eyes, which in elven years means she's quite old, she's probably close to 150 or 200 years old, by your gathering. They can live quite a long time. She would be in the equivalent of her late 50s.
Sam: Not old enough for our party to kill mercilessly.
Matt: No, that's a whole different gauge.
Liam: Throwback Thursday.
Laura: Is she wearing a hat?
Matt: She is not wearing a hat.
Travis: Shit. All right, she lives.
Matt: The guard behind ushers you guys forward toward the chairs. You all get the idea that you should sit.
Sam: We sit.
Matt: All right.
Marisha: Are there chairs for all of us?
Matt: There are chairs for all of you but Trinket, who currently, one of the guards is helping to put his hands out in front to keep back, like.
Laura: No.
Liam: That's a good way to lose a finger.
Laura: I wouldn't mess with him if I were you, just to be safe. And I walk up and I give Trinket a kiss on the nose and I put him in his Pokeball.
Matt: The guard leaps back for a second. "That's much easier."
Laura: Just watch closely, buddy.
Matt: You step back, you all find your seats.
Laura: Just talking to my boobs. No big deal.
Liam: Buddy, buddy. (laughter)
Matt: This meeting room pavilion, and as you all have your seat, you see the High Warden waiting there patiently, smile on her face but definitely an expression that shows both intelligence and guard. As you all sit, she looks about the group, asks, "So you've all come and made arrangements to meet with me. You've come quite a ways and with very short notice. I'm curious as to what your reasonings are. Please, state your business."
Liam: You probably recognize the two of us even if you don't know us. We're Syldor's children. This is my sister Vex'ahlia. I'm Vax'ildan.
Matt: "Strange. It has been some time since you've been within the city. Welcome."
Liam: Thank you.
Laura: We're back because we're searching for a certain bow, Fenthras? Said to be within the Murk something?
Liam: Bog of Eternal Stench, I believe.
Marisha: Shadowmurk Bog. That's the one.
Matt: "The Shademirk?"
Marisha: Shademirk. That's it.
Liam: It's not on a lark. We're not a bunch of fly-by-nights. We've already stopped to see Vex's and my father. Over the last several months, we have been dealing, a little more closely than most would want, with the Conclave, these dragons. We know that you are struggling to do the same. We have felled two of them, and I don't say that to brag, just to impress upon you how serious we are. We've come a long way, and we are in need of help. Thank you, darling. I think that the city's intentions are in the best possible place. Brings me a great deal of personal satisfaction, actually. I would like to offer our aid in service of the very same purpose, and that bow, in my sister's hands, will go a long way to felling more of these beasts.
Matt: "Well. You stroll in here with a great deal of arrogance and an air of self-importance. Not in a way that is negative, more in a way that means you aspire, and I hope, not reaching beyond your means. If you have indeed felled these two members of the Conclave as you say, then perhaps this errand to the Shademirk is not as dangerous as one would expect. I would not deny you this, and if you indeed have these capabilities, you should have no issue surviving the Mirk, you and your companions."
Laura: Syldor sent us here because he said you would know what we might face in the Shademirk.
Matt: "Well. The Shademirk, as far as I understand, was once a very beautiful landscape. That once was the fountain heart of the Gilded Run that provided the flowing rivers that spun throughout this entire region. There was an archfey many years before who was turned on by his beloved, who had been growing so spiteful, so full of angst and anger and vengeful thoughts that it turned his heart dark and black and he began to spill into the fen around him. It was there that these lands became the Shademirk. It was there that he became one with the land and corrupted it and turned it. Dryads turned foul and shadowed. Other creatures began to crawl up from the bog itself, and to this day feed off the life of those they can reach. The only thing that holds its spread at bay is the Gilded Run, the rapids. Now, it's found balance, and we watched it spread, as those who've lived here for a long time do. It does not force any sort of immediate threat to any of us, and it serves its own purpose. It has its new-- I shouldn't say new, it's been hundreds of years now-- but its own life, its own biome. And we could not be ones to mess with that, if you will. But it is dangerous, and it is, for those who have scouted far enough to see it, say it is akin to wading through an oil slick. It is to walk into a hungry swamp that never gives up its need to feed."
Laura: Sounds lovely.
Matt: "Yes, quite."
Laura: You say you've lived here. I know the city goes back and forth between the Feywild. Do you travel more freely?
Matt: "I haven't in my older years. When I was younger, perhaps. It is important to maintain an idea of the current state of the Feywild. Every few decades, perhaps every generation, just to be certain when we have to undergo this transition that we don't come into the middle of a war zone in its own right. But I grow tired in my older years, and find myself chained to politics more often than not."
Laura: How did you make that transition so easily? I know that the threshold crests are how the city gets around. (laughter)
Matt: "Well, there are thin areas between the planes, there are doorways, and we have magical means to send small scouting parties between this veil."
Sam: Go on.
Laura: Well, I don't want to be a bother, yes, but. Do they entail any part of those threshold crests? I'm wondering because perhaps we might find ourselves in need of traveling, as well.
Liam: We know we're strangers. But we read much wisdom and experience in your eyes, and it would seem that you have encountered this place yourself, or have experience in the past with those who have, and we're just looking for an edge, really.
Matt: You make a persuasion check.
Laura: Oh, do I want to roll this one or do I want to roll--
Travis: Oh, just pick one.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: The ever-plight of Laura Bailey.
Laura: Ooh! That's a good, that's a good, I'm glad I switched!
Travis: There are 300 fucking dice on this table.
Laura: 27.
Liam: Ooh.
Matt: "We have refined the art of creating the threshold crests. We have personalized enchantments that can be utilized for our trained spies, our trained guides, our trained scouts. We keep them under lock and key, but when an endeavor requires the transference between planes, we do on occasion allow these to go into the hands of our greatest guides."
Laura: If a party would be in search of an item that would be of great use to your survival, would that be worthy?
Liam: Listen, we know we're bastards.
Laura: Stop bringing up the bastard part!
Liam: Clearly. Look into my eyes, we share the same goal. Half of my blood is yours. I want to kill the threat to your city and to all cities. I ask with complete humility. I know what I'm asking. Please.
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Laura: Which one? Him or me?
Matt: Him.
Laura: Fuck, can I give him advantage, can I help him?
Liam: Using Luck.
Matt: No, he's got Luck. He has his own.
Laura: Come on, you motherfucker.
Liam: Ouch. I rolled the same thing. Low number twice. No, that's a big five.
Laura: Wait, no, everything's ten. I thought everything was a ten!
Liam: No, that's right, you're right. So that is a--
Laura: 12.
Liam: No, 13.
Sam: Oh, that's better.
Matt: It's better.
Laura: Why did you talk? I think she would've listened to me. (laughter)
Matt: "I appreciate your intent, and I understand that our current paths will hopefully align in the near future. However, such artifacts are very important to us and the business within Syngorn, and I mean no offense in saying that you are no longer residents of our city. As such, no, I cannot provide you with these crystals. However, when the time comes, and you retrieve this bow which you say you seek, I hope that we can count each other brethren on the battlefield."
Travis: Can I look around the room? Are there any doors open, ajar, leading into a bedroom with a hat on a rack?
Matt: Make a perception check, Grog.
Sam: Are there any guards in here with us?
Matt: Yeah, the guards have led you in, they're just back by the front door you entered.
Taliesin: There's a hat rack and a Starbucks, that's what's in the room right there. It's a hat rack and a Starbucks.
Travis: 19. Natural.
Liam: I'm rusty on my rules. That should've been a 17.
Matt: What'd you roll?
Liam: I rolled a three, but because of reliable talent, anything lower counts as a ten. Ten plus my persuasion of seven is 17. I'm just rusty.
Matt: I understand. Same answer. (laughter)
Liam: That is racist!
Matt: No, that is a very closely guarded item that would've required a roll of 20 or higher to succeed.
Liam: The whole time I was like, that seems wrong to me; that it's so low.
Matt: Yeah man, reliable talent's good for that reason.
Laura: Why did your luck suck that time?
Matt: It's all right. Grog, glancing about the room, your suddenly strangely keen giant eyes in an elvish realm, you who can read patterns in rock and mountain faces, but when looking at finely crafted marble it's just a big mess. You see at the very back of the chamber what appears to be an imprint into one of the sculptures, one of the almost silver and brass latticework that tends to look like climbing roots and vines across the back of the room. There is a door that is recessed within that, though it's hidden in the sculpture itself. "Now. Unless you have other business?"
Sam: I have a little bit of business.
Matt: "Yes."
Taliesin: Good, carry on. Sorry.
Sam: Everyone who meets me knows I am a collector of hats. (laughter)
Sam: I take out my beret and I put it on and I say, why, this one was a very special beret I got by defending Whitestone against an invasion of vampires, singlehandedly freeing the city from the scourge.
Matt: "That sounds entirely believable."
Sam: Yes. It's a fine garment woven by a master craftsman. I hear you have a fine hat, as well, that you've been seen wearing about town. Is that true?
Taliesin: I wish I could say this isn't true, but it's actually true. He is genuine.
Matt: "I have been known to have a few garments based on where I'm going, yes."
Sam: As a fine appreciator of the haberdasher arts-- (laughter)
Sam: A connoisseur, really. Could you humor an old gnome like me and show me... I hear tell of a green hat. A tri-tip hat, right?
Marisha: I thought it was blue.
Sam: Blue hat?
Marisha: Might be green.
Taliesin: He's also colorblind, I should mention.
Sam: Tri-tip, triangular-- I just hear it's fantastic, I've never seen one quite like it up close. I was wondering if I could take a look-see.
Matt: Make a deception check.
Sam: With disadvantage.
Matt: Yeah, because you didn't sleep.
Marisha: Yeah, you didn't sleep, Scanlan!
Sam: Well, that was a natural 20. But the first one was a six. Luckily, it's plus 14, so 20. (laughing and cheering) [no audio]
Matt: Bards! "From political requests to a hat collector, this is indeed a very strange afternoon in the palace. Yes, I can have one of my servants show you."
Sam: Thank you so much, it would mean so much to me. I've never met a hat I didn't like.
Matt: "Then I am certain you will be fulfilled."
Sam: Should we just wait here, or is it going to be a while?
Matt: "No, I'll have a servant bring you up." And she puts her hand up and the guards open the door and you see a servant walk out who looks to be a younger elven man. Actually probably about the age of Vax there. Short tattered hair comes across in front of his eyes. He enters. "Yes, mother?" "Could you please show this strange little gnome man to the hat room?" "Yes, of course. Yes. Follow me."
Sam: There's a hat room? I have a hat room in my place, too!
Matt: "That's splendid. Now, is there any other business?"
Taliesin: Just to be clear, you would say that the river is probably our safest mode of entry into the bog?
Matt: "It surrounds the bog and runs past the southern portion of it, so you'll most likely come upon the river one way or another. Lest you wish to traverse the Green Sea, but that I would not recommend, either."
Marisha: So there's no real easy way into the bog, is what you're saying?
Matt: "There's no easy way to anything in the Feywild, my child."
Marisha: Got it.
Laura: Have you seen the tree yourself?
Matt: "I have not."
Taliesin: Are there river men who run boats on the river?
Matt: "No, the river tends to run itself." (laughter)
Taliesin: I had that coming. That's fair.
Travis: That's good.
Matt: "Do you wish to inquire about my shoes? My coat perhaps..."
Marisha: Oh my god, they're so cute, though. They're amazing shoes. I didn't notice them until you pointed them out, sorry. No, continue on.
Matt: "Is that all?"
Taliesin: I think that's all, yes.
Matt: "All right. Good luck. I wish you safe--"
Marisha: Oh, wait, wait, lady!
Sam: High Warden, High Warden.
Marisha: High Warden. I'm sorry. I was just curious. It's my first time to Syngorn, and it's in the Feywild. It's special, right? Is there a gift shop? A visiting the temple and sights of Syngorn type of shop?
Sam: I went to Syngorn and all I got was this lousy shirt?
Marisha: Right!
Laura: We have to make that shirt!
Liam: Shirt after this one.
Matt: "I'll see what Braum can do. Braum, please escort them to some semblance of a gift shop."
Marisha: Oh, thank you!
Taliesin: Good luck.
Matt: "Now, I have important business to tend to. Good luck. Safe travels. Don't die. Let us see each other on the battlefield soon to slay a dragon. Now, please, be on your way."
Laura: We appreciate your time.
Matt: You guys get up and leave, Trinket goes--
Laura: Trinket's in my necklace.
Matt: That's right, Trinket is in your necklace, so Trinket does nothing.
Laura: Trinket does nothing but stare outside of the necklace.
Matt: You make your way out of the room, the guards following suit. You can see the lightish brownish reddish tousled hair of the elven boy who's waiting, he's wearing very fine clothing, though very baggy on his scrawny frame. As you all step out, he says, "All right, so, I'm to take you to the hat room, I believe. Oh, you're going to be very happy. It's quite the room."
Sam: The room I could care less about, it's those hats!
Matt: "Well, I think you'll still be pleased. Are you all coming?" (noises of agreement)
Liam: Traveling with Scanlan, we've all become amateur hat enthusiasts.
Laura: I pull out my hat and I put it on.
Travis: Yep, I pull out the rhinoceros horn.
Liam: (gong) (laughter)
Matt: And he pulls out a little masquerade mask and goes like, "Oh my goodness!"
Sam: You're a hatter, too!
Marisha: Do you get the monthly newsletter?
Matt: "Well, I used to, until we came to the Feywild. It's very boring these days. Well, come, please!" And he darts off excitedly down the hallway. The guards groan loudly behind you. You make your way through the second hallway on the left of the palace, down a flight of stairs into a storage room. To the left you can see what looks to be the entrance to some sort of a heavily barred metallic doorway, about ten feet wide, about 12 feet tall. Further down you come to two doorways. He pulls out a keyring, goes, "No, not that one. Ah, here we are." It opens up into a small room, you can see in here, it's a display room. In here you can see ornamental armor and helmets and all sorts of classic Syngorean designs, which change often because, well, elves when they don't have a lot of things to fill their time with, it's all about designing new outfits and new armor. There's a whole display of very classic designs for the guards, for the watchers, for the people who first founded Syngorn. It's like a history walk through. But there is a section that is primarily helmet designs for different stations and, "This is as close to a hat room as we have. This here is part of the original Temple of Ioun design. It is a delightful piece." He keeps going on and on.
Laura: Do we see the hat that we're looking for in here?
Matt: You do see there is a small rack to the side which is for more just things that are used and you can see there are like wide-brim, rainy-day, carriage-driving hats, you can see there are far-brimmed cloak hoods that are used for horse-riding beneath the rain, you can see there are a few more curved up to one side archer-based hats, and you can see there a nice green velvet hat that is resting across.
Liam: Is that the one area with hats?
Laura: Are they all just jumbled in together?
Matt: They're all jumbled in together in that corner and then the actual helmets are against the wall in different setups.
Liam: Go ahead.
Laura: I nudge Vax and I point it out.
Liam: Scanlan, look at all those codpieces across the room!
Laura: Are the guards in here with us?
Matt: They are, yes.
Laura: I prat-fucking-fall. I pratfall right in front of the guards, on the opposite side of the room.
Matt: Which one?
Laura: I walk to the other side of the room and I just fall over.
Liam: Eat shit, knock shit over.
Matt: Make a perform check.
Laura: Oh, shit. Can it be acrobatics, though?
Matt: No, acrobatics is avoiding the fall.
Laura: Shit. Okay. 19?
Matt: 19!
Laura: I want to take some shit down with me.
Matt: And you do, delightfully so. You fall over, trip, go into a tumble, grab arm over pieces of metallic armor, (crashing sound).
Laura: Ah, oh god, did you see that--
Marisha: Oh my god, Vex, are you okay?
Laura: I think there was a marble on the ground.
Marisha: Oh no, what? Keyleth turns to the guard. (laughter)
Marisha: That was Lady Vex'ahlia, the Baroness of Whitestone. I could sue you! I could sue you for negligence.
Matt: Make a sleight-of-hand check.
Sam: Hold on, he's making a check.
Liam: 24.
Matt: All right. You take the hat. You place it away. Everyone seems to be focused on the currently yelling Vex'ahlia--
Laura: Ow, I think I hurt my wrist!
Marisha: You will get a letter from me, good sir. You will get a letter, okay?
Matt: "This was, look, I apologize if your friend is clumsy, but this wasn't part of our job description, okay, it's been a very--"
Marisha: Your five-star review just went to a four, okay? I just want to say.
Matt: Braum pushes his way in and goes like, "I am so terribly sorry. I didn't mean-- I hope this hasn't ruined your opinion of the hat room."
Laura: If we could just see a gift shop, I would be thrilled.
Travis: And I say to the side, I go, (coughs) pinch my knee, is that the one?
Marisha: What?
Matt: "Are you feeling all right, sir?"
Travis: Yeah, no, (coughs) pinch my knee if that's the one. No, to the little, to the little satyr.
Taliesin: Let's just find a gift shop, Lady Tyrell doesn't need to hear anything about this. Let's just move on.
Matt: "Lady who?"
Marisha: High Warden Tyrelda.
Sam: High Warden Tyrelda.
Taliesin: Tyrelda.
Sam: Yes, well, there's another lady named Lady Tyrell, who's...
Taliesin: No, this is amazing what my handwriting does.
Liam: What did you put in that tea, Percival?
Matt: "Well, I'm glad to see this hasn't ruined your opinion of the collections here."
Liam: Just the safety codes, really.
Marisha: If you took us to the gift shop, it might fix things. Okay?
Matt: "Then come, come! You two clean this up!" And the two guards go, "What?" "Yes, my lord." And the two guards eye you very intensely as they walk over and start picking up all the pieces of armor--
Laura: Ow!
Marisha: I start pretending like I'm doing a Cure Wounds spell to her wrist, you know?
Matt: All right. As you guys make your way out, with two of the guards now; two of them are now left behind.
Taliesin: As we walk out, I just make sure the two guards are, I hope this didn't interrupt your schedules for today.
Sam: "Shedule."
Taliesin: Yes, schedule.
Matt: Somehow their chin goes higher. It's impressive, really. You make your way through, down another set of hallways, back towards the beginning of the palace, he goes, "It's not really a gift shop, the closest thing that we could ascertain based on your request is, we do have a small collection of gifts and knick-knacks we've received from allies over time that really aren't much use to us."
Marisha: Wait, you're taking us to the lost and found? Please! This is the high baroness Lady Vex'ahlia!
Matt: "Perhaps you'll find something you like."
Laura: No, lost and found is a wonderful place to go.
Matt: "It's a combination lost and found and just... gifts from political allies that didn't understand the High Warden's aesthetic. Yes, no, please, this way please." And he leads you back to the main hallway you guys walked through, a little ways towards the entrance, and then another hallway to the left, he unlocks and this is straight-up like a dark storage room, it is just boxes and boxes that are sealed and he lights a small lantern on the side. It flickers to life, and the flame itself, as opposed to a low oil lantern flicker is like a bright glowing light, you can see this is a magically set lantern, as most of the lights in the city are just everlit torches or things that flicker on and off as a light spell. It illuminates the room around you and you can see no one's walked in here in a while.
Liam: These are for sale?
Matt: "No, these are for the taking should you wish."
Laura: Awesome.
Sam: Well, what do we see?
Matt: Go ahead and make an investigation check.
Marisha: Can I ask a logistical question?
Matt: Sure.
Marisha: Is Garmelie with us or did we leave him behind?
Matt: You don't know.
Marisha: What?
Taliesin: You don't know.
Sam: Grog might know.
Liam: 18.
Marisha: Grog.
Laura: 19.
Matt: 18, 19, are you searching, Grog?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: What'd you get?
Travis: Nine. (laughter)
Marisha: Wait, is this an investigation?
Laura: Come on, natural 20!
Marisha: Natural one.
Liam: Oh, propeller beanie!
Matt: Keyleth is distracted by the pretty light in the fixture.
Sam: Natural one. (laughter)
Matt: Scanlan comes up next to her and is equally distracted by this wonderful magical light. Like two moths to a flame. Percival?
Taliesin: Nine.
Matt: Nine. All right. The two twins, you guys spend some time looking through the nearby riffraff and Braum is in the back, hoping you find something to satiate your need for gifts. The twins find their way through a few boxes, and you open up and there's small porcelain dolls, dressed up in ancient Emon's outfits and designs. You can see what looks to be very dusty Kraghammer designed weaponry, you can see what looks to be a bunch of small game pieces that half of them have been lost, like a chessboard of some kind, but only part of it's there. This is really the junk room. This is where all the really bad Christmas presents get put every year. "No, thanks, it's great!"
Sam: Is it like Storage Wars, where there might be something?
Matt: It could, it could be depending on how well you search.
Sam: Well, I searched terribly.
Matt: You did.
Marisha: Keyleth starts talking up Braum. Braum?
Matt: Okay. Braum.
Marisha: Braum. So, Braum. Where're you from?
Matt: "Syngorn?" (laughter)
Travis: Good start.
Sam: We don't have to distract him, he said it's all for the taking.
Marisha: Oh, it's all for-- really, oh.
Sam: No, that's fine, we don't have to.
Marisha: You didn't see any distraction. You didn't see anything.
Matt: "I am so confused by all of you."
Laura: Can I try to do an arcana check to see if there's anything magic in the room?
Matt: Sure. Make an arcana check.
Travis: I'll join you. Two.
Laura: Oh shit, I just rolled off the table. How did I do that? 16.
Matt: Your untrained, though natural arcane instincts reveal to you that--
Laura: I can speak with animals.
Matt: Yes, you can. And there are no animals here. Nothing even remotely magical seems to cross your attention span, unfortunately, and you guys spend a good hour in here sifting through--
Liam: As, as we're digging in the corner, I say, I thought maybe coming back here I might like this city a little bit better, and I was fucking wrong.
Laura: This place fucking sucks.
Sam: Let's get out of here.
Travis: Yeah, there's nothing in here.
Sam: No, let's leave.
Marisha: Okay, yeah, sure. Yeah.
Travis: Let's go.
Taliesin: Pick something pretty.
Marisha: Your four-star rating just went down to a three.
Taliesin: I am picking something random from the room.
Marisha: And I'll also pick something random out of spite. I'll take this.
Matt: You have a fine tobacco box at your disposal now, Keyleth. You can write that down.
Marisha: I like it. I chose it on purpose.
Matt: Percy, you find half of a jeweler's kit.
Taliesin: That's perfect.
Marisha: That's awesome.
Taliesin: I am excited. Was it literally cut in half, like literally?
Matt: Half the supplies are there.
Marisha: And did you say I had a half a tobacco box? Or no, just a tobacco box?
Matt: You had an older tobacco box.
Marisha: An old tobacco box. All right. Yeah, sure.
Matt: Braum at this point goes, "I hope you've all found something you liked."
Laura: All right, I grab something random, too. I mean, if we're all doing it.
Matt: All right. You reach into the Syngorean Wal-mart gift bag on the way out.
Liam: Come on, secret Santa.
Laura: Come on. Roll for value.
Matt: No. I'll do that.
Laura: No whammies.
Matt: You bring out what looks to be a really intricately carved music box made of dark wood.
Laura: Ooh, that's neat.
Matt: As you shake it, you hear (ting-ting) little remnants of the last winding come through, and it seems to still play.
Laura: Mine. I'm writing it down.
Travis: All right, I want to reach in and grab something out of there too. All right, fine!
Matt: You reach in and you pull out a potato. (laughter)
Matt: But it's been there for a while, so like the roots are growing out and everything.
Liam: Oh, with leaves coming out of it.
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: I take a bite out of it.
Matt: That is a stale potato.
Liam: Make a constitution check.
Marisha: Keyleth takes the potato. Okay, give it to me, give it to me.
Travis: Oh here you go. And I squash it in my hand.
Matt: (squelch) up the sides of it. Braum goes, "If you could clean that up?" And the guard goes aww and starts picking up the potato chunks off the ground.
Laura: We're down to one!
Liam: Hey gang, I feel like we've lost focus here. (laughter)
Liam: Maybe we should--
Sam: --get out of here.
Laura: Oh, do we find any broken threshold crests?
Matt: You do not.
Laura: Damn it.
Marisha: Okay, wait, do we find any pictures of threshold crests? Or a postcard?
Matt: Nope.
Taliesin: We're fine.
Laura: All right.
Travis: We leave.
Marisha: We'll just go.
Sam: We got the hat.
Taliesin: We have a plan.
Matt: Braum leads you out of the room, closes and locks it behind, you guys walk back to the hallway that split off, you go past the large metal door again, find your way up into the foyer area at the front of the palace, he goes, "Well, I hope I've been of help to you. I hope I've delivered your interest in seeing our fine selection of helmets and hats here in Syngorn?"
Sam: I am more than satisfied. I will write a five-star review.
Matt: "I don't know what any of that means, but I assume that's good, and I thank you for that. Goodbye."
Laura: Thank you.
Taliesin: Charming.
Marisha: Good day.
Laura: Good day.
Matt: The guard that was cleaning the potato follows suit, you guys now have two guards, the other two have not returned. So you have two guards following you.
Travis: I don't know if you guys noticed, but there was this recessed door up in the queenie's room, but I don't know if maybe she would have some fancy stuff back there. Can't shake these guards.
Sam: Well, some of us could slip in anyway, but what do you think we will find there?
Travis: Well, I don't know. I just noticed, because I wasn't paying attention to all the talking.
Marisha: I think Percy and I can fake them out.
Sam: Fake them out? What do you mean, fake them out?
Marisha: Wait, is he around? Don't say it out loud.
Taliesin: There's no fake. It's not faking. I've got a plan. It's not fake, I've got a plan. It's a good plan. But we should sit, recuperate, go somewhere quiet and figure out how we're getting to the bog.
Marisha: How long have we been awake at this point?
Matt: You mean since you guys woke up this morning, I'd say six hours?
Laura: That's it?
Travis: We don't want to go try and bust one of the crests we already saw?
Laura: We could seriously like fuck it up, what if they can't get back?
Travis: Who gives a fuck?
Laura: They have an entire army to help fight Thordak.
Travis: I didn't think that far ahead, I'm sorry.
Sam: Well, Vex, they could repair it; they have magicians here and stuff.
Travis: Thank you, Scanlan.
Taliesin: How do you repair a--
Sam: With arcane juju.
Laura: You make a very good point. A very good point.
Marisha: But they said they got these stones from the other side, from our realm.
Laura: Maybe we should just go fucking check them out.
Liam: The two guards are here to whole time, right?
Matt: Yes.
Liam: Yeah. We should really go take a nap, I think we should go take a nap.
Laura: This dusk is really making me--
Matt: Vex. You hear muttered under the breath of one of the guards, "Thank god." (laughter)
Matt: Very low; nobody else hears it.
Marisha: I've got plenty of energy.
Laura: I mean, is, is anyone else super duper tired? Are you guys tired?
Marisha: I'm--
Marisha: Tired.
Taliesin: Tired.
Marisha: So tired.
Laura: I look at the guards. I mean, are you guys tired? I mean, how do you even know what fucking time it is, right?
Marisha: Right?
Matt: "Do you wish to be escorted to your quarters, then?"
Laura: I would love to get some sleep.
Matt: "Please follow us." And they both lead on, leading you back to the rooms you guys had set for the evening's rest. Eventually you get to your rooms, the guards stay stationed outside, and you are led into your individual spaces.
Laura: There's windows though, yeah?
Matt: Yes.
Liam: And the guards leave us in our rooms, obviously.
Matt: Yes.
Marisha: So wait, are we all in our own individual rooms?
Taliesin: We have earrings, we could just talk on the earrings.
Matt: You all go into a room together, then.
Laura: Super duper happy, all together.
Matt: You have four rooms at your disposal and you all say, we're going to go sleep, and all go into one room with a broken bed.
Sam: We're a close-knit family.
Liam: You can make your own assumptions.
Marisha: We can go into our own rooms and I can fix it if we don't want to tip people off.
Sam: No, we do what we want.
Travis: Yeah, we're fucking close, man.
Matt: All right, you guys all enter the largest room where you met before, and as you all find your way in there, one of the guards goes, "You're going to sleep--"
Marisha: It's for prayer. We have to pray. Remember, right, Grog?
Travis: Oh yes, we're very holy.
Laura: Yes, it's been quite a while. I'm rather hungry.
Sam: We all sleep together; it's a polyamorous thing. (laughter)
Travis: I told you we were holy.
Matt: Scanlan and Vex, make deception checks, please.
Laura: Perception?
Matt: Deception.
Liam: Deception.
Laura: Deception. Oh. Ten?
Sam: 21.
Liam: (cackles) That's the lie that goes through.
Matt: When you say you're tired and ready to rest, the guard goes, "Mm-hm." And then when you say polyamorous, the guard goes, "Oh." (laughter)
Sam: Yeah, man. We are freak-ay.
Liam: I grab Grog by the circlet thing and say, come on, I'm tense. Let's go. (laughter)
Matt: The two guards, the two guards look at each other and take two steps away from the room. "We'll keep a close watch."
Marisha: Keyleth says, we're totally polyamorous--
Taliesin: You! No!
Marisha: And I turn Percy and Vax into squirrels with Polymorph. See? Polyamorous.
Matt: The two guards look at each other, very disturbed and say, "You've already shared too much, we don't judge, just please go 'sleep'." They both hold their blades at the ready, both just like, "What is my life right now?" All right.
Sam: We may need you to clean up for us later.
Matt: "Please! Go! Sleep!" You guys are now closed off inside your room.
Laura: And the squirrels.
Matt: As squirrels. What are you going to do?
Marisha: Okay, I drop Polymorph. That's what polyamorous means, right, guys?
Taliesin: Yes.
Marisha: Okay.
Sam: Garmelie, show thyself.
Matt: He appears and goes like, "Was that true?" (laughter)
Matt: He has his sketchbook at the ready and is like, "Because I mean..."
Taliesin: No. No.
Sam: You don't know.
Matt: "Well." He closes the book. "So. I believe someone here took a hat?"
Liam: I might have a hat for you. The other adventure didn't turn out so well, and I really want to give you this hat. I'm wondering-- fuck it, I don't have anything to say, take the fucking hat.
Matt: And he puts it on. It's a little small. But he goes, "Ah, it's fine." Smiles back.
Liam: So worth it.
Laura: Yeah. That was definitely worth it.
Matt: He seems extremely proud and happy that this hat is now in his possession. "One of two. Now, the second part."
Sam: Any ideas there, Garmelie?
Matt: "No."
Laura: You passed by those threshold crests several times, I'm assuming.
Taliesin: Let me get this straight, Garmelie. You require of us a piece of a threshold crest.
Matt: "Yes."
Taliesin: Any threshold crest.
Matt: "Yes!"
Taliesin: Just as long as it's a threshold crest.
Matt: "Yes!"
Marisha: And looks like a crest.
Taliesin: It's a threshold crest.
Matt: "A threshold crest."
Taliesin: Okay, Keyleth. The thing we talked about.
Marisha: And I start casting Stone Shape right under the threshold of the door to the room that we're in, and I cut out a crest from the threshold.
Matt: What crest do you create? What does it look like?
Marisha: A Whitestone crest. From the threshold of the door.
Taliesin: We break it.
Marisha: There's a piece of your threshold crest. (laughing and cheering)
Taliesin: Don't cast Friends on people. It's not nice.
Matt: You watch as his ears, his pointed ears slowly slink back and his hair stands up all across the back of his head, his beard almost bristles out into spines as the hat goes (poink) and pops off and hits the ground. He snatches it up. Grabs the piece.
Taliesin: That's your threshold crest. Piece of a threshold crest.
Matt: "Thank you."
Laura: Yay!
Matt: "Well, it appears that our deal has been kept." (laughing and cheering)
Matt: He snaps his fingers and you feel like this sudden, this almost unnoticeable pressure at the base of your neck that you had felt since you made the deal release and absolve, on both of you. "All right, so. Well, at least I got the hat out of it. So. The Shademirk, then? Come, follow me, grab your things." (laughs)
Marisha: Let's go.
Taliesin: I cannot wait.
Matt: "Now." He vanishes. And Grog, you feel a little tug on your finger to pull you forward.
Travis: I fart. (laughter)
Matt: "I had that coming. We now have even more of a reason to make haste. This is a very small room, and I've been following behind him for quite some time. Let's go. Now, quickly." And you see Grog being pulled forward by the finger, and you guys get the feeling that he's leading you out of the city, invisible, by Grog's finger.
Travis: We're going this way. Follow me, chaps!
Marisha: Follow the finger.
Sam: Are the guards following?
Matt: The two guards are following, yes.
Laura: Woo, that was really fun.
Marisha: My hair is messed up.
Sam: Good sesh.
Laura: Good. That was really...
Liam: Thanks, Grog. (laughter)
Liam: I feel loose as a goose. Let's go see this bog.
Marisha: And I transform into a goose and come out as a goose.
Matt: "You-- (frustrated noise) Never mind." The guards follow at a very healthy distance now, both whispering to each other as they watch you walk.
Laura: I think we made a really good impression on this city coming back.
Travis: I'm going to kill you later.
Matt: You guys are led back through the main portion of Syngorn, towards the front gates where the watchers reside. The doors are opened for you, and you are escorted out the front gate, where the guards very happily leave you to be. And both turn around at each other and go, (heavy sigh) and they walk back inside the confines of the outer Syngorean wall. You guys are now back out in the wilds of Syngorn, the finger tugs lead you out past the front of the city, through the marshlike mandrake fields that you initially traversed when you made your way to Syngorn, and then find your way back into the Ever-Shifting Grasses, heading duskward, towards where it seems the dusk sun will set.
Laura: Duskward.
Taliesin: Duskward.
Marisha: Always duskward.
Sam: I hate that direction.
Matt: There's also nightward, seaward, or tangleward. Which would you prefer?
Sam: Are those different directions?
Matt: Yes, those are different directions.
Laura: Tangleward? Did you say tangleward?
Matt: Tangleward. It was mentioned before, yeah.
Laura: Oh. I just thought of the Disney movie and I think I spaced out there.
Matt: I'm pretty sure that the people in the Feywild haven't seen that. Not yet. They're waiting for it to come out on Blu-Ray. All right. So you make your way towards where the grasses get heavy again, and you see Garmelie (foosh) once again take visible form again and be like, "Ah, sorry, that concentration for a while really gets to you, I'm so glad to be out of that stuffy place. So! Shall we?" Rights his hat. And even in righting it, it's a little crooked to one side and he begins marching duskward.
Laura: Onward to the theater!
Matt: "No! No theater! We are avoiding the theater! No."
Travis: Garmelie, how far of a journey is it to this bog?
Matt: "Say about four times since we met?"
Laura: Okay.
Travis: That doesn't mean anything to me.
Laura: Four times since we met.
Liam: I'm just curious, why are you so worried about the theater? I love the theater.
Matt: "I have my reasons." And he continues walking forward.
Liam: Thanks, great. Good talk.
Laura: It's been 14 hours since we've met.
Sam: Can we travel any faster than that? Can we mist, can we tree, can we...?
Laura: Wait a minute, you could-- if you know a tree is-- that would be pretty stupid, to just pop out of the cancerous tree, but if we know a tree is there, couldn't you potentially just fucking do it?
Liam: You've had a lot of good ideas. That's not one of them. That's a bad idea.
Marisha: She's not wrong.
Laura: Wait! Keyleth, what if you just open up the cancerous tree, we reach through, we grab the fucking bow, and then we're out.
Marisha: Well, you're not entirely wrong, I don't know if I can Teleport via Plants because generally that takes knowing the plant. However, I do have Tree Stride, which means we can-- nope, never mind, I can only do that on myself.
Matt: Wah-wah.
Taliesin: We are not sending Keyleth the goose into a bog to retrieve a bow from an angry cancerous tree.
Marisha: But I'm loosey! I'm a loosey goose.
Matt: That would look amazing on an epitaph, I'm just saying.
Marisha: We can mist there.
Sam: Would that save time, I don't remember how fast we go.
Marisha: I might have to take a hot nap.
Travis: A hot nap?
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: Didn't you guys just take a hot nap? (laughter)
Marisha: Yeah. The answer is yes. I can do all those things.
Taliesin: Well, let's travel for a bit and then we'll take a proper break.
Marisha: If we can get to the edge of the bog, then we'll take a sleep.
Laura: Wait, I think the edge of the bog is kind of far, though.
Taliesin: We'll start our journey, and the next leg of our journey.
Travis: Yeah, let's get going.
Marisha: We'll go until we're tired.
Matt: "I like the sound of that."
Laura: Oh. (belches) (laughing and cheering)
Matt: "Most impressive for a lady."
Laura: Thank you. That's a baroness burp.
Marisha: Robert Durst shit.
Matt: As you guys push on further northward at the behest of Garmelie, you push for another two hours or so through the Ever-Shifting Grasses, and as you get further and further north, the color of the grass seems to go from that deep verdant green to almost a maroon purplish color.
Laura: I pop Trinket out of the necklace.
Matt: He attacks some of the grass and chews it up.
Laura: Yeah, get it!
Marisha: Don't touch the grass, it'll get angry at you! It'll yell at you for a week!
Travis: I don't think that applies here.
Laura: It's okay, darling. It's okay. Keyleth.
Marisha: What?
Laura: Do not yell at my bear.
Marisha: I was just trying to protect him.
Liam: I give him some grass.
Marisha: Don't!
Sam: It's fine.
Taliesin: It's fine.
Matt: And just keeps going forward through the grass fields.
Marisha: Does the grass seem angry?
Matt: No, it just seems to be changing color.
Marisha: Suck it, grass!
Matt: As you say that, the grass goes from a purplish color to a deep, deep red around you.
Sam: Oh god.
Marisha: Because you... suck out the joy of all of us living around you, and you're so amazing.
Travis: That makes it even worse.
Sam: Not a compliment.
Travis: You're still going in the same direction.
Marisha: I mean, you suck out bad--
Liam: I grab Keyleth's hand. Let's take a walk.
Matt: All of you, as you're walking, the actual grasses around you are getting more and more dense and are catching on your feet and you're finding that your progression is getting slower and slower.
Laura: Wait, no. I have Landstride, which means I don't slow against any land.
Matt: Yeah, so you're fine, you just coast ahead. The rest of the party, it's like they're going through waist-high thickets. The grass looks gentle, but as soon as it hits your body, it rakes across it almost like very fine serrated plants, and it's catching on your clothing and pulling you back. It's almost like since those statements were made... (laughter)
Travis: I have a hooded lantern. I could set this whole fucking thing ablaze.
All: No!
Matt: The red goes to a deep cinder-like red.
Sam: Are we going to have roll initiative on grass?
Laura: No, wait.
Taliesin: Does no one-- I'm going to take a moment.
Marisha: I feel like the grass feels our emotions.
Sam: Your emotions. Because you yelled at it.
Taliesin: Lovely field, I apologize for the rudeness of my compatriots. We will be gentle trouncing through you. We will make as little mark as we can and enjoy the splendor of your ever-changing colors. You are majestic, you are windswept-- I'm flirting with grass-- you are everything I could hope for in a beautiful view.
Sam: I sing a song.
Matt: What do you sing? (cheering)
Sam: (singing) Keep growing. Keep flowing, knowing you can always count on me.
Travis: (singing) For sure.
Laura: (singing) For sure.
Sam: (singing) For sure.
Sam: (singing) That's what Scanlan's for. (cheering)
Matt: Percy, I want you to make a persuasion check against the grass? Adding the d10 inspiration die.
Taliesin: Oh, d10 inspiration. Come on.
Marisha: I do an interpretive dance.
Sam: Come on, persuade that plant.
Taliesin: That was leaning.
Sam: That was a leaner.
Taliesin: That jumped, but that's still fine, okay, it's. Persuasion check? Oh yeah, that's not bad. 24.
Matt: What was it?
Taliesin: Eight plus six plus seven. (counting) 21.
Sam: It's more than that.
Matt: Between the interpretive dance of Keyleth amongst the tattered angry grasses, the beautiful vocal stylings of Scanlan Shorthalt, and Percy speaking out a wondrous poem towards the Ever-Shifting Grasses, you watch as the deep bright red subsides into the relaxed purple, and eventually goes back to a dull green, and you find your traveling no longer impeded as it once was.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Good job!
Laura: Good job!
Matt: You successfully parlayed with a field.
Travis: First doors, then grass.
Liam: Don't talk shit to grass!
Sam: How do you want to mow this? (laughter)
Matt: So. About another half an hour of travel before in the distance ahead of you can see the dark edge of what looks to be another forest ahead of you, wide and almost end-to-end, you see it. A lot of these wooded areas almost meet the horizon, it's like you're stepping into just an endless wall of trees. As you begin to approach closer to the edge, Garmelie looks up and says, "All right. So we have choices now. We have the Moonbrush before us, or we have the Green Sea, which is far seaward of here. I would recommend the Moonbrush."
Sam: Then we should go the other way. Because we don't trust a fucking thing you say.
Matt: "Very well."
Laura: Wait.
Taliesin: No, the High Warden did say--
Marisha: -- to avoid the Green Sea.
Laura: Why do you recommend the Moonbrush?
Matt: "Because it's the only real route to get to the Gilded Run."
Laura: What is the Gilded Run?
Matt: "The Gilded Run are the rivers that surround it."
Laura: Right, those.
Matt: "Yes. You're looking for the Shademirk. You have to get through the Gilded Run to get the Shademirk. You have to go through the Moonbrush to get to the Gilded Run."
Liam: Where's the theater?
Matt: "No theater!"
Travis: Right, so we're going through the brushy moon?
Matt: "Yes! Come, come."
Laura: Yeah? Are you okay with that, Scanlan?
Sam: I'll allow it.
Marisha: How long have we been awake?
Matt: You are... you've been awake for about 12 hours now, I'd say.
Marisha: If we want to mist there, then we have to sleep. But we'll press on for a few more hours.
Matt: Certainly. About another 40 minutes of foot travel before you begin to hit the edge of the Moonbrush Forest. As you approach, Garmelie says, "All right, so things you should know about the Moonbrush. One: it is home to a number of denizens." And as you look overhead, you can see it's a thick fog that permeates the entirety of this forest. You can see the outline of every tree trunk towards the outer rim of this entire brush. The canopy of the trees themselves are like long weeping willows that sag and give this very ominous feeling to the entire forest. You can see small mountain spires breaking through portions of the tree line in the distance occasionally, miles between each other, sometimes a cluster far closer together. He says, "There is a clan of sorts that lives amongst the forest, we'll try our best to avoid. They are natural hunters and they are of the lycan persuasion."
Sam: Oh.
Taliesin: Oh.
Matt: "So, best that we avoid interaction. They are well-read, they have a society; we should touch none of it."
Marisha: Question. You mentioned we are going into the Moonbrush with lycan hunters?
Matt: "Yes. It's a necessity."
Marisha: Yeah, no, it sounds like it. Yeah.
Matt: "Yes. But they do have natural enemies. There is a faction of pixies that live within, known as the Wishers, and they are forever locked in a struggle. So avoid both, do not get involved at all, and we'll be fine."
Laura: Do the lycan tend to populate trees, or if we stay up high can we maybe avoid them?
Matt: "Actually, they travel mostly in the trees. That's the easiest way for them to hunt, is unseen."
Laura: Well, there you go.
Matt: "They are ruled by a singular lycan lord, who goes by the name of Ukurat."
Marisha: What?
Sam: Ulurat?
Matt: "Ukurat."
Marisha: Ukurat.
Laura: Ukurat or Udurat?
Matt: "Ukurat."
Laura: Ukurat.
Liam: Ukurat.
Matt: "U-K-U-R-A-T."
Travis: Bob.
Matt: "He is to also be avoided."
Taliesin: Is that an elven name? Is that an elven word?
Matt: "It was, once."
Laura: Wait, he used to be elven? He used to be elven.
Matt: "They all used to be many things. He happened to be elven at one time, yes? So. Anyway. We'll avoid them, and avoid the Wishers, and also those things, the little plants that you saw before?"
Laura: Mandrakes?
Matt: "Mandrakes? Also everywhere. Avoid them."
Laura: Okay.
Matt: "And we'll just avoid the other things I mentioned, so. Shall we?" And he begins to step and march up to the edge of the Moonbrush.
Taliesin: Okay.
Sam: It's fine. We've killed dragons, we'll be fine.
Travis: I'm so stoked right now.
Marisha: Did we-- okay, yeah. Sure. Yeah.
Matt: All right. You guys make your way into the dark Moonbrush itself and as you walk into the forest, immediately you can hear the swell of distant crickets, thousands upon thousands, sourceless, fill the air around you.
Sam: Audience, please. (cricket noises, laughter)
Matt: That works, I was going to look for cricket sounds here. That's also totally doable.
Marisha: Someone's got a really good one.
Matt: As you walk in, the actual dusk light that has permeated the Feywild begins to give way to the first signs of night. You can look up through the different breaks in the tree line, you can see stars for the first time. And you can see what looks to be a very dull white glow of moonlight hitting some of the trees and breaking through some of the treetops themselves. The underbrush itself is very soft and spongy, with a lot of leaves that have fallen and given this soft setup. As you guys push forward for another half-hour or so, you in particular, Vex'ahlia, come upon what looks to be a series of stones, what looks to be a series of small structures, almost. Not like buildings per se, but intently placed obelisks of raw, rough stone. And as you come across and look on that side, you can see what looks to be the base of one of the mountain spires that sticks out, a large cave.
Laura: Do I see any kind of markings on the obelisks?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Laura: Oh. Get out of here!
Matt: What'd you get?
Laura: Natural one.
Matt: Natural one.
Laura: I know!
Matt: They just look rough and old. They've been placed there. It's old magic.
Liam: God, you're so bad at D&D!
Laura: I suck!
Matt: But you do see around the ground right out in front of this cave what appears to be hundreds and hundreds of small objects, piles, what looks like fruits and flowers and bones and stone carvings, all sorts of things placed in front of this cave.
Marisha: Can I do a nature check on one of the bones to see if I can identify where it came from?
Matt: Okay. So you head out and take one of the bones and look at it. Go ahead and make a nature check.
Marisha: Yeah, the closest bone, I don't want to, ooh. Yeah.
Taliesin: That ain't nothing to sneeze at.
Marisha: No, it's not. 28.
Matt: 28. This bone belongs to a larger bird, like a great eagle, you can't quite specifically make out what it is, but it's been carved with small letters into it of a language you can't understand. It looks like it's some sort of a ritual item that's been placed there in the ground. But as you pick up and make this moment noticed--
Liam: I'm going stealth just because.
Matt: You all hear a giant, echoing roar coming from the cave.
Liam: Was I fast enough?
Matt: (roars) What'd you roll?
Liam: 30.
Matt: 30. Okay, yeah. You just (bip) out; you are gone. The rest of you are right at the outside of this small clearing where all of these small objects have been placed, you hear this rumbling loud roar come tearing through.
Marisha: I step back with the bone.
Matt: Okay. What are the rest of you guys doing?
Laura: I pull the broom out from behind my back.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Can I lean the bone over to Vex'ahlia and be like, is this Draconic?
Laura: Is it Draconic?
Matt: It is not Draconic.
Marisha: God fucking damn it.
Laura: Is it anything that I recognize, though?
Matt: What languages do you know?
Laura: Elvish, Abyssal, Undercommon.
Matt: No, none of those.
Laura: Shit.
Matt: However, at this time the trees behind you two, because the rest of you guys were staying back--
Laura: Who's you two?
Matt: Vex and Keyleth. The trees (fwoosh) shift and close off the exterior. As you turn towards the entrance of the cavern, you can see emerging from the front a giant-- it's hard to really tell the first moment that it appears, but you see what looks to be a gargantuan dire bear-like entity made of crackling blue ghostly energy, shimmering, translucent, not actually a physical form, but massive in size. (stomping noises, roar)
Marisha: Wait, did we get cut off? Did Vex and I get cut off from everybody else?
Matt: Yep. From everybody else.
Laura: Shit! I grab Keyleth's wrist and I fly into the air.
Marisha: I hold on for dear fucking life.
Matt: As you grab her wrist as you fly up, the trees, swoosh, close off and you go slamming into the tree boughs (crashing sound). You lose the broom for a second. Go ahead and hold your grip. Go ahead and make a strength check.
Laura: A strength check!
Sam: We can't even see them, Matt?
Matt: You guys can't see them and they just closed off in the trees.
Laura: Come on! Is that a saving throw or just a check?
Matt: Just a check.
Laura: Five.
Matt: Five? You lose your grip on the broom, and both Vex and Keyleth tumble down about 20 feet, you both suffer seven points of damage as you slam into the center of another pile of what looks like knick-knacks and things that are gathered on the floor. It's at this point that your mind hits that these are probably offerings, these are things that are left as some sort of offering to this bear-like spirit entity that exists in this cave. The bear, which is now, (stomping sounds), coming up towards you on the ground. Looks to Keyleth, (roars).
Marisha: Hi!
Laura: I cast Speak With Animals!
Matt: Okay, you cast Speak With Animals.
Laura: Yeah.
Marisha: Like I taught you!
Laura: (weak growling sounds) (laughter)
Laura: And I say, we mean you no harm, great ghost bear! In fact, we brought you an offering and we just accidentally touched the other offering of yours.
Liam: Où est la bibliothèque? (laughter)
Laura: The cheese is old and moldy.
Matt: None of the bear's face moves at all, but an echoing voice, in Common, not animal speak, comes blasting into both of your minds, and those of you guys outside of the trees, trying to find a way through, also hear this echo, "You have entered the domain of Orlan. You destroy and disgrace that which was gifted. What do you offer in response to your travesty?"
Laura: Yeah, well, I--
Sam: We have a hat. A really good hat.
Marisha: I've got an old tobacco box I got from lost and found.
Laura: Ooh, yeah, that's pretty good. I offer him a tea set.
Matt: As you pull the tea set out, the bear claw reaches out and smashes it out of your hand and goes scattered and breaking across one of the stones and goes, "You walk into the realm of the wild, unwatched, unrespecting. The beasts of this land hold no kinship with you. You will prove offering yourself." And the tongue licks the lips.
Marisha: What? I turn into a giant scorpion.
Matt: The scorpion takes its form, as it does the bear, (growls).
Marisha: You want an offering, you can have mine.
Matt: Make a persuasion check on that.
Marisha: Oh god.
Liam: By the way, am I hidden in or outside?
Matt: You're outside.
Marisha: 21.
Laura: Good job, Keyleth!
Marisha: Thank you!
Matt: "I sense you have kinship with beasts. You may pass, though I will not forgive this infraction. You."
Laura: Yeah?
Matt: "You shall be the prize."
Laura: Oh, fuck.
Matt: The giant bear is looming over you now, and its size is so immense, probably 15 or 20 feet to the top of its shoulders.
Laura: Trinket! I call Trinket.
Matt: You call Trinket?
Laura: I call Trinket.
Matt: Leaps out of your necklace and lands right beside you and just roars, (roars) up to the spirit. The spirit pulls back, (roars), roars back. And Trinket is so tiny by comparison and is up to the elbow, but Trinket lashes out at the giant bear, just leaps up towards it, pushes into it and starts tearing at its throat. The giant bear takes Trinket with one claw and slams him into the ground. Trinket rolls and gets back up, (growls), you can see a little bit of blood at the corner of its mouth, and just lunges again, this time jumping up onto the bear's back and clawing up onto its, onto the top of its torso. The bear (growls).
Laura: He's pretty cool.
Matt: The bear head looks up at Trinket now gnawing onto its hide, (gnawing sounds), seemingly to no real effect, and the bear reaches up and grabs Trinket and plucks him off the side and sets him down next to you. The bear now begins to speak in the language of bears, which only you can understand at this moment, says, "You walk with this one. Is she your charge?" And Trinket voices back, you hear the (bear noises) up to the bear, as you hear coming out, "She is everything. Her life is mine. You take her, you take me, or we walk on and remember you as a kind soul." The giant bear looks down, "Very well. If you are at her side, I take your charge, as well." And the spirit bear steps forward, passing through you, and passing through Trinket's form, and what feels like this rush of warm air. And then disperses into a series of sparkles. You watch the energy slowly drift down and fade into the ground around you, and everything gets quiet. The trees slowly creak back and open the perimeter of this forest around you, leaving you alone. And Trinket comes up and licks your face.
Laura: Oh! (cheering)
Matt: As he's looking at you, you look down and you can see the necklace that you hold is actually shimmering with a blue light that passed through you, and it slowly fades to its dark normal form.
Sam: You're part bear now!
Matt: So. That's your new item card for Raven's Slumber. (cheering)
Audience member: What's it do?
Laura: I don't know.
Matt: So. I've got to finish this quickly because we've got to get to the Q and A, but as of this point in time, and I'll give you an ability card, but Trinket now benefits from your Hunter's Mark. (cheering)
Matt: And has an ability called Primal Fury you can use once per short rest that I'll get to next episode. As you all gather around this moment of silence, this quiet tension that has now dispersed, you see Trinket lift up Vex from the base of her cloak and put her back on her feet, nuzzles the side of her, and you can see the trees overhead open up a little wider than they were before, leaving some moonlight to hit the two of them. And that's where we'll go ahead and leave this session this week. (cheering)
Matt: Thank you, guys! (cheering)
Audience member: Is it Thursday yet? (cheering)
Matt: Thank you. (laughs) Thank you guys so much for joining us here live, this has been an awesome and incredible first experience for all of us. Thank you so much for tuning in and watching with us this week. We're looking forward to the GenCon show in a few weeks, so some of you guys over on that side of the US can hopefully come and see us here as well, and join in this fantastic energy that tonight was just filled with. So hopefully we'll do more of these as time progresses.
Travis: Thank you, Loot Crate!
Laura: Thank you, Loot Crate!
Matt: Thank you Loot Crate for supporting us and being so awesome, being a fantastic sponsor, and yeah, I guess, is it Thursday yet? We'll see you guys in a couple weeks.

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Announcer: Hi, guys! Let's give it up for Claudia for putting almost this whole thing together. So really quick, I just wanted to say very special thanks to you guys from me and Felicia. Doing these kind of events where we have this kind of community has been the number-one goal from Geek and Sundry. So again, thank you guys so much for coming. We're excited to have you; we're excited to keep doing this. So yeah, you're awesome. (cheering)
Announcer: All right, let's get down to it. First up, the man with the grog. Travis, come on out! (cheering and chanting "Grog")
Announcer: We got six more people, Travis. Come on. Fresh off the plane from New York City: Ashley Johnson! (cheering)
Ashley: Whoa! I'm a monstah! (cheering and chanting "Monster")
Announcer: Next up is Travis's better half Laura Bailey! (cheering and chanting "Vex")
Laura: This is amazing! What?!
Announcer: Your favorite druid Marisha Ray! (cheering and chanting "Keyleth")
Marisha: What?!
Announcer: And give it up for Taliesin! (cheering and chanting "Percy")
Announcer: And last but not least Sam Riegel! (cheering and chanting "Scanlan")
Announcer: All right, the man who brings it all to life with his amazing imagination: Matthew Mercer! (cheering and chanting "DM")
Laura: Should we sit?
Matt: Well, first and foremost, guys, I want to thank all of you for being here tonight, for what is already the craziest night of my life in a long time. And we haven't even started, really, which is nuts. I want to give a big thanks to the Dungeons and Dragons team and Wizards of the Coast for gifting us an awesome series of gift bundles that we'll be able to give out to some of you lucky winners here in the audience and some of you lucky folks at home, as well. There'll be information for that throughout the chat as those events arrive. And also, in that same vein, thank you to them for helping me and Chris come together and help make the event of Force Grey: Giant Hunters, a new series we've been working on, recently coming out. (cheering)
Matt: We have four episodes already out for that, if you haven't seen it yet. The fifth one comes out this week on Monday on Nerdist. And this will be introducing Brian Posehn's character; he'll finally be joining the campaign for that, and some crazy shit goes down, so don't miss it. Yeah, and I think we have one other cool announcement, if you guys want to take this one.
Announcer: Yeah, so we're really excited that this is Chris Pramas, from amazing Green Ronin, who did the Titansgrave book and series. And we're excited; that's been a labor of love for a long time, but we're able to announce that we will have a Critical Role campaign book coming out. (cheering)
Announcer: So Chris, you want to tell them about it?
Chris pramas: Hey! Try to get the energy up, people. This is exciting. Hey, I'm Chris Pramas. I'm the president of Green Ronin Publishing. You may know me from such things as season one of Tabletop and Titansgrave. And yeah, we're going to be publishing Critical Role RPG books. They'll be for 5th edition rules, and the awesomest part is that Matt is going to write them. (cheering)
Announcer: So you can look for that Q1 2017?
Chris pramas: Spring?
Announcer: Spring 2017. All right, well, I think that's it, so let's get started. Enjoy the show, everyone! (cheering)
Matt: So that's interesting. Yeah, as if I didn't have enough free time already, now I'm putting that together. But yeah, the first book is going to be a Tal'Dorei campaign setting, specifically within Exandria. And if that does well, hopefully we'll be able to extend that to other continents, like Issylra with Othanzia and Vasselheim, maybe Marquet and Wildemount; we shall see. But the first book I'm really excited about. It's a labor of love, and when that does come out next year, I hope you guys get a chance to enjoy that, so yay. (cheering)
Matt: So. As we've finished our announcements, I think it's time we go ahead and dive into our fantastical journey of Vox Machina in tonight's episode of Critical Role. [dramatic music] (cheering)
Matt: All right, enough of that. Bringing us into tonight's game of Critical Role. The last time we saw them, the group of adventurers Vox Machina had found themselves in the Feywild, intent on discovering another one of the Vestiges of Divergence, one of the many artifacts that they hope will aid them in their struggle against Thordak, the Cinder King, and the rest of the Chroma Conclave. Defeating two of the members, three still remain, Thordak being the seeming powerhouse head of that troop. So now, deep in the Feywild, a crazy alternate dimension in which fey creatures rule a landscape where up is down and everything is topsy-turvy and nothing is what it seems, they've made their way through the Moonbrush, parlayed with a group of lycanthropes-- werewolves, werebears, weretigers-- and a group of pixies and made a choice, the pixies now scattered and stapled to a number of trees in the forest. The leader of their troop, an extremely large, powerful werewolf lord named Ukurat, has pledged his aid to some degree in the near future, should you need it as you travel duskward past the Gilded Run, eventually to the source of where apparently this bow Fenthras exists in the Shademirk Bog. And now, we pick off where we last left off. The rest of you, after resting in the treetops on the outskirts of the duskward side of the Moonbrush, you've come to consciousness, gathered your things, escaped the forest, and headed northward, just beginning to see the cresting edge of the tangled river mass of the Gilded Run. And beyond that, the dark, ominous shadow: the Shademirk Bog. So before you guys press anywhere forward, is there any preparation you want to take on your adventure?
Laura: Straight-up prep? Oh jeez.
Matt: You're about to travel forward. What do you want to do?
Sam: Can you hear us? Yes? Are there any potion stores nearby? (laughter)
Matt: Roll an investigation check. No.
Sam: Ooh, 22.
Matt: Oh! You strongly recall information that inform you that the last bastion of true civilization is long past you, south of where you originally came from.
Sam: Well, then I will take a moment to limber up for the day. Stretch up. Yeah, just stretch up. Active squats.
Travis: Can I ask a question? Since I was obviously out of commission with the whole last fight that happened--
Laura: Your own fault, Grog!
Travis: It's not! I was being a politician. Is anybody hurt? Do we need to heal anybody before we go? Did these fireflies mess with any of you?
Taliesin: I think everyone's mostly fine.
Marisha: I think you were the only one who got the shitty end of that deal.
Travis: That's fucked up.
Sam: I will say that Vax looks a little weird.
Laura: Vax is just strange.
Matt: Vax turns to you and goes, "Yeah, I usually feel a bit that way. Quiet." As you guys are preparing for the morning, there's a strange sound like a simmering, high-pitched whine. Two or three times, you see these sudden bright flashes of light in your vicinity. And there's a burst of white light, as out stepping from it, you see the somewhat-corporeal, divine energy-based form of Pike Trickfoot. (cheering)
Laura: Oh my god!
Ashley: I'm back.
Sam: No! You are not supposed to trust anything in the Feywild. (laughter)
Ashley: I swear it's me!
Sam: There's only one way to find out. I run up and I kiss her. (laughter)
Ashley: That was a little fast, I think.
Sam: It's her.
Matt: Garmelie, at this point, watching this whole circumstance, walks up to you and goes, "It's good to see you again. I don't know where you went away last time, but I hope you enjoyed the last sketch I did. If you need any more, let me know. I got plenty of paper."
Ashley: Okay. What was that? Who were you?
Matt: You look down and see the small faun who you previously had commissioned to draw--
Ashley: Yes. I really love that piece that you did.
Matt: "Well, thank you kindly."
Ashley: You're so welcome.
Matt: "Let me know. Your form's closer to mine, so it's easy for me to get a full view." (laughter)
Travis: Whoa. (laughter)
Ashley: That's okay.
Travis: Snap. So are we going across the river, then?
Marisha: Wait, there's a river?
Matt: Make a perception check! (laughter)
Marisha: Really? Okay.
Matt: First roll of the night.
Travis: Ten.
Marisha: It's okay. 18.
Matt: 18, okay. Glancing ahead of you, you see the hint of the peak of an ominous mountain range slowly growing in the distance. At the base of that, you see a treacherous weave of powerful rivers rushing past, and around the exterior of the Shademirk Bog, these large heavy trenches of water jamming and folding into each other. You've heard of the Gilded Run, and you've seen a few stationary rivers in the past, but this is a cluster of perpetually rushing rapids that fill a rather sizeable period of the land surrounding the actual Shademirk Bog. And you can see just past it, the edge of the bog itself, these very dark, glistening, almost black oil-caked tree canopies that vanish into shadow beneath. But that's a couple of miles off.
Travis: But the rapids are right there?
Matt: You can see them maybe half a mile in front of you. And you can see the spray occasionally shooting off some of the rocks, and the shore of the river just barely shows the speed of the water passing by.
Laura: It's definitely not something we can wade across, I'm assuming.
Sam: We could fashion a crude canoe and go down it.
Marisha: Or I could part the sea. I'm going to take my staff, and I want to feel how deep it is.
Matt: Okay, so you decide to walk the half-mile to make it to the river?
Marisha: I thought we were there. It's a lot going on.
Sam: Let's walk the half-mile. It's a half-mile!
Marisha: And it looks like a long river?
Matt: It's a series of long rivers that completely wrap around the Shademirk. One side of it seems to be vanishing into the Green Sea, which you could barely see to the far seaward side of you, and it curves around the outside of the Shademirk and vanishes into the horizon.
Sam: It's a river.
Laura: It's a big river.
Taliesin: It looks like a river, at the very least. Don't trust anything in the Feywild!
Laura: Can I perception and see if there are any sort of creatures that are visible?
Matt: Do you want to get close to it first? You have a jaunty jog on your way towards the Gilded Run. A very short time passes before you begin to actually hear the waters in the distance. And as you begin to approach, about a hundred feet from the edge of the first stripe of river, and you can see some are tighter together, some are only a few feet between the rivers, some merge into even thicker roaring rapids. They're all traveling from the seaward side to the tangleward side. In layman's terms: west to east.
Taliesin: How far in does it take to cross all of these little rivers?
Matt: The rivers change in width. The smallest one you can see is maybe ten feet across. Some of them swell to upwards of 30, 40 feet, depending at which point you come across it.
Taliesin: What's the speed and roughness of the ten-foot?
Matt: They're all pretty matching in speed, and they're pretty hefty. You can see there are occasional rocks in the edges of water that are just spraying, causing the water to smash into the side and split off around it. There's nothing visible in the water drifting, through. Most of it is destroyed in the process of crashing against the rocks in the sides of the bank.
Taliesin: Let's find a nice mix of not-too-wide and not-too-rapidy. Not too fast.
Sam: And do what?
Taliesin: And start thinking of a way across it and making sure that it's not magical or strange.
Ashley: Could we fly?
Laura: I can.
Ashley: You can.
Laura: Brother, do you want to scout up ahead? Maybe fly up above the river and see down into the oily land? Both of us.
Matt: "Fine, I'll go ahead and give it a look, I suppose. Although you can fly any time you want, if you wish."
Laura: Yes, I can. And I do. I pick my broom up.
Matt: He seemingly ducks down into the grasses that you guys are standing in and vanishes, barely giving a small path as he disappears.
Laura: I float above him on the broom.
Matt: Occasionally, you see him glance up and loudly grumble.
Laura: You are so hidden right now. I can barely even see you. So hidden.
Matt: "I appreciate the backup, sister." And he keeps continuing forward. As you get to the edge of the water itself, he looks inside. It's pretty clear, the water, as you can see the bottom of it right there. You can see a deep-set blanket of greenish-brown algae-type plant life that cakes the bottom of the river floor, the occasional stone protruding from it and everything is growing and pushed around it. He releases his raven wings from his armor, which shoot out in a large 15-foot wingspan on each side. He jumps in the air, makes his way over the first short river, and lands on the other side.
Laura: Oh, okay. I fly up and I stay above him. I don't want to land on the ground.
Matt: Okay. Glance over. His wings fold behind him and he's like, "Was it so hard, sister? Really?"
Laura: You wasted your entire hour of flying for that? (laughter and applause)
Matt: (sighs)
Laura: Oh, I got a Vax sigh. I like it.
Matt: He scoots underneath your broom, as you're hovering on, and one of his wings catches the edge of it, flicks, and then tries to knock you off your broom. Make a quick strength check.
Laura: A what check?
Matt: Strength, my dear.
Laura: Oh, I got a natural one. (laughter)
Laura: If you just killed me--
Matt: As the edge of his wings smack the back side of the broom, it spins out from under you, and for a moment, you grasp the edge of the front of the broom, and it slips from your fingers. You flick off, tumble to ground about ten feet. Not too far. You take one point of damage from the impact; nothing huge. But as you roll to the side, your broom scatters across the stones and dips partially into the river, which begins carrying it slowly--
Laura: No! And I crawl over and grab it.
Matt: Okay. You grab it and pull it out. As you turn back over, your brother's sitting there with his arms crossed, his wings still folded, smiling.
Laura: I swing around and hit him with the broom.
Matt: Make an attack roll. This is not with your bow, by the way. This is just adding your proficiency bonus. You're not even proficient. This is an improvised weapon, so you have disadvantage. Go ahead and roll again.
Laura: Disadvantage? Aw, come on. That was so much better than the first one.
Matt: You're not proficient, really, in attacking with brooms.
Laura: 13.
Matt: 13? With but an instant of reaction time, it passes a good solid foot and a half in front of his face. His wings furl. A couple of feathers dangle down, and he turns around and decides to hop over the next bit of the river.
Laura: I hate you sometimes.
Matt: "I know, sister." As he takes off.
Laura: All right, I get on my broom and fly after him, like a loser.
Matt: Any of you guys also doing anything, or are you just watching them scouting ahead?
Travis: We're just watching them fly around.
Matt: As you scoot up to catch up to your brother, he's probably a good 15 feet ahead of you--
Laura: Yay, we're back.
Ashley: That was such a busy desktop.
Matt: As you hop up after him, you notice his wings go into a dive, and he ends up curving downward at an alarming rate, diving right into the river.
Laura: Can I float down and try to grab him?
Matt: I need you to make a wisdom saving throw.
Laura: A wisdom saving throw? Shit, balls, mother-- that's bad: nine.
Matt: As soon as you see your brother dive into the water, you begin to coast downward. As you do, there's an impulse in your head that begins pushing and steering the broom lower, lower. And even in the back of your head, you sense this is bad; we're going far too steep. It's like you're outside of your physical body. The control has alleviated itself, and your body forces you to splash into the river, as well, both of you guys submerging yourself in the raging rapids. You guys see this in the distance, with a splash of two impacts on the riverside.
Travis: Did we tell them to go fishing?
Marisha: I don't think we did.
Laura: Can we try to get out? Can we try to get out of the water?
Marisha: Okay, let's go save our friends.
Matt: There is a ten-foot river for you guys to traverse first, before you get to them. Each of you who are trying to leap across, make an athletics check.
Marisha: I didn't say I was trying to leap across.
Matt: I said anyone who wants to try.
Travis: You want to hop on the-- (laughter)
Sam: I don't follow. I'll jump on. All right, Grog's got two gnomes on his back.
Matt: Grog's got two gnomes on his back. Of course he does; that's perfect.
Laura: Help. Right here. Are we underwater, or are we on top of the water? We're just dying.
Matt: Two gnomes on Grog's back. You grab both of them, do a quick sprint and leap, as heavy as you can. Go ahead and make an athletics check.
Travis: I rolled a 25.
Laura: Oh, that's good. That's way better.
Matt: Much like how Hulk escapes a fray, you watch as Grog bounds into the air in a large arc, slamming into the other side, causing the stones on the outskirts of the riverbed to crack beneath him. You stand back up, proud of yourself. Pike and Scanlan, you're a little jostled from the impact.
Ashley: That was so fun.
Travis: I know, right?
Sam: I think I landed on my keys!
Taliesin: And I rolled a nine.
Matt: You smile as you hear a splash behind you. Percival getting right up to the edge and leaping, as his foot catches the stone and goes right into the smaller rapid, being carried, as well. Keyleth?
Marisha: The people who are in the water, are they being dragged under? We can just not see them anymore?
Matt: If you take a moment to watch--
Marisha: Yeah, Percy? Percy?
Taliesin: I think I'm fine. I'm just wet.
Sam: Is he being carried away?
Matt: The three who've been pulled under the river-- that includes you, Vex'ahlia, Vax'ildan, and Percy-- I need you to make a constitution check.
Laura: Constitution?!
Marisha: Why does everything here hate us?
Laura: Ugh! Oh Jesus! Six.
Travis: You're going to die live.
Taliesin: Ten.
Laura: Why am I rolling so bad right now?
Matt: 14. Okay, you manage to pull yourself up to the surface and you almost get to the point of actually getting some air, and a force pulls you back under.
Marisha: Percy! Aw. (laughter)
Matt: However, Percy, you do maintain the breath in your lungs. You and your brother both (coughs) give away a bulk of the air, and you feel yourself in the beginning spasms of drowning.
Laura: Can I cast Grasping Vine from the side of the river and try to catch myself?
Matt: You know what? Yes, you can. In the aspects of this sequence though, it is a difficult job to cast this. Is it a concentration check or not?
Laura: I don't know!
Marisha: Grasping Vine is a bonus action, yo!
Matt: But is it a concentration spell? That is the difference.
Laura: I don't have my card because we're traveling.
Sam: Matt, how far are they from me?
Matt: From you guys out there, they're maybe 25 feet from you.
Marisha: Wait. No, it is. Sorry.
Matt: That's all right. So I need you to roll another constitution check, if you could.
Travis: Roll better.
Laura: I'm scared of all my dice.
Travis: It's because you have a hundred of them.
Laura: No, that's good! 19.
Matt: Okay, so yes. As the rapids are rushing by, you open your eyes, and the sting of the very high-powered water hitting your eyeballs causes you to have a hard time even seeing what's up and down. As you glance up to where the little bit of light from the ever-dusk sky of the Feywild pulls your attention, you put your hand out, and using that burst of ranger magical energy, you watch as the undergrowth of the river itself stretch out and form this strange, slimy mass of vine that wraps around you and yanks you out of the water surface, slamming onto the ground just outside of the river. (applause)
Laura: That's my broom that I'm holding up in my hand right now.
Marisha: So the river doesn't hate magic?
Laura: I don't know.
Marisha: All right.
Laura: Where's my brother? Where's Vax?
Marisha: I'm going to cast Control Water. Where do I see Percy? Is Percy and Vax together?
Matt: No, Vax is in the next river over. Percy is about maybe 20 feet from you, but is quickly being rushed down the river.
Marisha: Vax is? Or Percy?
Matt: Percy.
Marisha: Okay, so first, I'm going to Control Water. I'm going to stop the flow of current and see if I can get it to burp out Percy.
Matt: Okay. Just pat it.
Marisha: I'm going to burp the river.
Matt: (shushing) It's okay, Gilded Run. It's okay. All right, perfect. So you see this influx and see Vex get thrown out of the river. You see Percy's hand get pulled back under as the river pulls him along at a very fast speed. You concentrate, and as you put your fingers forward, you see the rapid river begin to slow down at a certain point, and it's almost like an invisible dam gets held up as the waters continue to flow out and carry him a little bit further. It slowly descends to leave him on an empty bank of water as the rest of it slowly seeps to a much lower level. You catch your breath, Percy. However, I need you to make a wisdom check, as this is a very powerful, magically-enforced river, and it's currently combating the strength of your spell. This is Keyleth. She's making a wisdom check.
Marisha: No, okay. Yeah. Wait, what? Just a straight wisdom?
Laura: Oh no! (laughter)
Marisha: I just spent a lot of money on these dice today!
Sam: Wait. Hold on. I've got this. Quick, everyone. What's that over there? There.
Marisha: Oh, a 15.
Laura: Was it a one?
Marisha: I rolled a one.
Travis: You did?
Taliesin: Wow.
Matt: All right, feeling confident in your druidic ways, but unfortunately not yet undergone the formal training of the water Ashari, the actual forceful wave of the river begins to push back your control over that being, and then cascades down, picking Percy, once again, back up an additional 30 feet down the stream. You are at the surface at the moment, though. You are not considered drowning. You're not drowning. Your brother, not doing so hot.
Laura: Can I send the vine to him?
Matt: Well, before we get to that, the three of you guys now get to act.
Sam: I'm going to step forward and inspire myself. (cheering)
Sam: I sing to myself  (singing) Scanlan Shorthalt. I'm a gnome. My name is Scanlan Shorthalt. I'm a gnome. There's a million chicks I haven't boned, but just you wait--
All: (singing) Just you wait. (cheering)
Matt: Fine, you go and take your inspiration die.
Sam: And then I will cast Bigby's Hand. Bigby's Hand! Because we're in a symphony hall. And I'm going to grab Vax and toss him out of the river.
Matt: Okay, taking Bigby's Hand. I need you to make a strength check for Bigby's Hand, if you could.
Sam: What does he get? What does Bigby get? I'm going. It's a different guy. He's a whole guy, who's not quite as handsome as me.
Matt: Add a plus eight to it.
Sam: Okay. 25.
Matt: 25. You watch as Bigby's Hand plunges into the river itself, vanishes for a few moments, and then like a reverse cannonball out of the water, coming curving around and at an incredible speed, looks like it's about to spike Vax onto the water's edge before slowing down and limply dropping him on the edge of the bank front.
Sam: I give him a little pat on the head.
Matt: Which is good, because the pat actually forces the water out of his lungs. (coughing and panting) "No flight."
Marisha: Grog.
Travis: Yeah?
Marisha: Grab Percy.
Travis: Yes, me?
Marisha: Grab Percy.
Travis: I take the Alchemy Jug, and I turn it upside down like diving bell, and I put it over my head. (cheering and applause)
Travis: I take the Chain of Returning, and I wrap it around my waist. And I hand the other end to Pike because she's got the ogre gauntlets. And I wade into the river to go get Percy. (cheering)
Matt: Okay, I'll say it is your turn, because he move quite a bit down the river, but you have a pretty high movement rate as a barbarian, so you tie the chain around yourself at your full movement speed, and you get to the very edge of the bank and begin to wade in just as you pull the jar over your head. And that's going to be the end of your action there. Pike, you're holding him at the edge. I need you to make a strength check, if you could.
Ashley: I got you, buddy.
Travis: Come on, Monstah.
Ashley: Oh wait. Hold on. Where did it go? I'm sorry, I forgot how to play.
Matt: I believe it's a plus four.
Ashley: 18?
Matt: 18. Without an issue, you watch as this giant anchor of a man is being held solid by this tiny rock of a gnomish cleric.
Ashley: Yes! (cheering)
Ashley: Go get him, Grog!
Travis: (muffled) Okay.
Matt: You watch as her teeth bite down, and her tongue sticks out the edge as she digs her feet into the bottom of the river rock. Percy, you see a dark form in the river as you're rushing past. I need you to make a perception check with disadvantage, as you're being drawn underwater.
Taliesin: Perception check with disadvantage?
Matt: This is a perception check with disadvantage.
Taliesin: That's not that bad. Where's my perception? There it is: 14.
Matt: 14, okay. Just as you see this strange dark form appear out of the way, you instinctively sweep your hand out, and you smack and catch the edge of Grog's pants.
Sam: He has pants? (laughter)
Matt: At the hip. And you catch it. Grog, you see the hand emerge, and you catch the edge of it and pull him up out of the river. He's now out. Caught his breath; he's no longer beneath the surface. You guys are still being pulled, now, by the water. Your feet are beginning to fall out from under you as the rocks that are holding you up are being pulled along by the force of the river. It seems the longer you're in the river, the stronger it's getting.
Travis: Oh shit. Pike! Pull! I got him!
Matt: I need you to roll another strength check, Pike, as you pull them in. There is a little more weight on there, so the DC's going to be a little higher. Go ahead and roll.
Travis: 21.
Sam: Can I quickly inspire her?
Matt: If you want to, yeah.
Sam: Yes. I turn to her and I sing  (singing) Repairing up your heart when she heals you! And when you are a bard, you feel it, too! And no matter what you do, she heals the pain, and she's pretty, too!
Travis: I love you for doing *NSYNC.
Marisha: Ten-sider!
Laura: She did a ten-sider.
Matt: She's taking it now, so roll a strength check and add.
Ashley: Oh, it's the same. Or is that this way?
Travis: That's a nine.
Laura: That's good. That's better!
Ashley: 15?
Sam: With my dice?
Ashley: Yes. I originally rolled a two.
Matt: Even with the fantastic rhymes of Scanlan's voice ringing in your ears, and you're holding tight, you feel your heels begin to scrape as the river rush is pulling you now towards the river. Grog and Percy, you feel yourselves being brought deeper into the center of the river.
Marisha: Can I try again with the current? It's a concentration spell up to ten minutes.
Matt: Yeah, you do. So coming back to Keyleth, at this point.
Marisha: Even the water's angry! (screams)
Matt: Keyleth, I'd like you to make another wisdom check, if you could.
Travis: Roll good!
Marisha: Okay, that's better. Straight wisdom? A saving throw or just a check?
Matt: Just a check.
Marisha: 16.
Matt: 16. That's better. As you guys are being swept away, you feel the current begin to subside slowly, and Pike, once again, you get your ankles dug in. You begin to pull on this, and between the two of you and the concentration of Keyleth, you manage to wrestle Grog and Percy's forms out of the river onto the bank. Now you guys are between the two. (cheering)
Sam: You guys, we defeated a creek.
Taliesin: We didn't actually even defeat it.
Marisha: No, we haven't even gotten started. There's like 50 more creeks in front of us.
Laura: Me and Vax are on one side, and everyone else is on the other, then?
Matt: Yes. There are a couple of small trees that are planted or grown up between the river banks, and you can still hear the rapids rushing past.
Sam: How many more rivers would we have to cross?
Matt: Looking ahead of you, there's probably 12.
Travis: Let's just go home. Fuck it.
Taliesin: That was very clever with the pot, by the way.
Travis: Yeah, right? I figured if anything was going to hit me in the head, it would hit the jug first.
Taliesin: That was less clever, but still very impressive. What if we were to throw your chain, or if we could throw the rope across the river?
Laura: Actually, I'm going to use my earring so I don't have to shout.
Taliesin: Yeah, no, that's better.
Laura: I feel like when I was crossing the river, I wanted to kill myself. And I'm afraid that anybody else crossing the river--
Taliesin: No, Vax has already crossed. We're not going to feel the angst coming off of him.
Matt: The experience, when you were trying to cross over, was reminiscent of that urge to jump whenever you're near the edge. That weird, very base impulse whenever you get to a point of danger that says, do it! It's like that being triggered and preyed upon.
Marisha: It's a river of impulses? Such an allegory for so many things.
Taliesin: Here's a thought. We take the rope, we tie ourselves to it, we toss it over to the two of you, we start using it to wade, you help pull us over. Everybody would have to be terrible for everything to go. Everybody will be fighting together to get across.
Ashley: We can attach the rope to the Immovable Rod. Just put it in the ground.
Laura: I think I have it. I thought Grog had it, but I think I might have picked it up after.
Taliesin: As long as we're tied together, we can only go so far. It'll be like mountain climbing.
Sam: But that just gets us across one, right?
Taliesin: I think they're across two.
Travis: How wide's the second river between us and Vax?
Matt: It would take you guys about 20 feet across.
Taliesin: That's good. 20 feet across.
Sam: No, there's ten more rivers!
Laura: There's so many rivers!
Sam: Can we become mist form? Are our minds affected when we're mist form?
Taliesin: Yes. I'm sure.
Laura: Is it? Are we?
Marisha: I didn't learn mist form today.
Travis: Fucking hell.
Ashley: What if we made a boat and then floated down the river?
Travis: They're rapids.
Ashley: That sounds like a terrible idea, by the look of his face.
Marisha: Does it look like all the rivers are connected?
Matt: It looks like some of them swell between each other and then split off again. Some are solitary, from your current position that you can see, but you only have what's immediately near you to really see. Since some of these are hills, and it carves into part of these hills, you don't have a complete view of how they intertwine and merge beyond the immediate hillsides.
Laura: Hey, Garmelie!
Sam: Yeah, where's he?
Matt: He's back on the other side.
Laura: Hi!
Matt: "Some help, please?"
Laura: Have you heard any stories about how people crossed these damn rivers before?
Matt: "I told you I've heard about this land. I haven't actually been here."
Laura: I know! So tell me what you've heard!
Matt: "It's dangerous, and it keeps the Shademirk from spreading!"
Laura: Cool.
Travis: Garmelie! Hop in the river!
Matt: "No!"
Sam: Has my minute of Hand worn off yet?
Matt: I'd say it's getting towards the end.
Sam: All right. I'm going to take Garmelie and throw him across as many rivers as I can. (cheering)
Matt: Make a strength check.
Sam: 25 again.
Matt: Being a small and relatively light-weight fey creature, but also smug in a standing position after proclaiming his negative approach to Grog's idea, he doesn't quite notice the spiraling purple hand that swings up from behind, grasping him and lifting him into the air with an incredible speed. All you hear is the distant (squeal) as the hand full-on fastball special chucks him. Arcing overhead. (distant scream, impact) A little plume of dust.
Laura: Did he make it? How far did he get?
Matt: He made it past five of them. (applause)
Matt: And also suffered 22 points of damage. There's a long, awkward pause as you see no movement.
Sam: Oh god. I think I just killed him.
Laura: Scanlan, you're such a dick!
Taliesin: That was a little harsh.
Matt: Which gets more and more awkward the longer it goes by, until eventually you see a shift and this small form rise up, raises a thumb... which quickly transitions into a middle finger. (cheering)
Marisha: He's fine!
Sam: He's doing great.
Travis: Scanlan, Keyleth, if I had magic, I would freeze all the water, so go ahead and do that.
Marisha: If Bigby's Hand had about ten seconds left, I've got about nine minutes left on this Control Water spell. Why don't we try and move as fast as possible along with the chain and maybe the Immovable Rod. Let's go. You guys go first. And I'm going to try and halt the flow.
Matt: Make a wisdom check, if you could.
Travis: Come on, you stupid opal dice!
Laura: Is that a natural 20?
Marisha: No, it's another fucking one! Useless!
Laura: Put it away, Keyleth. Put it away for the rest of the night.
Marisha: I spent so much money on these!
Travis: You've got to retire that bitch.
Matt: No! They just haven't been charged properly. (cackles)
Laura: Put it in its dice jail.
Taliesin: See? Better.
Marisha: Percy! Don't touch my dice, Percy!
Matt: So as you guys begin to prepare your attempt to cross the river, Keyleth concentrates. The river stalls for a moment, and then pushes past, seemingly unaffected. Mind you, the spell does seem to have an effect when you're having a better time concentrating, but it is a magical force versus a magical force, and you can see it actually angrily swells against the resistance. That's where the actual tension comes from. There is something living, like an entity that these rivers seem to almost mingle as.
Travis: Are there a bunch of trees?
Matt: There are a few sporadic trees scattered around, yes.
Travis: How tall are they?
Matt: They're not that tall. Some are maybe 15, 20 feet up. These trees specifically are a little more marsh-based. They're not quite swamp-based trees, but that's as tall as they get.
Travis: And the river's 20 feet wide, right?
Matt: No, these are maybe five feet wide.
Laura: Oh. Five feet. We could jump across them?
Matt: Oh, the rivers. Sorry. The trees are five feet wide. I misunderstood. Yes, the actual rivers are between ten to 20 feet.
Laura: Do you have Tree Stride?
Marisha: I do, but I can only cast that on myself.
Laura: I thought we could all use it, always?
Marisha: We can use mist form. Sorry. There's Teleport Via Plants, which I did not bring today.
Travis: What did you bring today?
Marisha: I brought Control Water, Grog!
Sam: Wait. The total distance from us to the end of the 12th river is how far?
Matt: Probably close to 150 feet?
Taliesin: We can do that in five minutes.
Sam: So I can make it with Pike super fast.
Laura: How?
Marisha: Dimension Door.
Sam: Yeah. But the rest of you are fucked.
Laura: No! This is really good! This is good, because with the Immovable Rod--
Sam: I can set it, forget it. Set it and forget it.
Laura: And then tie maybe the endless rope to it. And then you teleport back to the other side.
Travis: How's that going to work?
Laura: I don't know.
Ashley: Wait. If we Dimension Door, what if you turn into an animal to fly, and then you have a broom, and someone can ride on your broom?
Marisha: I could potentially turn us into animals that can swim, which is why I was wondering if the rivers were connected. Maybe we can jump like salmon, going upstream?
Sam: Don't tell Trinket!
Laura: Trinket is safe in this necklace right now.
Travis: Can you raise earth? Can you make a dam?
Marisha: I can, and I did bring Move Earth, as well as Wall of Stone. To be totally honest, I am terrified of messing with the ground. I'm afraid if I move the earth, it will eat me. It will split open and swallow me. I could try it.
Laura: Wait, did I hear right that these rivers are alive? What did I hear?
Marisha: They're magical rivers.
Travis: I'm going to chop down a tree.
Laura: You're going to chop down a tree? Grog, Keyleth picked a flower and the entire world ended.
Travis: We are getting nowhere, super fast.
Taliesin: Easy plan. Easy peasy. Teleport with the Immovable Rod. You shoot one end of the rope to him.
Laura: Oh, why didn't I think of that?
Taliesin: Everything's easy peasy.
Marisha: Why didn't we think of that?
Sam: Okay. Give me the rod. You take the eternal string or whatever it's called.
Laura: I have the eternal string, and I have the rod.
Travis: Can I walk over to a tree just in case their plan fails? I want to start chopping.
Matt: You go up to one of the nearby trees at the edge, and you can see across the way, it looks like there's part of a crumpled stone corner, some long dilapidated ruin. You can see what looks to be one dried tree log that has fallen over and rotting on the other side. But there is one tree right on the edge of the bank that you guys are on that leads across this next river that is pretty solid looking. Maybe four feet in thickness there and 25 feet.
Laura: Don't do it, Grog! Do not do it yet!
Travis: I hope your stupid plan works!
Marisha: Hey, Grog. Remember when we almost died because I picked a flower? Just throwing it out there.
Travis: I'm super bored, so do your plan.
Laura: I'm going to start tying the rope to an arrow.
Matt: You're tying the rope to an arrow. Okay. You have, at this point, a good seven minutes left.
Marisha: Of the Control Water? All right. Let's do this.
Laura: All right. Are you going to teleport, and then we're going to try to do that?
Sam: Sure, let's do it.
Laura: So you teleport first. I'll shoot the arrow, see if I can actually get it to stick over there, and then you can do the...
Sam: Okay. Pike, you with me? Hand in hand?
Ashley: Hand in hand.
Sam: Here we go. I Dimension Door us across the river, if it works.
Matt: Okay. As you guys grasp hands, both of them vanish in a swirl of purplish-pink smoke. You see, simultaneously, across all the banks, right at the edge of the Shademirk, this little burst of energy. You guys land on the ground immediately, your feet sinking about three inches into this black sludge-like tar material. Already, you can smell the outskirts of the Shademirk. It's a very sulfurous decay smell that permeates the ground by you, and you can see it seeping into the river like a slow-moving morass of syrup, and the water carries it away upstream, like an angry force of cleaning. It's a little sludgy where you stand, but you guys are across.
Sam: All right. Hey! Shoot an arrow at me!
Laura: All right, I shoot an arrow! Not directly at him, but pretty close to him.
Sam: That's a long shot.
Laura: I have a really long-- I'm just going to shoot a couple arrows just to be sure.
Sam: I instinctively cover my neck.
Laura: 17.
Matt: 17. What did you roll?
Laura: A five.
Matt: Okay, just making sure. Because ones are always fun for situations like this. All right. You fire the arrow. It goes a little wide while you're aiming in the proximity of Scanlan and arc off and staples to one of the outside trees, sticking in it. The rope goes lax and begins to be carried in the water, and you can see the tension as the river itself seems to be trying to pull the rope underneath the rapids.
Laura: I hold the other side of the rope.
Matt: Okay, you begin pulling it up, and it's hard to pull up. The actual river is almost pulling the rope under itself.
Taliesin: I grab it, too.
Matt: All right. I need both of you guys to make strength checks together.
Marisha: Can I try and stop the current once again?
Matt: What's the range on Control Water?
Marisha: 300 feet.
Matt: Yeah you can do that.
Marisha: Okay. Calm, waters, calm.
Laura: And hook it to the Immovable Rod there.
Sam: Oh yeah! I forgot that whole part of the plan.
Marisha: Oh my god.
Taliesin: What are you doing?
Ashley: No!
Laura: You can't use it anymore. You're not allowed to use that dice anymore.
Travis: Just throw it offstage. Just throw it.
Marisha: I am not giving you all that dice! (laughter)
Travis: Say it. What was it?
Matt: I'm assuming it's a low roll.
Marisha: It's a fucking one! For the third time in a row!
Matt: All right, so what did you guys roll for your strength checks?
Laura: Oh, for strength checks I rolled...
Matt: As there has been no druidic aid, unfortunately, in this particular moment.
Sam: Pike, do you know any sailor's knots?
Ashley: I sure do!
Sam: Can you tie a sailor knot around this Immovable Rod?
Ashley: I sure can!
Sam: Which one?
Ashley: The swirley-whirley. (laughter)
Matt: As the two of you rush over the 30 feet to the tree that the rope is stapled to right now, it's taut and you can see it's starting to break the arrow as the strength of the rope being pulled into the river.
Laura: Percy, what did you roll for strength?
Taliesin: Oh, that's good. I rolled a ten. I'm not that strong!
Laura: We are so weak!
Ashley: We are doing so great!
Matt: Between the two of you guys, you manage to slowly pull it out of most of the rapids. It's still being dragged by one. It takes you another minute or so, but you manage to get the rope entirely taut against the edge of the arrow. Pike, you catch the actual rope on the other side before the arrow snaps and carries it back by the strength of their pull. So you take it and you make a little knot. Tie it strong from your experience as a sailor to the Immovable Rod, and it is solid and in place.
Taliesin: So I tie the rope to myself.
Laura: Yeah, we should each tie the rope to all of us.
Travis: What?
Laura: Grog, you're on the end there with the rope.
Travis: Nope. I'm going to cut down this fucking tree.
Laura: No, Grog!
Travis: All right, fine. I'll help.
Taliesin: We're going to tie a rope to you.
Travis: Around me?
Laura: Around all of us, yeah. So Keyleth, too, you get a rope, as well. You get a rope! You get a rope!
Marisha: We all get ropes!
Taliesin: You should be in front, and then the rest of us.
Laura: Oh, okay, sure.
Sam: Don't forget Vax.
Laura: And Vax, of course. Obviously, my brother, who is standing right here very stealthily.
Matt: He looks to you and his wings (whoosh). He lets them dissipate, as they're not going to be much of a help in this moment. "If I'm going to be tied to the rope, I want to be tied close to you, at least." He shimmies over. You're all tying yourselves like a daisy chain?
Laura: You know, like you do.
Matt: All right. Once you've all affixed it, what is the order in which you guys are affixed? I'm just curious!
Travis: I'll be in the front.
Laura: It's Grog, then Percy.
Taliesin: Vax, Vex.
Laura: Keyleth.
Sam: And then leave a little slack for Garmelie at the end.
Laura: Oh, right, because we've got to pick him up on the way through.
Matt: He's in between the two of you guys right now. He's waiting.
Laura: We're on our way to you, Garmelie. Don't worry!
Matt: "Good!" He looks over his shoulder at Scanlan and goes, "Good." All right, you guys all begin to pull yourselves forward on the rope, taking your time to make sure that if anything bad happens, you take a moment to pause and help out your friends. I need everyone who's on the edge of that rope to make a general athletics check.
Laura: Everybody holding on to the rope?
Matt: Everybody who's currently tied onto the rope, so not the gnomes.
Laura: Athletics?
Matt: Yes.
Travis: 20.
Marisha: That's acceptable.
Taliesin: 13.
Laura: Are we in any kind of favored terrain right now?
Taliesin: Only for Aquaman is this favored terrain.
Matt: I'm going to say no.
Laura: Okay, cool. 11 there, with the dice and the adding.
Matt: So that's 20. What did you get?
Marisha: 22.
Matt: 22, okay.
Ashley: Making a comeback!
Matt: You guys begin to pull yourselves forward. The two half-elf twins, in their physical waif-like state, begin to find themselves being carried hard down the first, second, and third progressive rivers as you guys pull through, but you manage to make up the slack and get them back on the land each time. It slowed down your progress. You only have three more minutes on your spell.
Marisha: Keyleth's got angry tears of frustration in the back as she's trying to control the water. Runny eyeliner, like it's 2001.
Matt: All right. You manage to make it across the next six or so rivers. You get to where Garmelie is, who's sitting there tapping his little hoof impatiently.
Laura: Tie yourself on, there, Garmelie.
Matt: He looks up at the rope, which is basically head level. "Give me some slack!"
Laura: (grunts)
Matt: "Thanks." He wraps it around his midsection, ties it up, and it's uncomfortably tight because as soon as you start moving it pulls on his midsection. When it's pulled taut, because of his size, he's actually lifted up between you guys, so his feet dangle, and he's top-heavy in how it tied, so he rotates. His feet are in the air. (cheering)
Matt: You bring yourself over to the eighth, the ninth river finally traversed. A few other scary moments. Keyleth, I want you to make a wisdom check again to see if you can aid this next length.
Marisha: Fuck you, no. It's a 19! Total 19.
Matt: Harnessing the inspiration of frustration at your recent failures to control the elements that you've been so hoping to learn to bring to your beck and call, you look forward at what would be the third-to-last river in your progress forward, and angrily do this with your hands. You guys watch as the river, like a paper, is torn asunder, the water held at bay.
Marisha: I'm sorry!
Taliesin: You're great! Run!
Marisha: Just go!
Matt: You guys run down the bank, stepping over. As you start to reach the other side of the bank, Grog, your heavy foot hits something that seems to react to the impact of your weight.
Sam: Like a thing? Like a person?
Matt: You guys make your way up the edge of the river. As you glance over the side, you see something in the mud vanish beneath.
Travis: I stepped on a catfish.
Ashley: Let's eat it.
Laura: Get up and out. Up and out.
Matt: As you guys all get across, the water slams back, continuing to flow with the river. Angrily, it roars and seems to almost swell up over the bank where it once was before it slowly descends back to its natural rushing rapids.
Marisha: That's a really big catfish.
Matt: There are two more rivers now ahead of you. There's one right before you, and then the one that separates you from Scanlan and Pike.
Sam: Are they multiplying? Oh no, it's because we got them wet!
Matt: There were roughly 12 ahead of you when you asked. You guys have now traversed nine of them, ten of them, so there's only two left at this point. Keyleth.
Taliesin: I believe in you.
Marisha: I didn't mean to do that. I was really nervous. But it's an 18, so 25. You know what, Percy? So I'm going to talk. I'm going to be like: Look, river. I'm your friend. I don't want any tension between us. I'm just trying to make it across you, you know?
Matt: The actual near-growl of the rapids begins to slowly subside in the river before you as the water sinks down into a slower, more gentle pace. You can see it building up and backing up behind you as the river here comes to a soft, cool dip that you guys can begin to walk through as well.
Marisha: Good river. Good boy.
Travis: Can I keep an eye out for whatever I stepped on in the river?
Matt: Yeah, make a perception check.
Travis: Six!
Matt: Grog, being in the front of the troupe, as the river is slowly separated for this, you step down into the mud, and you don't notice a similar shift curl up behind you as suddenly a rapid (whoosh). A set of gargantuan, long tooth-filled jaws come pouring out of the mud underneath the bank, snapping towards your large half-giant form. (evil chuckle) It has begun. That is a 22 to hit. I believe that hits your armor class.
Travis: That'll hit.
Matt: All righty. Getting ready for the first real attack damage of tonight's episode.
Laura: How come we never noticed the battle map has a river on it? Oh no!
Matt: You suffer 27 points of piercing damage. (groaning, laughter)
Matt: You, Grog, are suddenly grappled. The jaws have latched onto your midsection and hold you. You guys look ahead as you see this form, this spray of dark grimy mud and river-bottom muck gets flung into the air. You see what looks to be a far larger than you've ever seen before crocodile-like entity has come bursting out from under the river. You see the sheer force of the impact pushes him forward and carries him onto the other side of the river, in doing so, dragging all of you behind him at a rapid pace.
Travis: We're across!
Matt: Most of you go flying in an arc at the sheer force of this impact. I need you guys to make acrobatics checks to try to stop yourselves.
Travis: It's not a catfish!
Marisha: Acrobatics or athletics?
Matt: Acrobatics.
Taliesin: That's my jam. 27.
Marisha: 15.
Laura: 28.
Travis: 21.
Matt: All right, and your brother does well. Of course he does. You guys all manage to catch yourselves right now, still attached by the rope as you now see this heaping 15- to 20-foot-long giant barrel of muscle, green scaled skin, but what looks to be hundreds of tiny roots that spread from the center of its midsection, reaching into the ground. As it begins to move forward, it's actually rooting and uprooting itself as it moves. You can see the moisture and the life force of the land is pulsing into its form as it holds Grog in its jaws. I need you all to roll initiative. (cheering)
Sam: Wait, where are we? Where are the gnomes?
Matt: You guys are way over here on the edge.
Laura: Oh no! Wait, where are we? I don't see us at all.
Sam: Oh no, we have to go back!
Taliesin: To the future!
Matt: Please remind me the marching order again. If I recall, it was Grog...
Taliesin: Me.
Matt: Grog, Percy. Thank you.
Travis: Garmelie was in the middle somewhere.
Laura: I think he was between me and Vax.
Matt: Garmelie was between the two of you guys, yeah.
Taliesin: It was Vax, Garmelie, Vex, Keyleth.
Matt: Perfect.
Taliesin: Don't say that. That's not cool.
Matt: You get to see a little behind the field there.
Taliesin: I haven't seen that river in two years. It's so nice.
Sam: Pikey pants, what should we do? We should go help them, right?
Ashley: I don't know.
Sam: I mean, this mud is nice.
Ashley: But I did roll shit initiative, as usual.
Matt: There he is. There's Garmelie. Great.
Taliesin: That was terrible initiative. I am embarrassed by my initiative.
Laura: My initiative is really bad, as well.
Sam: This is crazy.
Matt: So top of the round, we have initiative of 25 to 20?
Marisha: 20. Shut up, really?
Laura: Go, Keyleth!
Marisha: I don't think that's ever happened before. That's never happened.
Matt: All right, so Keyleth, a 20. 20 to 15, anyone?
Travis: 18.
Matt: All right. 15 to ten?
Taliesin: 13.
Laura: 14.
Travis: This is our first live initiative.
Laura: Yeah.
Marisha: Yeah, because it didn't happen last time!
Travis: We're all going to die.
Matt: Scanlan and Pike, what did you guys get?
Ashley: I rolled a big fat six.
Sam: I got a four!
Matt: The gnomes bringing up the rear.
Sam: We were caught off-guard by this whole thing. She was teaching me the swirley-whirley while this was all going on.
Ashley: That's exactly what was happening.
Matt: All right, so Keyleth, you're up first. You watch as this giant mass of a creature is now clutching Grog in its jaws, and you see its tail begin to whip up, and it's now guarding itself on all sides as the roots are dragging themselves into the earth around you.
Marisha: So it has roots. It appears to be plant-based?
Matt: Elements of it. As you get a closer look now, you can see parts of its scaly hide emerge into leaf-like protrusions. It is a strange mixture of both giant croc and some sort of a plant-based entity.
Marisha: Okay. I'm going to go a little risky here. I'm going to cast Speak With Plants.
Matt: All right.
Travis: Look at Mercer's face.
Marisha: Dumb idea, yeah.
Taliesin: He's thinking an alligator voice is going to hurt a lot. That's what he's thinking.
Matt: This is a perfect Keyleth moment. So Speak With Plants generally works with plants.
Marisha: Sure, but he appears to be fellow kin.
Laura: He's got roots, yo.
Matt: He does. However, in the purposes of this type of circumstance, it's usually meant for smaller plants that have no sentience that you can normally interact with, like roses and petunias.
Marisha: I've done this before with talking to the treant.
Matt: You can probably communicate with it, yes. I'm saying, issuing commands on this might be a little more difficult for the rest of the spells.
Marisha: What if I cast at a higher level? Would that help?
Matt: This is not a spell that can be cast at a higher level, unfortunately. So what do you want to do? You're casting Speak With Plants.
Marisha: Well, I cast it, so I'm going to say Hey! You spit that out of your mouth right now, mister! (laughter)
Marisha: You don't know where that's been! And trust me, I do.
Matt: Make an intimidation check. (cheering)
Laura: No! Don't do it!
Taliesin: (laughs)
Travis: No way. There's no fucking way.
Sam: In a way, it doubled in its level.
Laura: You do not touch that dice anymore.
Marisha: Seven.
Matt: As you shout this out, pointing at the large crocodile-like entity, you look deep into its beady black and purple eye that darts around in the sunken socket of its crocodile skull, and you can see it re-initiate its clutch on Grog, readjusting, pulling him even further into the jaw. Grog, you suffer another nine points of piercing damage.
Travis: I take what?
Matt: Another nine points of piercing damage.
Travis: Nine points!
Taliesin: Yeah, you haven't raged yet.
Matt: Sorry, Keyleth. Are you going to stay where you are?
Marisha: Where am I? Oh, I see where I am. Can I move towards that tree, away from the river that also wants to eat us?
Matt: Sure. You get that far before the rope on your midsection stops you.
Travis: Oh shit, we're all tied together!
Marisha: Okay, yeah. All right. Cool. Done. Go.
Matt: Grog, your turn.
Travis: Yeah. Where did he bite me, by the way?
Matt: He has you in his jaws by the midsection, and he's trying to turn you so you lose your footing, and you're getting pretty close right now. So he has you clamped right around your hip and chest right now. The nostril's right here, and the other half of the jaw is almost completely wrapped around the side.
Travis: I don't give a fuck! I go into a rage! (cheering)
Travis: Can I go into a frenzied rage?
Matt: Yes, you may.
Travis: And I use my bloodaxe, and I'm going to start whacking him in his stupid plant monster face.
Matt: All right, so you use your bonus action to go into the rage, and you have two attacks, so go for it.
Laura: Yeah, kill him, Grog. Kill him!
Travis: That's a 30.
Matt: That'll hit.
Travis: For the second one, it's a 21.
Matt: That also does hit, yes. Roll damage for both of those strikes.
Travis: So the first one is a 19, plus five points of necrotic damage for 24.
Matt: All right, 24 points of damage.
Travis: And the second one! Oh shit. That's 15, plus another five points of necrotic damage for 20.
Matt: 20 points. Fantastic. So you're slamming it as hard as you can with the axe in the side. You're jamming it into the side. You can see part of its jaw split open from the impact, and you can see a gleaming of white, slick bone beneath that begins to expose from where you slammed the sharp end of the axe into it twice in a row. It's (snarling) shaking you in its grasp once more.
Travis: I've always wanted to be a dog toy!
Taliesin: Uh. I feel like we're learning a lot.
Marisha: Have you told many people that?
Travis: Now I have.
Matt: Does that end your turn, Grog? All right. Next is the croc's turn. At the beginning of its turn, you watch as the wound you just left begins to slowly seal shut. You watch the roots protruding from its body begin to suck the water, moisture, and life force from the land around it, and it begins to heal itself slowly. So some of that damage goes away.
Sam: Goes away?
Matt: It begins to heal itself, healing from the ground it's rooted into.
Travis: I probably should have tried to break the grapple.
Laura: That would've been a smart move.
Travis: I haven't hit anything in forever.
Matt: Grog. 24. I believe that hits?
Travis: Yeah, that hits.
Matt: You guys watch as the crocodile backs this way slightly, which allows Vax and Garmelie to get an attack of opportunity. Vax does hit. Well, no, it could be sneak attack, although Grog technically right now is not threatening it.
Travis: Yeah, I am. I'm hitting it with a thing!
Laura: Garmelie is standing next to him, too.
Matt: I'll let it. Sure. The timing is pretty close on this, and you'll hear why in a second.
Sam: Seven more crocs appear.
Travis: I'm about to get jacked up.
Taliesin: We'll see.
Matt: 31 points of damage from Vax. Garmelie misses. He is awesome. So as it pulls away, you guys watch as the crocodile spins around in the direction of you guys, grabs and tugs Grog, throwing him up into the air. In doing so, all of you guys get pulled this way, and Keyleth dragged behind at that point. The jaws open, and Grog vanishes down the creature's gullet.
Ashley: No!
Taliesin: We're all still tied to him!
Laura: We're all attached to him, though!
Matt: You all got dragged right to the edge of its mouth, so right now, Percy, you have the rope right at the edge of its giant snapping jaws.
Travis: We're a big set of anal beads.
Taliesin: Can he roll for gag reflex? There's a rope coming out of his throat.
Matt: This creature's pretty profound at swallowing larger entities, so that's fine. (laughter)
Matt: Anyway. Grog, you're currently blinded and restrained.
Travis: Blinded and restrained?
Matt: Yeah. Things go to darkness. You now have a general idea of what Scanlan and Vax went through, oh but a few days ago.
Travis: (singing) Hello, darkness, my old friend!
Matt: Cool. Yeah, you are completely locked inside of it right there. It also spins around as it does so, and its tail (whiplash) whips out, and you see at the very tip of its tail what looks to be some sort of strange, jagged stinger. This is going to whip around in the direction of you, Vex.
Laura: Me?
Matt: That is going to be only a 14.
Laura: Oh, good. It misses.
Matt: Yeah. You duck under it as it scrapes across the ground, causing this huge section of the dirt to grind past, leaving a small trough behind. That's going to end its turn. It is now your turn, Vex.
Laura: Me? Okay. I am going to send Trinket out and attack it with Bestial Fury.
Matt: Trinket appears at the side of it suddenly, spawning out of this strange burst of shadow energy from the center of your necklace. (roars)
Laura: Trinket, attack the thing!
Matt: Trinket happily does so. He has advantage on both of these strikes. Go for it.
Laura: Can I use my dagger that's on me to try to cut the rope that is attached to my front?
Matt: You would have to pull a dagger out, and that would be a bonus action. So you can do that now, but you wouldn't be able to cut it until next turn.
Laura: Okay. Well, I'll attack with Trinket, and I'll pull my dagger out.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Okay, that's good. Wow, I never attack with him. How about that. 26!
Matt: Hits.
Laura: It does.
Matt: Yes.
Laura: So does he do the bite attack, or does he do the claw attack?
Matt: We'll say the first one will be the bite, and then the claw.
Laura: Okay, so now he's rolling for claws. Okay, so that's a 25 for the second one.
Matt: Both hit. Roll damage for each.
Laura: Okay. Oh Jesus, I'm so stupid! Okay, that's eight?
Matt: Eight?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Eight damage, all right.
Laura: And then, for the next one he gets two claws, and he's going to use his fours. Jeez Louise. Five plus seven is 13. No, 12.
Matt: Total of 20 points of damage as Trinket tears into the side of this giant gator-like creature.
Laura: That's good! And then I cast Hunter's Mark!
Matt: As you pull your dagger out, you're like, Hunter's-- damn it. But yeah, at the beginning of your next turn, trying to hack away at that rope; that's fine. That ends your turn, Vex, unless you want to try and move.
Laura: Can I try to fly up in the air? It won't do anything. I'm stuck on the ground.
Matt: Currently, yes. And you don't have your broom at the ready.
Laura: No, so I'll stay where I am, I guess. I'll continue to be flung around.
Matt: Perfect. Well done. Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: Oh boy. A lot of my plans got swallowed.
Travis: (muffled) Help me!
Taliesin: Okay. I'm going to pull out the Retort pistol, because Bad News will not be happy at this range. First thing I'm going to do is I'm going to take a head shot. I'm going to try and blind him for the round. This is going to go great!
Sam: Laura just quit the show.
Marisha: She couldn't do it anymore.
Taliesin: See, I'm too nervous to even take Sharpshooter, so we're just going to do this clean. And I roll a natural 20. Fuck it.
Matt: Hey, Percy. You are in melee with the creature. You have disadvantage on your ranged attack. Roll again. (groaning)
Sam: Such a stickler. (cheering)
Matt: Don't even try it.
Taliesin: The trick is not to care. It's good enough. 26.
Matt: Okay, that does hit.
Taliesin: Fuck, I forgot to cast Hex. Goddamn it. Can I throw my bonus in there really quick?
Sam: There's children in the audience.
Taliesin: They watch the show; they've heard me say worse. Can I sneak Hex in there?
Matt: I would say given the fact that you said specifically that you were too nervous to do Sharpshooter, you're also too nervous to remember your Hex, but you can finish your turn with that, if you'd like.
Taliesin: I can get it in between attacks. Technically not.
Matt: No, that's true. You can do it. I'll let you.
Taliesin: It's a bonus action. I'll do whatever you say. I'm not going to fight you. I'm trying to find my d10s. Okay, here we are. So that's 11 points of piercing damage.
Matt: All right. Marking that down. What's the save DC on that?
Taliesin: The save DC is a 19 on a constitution save.
Matt: That is a 12, so yes, it is currently blinded.
Taliesin: It's not blinded. It has disadvantage on attacks until my next turn.
Matt: There we go. And you are Hexing it, you said?
Taliesin: And now I'm Hexing. I'm going to give him a disadvantage on strength checks.
Matt: Okay, good to know.
Taliesin: Strength or constitution? I'm not asking. Why am I asking people? Asking is for quitters. Still at disadvantage because of the close proximity?
Matt: Correct.
Taliesin: Is his mouth open?
Matt: The mouth is currently slightly open.
Taliesin: Am I close enough to start laying in a few shots inside?
Matt: Maybe. You can certainly try.
Taliesin: I'm going to lay in a couple shots inside. Two more shots inside with Hex attack.
Marisha: Hide behind his uvula, Grog!
Taliesin: I'm going to try and go for the sides. If I hit Grog, I don't care. He can take it. With disadvantage, that's a jam on the Retort pistol. Wait! No, that's a save reroll. Fuck my life. Okay, so that's a jam, and one to try and fix it really quickly, just trying to give it a clear, with not disadvantage, because it doesn't matter.
Matt: What did you roll as the jam?
Taliesin: One.
Matt: You rolled a natural one?
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: Okay. Roll damage, anyway.
Taliesin: Roll damage, anyway?
Matt: Yeah.
Taliesin: I hate you.
Matt: Without the Hex damage bonus.
Taliesin: That's ten points of damage.
Matt: Grog, you take ten points of piercing damage.
Taliesin: I don't have a jam?
Matt: But it does jam.
Taliesin: Okay, so I'm going to do a clear.
Matt: So as you go to fire, it splinters off, and there's a burst of smoke and the heat hurts your finger, and you hear this dull (impact) on the inside and a (grunt).
Taliesin: Sorry!
Travis: It's halved, right?
Matt: It's halved, yes.
Taliesin: One more shot.
Matt: This is to try and clear it, though. You still have to clear.
Taliesin: I tried to clear. It clears. I hit 16 plus--
Matt: Okay, yeah, so you manage to get it cleared and get it back and ready to go.
Taliesin: I don't have a third shot, but now I'm at least reloaded. Do I need another round to reload, or does that count as a reload, a clear? I can never remember.
Matt: Using it as an attack is a reload.
Taliesin: Okay, so I'll have to next turn. Okay, I'll just call that clear. The last thing I'm going to do is I'm going to move away from the crocodile with all my strength, and I'm going to say: everybody pull! And I'm backing up.
Matt: Make a strength check.
Taliesin: This is going to be so sad.
Marisha: Can we assist?
Matt: If you want to use an action on your next turn to assist with this, then yes, that'll be your action.
Taliesin: It might be fine. Oh god.
Ashley: Come on, Percy!
Taliesin: I have the worst strength. Eight.
Matt: Eight. As you say, "everyone push away!" Your feet feebly glide against the muddy surface of the riverbank as the jaws open slightly and you hear the low, guttural (growling). The breath comes pouring out into you in this strange combination of muddy swamp low tide and compost. It's delightful.
Taliesin: We technically have our hands free and are tied to the rope, so in theory we could still use our hands and just try and all shift backwards like stupid people.
Matt: But you're all mostly taut on the rope now. So you can. That's what you tried to do, and it failed miserably. That's your turn, Percy. Vax is up now. Vax tries to push inward. Actually, no. He's going to stay where he is out of range. He's going to try and throw his daggers from where he is.
Laura: Come on, brother!
Matt: He is not going to use his haste boots, though; he's going to save that for later. That's two attacks; both hit. So with the first strike and with the offhand throw. The first one with sneak attack, because it is currently next to Percy. You are threatening it at the moment.
Taliesin: I hope I have its attention.
Matt: 28 points of damage, and the second strike for a total of nine. So after Vax throws both daggers, both sink into the sides of the giant crocodile. It moves ever so slightly with the first impact, the second one seemingly to no effect. Both daggers appear in a puff of smoke to the side of his belt and he looks to you and goes, "Sister, what are we going to do?"
Laura: I don't know!
Matt: He can't really move at that point. It is now Garmelie's turn.
Laura: Oh, Garmelie!
Matt: Garmelie, who can't turn invisible, who can't use his normal tactics, is just, "Um!"
Laura: Sing a song, Garmelie! Charm him! Do something!
Matt: He pulls up a small pan flute from his side and (whistling). There's an awkward pause, and he goes, "Shit!" He then tries to scoot away as far as he can, but is once again caught between the very taut sides of the rope, unable to shift. That brings us to Pike.
Ashley: Okay! How far are we from the disgusting thing?
Matt: You guys are over here, so I'd say, from what you can gauge here, you're approximately 40 feet from it.
Ashley: 40 feet? Great. So I'm going to get a little bit closer.
Matt: You go right up to the edge of the water, toes dipping in.
Ashley: I'm going to use my trusty old friend Guiding Bolt. I'm going to Guiding Bolt his face.
Matt: Of course you are.
Ashley: And I'm going to do it at 5th-level, because my best friend is in his belly!
Sam: Pike, I'm standing right next to you.
Ashley: I know.
Matt: So that is 8d6 damage if you hit. Go ahead and roll your radiant attack against it. Spell attack bonus. Roll a d20.
Ashley: Roll a d20?
Matt: Roll a d20, add your spell attack bonus, yeah.
Ashley: Oh no. That's terrible. 15?
Matt: 15 just hits.
Laura: How many d6s?
Travis: She needs two more d6s.
Laura: I have two more. Here we go.
Matt: So 8d6 points of radiant damage, and it is currently marked for an advantage on the next attack against it, as a giant bright light now bursts across the front of its head, causing its eyes to retract and close in pain. (snarling)
Marisha: Come on. Big money, no whammies!
Travis: There's math happening.
Taliesin: It's really hard to count up here.
Sam: So exciting.
Ashley: 24.
Matt: 24. Not too shabby. 24 points of radiant damage, and the glowing divine beacon now flashing in the center of its face, causing it to close its eyes. The next person that wants to make an attack is going to have a nice little bonus. Is that the end of your turn? You're going to stay right there at the edge of the river?
Ashley: Yes.
Matt: Okay, that's the end of your turn, Pike. Scanlan, you're up.
Travis: Help me!
Sam: I can't!
Travis: Oh, you're all the way over.
Sam: I'm across the river! I'm going to help everyone else but you. Can I inspire anyone over there?
Matt: They're within 60 feet.
Sam: Okay. I'll inspire Keyleth. I'll sing to her (singing) Believe it or not, you're killing a croc! You never thought you could feel so free! Slashing away on a giant fucking croc. How can it be? Believe it or not, it's because of me! (laughter and applause)
Sam: And I will take out my Wand of Magic Missiles and fire many of them. I think if I use six charges, that's eight darts.
Matt: That's a lot of missiles.
Sam: It's not very powerful, though, and I would not like to shoot at the croc. I would like to shoot at every segment of rope between every single person. (cheering)
Matt: After the flash of the Guiding Bolt, the rest of the party, you look across the way as you see Scanlan, after singing this delightful song, turn around Rambo-style and release this burst of arcane energy. These arcane darts come firing straight towards the croc, and in a moment of excitement, expecting each of these impacts to blast into the side of this creature, they suddenly soar up into the sky and arc down towards each of you. Before you have a moment to really react, the word leaving your voice, "What?" They streak back down, slamming into each side of the rope, causing it to burst into frayed, burnt rope chunks and pieces of twine, all hanging loosely to your sides. All of you guys are now free to move about as you wish.
Sam: And for my movement, I will grab Pike around the waist and pull us back five feet off the edge of the pond there. Thanks.
Matt: Well done. Top of the round again. Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: Okay! You have advantage on the next hit on it?
Matt: Anybody. Whoever has the next attack roll against it has advantage.
Marisha: I am going to cast 5th-level Blight on him. He is a plant creature! I get how much extra?
Matt: Well, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage and the spell deals maximum damage to it. So what's the spell DC of this?
Marisha: 19.
Sam: Here's the big roll, guys.
Matt: 19. You can come look at it if you want to.
Audience: Disadvantage!
Matt: I understand. (chuckles) 15. This is going to suck. So that is 64 points of necrotic damage.
Marisha: I said, spit him out! That is caca! Spit it out!
Matt: As you clench your hand like this, you guys watch as the roots that connect to its body suddenly begin to wither and dry out. You watch as the outside bark then cracks and turn to ash and dust at its side, and its once verdant green hide begins to curl into this dull gray, lifeless husk. The creature's eyes spring open, and its low, guttural growl turns to this horrible shrieking pain sound. From the inside, Grog, you feel everything tense around you as its form all of a sudden is being drained of the life essence and water that keeps it going. It manages to recover, and the life pumps back into parts of it, but that sucked. That is not a happy creature. (applause)
Matt: Oh, that was fun to build the tension on that one. All right, Keyleth, that's your action. What else would you like to do for your turn?
Marisha: I want to move and flank him a little bit if I can. Get on his six. The other way.
Matt: All right, so you move past to this side.
Marisha: That's good. Closer, a little bit, to him. One more closer.
Matt: Sure, closer's great.
Marisha: No, back one! Back! No, it's fine.
Matt: Grog, you're up. You're currently still constrained inside its body. The tautness of the rope around your waist has gone slack, so in a moment, you realize either your friends are dead, or they managed to break the rope. You would think that, if you weren't so full of anger and rage at being shot and squeezed and devoured by a giant crocodile. What are you doing?
Travis: Can I reach the jug at all?
Matt: We'll say you can take your action to reach into your Bag of Holding and pull it out, yes.
Sam: I thought he had it out already. It was on his head, right?
Matt: Well, he had it out earlier. Have you had it on your head this whole time?
Travis: I had it tilted up so I could see.
Matt: If that was the case, the sheer force of the creature biting you initially and throwing you onto the bank would've tossed that jug quite a ways away from you.
Laura: Then it wasn't there.
Travis: Yeah, we'll retcon that shit. It was in my pocket.
Matt: That's what I thought. So do you want to spend your action to rummage through the Bag of Holding and pull out the jar?
Travis: And that's my action?
Matt: That would be your action, yes. You can use your bonus action to attack because you're in a frenzied rage.
Travis: No, fuck it.
Taliesin: You're still raging, too, because I hit you.
Travis: Yeah, but I can't hit anything. I'm like this.
Matt: You have disadvantage on your attacks. You can still attack him from the inside.
Travis: Can I take the Titanstone Knuckles, smash them together-- (cheering)
Travis: Can I cast Enlarge on myself?
Matt: You can certainly try. Is that what you want to do?
Travis: Yeah, I'll try that.
Matt: As your mind is suddenly clouded with the thought of, "Jug! I need to get the jug... No." You feel your body, your physical form begin to ripple and swell. You guys watch as the crocodile, now currently recovering from the blight-like withering of its form, suddenly its eyes go wide once more as its gullet begins to swell wider and wider. You hear this low (retching), like a cat coughing up a hairball slowed down, as you watch an enlarged Grog get immediately vomited up and out of the creature to its side.
Sam: His favored terrain is vomit.
Matt: Yes, you do have benefits to that. So yes. You manage to do that, sir.
Travis: So I get puked out. Can I use whatever movement speed I have left to drag the daisy chain with me away from the crocodile?
Matt: Okay. As you rush away, he gets an attack of opportunity on you.
Travis: Oh yeah. It got separated.
Matt: It does have disadvantage because you shot it last turn. Which is good, because the second roll was a natural 20. That's a total of 20 to hit. What's your armor class?
Travis: 20.
Matt: Okay, so it just hits you with the bite.
Sam: Can I Cutting Words him?
Matt: You do have a reaction, so yes, you may.
Sam: Okay. I will Cutting Words him. I'll say Mm-Grog (vocalizing) Grog (vocalizing). Yeah! It's supposed to distract him.
Matt: Yeah, it's not inspiring somebody. It is intended to distract the opponent. And this crocodile, probably having a rather rough time in the early 2000s, manages to provide even more bile from its stomach at the sound of a rehashed Hanson song. Go ahead and make your roll.
Sam: What do I roll?
Matt: You roll your inspiration die.
Sam: Eight.
Matt: No, it's a d10.
Sam: d10? Eight.
Matt: You were intent on that happening. As it reaches out to try and bite towards Grog, it hears the sound and its head quirks, vomits a little. Grog, you manage to get away, at that point, we'll say about that far. As you turn around, the daisy chain has not followed you. Glancing down, the rope that was once around your waist has snapped by the growth in size, and all the rest of the ropes have also been snapped. Sorry.
Laura: Hey, you're out!
Matt: Perfect. That ends your turn. It is now the croc's turn. It's going to make a bite attack right now. This is going to be at Percy, since you're right there in front of him.
Taliesin: Bring it!
Sam: Don't worry. I won't sing Hanson again.
Matt: With disadvantage, that is a 23.
Taliesin: That hits.
Matt: That hits you. All right, as the head turns back towards you, it opens to the side and tries to clamp on you.
Taliesin: I'm using my new fancy counter.
Marisha: Yeah, your counter ring.
Taliesin: I'm so excited to take damage.
Matt: That is a 34.
Taliesin: I'm not that excited to take damage. 34?
Matt: 34 points of piercing damage, and you are currently grappled and restrained.
Taliesin: Grappled and restrained.
Marisha: Wait, he's in the crocodile's mouth now?
Matt: The crocodile has now snapped, its jaws moving to Percy, and Percy, you're currently held tight in its jaws. It's trying to lift you up now, possibly to fill its now terribly empty stomach. It lost more than it originally started this battle with. As it swings around its tail, in doing so, its stinger sweeps overhead. It has a reach of ten at this point. We'll say in that arc there. This is going to be towards Vex. Towards you Vex, with disadvantage. Still, that's a 21. What's your armor class?
Laura: Fuck! I mean, 20.
Matt: 20, okay, so it still hits you. All right, so the stinger (whipcrack) grinds itself into your flesh, tears through the armor separation there, and you can feel pulsing. I need you to go ahead and make a constitution saving throw.
Laura: Because that's my strength.
Taliesin: You got this.
Laura: Do I?
Taliesin: You do.
Laura: Ten!
Matt: Well, you take 16 points of piercing damage from the actual stinger itself striking you. You now feel that pulse of venom through your body, and as it begins to swell through you, you feel all the colors and all the images of the landscape around you begin to shift and bubble and move.
Marisha: You're tripping, man.
Matt: You are tripping balls right now. You look to your left and see Garmelie next to you, whose frightened expression becomes suddenly this giant feral wolverine that hisses at you! You look to your right, and you see the giant crocodile holding Percy suddenly merge into one strange, giant Medusa creature. You don't know which way is up and down, and you are extremely frightened and confused.
Marisha: You're frightened? Oh no, it's a bad trip.
Laura: Does that mean I lose my turn?
Matt: Well, that ends the crocodile's turn, and it is now your turn. Currently, you cannot take reactions, and I need you to roll a d8 to see what you do.
Sam: Wait, it could be anything?
Matt: (chuckles) You're so stunned by this moment, and your brain being completely turned around. What did you roll?
Laura: I rolled a five.
Matt: Roll of five. Okay. You take no action, and you use all of your movement to move in a random direction. You go into the river. You turn around and begin to flee. Looking ahead of you, you see what seems to be a moving sea of grass, and all of a sudden you feel your feet (splashing). The river begins to pull you away at the end of your turn.
Marisha: Son of a bitch. Oh shit.
Laura: Bye!
Matt: Make another constitution saving throw.
Laura: Oh, good. Okay. Oh, natural 20!
Ashley: She turns back time.
Matt: As soon as your vision comes back to you and a breath of relief hits your form as suddenly you have control of your form. As it begins to be sucked under the water. End of your turn. Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: So I'm grappled. There's nothing I can do.
Matt: You're restrained. You can attack. You can't move, and all your attacks have disadvantage.
Taliesin: And everything I have, at least at the moment, anything with a gun is at disadvantage. Oh, but I've got Hex on him, so even if I hit him with a sword, it's an extra d6. I'm going to try and start hacking him to let me go. Ooh! Weird question. If I use the drop-it effect, the grit drop an item, can I get him to drop me, as an item?
Matt: I don't think you count as an item, I'm sorry.
Taliesin: Sticking him in the jaw, I can't get him to? I can't make him roll to drop?
Matt: I don't think that's how it works. It's not like you hit a couple fingers and they drop a cup. This is a massive muscle currently clamped on you, trying to swallow you.
Taliesin: I was hoping.
Matt: I know. Sorry.
Taliesin: Okay, in that case, I'm going to grab my sword and start hacking at him.
Matt: Okay, so we'll say you use your bonus action to draw your weapon. It's right there by your side. You pull it out. Go ahead and make your attacks against the crocodile.
Taliesin: Okay, that's a 15?
Matt: 15 just barely hits.
Sam: Okay. You had advantage on them.
Taliesin: Did I? No, I don't have advantage for these.
Matt: Actually, technically it would have been the first attack since Pike's Guiding Bolt. Thank you for the reminder of that. So it would've been a normal attack.
Taliesin: That was the first attack since her Guiding Bolt?
Marisha: No, I thought I attacked.
Matt: Yours didn't have a spell attack, it just instantly hit and made a save. So technically, what was your first roll?
Taliesin: 15.
Matt: Yeah, you hit.
Taliesin: Okay. The next roll wasn't a 20, so it doesn't matter, anyway.
Matt: The Guiding Bolt wears off. However, that did manage to get rid of the disadvantage on that one strike. Seeing the bright side of its face, you take your blade out and hack downward for the first hit, which does strike true across the side of its face. You can make your next two attacks.
Taliesin: That's 28. MATT Those do have disadvantage.
Taliesin: Okay, in that case, natural 20. Oh, it has disadvantage, though, so it's still the 28.
Sam: Matt, if I can be a stickler, I also Cutting Wordsed him, so that puts him at disadvantage on a save.
Matt: On his next saving throw, but he's not making a saving throw.
Sam: This is a kangaroo court!
Matt: And if I'm going to be a stickler here, Sam. The next time he has a saving throw, I'll keep the disadvantage in mind.
Laura: Oh, you're in trouble, Samuel.
Taliesin: All right, so that hit, and then for my last one... That's not bad. 21.
Matt: Yeah, all three strikes hit. Go ahead and roll damage on all those.
Taliesin: Let me get my new d8. That's super. Oh, I can get all my d8s. And then 3d6 for some necrotic damage. So that's 13 points of necrotic damage and 37 points of slashing damage.
Marisha: Kill it!
Matt: Slamming into the side of its face, you begin splitting open a section of the side of its head. You can see its cracked, withered form from the Blight spell earlier has become a little more brittle, and each impact is cutting deeper than any of the previous hits has. We're going to take a quick break here. Five, ten-minute break to use the restroom, and return to the apex of this battle. [break]
Travis: Is this for me? Motherfuckers!
Laura: You're so low.
Taliesin: Oh, god, that game again.
Laura: Grog? It's all for Grog? Is it just for you?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: So on Vax's turn... Vax is going to go ahead and dart around this way, behind Garmelie, getting to where Trinket is flanking along the river bend there.
Laura: Oh, are we just right back in?
Matt: As he does pull out of the range of the tail, the croc can go ahead and make an attack of opportunity with the stinger out towards him behind. That is not going to hit, that is a natural four. That's going to be like a 16, so yeah. As it swings with its tail wide to Vax, Vax ducks beneath it, arms up to the side, leaps in the air and catches himself right on the edge of the bank. He looks over and notices you, running off to the side.
Laura: Me! Me, help me.
Matt: Immediately decides to put his daggers back away, and then uses a dash action to dart over to the edge of the river where you are, and is going to reach out and try and grab your arms. You guys are reaching for each other right now. That is how it's going to go for this moment. That brings us to Garmelie, who now, free of the rope circumstance and the chaos around, looks and sees you out in the river, scoots around, goes out with, grabs your brother's arm and then reaches out towards your arm and chains his way towards you, putting his hand towards you.
Laura: Garmelie's helping!
Marisha: Garmelie!
Matt: "Grab!"
Laura: Okay!
Taliesin: It's a sign he's going to turn on us at any moment.
Laura: I know.
Matt: So you guys grab and link arms. At that point he's going to go ahead and make a strength check to pull you out of the roaring rapids. Okay. He manages to hold in the moment, but doesn't actually get any ground on pulling you out of the river, so now it's just him and Vax holding you at the edge. The river's pulling you harder and harder, and you can feel the actual swell getting stronger, but they're still managing to keep you in place. That ends his turn. Pike, you're up.
Ashley: Okay. How is the monster crocodile plant doing? Is he looking rough?
Matt: He's looking hurt.
Ashley: Is he regenerating himself?
Matt: You've noticed each time it's had a moment to itself, its roots have dug in and it's pulled back into its form, yeah. It has been still regenerating every round, yes.
Ashley: That's bullshit.
Travis: It really is.
Ashley: You know what? I'm going to hold off on that then. No, you know what? I'm going to Flame Strike him.
Matt: What are you doing on him?
Ashley: Just the old Flame Strike.
Matt: Sure. All righty. Where do you want that Flame Strike to land?
Ashley: Just on his whole body.
Matt: Wherever you see it, onto the middle of its body.
Ashley: Oh, where do I want to see it? Maybe his torso area.
Laura: Where it won't hurt anybody else around.
Matt: As you look over in the distance, unable to really see beyond the form of the creature, you bring the Flame Strike down onto its form. It's going to make a saving throw with disadvantage because of your Cutting Words, which is good because it rolled a 17 for the first one. And it rolled a 15 for the second one. No dex bonus for it because it's not very fast. Your DC is?
Ashley: 18.
Matt: 18, yes. 8d6 radiant damage. Go ahead and roll that.
Laura: Wait, here's some more d6. Take them.
Matt: That's a ten-foot radius. I'll say for the sake of knowledge in the area, too, and seeing Trinket attack, you manage to pull it out of the range of the bear, not wanting to ignite him. Scanlan, you're up next.
Sam: Yeah, I know.
Matt: How much fire and divine damage?
Ashley: 28.
Matt: 28 points of damage. As you guys see this gathering of small reddish and white divine particles circle in the air, faster and faster, and then (boom) a column of divine flame strikes from the heavens, blasting into the side of this creature. It rears back (roars) in pain as you see now its slightly withered, blight-impacted grayish-green back is now burnt to a black crisp, and smoke begins to rise off of its form. It's very pissed off.
Travis: Monster!
Matt: Is that the end of your turn, Pike? Are you going to stay where you are?
Ashley: How's everybody doing?
Taliesin: I'm a little iffy, but I'm okay.
Ashley: You're a little iffy? Yeah, I want to Healing Word Percy.
Matt: What's the range on it?
Ashley: 60 feet.
Matt: 60 feet? Yeah, you can get to him from there.
Ashley: Okay.
Laura: I don't know. So you heal him.
Ashley: All right, so I'll heal him.
Matt: So you're casting Healing Word at second level?
Ashley: Yeah.
Matt: Go for it. Roll the dice.
Taliesin: What is that? How many-- oh, she's rolling dice.
Ashley: 19.
Taliesin: 19. That's nice.
Matt: All right. Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: Okay. I don't know, man.
Matt: Real fast, Pike. That was 2d4 plus five?
Ashley: Oh, isn't it my spellcasting modifier?
Matt: No, just add plus five.
Ashley: Okay, so then it would be 13, because I rolled two fours.
Matt: All right. Scanlan, what are you doing?
Sam: Is it a large creature? I know it's large, but how large?
Matt: It would be classified as a huge creature.
Sam: Okay. Well, then forget that. Okay, I'm going to Eyebite him with my eyes of craziness. Put up the hand cone, and I'm going to try to make him sick.
Matt: All righty, so let's take its wisdom saving throw against your DC. That is a six with no modifier. It is certainly sickened, though its disadvantage has worn off, of course.
Taliesin: There's so many rings on it. It's great.
Sam: And I won't really move, but I will inspire Grog, because he needs to hit something, man.
Travis: I'm telling you.
Sam: I'll inspire him with a limerick. A warning from your favorite bard: In the Feywild, you should be on guard. I went off to take a shitter, and saw, like, a thousand Critters. (cheering)
Sam: And they kind of made me hard! (cheering)
Matt: Take your inspiration die, Grog. All right, staying where you are, Scanlan?
Sam: Staying where I am.
Matt: Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: Oh! It's me! Oh dear god. Okay. I am going to do what worked really well last time, and I'm going to do a 4th-level Blight. And what I want to do is, I want to take my staff, because I'm near him, right?
Matt: You are.
Marisha: Okay, I want to take my staff, and where Pike put that nice little crispy donut hole in the middle of him, I want to take my staff right in the middle and bring it down and cast Blight.
Matt: All righty. Saving throw against the DC with disadvantage. A six and an eight. (laughter and applause)
Matt: How do you want to do this? (cheering and chanting "Keyleth")
Marisha: That's the coolest thing that's ever happened to me.
Matt: You hear the phantom chanting in the back of your head. How do you want to do this?
Marisha: My ego loves this. Is Percy still in his mouth?
Matt: Percy is still in its mouth, yes.
Marisha: Okay, I'm going to say  Stop putting foreign objects in your mouth!
Matt: As you slam your staff into the ground with a giant ripple, all of a sudden you watch as the various plant growth in the ground begins to turn to a dark black gray at the base of the staff. It curls across the ground, like the actual line of blighted death and decay seems to spear out across. It manages to catch the bottom and sink up the roots of the creature. As it begins to swell up into its body, you see it taking form. How do you want the Blight spell to take hold in its body?
Marisha: It takes hold? Okay. How about this? You know the petrified forests in Arizona? Can I petrify him?
Matt: All right, so as the Blight spell spirals across his body like a spider web, crackling, it begins to (snarl). It rears up with its arms out in front of it taut, the muscles locking up like this giant arching statue, its jaws up in the air holding Percy aloft. (laughter)
Matt: You hear the scraping and cracking of bark and dried plant matter, its entire form slightly squeaking as it becomes a solid, petrified piece of plant matter, the life force now drained from it. The roots at its sides crack and turn to ash. Part of its form tends to sink to one side of the mud, and now this once very dangerous-looking creature is solid, dead plant matter, holding a wiggling and very unhappy human. (cheering)
Marisha: Hey, Percy! How's the weather up there?
Taliesin: Ow!
Laura: I would be cheering for you if I wasn't drowning at this very moment.
Matt: On that note, too, I need you to make a strength check.
Laura: Oh. Well, that's a 15 there. Actually, that's a straight check. That's not a saving throw?
Matt: Right, just a check.
Laura: 13.
Matt: (chuckles) You and Vax and Garmelie still hold your ground, but unfortunately, not a whole lot of physical strength in this daisy chain right now.
Laura: Can I ask Trinket to come up and help?
Matt: You can, yes. And Trinket rushes over. (moans) Comes up behind Vax and bites the back of his cloak and begins tugging on him as he's now being slightly strangled by the bear. Pulled back toward Trinket, adding his strength to that. What's Trinket's strength bonus?
Laura: Yeah. Four! He's stronger than me.
Matt: With a roll of a 17, that brings it to a 21. Whereas you began to pull them in towards the river, Trinket makes up the back end of it and manages to drag all of you out of the wake, onto the side. As you get up and cough out the water, Trinket comes up to you and nuzzles you on the side of your face.
Laura: Thanks, buddy.
Matt: (moans)
Laura: I get up and hug Garmelie. What! You saved me. You're wonderful.
Matt: "What was I supposed to do, watch you drown? No! We're almost to the end of our agreement."
Laura: I tousle his hair. Good job, Keyleth!
Marisha: Thanks.
Laura: How you doing, Percy?
Taliesin: Grog, could you help with this?
Travis: Do I get to chop down a tree, finally? (laughter)
Taliesin: I really wanted alligator boots, but I suppose that will do. Please help.
Travis: Do I get to chop him? I start chopping down the petrified alligator tree!
Laura: Trinket, catch him when he falls.
Taliesin: What?
Matt: Trinket rushes up and looks up at you underneath with open jaws.
Taliesin: No!
Matt: As Grog, large Grog, comes lumbering up. (heavy footsteps, whack) With one clean hit, the bloodaxe carves straight through its body, causing the upper part of the torso to slam into the ground with a big speed. Upon the impact, it rolls a few feet, taking Percy in its jaws.
Taliesin: Oh, ow!
Matt: You do suffer two points of damage from it, but eventually you hit a point in the bank where the jaw cracks into a hundred pieces, and you tumble onto the ground and catch your breath, after being restrained for so long.
Taliesin: I stand up and kick one of them.
Marisha: Keyleth wants to get down on the grass that she hurt, and I want to cast Druidcraft and heal it, and talk to the grass, and be like: It wasn't personal. I hope you know you were not the intended target, you just happened to be caught in the fray. It's okay. Don't be mad.
Matt: As you extend your fingers about you, you see small strands of green go (popping) and you hear a hundred soft voices go, "Eh."
Marisha: I like your enthusiasm, grass.
Laura: All right. How are you doing over there, gnomesies?
Ashley: Come on, you should get over here! No rush, but.
Taliesin: All right, there's a river.
Sam: Don't forget to loot the body?
Laura: There's nothing to loot on the petrified alligator, is there?
Taliesin: Actually, there's an empty stomach, isn't there?
Travis: It's made of petrified wood.
Taliesin: I'm going to stick my head in and see if there's anything in there.
Matt: Okay. The very tiny, pressed stomach interior of this creature, petrified as it is, it's like staring into one of those weird high school science room half-man organ presentation statues. You can see where the folds of the stomach lining are. There appear to be some remnants of bone, some entities that were partially digested, but nothing that catches your eye to be something worth pulling out of it.
Taliesin: Just for fun, Grog, smash this.
Travis: Okay! (whack)
Matt: And with that, (shatter) the pieces of it go scattered all across the ground. Elements of it tumble into the water and get washed away. It is no more.
Travis: How was that?
Taliesin: Anything exciting come out?
Matt: Many small, petrified crocodile pieces.
Taliesin: I'm going to pick one up and bring it to Keyleth. For you. Well done. (applause)
Marisha: I get a souvenir from the Feywild! That's all I wanted.
Travis: We've got two more rivers, right?
Matt: One more, technically. You guys have all made your way across. There's one last one that leads to the outskirts of the Shademirk.
Laura: I want to keep perception check up to make sure we don't run into another one of those fuckers.
Matt: Go ahead and make a perception check.
Travis: Listen, hey, is anybody near death? I'm super big right now. How about I just throw everybody across the river?
Ashley: I'll go.
Travis: You want to?
Marisha: I'm in.
Travis: Can I throw Pike across the river?
Matt: Make a strength check.
Laura: Yeah, Pike's already across. 22 for perception.
Travis: Wait. I need you to smack me in the face first. (impact) I would like to rage! Natural 20.
Ashley: I'm going to get in a ball.
Matt: Which you have disadvantage on. Hold on, because you took a point of exhaustion from frenzied raging during the battle. However, you do get advantage on strength checks while raging, so it's a singular roll, so the natural 20 stands. So as you pick Pike up, she smacks you in the face. The grin crawls across, and you (whoosh) lob her. She lands in the top of a tree. You see (cracking) in the bushes as a few leaves dangle down. You can see some gloppy black stuff out of the side, and you hear this muffled voice in the distance as Pike landed okay.
Ashley: She's laughing. That was awesome!
Travis: Should I try and skip Vax across the river? (laughter)
Marisha: Yeah, do it.
Matt: Vax says, "I'd rather run." And he goes running forward and attempts to make a leap across the river. He leaps, makes it most of the way, catches his ankle on the edge, and begins to flutter backward.
Travis: That's what you get, stupid!
Laura: Can't you save him? Aren't you on the other side?
Sam: I'm looking at the trees. I'm hanging out.
Matt: Yeah. However, he does manage to right himself. He only got partially into the river and managed to pull his way out, so he's fine. Grog, who are you throwing next?
Travis: Who's next?
Taliesin: I'll go.
Travis: Yeah, Percy's next! Can I granny shot this one?
Matt: Go for it. Strength check.
Travis: 19.
Matt: (grunts) You lob him. It's enough to get you across, but the landing is not very graceful.
Taliesin: Can I acrobatics check this to try and make the landing?
Marisha: Three-point landing.
Taliesin: That'll be a 21.
Matt: 21. You manage to use the actual momentum to go into a shoulder roll, stumble forward, and you come to a standing point. However, when you do, you realize you rolled through a bunch of slick, tar-like muck, and the side of your jacket is now seeping with it.
Taliesin: I was already covered in crocodile bile.
Matt: There you go. You feel balanced.
Taliesin: This is another layer of sadness.
Travis: Who's next?
Laura: I'll go next. But I want to bring out my broom and hold it in my hand.
Travis: In the spirit of the Olympic games, can I shot put her?
Matt: Make a strength check. You see Trinket come up.
Laura: Come on!
Matt: Trinket goes into your necklace.
Travis: Oh shit. No, it's not. It's a 23. I'm strong as fuck.
Matt: I would say the lighter half of the twins, but I think they're an equal weight class. You grab her by the side and (whoosh, grunt) launch her into the air. You catch your stomach contents. Make an acrobatics check.
Laura: That's okay. That's a 28, man.
Matt: You actually catch yourself on the side of the tree, landing, and then leap off of it with the last bit of momentum, stepping gingerly on the tips of your feet.
Ashley: I clap from however far away I am.
Matt: You hear muffled clapping in the tree boughs ahead of you.
Laura: I fly up and I grab Pike down from the tree. Can I do that?
Matt: She's about 15 feet up.
Laura: Oh. I fly 15 feet up and grab Pike.
Ashley: Thanks! I didn't know how I was going to get down.
Travis: Are you left?
Marisha: I'm left.
Travis: Do you want to go with me as I jump across, or should I throw you?
Laura: Piggy-back that shit, Keyleth!
Sam: I wave my hands and say I'll catch you, Kiki!
Marisha: Okay. You want to shot put this one?
Travis: No, it's going to be fast-pitch softball.
Marisha: Okay.
Travis: No, wait. I'm going to be a long snapper in football and turn around. (laughter)
Sam: I will receive that. Set!
Travis: 19!
Marisha: Hut!
Matt: (grunts) With a big long toss, you make it most of the way over the water and begin to descend very close on the opposite side of the bank. Make an acrobatics check.
Sam: Use your new dice!
Marisha: No, fuck that new dice. Nine. Not great.
Matt: The good news is, you miss the river. The bad news is, you Warner Brothers cartoon faceplant into the actual ground on the opposite side. (laughter)
Matt: Suffering 11 points of damage, and as Percy pulls you up, your entire front of your face and the little bit of hair in the crown is caked with this tar-like substance. Your nostrils are filled with it. You can't open your eyes. It tastes like IHOP. It's terrible.
Ashley: Hey!
Matt: Tonight's episode of Critical Role, not brought to you by IHOP. And probably never will be.
Ashley: There goes our IHOP sponsorship.
Marisha: I gag a little, try to keep it down. Try to wash my face if I can.
Sam: Who's left? Garmelie?
Laura: Oh, Garmelie!
Matt: Garmelie's on the side. He goes, "Don't worry. You first."
Laura: No, he's going to leave. I mean, he can. I guess you got us all the way here, didn't you?
Matt: "Once he's across, our accord is complete."
Travis: Oh yeah. No, totally. Come here, bitch.
Matt: "No!" Roll an attack. Well, technically, this is a grapple, so it's an athletics check.
Travis: A 20. Total.
Matt: You reach out and his eyes go wide and he darts around, and your fingers barely catch the edge of his fur, and you get enough of a hold to lift him off the ground. He's now dangling from your giant half-giant ass hand. "No! I don't have to go there! I'm just going back the other way when we're done!"
Travis: Oh, no, yeah, I totally hear what you're saying. We're going for a ride, bitch. And I back up.
Matt: Make an athletics check.
Travis: 20 again. 12 plus eight.
Matt: Your large, bounding form (heavy footsteps, impact, scream). As you make it across, you hit the other side. The actual bank shifts, and you guys feel the impact on the other side beneath your feet, and there's a small crater in the ground where you landed, and the river bank slowly fills it in as it lowers it just below river water level. Garmelie is now clutching your arm, his hands and legs wrapped around your forearm. (laughter)
Matt: His head was on the other side. He eventually loosens his grip, plops to the ground, and dusts himself off a bit. "Very well. Welcome to the Shademirk. Good luck."
Laura: We made it!
Travis: You don't want to see what happens at the end of the journey? You want to come with us, right?
Matt: He looks past you, and you all turn and look into the Shademirk. At this point, you can see the bog itself is an endless dumping form of sludge into the Gilded Run. The water itself is barely tearing it away, what you guys noticed before. The black oily material is itself thick, ichor-like tar. The smell that you're very familiar with, that horrible, acrid, sulfurous scent is very thick in the area, mixed with a terrible rotting leaf and decay. You see bubbles going (bubbling) and churning up in certain parts of it, and there are elements where you see knotted and gnarled roots that tangle up above the surface. It is the most uninviting place in nature you've ever seen and experienced, and you can see in the distance the swamp trees with high root sections overhead so you can walk underneath are scattered throughout ahead of you. Garmelie slowly turns his head back to you and goes, "No, I'm all right. But I appreciate that. Be careful. Don't stay in one place too long. The longer you stand still, the harder it gets to escape the place you stood. And there's a lot of things that tend to live here, from what I've heard, that wait for stillness as a means of attack. So keep moving."
Laura: Keep moving.
Travis: What kinds of things?
Matt: "I don't know. It's time for me to go. Thank you guys so much. I appreciate this. It's been something."
Laura: Wait, before he goes, I want to give him a kiss on his head.
Matt: A little kiss on the head, and he goes, "Well, at least it's been a pleasure travelling with you, my lady." He takes your hand and does a little bow and (kiss) on the edge.
Laura: As I was kissing him, can I give him a little pat down to make sure he didn't steal anything? (laughter and applause)
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Laura: 23.
Matt: 23? As you feel down, you feel this slight little bump inside of his fur, and you're afraid to touch it for fear of it being-- on the outside of his body! Not that you understand the physicality of the satyr, but still. It's hard and smooth. And appears to wiggle loosely when you touch it.
Laura: Well, now I feel wrong saying I reach for it and try to see what it is.
Matt: Do you reach for it?
Laura: Yeah!
Matt: All right.
Marisha: You're committed now.
Matt: Grasping onto it, you tug, and pull forth the small onyx mastiff that you had found earlier in the campground.
Laura: I take it back.
Matt: He goes, "Oh, that's right. I was holding this for you."
Laura: Thank you so much. You're so kind.
Travis: The little black dog statue? Oh, I like that thing.
Matt: "Fantastic. Well, wish you all the best of luck. Stay alive."
Travis: Wait a minute. How do you plan on getting back across the rivers?
Matt: "I have my ways." And he turns invisible. You see little sludgy footprints go off down the shore and around the bend.
Marisha: Bye!
Taliesin: Cast Hunter's Mark really quick.
Laura: Oh, on him? Can I cast Hunter's Mark on him really quick?
Matt: What do you want to do?
Laura: Can I cast Hunter's Mark on him?
Matt: You cannot currently see him now. He's already vanished.
Laura: Sorry. I should've done it when I was kissing him, but I was distracted by feeling him up.
Matt: It happens. All right, so what are you guys going to do?
Travis: Awesome. So we're across the rivers. Everything gets worse now, and we can't stop moving.
Taliesin: We should move until it's time to camp, and when we camp, we should camp in your palacious...
Laura: Oh, in the mansion.
Sam: I've got the mansion.
Laura: Thank god.
Marisha: Are we in the bog now?
Matt: This would be the tangleward tip of it, the southern tip of the bog, yes.
Marisha: I want to test and see if we sink when we step on the bog.
Matt: Okay. You step onto it, and your foot descends about three inches before it comes to a stop. (squelch)
Marisha: It comes to a stop.
Matt: But as you go to remove your foot, (sucking sound). It's very sticky. Effectively, you guys are at half movement moving through the bog.
Laura: I cast Pass Without Trace on us so that we can be stealthy. She doesn't have mist form, not until we rest.
Marisha: I could rest and learn mist, and we can mist across. That was what I was going to say.
Travis: Is it a treeline? Are we into trees?
Matt: Yeah, it is a very thickly wooded swamp now. The ground floor and the base of most of the trees, and occasionally dripping from the top of the canopy itself is that black, sludge-like material.
Travis: It's dripping from the trees?
Matt: It's seemingly seeping from everything.
Laura: I have Land's Stride. Does that mean that this doesn't affect me? Or am I still slowed down?
Matt: Read out Land's Stride to me.
Laura: Land's Stride isn't on any of my pieces of paper. Oh, wait. Here it is. Moving through non-magical difficult terrain costs you no movement.
Matt: Technically, yes, you can move at your normal pace. The rest of the party still has to stay slowed.
Laura: Then I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to pull out my broom and I'm going to let the gnomes ride on it, since you guys will sink down a little bit more than the rest of us. Do you want to ride on the broom?
Sam: How do we do that?
Laura: You sit on it, and then you fly.
Sam: Do we have to say a magical word?
Laura: I'll say it for you.
Taliesin: I don't think it works that way. I think you have to tell them, and then they have to say it.
Laura: Oh, really?
Matt: You can try. It's up to you.
Laura: Sit on it.
Sam: Okay. Whenever a woman tells me to sit on something, I do. (laughter)
Ashley: Do you want front or back?
Travis: Yeah, sit on it! Front or back?
Sam: I'll sit front, so you can have your arms around me.
Ashley: Okay.
Laura: That's sweet. (hacking spit)
Matt: Okay. As you guys get up onto the broom, you release it from your grasp, and it goes (splat) onto the ground. Both of you guys sink about three or four inches into the ground.
Laura: Say (hacking spit).
Ashley: (hacking spit).
Sam: (hacking spit).
Matt: It lifts up and pulls you guys slowly out of the sludge, (squelch) finally freeing yourself, and you're now hovering a very short distance above the ground.
Laura: So at least you guys and me aren't slowed down, so that's good.
Sam: Bye, guys!
Travis: By the way, now that we're out of all this shit, can we look around and see if Ukurat has been peeping us this entire time?
Laura: Can we see him?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Laura: We're not in the forest anymore? This is bog?
Travis: 15.
Matt: Right now, technically it's swamp, yeah. Not considered forest.
Taliesin: 16.
Laura: 20.
Sam: 16 here.
Marisha: Oh my god! It's a 31.
Matt: As you guys take a moment to look out in the distance, you're unable to really make any idea of a form or movement. Keyleth, you do see on the tree on the other bank, it looks a little thicker towards the top than you expect, and as you take a moment to glance, you can see a rather large creature drop down from the canopy onto the ground, and then slink behind it.
Laura: So he's checking us out.
Matt: He's following you.
Laura: So he's going to be able to get across all these rivers?
Taliesin: Apparently, he's fine.
Laura: He's pretty cool. He can jump really far.
Marisha: I give him a-- from a distance.
Matt: He shrinks sideways against the tree and is now barely visible, other than his furry chest that's now peeking out one side of the width of the tree.
Marisha: I give him a--
Matt: No reaction. Vax at this point is like, "So are we going to move on, then?"
Laura: Yes, but stealthily.
Matt: "Let's do it." Make a stealth check, guys.
Laura: I cast Pass Without Trace on us, so we all got plus ten.
Ashley: Oh!
Laura: Did you get something good?
Ashley: I did.
Travis: I fucked it all up. (laughter)
Sam: 32.
Matt: 32?
Sam: I rolled a natural 20. (cheering)
Matt: Percy.
Taliesin: 33.
Matt: Keyleth.
Marisha: 24.
Matt: All right, Vex.
Laura: 32.
Matt: 32! Pike.
Ashley: I rolled a 30. I'm so quiet!
Matt: And over here we have 12-foot-tall Grog. What did you roll?
Travis: I rolled a 14.
Matt: You guys begin trudging forward into the Shademirk. Everyone's being kind of... and he's lumbering through it like a mammoth.
Travis: We're being sneaky, guys!
Matt: You all shush him, and you find ways to cushion his footfalls. As unstealthy as you may be in the moment, the rest of the party helps try to keep you going forward the best they can, being unheard. You guys continue forward for about 30 minutes, not really understanding the direction. You know that heavy mountain that you saw on the way in is central and to the right of your direction, and you're not entirely certain where the tree is here in the Shademirk, but you're keeping your eyes peeled, and you continue to move forward further and further in. It is difficult. It is hot. It is muggy. There are heavy insects, large winged bugs (buzzing) through the air, and you knock them away. The bubbling of the ground itself is releasing sulfurous gas and various other chemicals into the air that are probably not healthy to breathe extensively. Many of you are having to cover your mouth to keep from coughing to break up your stealth capabilities.
Taliesin: I'm going to mask it.
Matt: Put your mask on, okay.
Laura: Can I keep an eye out for any movement ahead of us or around us?
Matt: Make a perception check. Yes?
Travis: I only stay enlarged for ten minutes.
Matt: At this point, it has now died down, and your form has shifted to its normal form.
Travis: Do I get to reroll my stealth check?
Matt: No.
Laura: 29.
Matt: As you guys move forward and Vex is keeping watch, Vex, you see ahead of you about 80 yards, a large, stocky tree in the distance that has a gentle glow emanating from the trunk.
Sam: Burn it down.
Taliesin: That simple.
Laura: Does it look like the tree we're looking for?
Matt: It's hard to say at this distance. You would have to get closer to get a better look.
Travis: How far off is it?
Matt: About 80 yards.
Laura: 80 yards. Fuck, I'm so scared of everything here.
Travis: Well, what's between us and it?
Matt: A series of trees and a few low areas of open sludge.
Laura: And it's a tree with a glowing bottom?
Matt: It looks thicker than a lot of the other trees that you've seen in the area, and there's a dull glow at the base of it.
Travis: I've got a great idea. Let's send Trinket to go check out the tree.
Laura: What the fuck? Why?
Travis: He's a bear, and this is the woods.
Taliesin: This is not the woods. This is a bog.
Laura: If he goes unconscious, he does automatically come back. But no, that's only within 100 feet, that's not 80 yards. No.
Taliesin: So take the broom back and fly 100 feet behind him. It's an idea.
Marisha: But we're only 80 yards out. Feet? 80 feet?
Laura: I'm not slowed down, so you know what, I'm going to sneak behind Trinket. I'll send Trinket out, and I'll sneak 100 feet behind him.
Matt: Trinket emerges (impact) in the sludge. (moans)
Laura: I'm sorry, buddy. Okay. Don't get too far ahead of me. We're going to sneak ahead and check out this glowy tree. See it?
Matt: (grunts)
Laura: Yeah. All right. Sneaky-sneaky.
Matt: And Trinket manages to stalk forward. Make a stealth check for Trinket, without the plus ten, because Trinket was not around when you cast the spell.
Laura: That's mean. What do I add?
Matt: His dexterity modifier.
Laura: Yeah, okay. Six.
Marisha: Total?
Taliesin: Really?
Travis: It was a six?
Laura: He gets no pluses.
Matt: Nope. He's not very stealthy, that bear.
Laura: No. He's a bear in armor. No. Six.
Matt: Oh, it was a six. I thought you were joking. All right. Trinket (squishy footsteps). You can hear the impact coming as each footfall hits the sludge. As you get closer towards it, keeping at bay, as best out of sight as possible. You see the tree, while it is thicker, it is not as high as the other trees. In fact, where there would be a top of a tree, it looks to be instead a tangled mass of branches that have been matted over and tied down to the top of where this tree ends.
Laura: I tell him to stop.
Matt: Trinket stops. You get a glance and the small glow is apparently a porthole or a window that is carved circular out from one side of the trunk of this tree. The glow is a dull reddish-orange, and it's flickering like firelight.
Travis: It's the Keebler elves. Kill them all!
Laura: I call him back. I feel like that's animals. That's not the tree we're looking for.
Marisha: This is not the tree we're looking for.
Matt: Trinket backs up towards you.
Laura: Come back in.
Matt: (squish, grunts) Dives into the necklace.
Marisha: The whole time, us who were waiting have been do-si-do-ing around each other. We don't stop moving, so we're dancing in circles.
Matt: It's like you're lagging. All right, what are you doing, Vex?
Laura: So it's a tree that looks like there's people living in it? It's a window looking out?
Matt: It seems to have an interior and some sort of warm firelight from the inside.
Laura: That's definitely a fairy tree. I'm going to stay clear. I'm going to go back. I'm going to go back to the party and tell them what I see.
Matt: All right. Vex returns from out of the shadows of the forest, no Trinket in tow.
Laura: Trinket died.
Sam: Oh my god!
Laura: You're a dick. I'm joking. I think it's fairies. I think we should probably stay clear. It looked like there were things living in the tree. It doesn't look like the cancerous tree.
Taliesin: They may know where we want to go, though.
Marisha: The pixies and fairies haven't been that nice.
Taliesin: I'm not saying they're nice. I'm saying that maybe we need some new guidance.
Travis: Yeah. Look, maybe if you let me talk to them--
Laura: How about no diplomacy from you. Maybe Scanlan should go talk to them.
Sam: I could talk to them, but I want to know what they are first. We should do some recon and at least see what kind of creature they are. I can't just knock on a door. What if it's a crazy monster that pops its head out?
Travis: Then it eats you.
Taliesin: We'll shoot you first. You won't feel anything.
Sam: I'll go up and talk, but aren't you curious?
Taliesin: No, not really.
Travis: I've got your back. I'll go with you.
Laura: No.
Travis: Why?!
Taliesin: We'll send Trinket, too, so either way, you feel like you've accomplished something. You'll both die, and then you'll know that the bear goes with you.
Marisha: It's a bonding trip.
Ashley: Do you want me to stay with you on the broom?
Sam: Yes!
Laura: Oh, wait, you're taking the broom? (laughter)
Sam: Do you care more about the broom than me?
Taliesin: Don't answer that.
Sam: You've known me for years! You just met the broom!
Ashley: Maybe we can land there, and then we can send the broom back to you.
Sam: No, I need the broom to get away!
Taliesin: That's a fair point.
Travis: In order to stay alive, you need to be near the broom.
Taliesin: We'll keep an eye out, Vex. It'll be fine.
Travis: Yeah, the two gnomes go. They're not very intimidating.
Laura: I do not like this plan at all.
Taliesin: You are charming. You're both very charming, so be charming.
Ashley: I'm not that charming.
Taliesin: You're extremely charming.
Marisha: I think you find her charming.
Taliesin: She is charming.
Marisha: I find her charming, too, but it doesn't mean that other people might.
Sam: What could possibly go wrong?
Laura: Can I go on the broom with you, Scanlan?
Travis: No! Let the little bits go.
Marisha: We're still doing a do-si-do, by the way, while we're having this conversation.
Travis: Little bits go.
Sam: All right, Pikey. Let's go knock on the door and get killed.
Laura: If you fucking get my broom lost because you told me not to go, I'm going to murder you. And this is not in character. This is me telling you that.
Travis: I just want to say, that was a death threat in front of a thousand people. (laughter)
Taliesin: I think with this many witnesses, it's not a threat. It's a promise.
Marisha: Is there a nearby tree that I can climb into?
Matt: There are a number of trees in the vicinity, yes. Where this thing is, though, there is about a 30-foot distance between it and any other trees. It's in the center of a small clearing.
Taliesin: I want a good vantage.
Marisha: Yeah. I get into a vantage point. I get up into a tree, and while they go do their recon, I want to cast Commune With Nature.
Matt: All right. So as you ascend the side of the nearest tree, and it resembles Atreyu climbing up the tree in the Swamp of Sadness, as it's these large gnarled branches and bits of muck and dust falling off the sides, and the oil slick that is surrounding the base makes it difficult to find your handholds, but you do eventually get your way up into the tree over the next five to ten minutes. You were going to cast Commune with Nature, you said?
Marisha: Yes.
Matt: All right. What do you want to ask?
Marisha: Do I sense a cancerous tree in the area?
Matt: You're asking this of the tree? Or is this the land around you, right?
Marisha: Yeah, I'm not asking the tree.
Matt: You concentrate for a second. You feel yourself link with the land, and it's a very jarring sensation. You're used to connecting with nature being this serene, wonderful experience. This is like plugging into a nightmare. Suddenly, your thought process is filled with this ever-drawn sense of dread. You feel this cold sensation fill your form, and you manage to get this information across, but it leaves this very hollow feeling in the center of your being. Feeling out, you do not sense a cancerous tree, but you do sense the strengthening presence of the source of this entire swamp's perpetual destitution and slow decay, further to the northwest of this.
Marisha: Northwest. Okay. So I can safely assume that the tree that they're heading towards is not cancerous.
Matt: Correct.
Laura: So we should call them back.
Marisha: I'm meditating. Then can I get a general lay of the land and sense running water and rivers, so we can avoid those?
Matt: Okay. In feeling any source of bodies of water, you're too far from the Gilded Run to sense any of that, and there is no running water within the actual Shademirk. Everything is a very slow-rolling sludge from the direction that you initially sensed. It's this perpetual billowing of slow, crawling death. What little bit of running water you would sense is deep underground, and probably still in danger, over the next 50 years or so, of being corrupted itself.
Marisha: Oh. Okay. For my last question, can I get a sense on any big evil things that might want to kill us?
Matt: You need to be a little more specific than that. (laughter)
Marisha: Everything. More specific that I won't screw it up. Are there Twinkies? Are there any more large crocodile dudes living under the-- I don't know. Any more large things living under the swamp?
Matt: So you do a sense for large, dangerous plant life entities like that crocodile.
Marisha: Yes, under the swamp. Well, wherever. Just blanket it.
Matt: As you extend your presence, you get no images or any sense of creatures like that crocodile. However, you do sense a rather intense presence throughout this bog at certain places of other corrupted plant life entities.
Marisha: Does the tree in front of us count as a corrupted plant life entity? And none of the pixies that live in there are showing up on my radar as bad?
Matt: No. That's your final question. The spell fades. You climb your way back down out of the branches of the tree.
Marisha: This place sucks.
Laura: What did you see?
Marisha: It's so sad. The trees are so sad.
Laura: Anything useful?
Travis: They're sad, or they're angry also?
Marisha: A little bit of both.
Laura: Should we call the gnomes back?
Marisha: They're fine. (laughter)
Marisha: The presence of the distortion and the corruption is getting stronger northeast.
Travis: Then we should all go. We shouldn't just send the little bits in there, we should all go.
Laura: I don't want to fight anymore before we get to whatever it is that we're getting to.
Travis: All right.
Matt: Have the gnomes already been set on their path at this time?
Sam: We're already cruising.
Matt: Yep. So as you guys are having this discussion, the broom slowly glides up to the outside of this tree. As you get close to it, you notice, too, from your immediate position, that mass of dried roots and branches that are up top are threaded together with rope. There is definitely construction to this, almost like a wooden thatched roof. The side porthole you see does have a wooden crossbeam in the center. It is definitely a functional and pretty well-crafted window for this rather rough exterior. The roots of the tree, though it is not very tall, it is thick. It is round. It's probably a good 25, 30 feet wide, this tree's trunk, and the roots are large and sink deep into the ground in the vicinity. You see the glow from the window. What do you want to do?
Laura: Don't do it.
Sam: What? Who said that? What?
Travis: Attack the tree.
Sam: I'm getting mixed messages.
Ashley: Scanlan, I'm a little nervous about these ropes. What if they're trying to catch us or something?
Taliesin: How many windows are there?
Matt: One from what you can see.
Taliesin: Just one window?
Laura: Don't do it.
Sam: You're not there.
Marisha: I think Vex might be right.
Laura: Come back.
Sam: Come back? Should we do a fly by the window to see what's inside?
Laura: Don't even fly close to the tree. I have really bad feelings about this.
Sam: Fly by the window and peek in.
Laura: Fucking shit mother bitch!
Matt: What do you do?
Sam: Using our expert flying skills, we're going to fly by the window and do one of these, and check out the Berenstain Bears and then run.
Matt: Okay. Make a perception check.
Sam: Not good. Eight.
Ashley: Wait. Okay. I think I just have so much mud in my eye I don't see anything.
Matt: Okay. You don't pick up a lot of detail, but as you come up over the top, looking on the inside, it looks to be rather comfortable, surprisingly. It's a small home. There's a table, and there's a small hearth. There appears to be what looks to be a shelf of some kind, ramshackle, maybe, but still functional, with books pressed into it. You can see a number of small baskets hanging from the ceiling, containing various roots and other pieces of plant matter that are gathered and bundled together. You can see there is a fireplace by the hearth. There is also a series of drying animal carcasses hung in the corner that are all stripped, and they're being aired out in that space. You also see what looks to be a large chair that is facing the hearth, slightly away from you, and a small end table next to it that contains a little teacup and a little tea set.
Sam: They look nice.
Taliesin: What size person is the chair for?
Sam: Small?
Matt: Actually, the chair is pretty large. It's tall. The tea set is small. And as you're making a look, you see one large crooked hand reach out from behind the chair with impossibly long fingers with hooked nails reach over. You can see what looks like dried wrappings hanging from parts of its wrist and elbow as it reaches over and wraps its gnarled fingers around this tiny teacup and pull it back behind the chair.
Taliesin: Do you describe this?
Sam: I don't. I see it and I turn around and I say: Pike, let's get out of here.
Matt: At this point, you hear a snap sound, and next to you, you hear this (creak) as a little bit of light peeks out to your left. A door has slowly opened on the side of the tree trunk.
Ashley: Guys? Guys!
Laura: Please fly fucking back right now! Please!
Ashley: What do you want to do, Scanlan?
Sam: We bolt. We bolt for it.
Ashley: (hacking spit)
Sam: (hacking spit) And start flying.
Matt: Flying where?
Sam: Back to our friends.
Matt: Okay. You guys turn and begin making your way back towards the party, and the broom slows.
Ashley: Oh no. (laughter)
Laura: How far away is it?
Matt: It comes to a stop and then drops out from under you both (squish) into the sludge.
Ashley: Okay. That's okay.
Sam: I grab Pike, and we both go invisible.
Ashley: I pick up the broom before we go invisible.
Matt: All right, and you're casting Invisibility?
Sam: Invisibility. I guess at one level higher, right? Is that what I do?
Matt: I believe that's what you do to get more of that. Making sure real fast, so we don't mess this up.
Sam: Level three Invisibility.
Taliesin: Her house is going to have chicken feet. (laughter)
Matt: You both turn invisible, her clutching the broom.
Ashley: What?
Matt: You're both invisible now. You're clutching the broom.
Ashley: We're invisible and the broom is invisible?
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: I go (surprised shriek).
Sam: We start tip-toeing out, I suppose.
Matt: You watch them vanish ahead of you. A few moments pass, and you guys end up making your way back to the group, and you see the (squish) footfalls of both of your tiny gnome friends.
Taliesin: I am watching that hag through my scope with everything I've got.
Matt: From your perspective, you can't really see anything through the window. You're just going off of what they've told you, which has been very little. You're looking into the side of the window, and all you see is a little bit of flicker of firelight. That's it.
Ashley: I go up to Vex and I give her her broom.
Laura: (relieved noises) (cheering)
Travis: What did you find? Oh. (whispering) What did you find?
Ashley: There's a woman. It looked like it was really nice, and then there was this really cute tea set, and then this crazy hand came out.
Travis: That sounds terrible.
Ashley: She looks really scary.
Marisha: Was she really tall? Do you know if she was tall?
Ashley: The chair was really big. I mean, anybody's tall to us.
Marisha: That is true.
Ashley: Yeah, she was very large.
Travis: Super important question Did they see you?
Ashley: I think probably.
Sam: Well, the broom stopped flying.
Laura: What do you mean?
Taliesin: Run.
Laura: What?
Travis: Are you saying we should hide, Percy?
Taliesin: We should go.
Travis: Where?
Matt: Clutching the broom in your hands, as you emit the phrase that you've known to bring it to vibrant magical life... (groaning)
Marisha: Oh no. (laughter)
Matt: The broom jumps to life. (cheering and laughter)
Laura: Thank you, Matt, for saving a marriage.
Ashley: Oh my god.
Matt: And there, backing up from this abode in the center of the Shademirk bog, your broom retrieved, your party members gathered, looking towards that glowing window, and now the ajar door inviting you in to some degree, we'll pick this up next session. (cheering and applause)
Matt: Well, that was fun. Thank you guys so much for joining us for this. We're going to go ahead and take a few minutes here and do a short Q and A with those of you guys we have here in the stage before we need to clean up here, and we'll do the meet and greet upstairs. That being the case, do we have a set-up over there with the microphone to ask questions?
Sam: Have we stopped broadcasting?
Matt: Oh, that's right.
Laura: Dude, you have to say good-bye.
Matt: That's right. Well, before we begin this Q and A, I want to thank you all for watching and tuning in. Thank you all so much. We'll be back next week, Thursday at our regular time slot and schedule. Thank you for joining us this Saturday, and yeah. Is it Thursday yet?

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello, everyone, and welcome to Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons & Dragons. And get the somewhat adjusted, altered countdown to us going live.
Travis: False start, offense.
Matt: It's great. But yes, welcome. We have just a couple of announcements to do tonight. Nothing too long and crazy. First and--
Sam: Mine's really long, Matt.
Matt: Okay, Sam's is really long. Speaking of which, let's go ahead and get us into our wonderful sponsor for tonight, Loot Crate.
All: Loot Crate!
Matt: Thank you so much, Loot Crate. Sam, if you want to tell us a little about Loot Crate.
Sam: You guys, Loot Crate. The theme this month is Magical. Brands included Dr. Strange, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, and more. Please make a special call out to the below Dr. Strange Q-Fig Loot Crate has announced will be in this month's crate. I just did. (laughter)
Sam: But tonight I've prepared, because we all need just some theater today. I've prepared for us a small radio play.
All: Ooh!
Sam: I'd like each of you to read a part in.
Liam: Pass 'em down, pass 'em down.
Sam: Pass it down, keep passing it down. I didn't know Ashley was going to be here, so, Ashley, you can read with Travis. You are both--
Marisha: Sam!
Sam: You are both doing it together.
Marisha: The first line--
Sam: Guys, calm down. It's sort of a Dust Bowl type of a play I wrote.
Marisha: Sam!
Sam: I wrote a play, okay?
Marisha: Do I have to say this?
Sam: Yes! You do! Come on! Guys, okay, I'll be reading stage direction, Taliesin is playing Junior, Marisha is playing Mama, Liam is Pa, Laura is playing Sam Riegel. And Travis and Laura are-- Travis and Ashley are the radio sound effects duo. Let's see how this goes. August, 1929, the Badlands, South Dakota. Lights up on the McCallister Farm. Mama, a sturdy, country woman, comes in from the windy, dusty farm and slams the door. Sound effects!
Ashley: (wind noises)
Travis: (ke-thunk)
Marisha: "Junior? Junior! Git yer slowpoke, molasses ass down here."
Sam: Oh! That's me! Enter Junior, a simpleton, down the stairs.
Travis: (ke-kunk, ke-kunk, ke-kunk, ke-kunk)
Sam: Good sound effects, guys.
Taliesin: "Sorry I didn't do no chores, Mama. I'm a simpleton!" What are you doing to me?
Marisha: "You'll be sorry when I run this cat-o-nine tails over your rear end."
Ashley: (whip sound)
Sam: Yeah, good sound effect, good sound effect.
Taliesin: "It ain't my fault because school was late because Teacher Sally died the evening before last."
Sam: Come on! Project, project!
Taliesin: "It ain't my fault school was late because, well, Teacher Sally died this evening before last."
Marisha: "Not sweet, sweet Sally. My rear end, I'm going to miss her. What did her in?" I don't even know what the fuck--
Sam: Enter Pa, a drunk. He smashes a beer bottle against the family cat.
Liam: (thumps)
Laura: No, you're not the sound effects.
Travis: (glass shattering)
Ashley: (cat snarling)
Sam: There you go. (laughter)
Liam: "Oh, same thing that kills us all around here. Dust poisoning. As we all know the Dust Bowl's full of radioactive dust. It melts your face clean off of the bone."
Marisha: "It's true. And dust ebola is the second leading cause of death in the dust bowl. My rear end just can't stand this dusty dust. Deadly dust."
Sam: It should be noted that the playwright did no historical research on the Dust Bowl. (laughter)
Sam: Junior.
Taliesin: "Here, Ma, I found your bagpipes to play at the dust funeral."
Ashley: (awful yet great impression of bagpipes) (laughter)
Sam: Good sound effects!
Liam: "Oh, Lord, what will we ever do with this dust?!"
Sam: Enter Sam Riegel, a strapping traveling salesman from the big city, played by Laura.
Laura: "Hi, folks! Handsome Sam Riegel here. Only thing more handsome than me is this here Loot Crate, featuring X-X-X."
Sam: I was supposed to put in actual stuff. Promo link "lootcrate.com/criticalrole." Keep going. (laughter)
Laura: "Once you enjoy the geeky gear inside, you can use the box to clean up, well, all this dust!"
Marisha: "Can it be? A box than can cure our woes and pick us up back onto our dusty rear ends?" What's with-- why?
All: Hooray!
Sam: And so the McCallisters used a dusty old vacuum cleaner--
Travis: (vacuum noises)
Sam: And their Loot Crates to clean up all the dust in the Dust Bowl. Thus saving their farm and the American Dream. (cheering)
Travis: Holy shit. It keeps getting better.
Sam: I'm a playwright, guys.
Marisha: A few on the fly rewrites there.
Matt: And you know, based on our viewership tonight, it's a pretty good opening night. (laughter)
Matt: Far better than most playwrights.
Sam: Thank you.
Matt: So, well done, Sam.
Sam: Good sound effects, guys.
Laura: Yeah, that was good sound effects.
Matt: Awesome. Well. Next up, we have a quick announcement that a special guest is going to come in here and tag me out. We have Brian Foster. Go ahead and tag. Boom! (cheering)
Brian: Hello, hello, hello. Man, it's been a Chris Hardweek, hasn't it?
All: Oh!
Brian: There's a giant note here that says, "Kill Grog. He's gotten too powerful." All right, so we're going to talk about Talks Machina, which is the new Critical Role after-slash-talk show. (cheering)
Brian: We've all been working on this along with a lot of people at Geek & Sundry for a super long time. So we're super excited about it. It's going to start this Tuesday at 7:00pm. You can watch it on Twitch for the first four episodes, and then those are going to be available on the VOD for Twitch and on the Geek & Sundry website. You can also watch it on a website called Pro-ject Alpha dot com. (laughter)
Brian: We're going to have two or three members of the cast on every single week. Mostly from this cast. We're also going to have celebrity guests-- previous guests from Critical Role. We're going to let them back out. We're going to let 'em back out. And we're also going to have some super fans that are going to be able to be on the show. We're going to get all dirty and nerdy. We're going to talk about the previous week's episode. We're going to give away prizes every single week. We're also going to have the near-impossible task of picking out your fanart and gifs-- I said "gifs" because "jif" sounds so mushy. It's "gif", right? Yeah, yeah.
Marisha: Yeah, living language; we decide.
Brian: It's been decided and decreed, ladies and gentlemen. So here's what we need from you-- We're going to give out a bunch of Critical Role merch, we're going to give out a bunch of D&D merch, we're going to give out stuff from our friends at Wyrmwood. (cheering)
Brian: We're going to give out, it says here, a shirtless picture of Travis Willingham riding a mechanical bull.
Laura: Oh!
Travis: The photoshoot is still TBD.
Brian: Oh, I see. Yes. (singing) He's waiting for an open tanning bed. Because we get so many-- there's so many thousands of tweets every Thursday night that go out about this amazing and weird and horrible show, we are asking that if you guys want to tweet a question for us to ask the cast live on the air, we're asking that you tweet @TalksMachina, which is the official Twitter handle for our show. And use the hashtag #AskTalksMachina because that way we can track 'em, make sure we get as many of your questions as we can on the show. Send your fanart and gifs to talksmachina@gmail.com anytime between Thursday nights during the show and Tuesdays at 9:00am Pacific Time. We're trying to feature fanart and gifs from each week's episodes since we're going to be talking about those episodes on the show on Tuesdays. So send those in. That's it. We're going to see you guys this Tuesday at 7:00pm on Twitch and Pro-ject Alpha dot com. Until then, it's high noon! (laughter)
Sam: Fix your mic there, Matt.
Travis: Yes! Look at the jaw, it's so forced.
Matt: Motherfucker. Didn't get enough of that at BlizzCon this past weekend. Okay, then. (laughs) Thank you, Brian Foster.
Ashley: That guy's hot! Is he single?
Matt: He's taken, unfortunately.
Ashley: Aw.
Matt: By you? All right, so, anyway we have one more quick announcement, Liam, if you want to take over for this.
Liam: Well it's not really an announcement, I'm just a willing accomplice with one of my favorite artist buddies. Sedona Parnham has sent something she has made specifically for Sam Riegel.
Sam: Oh, me? Oh. Why?
Liam: So it was sent to me on the sly, because you're so dear. To all of us.
Sam: Is it a radio play?
Liam: So dear. So charming. And now you will be well-rested. Please accept this gift.
Taliesin: Oh, I'm so excited.
Sam: What is this? Do I read it?
Liam: No, don't read-- it's nothing to read. Just open it up and show us all what you find.
Taliesin: Oh, my-- (laughter)
Sam: It's a pillow case. It's a pillow case.
Marisha: It's size appropriate.
Sam: The chest hair, the nipples. It's adorable, guys.
Laura: He's so cute!
Sam: This is 400 count Egyptian cotton here. (laughter)
Liam: There's only one other copy of that pillowcase, and it is mine. (laughter)
Travis: Gross. Gross.
Sam: Are we going to be sleeping on the same pillows at night?
Liam: Yeah. I mean, we need a blanket as well.
All: (singing) Somewhere out there, (simultaneous) someone's saying a prayer! (simultaneous) if love will see us through!
Travis: You're in different parts of the song.
Matt: For all you Critters who are under the age of 35, you have know idea what we're singing. I'm sorry.
Travis: Go watch American Tail and Land Before Time.
Liam: So that was from Sedona who is known as @anodesu on Twitter. She's done a ton of great art for this show. She's one of my favorites; she's a buddy now.
Sam: She's my favorite now.
Matt: Well, thank you, guys. Unless you have anything else to kick forward, I think we jump back into the chaos of the City of Brass and the elemental plane of fire on tonight's episode of Critical Role. [dramatic music]
Matt: Hello, and welcome back, everyone. Sorry, you waited too long, Taliesin. So, last we left off, Vox Machina was slowly making their way toward the final confrontation with Thordak, the Cinder King, as well as the end of the Chroma Conclave, hopefully, or the end of modern Tal'Dorei as we know it. One way or the other. You found yourselves preparing Fort Daxio for some sort of a plot to draw Thordak out. In the process, you took the rest of your intrepid adventurers to the fire elemental plane in search of the final Vestige that you had referred to yourself by the androsphinx earlier in your adventure. Upon arriving here, you spoke with a number of efreet that ran the outskirts of the City of Brass. Entered, found yourselves immediately traced and followed, and discovering that the society here is, well, very different than ones that you're used to. You managed to barely escape a confrontation in an alleyway with two efreet. You escaped on the path of two seemingly recent-made allies for the time being, led into their establishment in which jewelry is crafted, and with a plot to hopefully find whoever this fire giant is that holds onto the Plate of the Dawnmartyr. Many of you allowed chains to be affixed to your neck and wrists so you could pass as slaves in a society where they're relatively normal under the efreet that run the city. Your new friends, Senokir and Uten, are to help guide you in the direction of the next part of your venture. So. Picking up where we left off. You guys have been led out into this main street, watching the giant lava fountain that pours out into this deeply carved pit in the center of the ground. You see flickers of flame that occasionally burst out between the various bits of stonework that make up the floor in the center of the streets here. Looking up into the sky, you can see the deep reddish-orange hue of the skyline and one burning hot sun in the sky that doesn't seem to move from its position, but grows slightly dimmer as the day goes on. You are all led out into the street with Senokir and Uten leading you out into the main area. Senokir turns back to the rest of you, this slight half-smile on his face. "So, we are to find our way to the first giant you requested. This was the one named Whaska. Is that correct?"
Laura: (whispering) Whaska. (louder) Mm-hmm.
Matt: "Let us find our way to the Zenith Forge where he does most of his work."
Travis: Forge?
Matt: "Zenith Forge. Now come. Follow me." And he tugs the chains with a sudden burst and pulls you along. As you begin walking, he begins to talk about how: "Whaska is one of the few giants that still maintains the privilege of freedom. There was a coup within their people a few years ago, seemingly orchestrated by some of their own. As such most of the fire giants in the city either were cast out or were placed in chains. And the few that remain, one of which you'll speak with on this day, is one of the ones that sold them out. So. I hope you have your questions ready."
Travis: Yeah, for you? Shitloads.
Matt: "Shh."
Travis: Sorry.
Matt: Don't talk to your master in public.
Travis: That was hot. (laughter)
Liam: I feel like you're working some shit out, here. (laughter)
Travis: Do we have a safety word?
Matt: You did not establish one. (laughter)
Laura: Oh, no.
Travis: (weakly) Oklahoma. (laughter)
All: (singing) Oklahoma.
Matt: You're led through a multitude of streets, led along the outside of this large place that he points out to you that he refers to as the furnace. "That is where the Charcoal Palace exists and the sultan of the entire city. We won't be going there."
Laura: The Chuckle Palace?
Sam: The Chocolate Palace.
Matt: "The Charcoal Palace. You are listening; you are not supposed to speak."
Laura: (whispers) I'm sorry.
Liam: Like charcoal.
Matt: "Charcoal Palace." The air itself here, as you're spending more time outside-- and the interior of these buildings aren't meant to detract heat or cool either. Most if not all of the denizens here are well-tempered against the heat. As you guys are being dragged along, I need all of you who do not have fire resistance to go ahead and make another constitution saving throw.
Taliesin: Damn it.
Travis: I'm a master of a good burn. Does that give me fire resistance?
Matt: Nope! So I think that you don't have to worry about it.
Marisha: I had cast fire resistance on me.
Matt: Yes, and how long does that last?
Marisha: It lasts an hour. Has it been an hour?
Matt: It's been about an hour now, so that's past.
Marisha: I'll recast.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: I'm going to do a reroll.
Sam: This is a saving throw, or--?
Matt: A saving throw, yes. Constitution saving throw.
Sam: Am I allowed to inspire myself on a saving throw?
Matt: Only on ability checks, sorry.
Sam: 11.
Matt: 11, okay.
Taliesin: 16.
Matt: All right. Vex?
Laura: Oh, 15.
Matt: All right.
Ashley: Seven. I burn to death.
Matt: All of you manage for the most part to resist the heat. Your sweat is starting to become more of a prevalent downpour across your face. Pike, you take a point of exhaustion.
All: Oh no!
Ashley: I'm just feeling so tired.
Matt: So you are currently at disadvantage on ability checks.
Marisha: The heat makes you lethargic.
Travis: I'm very familiar with that.
Laura: Well, it does.
Matt: Travis can work you through the exhaustion levels.
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: Heading past the buildings and constructs you see these spires that come into these rounded point towers all made from some colored glass, some dark greens and blacks. You begin to see there are deep, carved, and well-manufactured waterways or what would be considered waterways in other cities. Except here, the actual molten lava from the Sea of Fire pours through. So there are large bridges that lead over these constantly bubbling and churning long aqueducts that are filled with molten rock.
Travis: In the ground or raised or--?
Matt: In the ground. Similar to how you see most city aqueducts constructed, except for the Sea of Fire spills into it. Anything going over there is uncomfortable as the heat grows astronomically as you pass over each bridge and the air itself becomes more sulfurous. And you find yourselves coughing autonomically as the fumes reach your lungs. You begin to pass by--
Liam: We're walking out in public at this point, right? And there's people about? We see other beings about?
Matt: You do. You see as the sun which--and you've been here for two hours now so you have some time. It's still very busy in the city. And as you pass by, you see many efreet on their own business. Some coasting at different levels of height, some just traversing through. Occasionally you come across strange, horned devil-like entities that work, walk in clusters.
Liam: So, question, because I put on the Ring of Invisibility before we left.
Matt: Yes.
Liam: But Senokir, I think, might have chuckled when I gave my sister a wet willie. So as we're walking, and I've got the ring on, as we pass people I'm doing this and looking to see if anyone is reacting to that.
Matt: No one else reacts except for Senokir. Who looks back towards you with this-- (laughter)
Taliesin: Oh, God, that face.
Laura: Oh, no, he's so weird. I can hear you moving around me.
Liam: (fart noise)
Laura: Blends in with the sulfur; I don't care.
Matt: Being led through the street you eventually see two large, lithe gray-fleshed creatures that stalk by with these large hooked tails that bend over in front. You can see barbs sticking out of parts of their body and they move in clusters of three or four.
Laura: Wait, were they walking on two feet or--?
Matt: Two feet. They're bipedal. And they're stalking through--
Sam: Three feet.
Travis: With like big-ass scorpion tails?
Matt: It resembles that. The more you push into the city, the more diverse the populace becomes. And you do see the occasional human, the occasional elf, not being subjugated, though they do usually carry some sort of a bodyguard or a handful of servants at their side as well. But you do see devils walking amongst the people here. And many, many efreet that are all walking the streets with large scimitars at their side and with a uniform, a long silk vest of a dull grey charcoal pattern. And it looks to be a pendant that hangs around their neck that constantly churns with a flame. And it's a uniform for each of these, and you get the sense as they walk around singularly or in pairs, that these probably act as the patrol, as the guard of the city.
Travis: Those that are walkin' around that don't like have a bodyguard and don't seem to be enslaved, are they still wearing that white and gold cloak-y thing that our strange bit is wearing?
Matt: No. They are very diverse in their attire.
Travis: Really?
Matt: You get the sense that at least the outfits they're wearing is their signature outfit. But you also have a hard time grasping what the cultural intricacies are of the City of Brass. Being that you're Grog.
Travis: Hey, man.
Matt: As you're passing by these various aspects-- do you have a question?
Laura: Oh, I just wanted to whisper  Vax?
Liam: (coughs)
Laura: Can you pick these locks as we're walking?
Liam: (softly) Yeah.
Laura: Do it then. Subtly.
Liam: I will stealthily pick my sister's locks.
Matt: Okay. As you guys are walking past, and at this point Senokir is talking and he mentions off to the side, "We are now passing the street of artisans and the city market. This is what we call the Pyraklum. This is where we're going to find Whaska. This is where we're going to find the Zenith Forge and hopefully the end of your journey. But we can work out the specifics later." As this is happening, I need you to make a sleight of hand roll.
Liam: Get behind Grog.
Sam: (whispers) Sleight of hand roll, boy!
Liam: Well, I'm going to Luck that sucker.
Laura: Oh, God.
Liam: It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter. It's a 20.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and make a lockpicking check.
Liam: Okay. Okay, that's fine as well. That's 25.
Matt: Okay. It takes you the better part of about four or five blocks to very carefully, walking with your sister, keeping in pace with her gait, making sure not to rustle the chains or anything to distract Senokir or Uten as they walk along-- and Uten is being very, you know, very careful with his watch. Not just on you, but on the city overall. It's not like they're, you know, honed in on you per se, but very observant of the atmosphere. And you get the sense that Uten definitely, as far as the partnership goes, seems to be the more paranoid of the two of them. However as time goes on you eventually (click) hear the gentle release of the lock on one of her arm manacles and then slowly the other.
Liam: As I trail backwards behind her you hear twins, motherfucker! (laughter)
Matt: As you begin to approach a large black and gray building built from heavy, heavy stones--
Marisha: Can I talk to Uten a little bit while we're walking?
Travis: Is she picking your nose?
Liam: I thought the same thing! It's a scratch, no pick!
Marisha: So, do you play tour guide often to newcomers in this town?
Matt: Uten says, "It is not often that we take newcomers under our wing like this. Usually they are either customers or, well, to be arrested shortly. So, no, this is probably the first tour we've given. Senokir seems to strangely enjoy it."
Marisha: Playing tour guide?
Matt: "Apparently!" Motions over and Senokir, other hand out, is like, "And around this way, you can see the Fenstral Spire, which is a wonderful craft fair that happens once every two weeks!" Uten goes back to you.
Laura: He's making shit up as he's walking.
Marisha: Seems he has quite a love for the City of Brass. How long have you all been residents here?
Matt: "We've been in business together for about the better part of ten years. I've only been here about 12. It was a very dangerous scavenge to begin, but at least the laws of the normal world do not apply here. I have no idea how long Senokir's been here. He keeps a lot to himself, that one, but I trust him."
Marisha: And your business mainly deals in--
Matt: "Fine jewelry. I showed you our establishment."
Marisha: Well, as you mentioned, people ending in arrest, are you bounty hunters?
Matt: "No! I must admit, our life is not as interesting as you might be expecting, and I am sorry for that. I will say, probably should not be talking so much right now."
Marisha: Sure. Go, slaves! Walk! Forward! Like you do!
Travis: Why are you talking to us like that?
Marisha: Because-- shut up, slave! And I smack Grog with the flail.
Matt: Doesn't physically hurt, but emotionally, there's a scar.
Travis: I'm wounded! I've been gashed open!
Marisha: Forward march! (whip crack)
Taliesin: To be fair, he didn't say Oklahoma.
Marisha: You never said Oklahoma.
Travis: It's dangerous to keep a race car at a red, I'm just saying, I'm a race car at a fucking red. Pulp Fiction!
Matt: As you continue pushing forward, eventually you come to that gray building with heavy gray and dark stones. It's large, square in shape, and you see an oversized chimney that bellows out constant black smoke that pours upward into infinity. There are a number of stacks like that throughout the entirety of the city, hundreds that all eventually bleed together as they all mingle and join in the atmosphere, whatever this atmosphere is consisting of. The large doors are partially open, they're about 20 feet tall and about 20 feet as wide as well. They are made from a very dark wood, but as you get close, it's just a textured stone. You see a dull light from the inside.
Sam: Where are we, Master?
Matt: "Welcome to the Zenith Forge. So, once we enter, I would have to be the one to ask all the questions, but that would be difficult for us to do. So the choice is yours. Either we try and find a careful way to funnel questions, or we put our cards on the table and you do the talking."
Marisha: Well, I can alter myself to look like you, if you can hang back.
Matt: "You already look like Uten and other compatriots. You can still speak, I just want to make sure that, well, our slaves don't talk out of turn."
Marisha: Sure.
Travis: Have you spoken with a fire giant before?
Matt: "It's been a while. Since the upset socially, I found it best to not deal with them outside of a customer-patron relationship."
Travis: So weird. Are they good conversationalists?
Matt: "They're curious."
Ashley: You seem a little bit nervous. I can't really tell because you're so strange in a wonderful way. (laughter)
Matt: "You're sweet, little one."
Ashley: Thank you.
Matt: "They're very big."
Ashley: Okay.
Matt: "And consider that since they kept their freedom, they're probably rather cunning."
Ashley: Bigger than him?
Matt: "You'll see."
Ashley: Oh.
Matt: As he begins to tug the chains and pull you through the doorway.
Sam: Shit. What questions are we asking?
Laura: I guess we have to ask, like, hey do you have any cool collections? Do you play cards? Have you won a lot? Stuff like that.
Marisha: Yeah. What's going to make him give us this thing anyway? Do we have anything to give him?
Laura: Well, aren't we going to try and steal it once we see it? Or are we really going to try and purchase it?
Travis: Maybe he's got beef with somebody in the city and we'll go out and jack 'em up if he'll tell us where--
Laura: Or maybe if we see that he has it then we can challenge him to a game of cards?
Marisha: Or maybe-- oh!
Sam: If we see that he has it. How do we know that he has it?
Travis: Yeah, he might not have it.
Marisha: Yeah, he might not have it.
Liam: You could also chat with him and I could walk over and take it.
Marisha: Well maybe he won't know its value.
Travis: It's a suit of armor, though.
Laura: That he can't fit into because he's huge and it's for normal people.
Marisha: You still have your Locate Item, correct?
Laura: I do! Oh yeah!
Sam: Use it. Now!
Laura: Okay! I use it.
Taliesin: Now!
Matt: You're going to stop as you're being pulled into the foyer of this building in chains, and you're going to begin to cast the spell.
Laura: Oh, do I have to stop? I can't do it as we're walking?
Matt: I mean you can do it, it's a visual thing.
Taliesin: We can hold him.
Marisha: Senokir, hold?
Taliesin: One moment!
Marisha: Senokir?
Matt: "Yes?"
Taliesin: We're going to--
Marisha: Hang on, a little bit of preparation on our end, if you don't mind.
Matt: "All right. Then decide. I mean, if you wish to progress--"
Laura: As he's talking I start doing it. (laughter)
Matt: All right, it's really quick. And you basically have to pull out your component from the side there, it's a little twig and you snap it. And you continue the ritual. All right. You concentrate for a second as he's talking, and currently no. You do not sense it.
Laura: Okay. And that lasts for ten minutes?
Marisha: But it can point us in the right direction.
Matt: It lasts for up to ten minutes, yeah.
Travis: Was it 1000 feet?
Matt: 1000 feet.
Travis: Radius.
Laura: Senokir, how large is the forge?
Matt: "Well, here it's a few rooms. It's large enough to house Whaska and his servants to construct the crafts that they are good at."
Travis: What do they construct?
Matt: "As far as I know, arms, armor. You see, fire giants, they find their sense of self-worth in society by their craftsmanship. So it's a very important thing for some."
Travis: Right. Yeah. So, like, wheels? Or like weapons? Arms? You said arms.
Matt: "I said arms."
Travis: I have a hard time listening when you talk like that.
Matt: "Would you like me to speak slower?"
Travis: It might help, you know--
Laura: No! That's all right.
Taliesin: No. That's just fine.
Matt: "So. Are you to funnel questions, or do you wish to ask as a troupe?"
Travis: Funnel them.
Taliesin: Funnel them.
Laura: Funnel them.
Matt: "Then decide on your questions now, or covertly speak once we enter. But we cannot stay here in the open and continue to talk long."
Sam: Three questions, quick.
Travis: Yeah. Has he heard of the Dawnmartyr?
Taliesin: We're looking for a suit of armor he may have won in a card game.
Laura: Yeah.
Marisha: Looking--
Travis: And maybe he didn't win it, but has he seen it, heard of it--
Laura: Right. Has he seen a suit of armor--
Taliesin: --that vanished during a card game?
Travis: Question two. Does he know where it may be?
Taliesin: It has great emotional value.
Travis: And question three, if he doesn't want to tell us where, is there someone that he has an errand that he need run in exchange for--
Marisha: Do we mention the Suutan bloodline or do you think that would be bad blood? Is that bad?
Travis: (singing) Hey maybe now we've got--
All: (singing) --bad blood!
Laura: I don't know. Does Senokir think that that would be bad?
Marisha: Is it a bad idea to mention the Suutan bloodline?
Matt: "I don't know." (laughter)
Marisha: I'm sorry, you just seem to know so much about this fine city.
Matt: "I know enough. But I don't know of the bloodline specifically. I've heard of it. You can certainly inquire within. That's why we're here!"
Travis: Yeah, that's three! Has he heard of them, does he know where it is and if he won't tell us, does he need an errand run, and Suutan bloodline.
Laura: Senokir, where are you from originally?
Matt: "These questions aren't pertinent at the moment."
Laura: That's true. I was just curious; you're so interesting.
Matt: "Thank you. Now, shall we?"
Marisha: Yeah.
Taliesin: Yes, let's.
Matt: Gives a tug on the chain, leads you guys inside.
Marisha: Sorry, guys.
Matt: The interior is very dimly lit. Thankfully, most of you have some form of darkvision. This is an open, heavy hall where, in the distance, you can see four different forges that are burning simultaneously. They are being fed by a small trail of the exterior sea of lava that is being funneled into the back corner. Within, you can see there is a large anvil in the center of the room as well as a number of smaller anvils off to the side. It appears to be four human-sized figures-- you can make out the shadow of them in the darkness. They appear to be human or human-like and they're in the process of moving things behind. They have troughs of water so they can quench the heated weapons. There at the center anvil, you see a large, hulking figure standing. Dark black leather apron across the torso, currently holding with heavy tongs this large, superheated piece of metal. Red sparks fly and illuminate the room with one hit. The second splash of light, as you see this piece of metal being slowly rotated from side to side. It's beaten into a heavier shape, the dark metal having a bladed edge to it, the actual length of it probably twice the size of Grog.
Liam: What's the guesstimate on this fella's height?
Matt: I'd say in the neighborhood of 20 feet. 16 to 20 feet from this vantage point.
Laura: I guess he's the size of the zombie giants we fought.
Marisha: In Whitestone.
Matt: (hammering) "So? Go."
Marisha: You want me to talk first? Yeah, no, okay.
Matt: "Well, you're the one who wants to ask questions."
Marisha: Yeah. I got this.
Travis: Don't fuck it up.
Laura: Don't fuck it up.
Marisha: Thanks, guys.
Sam: I'm hanging back behind Percy here.
Marisha: Does this guy have a name, Senokir?
Laura: Whaska.
Marisha: Right. Sorry. Good day, fair Whaska. Strong Whaska.
Matt: The last hit strikes the blade before the hammer pulls back. The currently hunched and focused fire giant suddenly pulls back, and is standing. You see the glowing iron metal off the side, gently gliding across the ground and scraping the stone before it comes to rest at the side. The giant stands at its full height. You can see the heavily red bearded chin of itself gently singed on the edges. The dark gray ash-like skin of the face looks down at you, the eyes glowing with piercing red dots through the shadow. "Yes?"
Marisha: Hi. I am Keyleth of the Ashari druids. Sorry. I was curious if I could ask you a few questions and just take a moment of your time, which I'm sure is very valuable.
Matt: The metal blade lifts and smacks the ground with a resounding (ting) sound that rings. All the other individuals working at the forges stop their work and look up.
Marisha: We promise we can make it worth your time.
Matt: The giant looks back. Does this with his hand, you hear the wind resistance across his massive arm, and all the rest of the servants gather their materials and begin to finish what they're doing quickly and set them aside. As they begin to go about finishing up their business, Whaska takes the large, unfinished metal blade and sets it onto the anvil, puts the tongs down with this heavy, echoing clack in this large chamber. The apron gets removed and tossed over the rest of the materials and tools and walks up (slow, heavy footsteps) and stands there looking straight down at all of you, towering over your group, backlit from the glow of the red forge hue behind him. "You may ask your questions."
Marisha: We are in search of a piece of armor, something that holds great weight and many legends behind it.
Matt: "Then I have probably made it." (chuckles)
Marisha: Maybe you have. It is called the Plate of the Dawnmartyr. Are you familiar with this?
Matt: His eyes squint a bit. "I am not familiar with this. I did not make this armor you ask."
Marisha: I don't believe it is from this realm, but it resides here. It was won by a fire giant, as yourself, in a game of cards.
Matt: "A game of cards?"
Marisha: Or some call them card games. (sighs and laughter)
Matt: "I may know who you would actually be seeking."
Marisha: Really? That would be phenomenal information.
Matt: "This information that would lead you to this powerful, legendary, sought-after armor you seek-- is it worth a lot to you?"
Marisha: Well look, you shouldn't compare it to you or the things you've made, right? I'm sure--
Matt: He crosses his arms. You hear the clatter of the metal bracers he has on cling against each other as his muscles tense.
Marisha: Yes, it's very valuable for us to find it! Yes.
Matt: "Then--" He begins to walk over to the side (footsteps) grabs something in the shadow and you hear this scraping sound (creak) of heavy wood being dragged across stone as he lifts up and slams in front of you a table. A little bit larger height than you, you can look just above it, but it's a relatively large table. (boom) "Then make your offer."
Marisha: I'm assuming you don't want me to--
Travis: (coughs) Jewels.
Marisha: Right. (quietly) Do we still have all those jewels?
Laura: Ask Senokir what he means.
Marisha: I look at Whaska and I say  Let me confer with my other masters. Hey, Senokir, what does he want? What do you think is fair here?
Matt: "Well, usually as a craftsman, they want something of their craft, perhaps."
Marisha: Craft? They want something-- okay.
Matt: "Or you could always ask."
Marisha: Sure. Yeah. I'll ask. Whaska!
Matt: "Yes?"
Marisha: In speaking with my fellow masters, we want to make sure we give you something that is fair and desired. Is there anything that you might have on your wish list?
Matt: He reaches forwards and rummages through a small pouch that's affixed to the side of his belt. When I say a small pouch, small by his comparison, the pouch is about the size of you, Keyleth, and as his fingers dig around inside you hear the clanging of heavy metal and various other objects slamming into each other. As he pulls out some sort of strange, small cylinder, he lifts it to his eye and peers through it.
Marisha: Oh, he's looking to see what we got!
Matt: Scans through.
Laura: Oh no!
Matt: "For servants you all walk with many enchanted, powerful, and desirable affixions to yourselves."
Marisha: You are a very intelligent and observant man.
Matt: Puts away the cylinder into the pouch.
Marisha: Giant, fire, respected fire giant.
Matt: "Offer me some of what you could give up. And should it be worth the information you seek, it will be yours."
Marisha: Let me once again confer with my masters and enchanted servants. Okay, guys, what have we got?
Taliesin: I've got a Ring of Lightning Resistance.
Laura: Don't you have a lot of fucking weapons in your Bag of Holding?
Travis: They're just normal weapons. There's a Greatsword of Frenzy, but--
Laura: That's not bad. Greatsword of Frenzy!
Marisha: Yeah, Greatsword of Frenzy, yeah. Whatever. And you said, a ring?
Taliesin: I've got a Ring of Lightning Resistance.
Travis: Oh! My war mask! My war helmet.
Marisha: It's not magical, though.
Sam: You built that thing!
Laura: Oh, that's right, the helmet.
Travis: It's crafted, though. It's like--
Sam: But it's so ugly.
Laura: Yeah, but it's hideous. And they said they didn't do it very well.
Taliesin: We did okay.
Travis: It's inscripted. It's got my title on the inside.
Marisha: I've got my magic choker.
Sam: That won't even fit his thumb!
Taliesin: I would put it on Pinterest. Maybe we could tell him it's a thimble. We could tell him it's a handcrafted thimble.
Liam: How high up is that side?
Matt: It's about eight feet up.
Travis: Don't fucking-- don't even.
Liam: All right, that's pretty tall, that's pretty high.
Matt: Yeah, you'd have to leap for that, man. You're not pickpocketing a giant without some high rolls. Mind you, you can certainly try. I would love for you to try.
Travis: Got to feed those forges with something!
Marisha: Okay. I have a Ring of Protection +1 that no one's been using because it's just a Ring of Protection +1. Which is good, by the way.
Taliesin: And I have the Ring of Lightning Resistance.
Liam: I have two Vestiges.
Laura: Do you want to try this Greatsword of Frenzy?
Marisha: Yeah, let's do the Greatsword.
Travis: What about the Alchemy Jug?
Taliesin: No!
Liam: No way!
Travis: Which we have used-- what?
Laura: Doesn't matter, it's too cool! You make mayonnaise out of that all the time!
Marisha: And I have my +1 magic necklace.
Taliesin: Are you using that?
Marisha: No.
Taliesin: Okay.
Matt: You hear the heavy foot taps of an impatient--
Marisha: Okay, all right. Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to take the Greatsword and the Ring of Lightning Resistance and put it on the table.
Matt: Can someone run that to me real fast, if you don't mind?
Sam: Coming!
Taliesin: (hums "Yakety Sax")
Marisha: I'm glad we didn't sell any of this stuff over the course of time.
Matt: So you take the big Greatsword and (crash) put it on there, and take the ring, place it up there with it. Both of his large, meaty fire giant hands grasp the side of the table as he leans down and looks them over very intently. Takes the blade, holds it in his hands. "This is a very good start."
Marisha: Oh, yeah. Well, lucky you! I also happen to have this awesome Magic Choker +1.
Travis: Choker? Did you offer the fire giant a fucking choker?
Taliesin: He can wear it as a pinkie ring.
Marisha: I also offered him a tiny ring. He's going to use it.
Taliesin: It's going to be like a little eyebrow piercing.
Matt: As you place it there, he glances at it for a second. The little, burning pupils of the giant look up towards you. "It was a strong start. Not a very strong follow up." As he leans back up, he says--
Marisha: Wait! That's a two-for-one deal, because it also comes with this Ring of Protection. You just hadn't let me get that far yet.
Travis: Arms, arms!
Laura: He doesn't want jewelry, he wants arms!
Marisha: Oh, he wants arms, right. It's a Ring of Protection. That's cool.
Laura: Yeah, but it's not weapons.
Matt: He seems unmoved by the presentation of the ring. He says, "You are to make one more offer. If you do not, I will tell the Illuminated of the dubious outsiders masquerading as servants. Slaves sent to undermine the rule of the The Grand Sultan of the Efreet, The Lord of the Flame, The Potentate Incandescent, The Tempering and Eternal Flame of Truth, The Most Puissant of Hunters, Marshall of the Order of the Fiery Heart, The Smoldering Dictator, The Crimson Firebrand Marrake al-Sidaan al-Hariq ben Lazan."
Travis: God bless you.
Matt: "So. What is your final offer?"
Marisha: Was that one man's resume?
Travis: Vax, give him all of your Vestiges! (laughter)
Marisha: What if we give him some of the dragon scales?
Travis: What about the black sapphire?
Laura: I mean, we do have dragon scales. We do have a fuck-ton of dragon scales.
Sam: But he wants arms!
Marisha: Hang on! Whaska! A great craftsman such as yourself deserves only the finest of materials. How about some (whispers) dragon scales? Dragonhide? White dragon, what kind of dragonhide? White dragonhide.
Matt: One large hard raises up, and begins to tug at the edge of his beard.
Marisha: A lot of white dragonhide. I think we even have a fair amount.
Travis: Leave it.
Laura: Just let it go.
Matt: "Make your offer."
Laura: Get it out of the bag of holding.
Matt: His finger taps the edge of the table.
Sam: Put it on the table, people.
Laura: Give him, like, 40 pounds of white dragonhide.
Marisha: Yeah, he needs a lot. He's gonna have a big loincloth. A really big loincloth.
Taliesin: That's going to be weird.
Travis: 40 pounds of white dragonhide.
Laura: Right? Can we do it like that?
Matt: Yeah. You go ahead and unveil and put 40 pounds of white dragonhide--
Marisha: I want to make sure it's like, "One, two, three, four, five--" Five minutes later, "37--"
Laura: But it's better if it's one big piece, as opposed to a bunch of tiny little pieces.
Matt: You manage to pull all of the hide out. With flourish. As you finish, Whaska's mouth turns into this wide grin, as his arms go out (thump) scoop it all to his end of the table. "Your respect will be remembered." He takes the handfuls of it, and the sword, puts the rings into the pouch, takes the sword and jams it into his belt, takes the hide, and walks over to the side and opens this large chest. Throws everything into the side of it. Closes it. And begins to walk over. As he walks away from it you hear this heavy metal click when he's about 15, 20 feet from the chest. He steps to the table. "Now--" He then rests his elbows on the table, folding his hands under his chin, leaning forward towards you, and looks over the rest of the troupe. "There are two other fire giants here. One is Sugan. Sugan, well, was the brains behind our positions. I have this foundry and this forge because Sugan led us against our people. He currently enslaved most of our kin, with my help, and with the help of Juuraiel, and her late husband, Guras. Sugan, he currently resides within the foundry itself, as a respected chain lord to the rest of his kind. Do not speak to Sugan. You seek Juuraiel. Juuraiel runs a powerful slag mine in the pits. Her home is outside the Shrine to Surtr, called the Smoking Hammer Shrine. Look for the spiraling tower of black iron and copper. If there is any problems--" And he reaches back, and pulls forward a small, square, metal icon. And he flicks it over towards you. It looks like a small piece of copper in his thumb. But as he flicks it in your direction, you reach out instinctively to grab it, Keyleth, and then realize, "Oh, shit!" And you have to back out of the way as it (loud thud). Roughly the size of a manhole cover.
Marisha: It's a ring?
Matt: It's a large piece of square metal. You look at it and it has a series of runes that you recognize as being Giant imprinted into the metal. "This will grant you respect and conversation with Juuraiel. Should she show any resistance, just tell her I gave it to you."
Marisha: Thank you. I go over and I start trying to (grunts) pick it up.
Matt: Make a strength check. (laughter)
Travis: Use your legs. Bend the knees.
Taliesin: Oh, no!
Liam: Pull a hammie?
Marisha: Eight total.
Matt: You can get it a few inches off the ground--
Marisha: Or just a check, right? Just a straight check?
Matt: Yeah, just with your modifier.
Marisha: Okay, then five.
Matt: You get it a few inches off the ground before it (crashing sound) hits the ground with a resounding clang.
Marisha: (hisses in pain)
Matt: Almost got your finger, but you're fine.
Marisha: Okay.
Travis: Do you want me to?
Marisha: Yeah.
Travis: C'mon, Beast Mode!
Laura: You're so strong, Pike.
Ashley: I'll give it a try.
Sam: C'mon, Pike! Lift that thing!
Laura: Get it!
Ashley: Oh, definitely not. Just doesn't even move. That's a seven.
Matt: Between the two of you, given about five minutes, you guys could eventually carry it.
Marisha: You wouldn't happen to have a wallet version, would you? Don't worry about it!
Taliesin: Can we put it in the Bag of Holding?
Matt: Grabs the table and moves it back to the space he got it. (thunderous claps) "Our business is done. Good luck. And should you find yourself in any trouble, you never heard my name." Turns back to the anvil, slowly puts on the apron, and goes right back to work. (metal ringing) Holds the metal over into the large furnace to the side to let it glow to a brighter orange, to white at the tip, and begins hammering once more. As you guys gather the rest of your strength to pull that along with you.
Laura: Sexiest fire giant I ever did see.
Liam: Who was that?
Matt: There is this awkward pause. Whaska stops and looks over. (laughter)
Travis: She's touched. Just don't worry about her.
Marisha: Oh, Whaska! Is it okay if I ask one last question?
Matt: "Depends on the question. What do you ask?"
Marisha: How do fire giants feel about the name, the Suutan-- Oh, wait. I already asked him that. Never mind. You know what, been a huge help. (laughter)
Travis: You're not going to fist-bump, or anything?
Matt: (metal ringing) Goes right back to hammering.
Sam: Have you heard of the Plate of the Dawnmartyr?
Marisha: Is it too late to roll an insight check to make sure he was telling us the whole story?
Matt: You could roll one now to gain his current composure while he's hammering the large sword.
Marisha: That's pretty good. 25.
Matt: He seems focused on his work and cares less about your presence now than he did when you entered.
Travis: How heavy is that thing?
Marisha: You know, it's more cumbersome? It's awkward.
Sam: Doesn't have handles.
Marisha: It's very wide. I can't really--
Sam: Like picking up a box.
Marisha: Yes. But it's not that heavy.
Travis: You guys are doing a great job with that, really.
Marisha: Thank you.
Taliesin: It's like a piece of pre-packaged Ikea furniture.
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: How is it they didn't design this to fit into a car.
Matt: As Keyleth and Pike carry it along at an angle because of height difference.
Ashley: Got to take a second to switch hands.
Matt: Wait, wait, oh oh oh!
Marisha: You walk backwards.
Taliesin: We bought the new bed frame. It's called the "Nupe."
Travis: No you go first, you go first.
Ashley: I'll go backwards, I'll go backwards.
Travis: Turn it over!
Marisha: Are you okay going down the stairs? Okay, okay.
Ashley: Okay. (clanging sound effects)
Liam: As we leave, I give the saddest puppy stare to that wallet on the side of his belt and wish upon a star. And then I leave.
Matt: All right. You guys make your way out into the main thoroughfare. Senokir turns back. "Very well. I know where this shrine is, so follow me."
Laura: (imitates Senokir) Great. We will.
Ashley: (imitates Senokir) Great.
Travis: (whispers) Weird.
Matt: "Are you mocking me?"
Laura: What? What are you talking about?
Matt: "Right. Continue, please." Pulls the chains a little bit.
Travis: (choking noise)
Matt: An extended period of time to make it towards where the mines and the pits are for the next hour or so, walking through the streets. As you're heading in this northward direction, you pass by a series of intersections where a lot of these lava rivers merge and splinter off. You can see there are individuals that are taking elements of it and carrying off large metallic buckets. You also notice in the distance one very terrifying-looking structure. All the rest have this beautiful, grandiose design to them. There is one that looks like it is made of curved obsidian spikes, like a series of giant, clawed hands climbing up over themselves. It forms a bastion in the center of the city. This is on the outskirts of the furnace that you walked past or saw in the distance when you first left Senokir's establishment. Pressing beyond that, you notice that there is a heavy number of nasty-looking devilish entities that seem to be running patrol around the outside of that building. You get the essence that there's a heavy devil presence in the City of Brass. Devils of multiple kinds, you gather. Many you've never seen before. But they seem to be gathering around and have that same terrifying essence to them. You see some that are humanoid, but covered in long chains with hooks at the end, dragging on the ground behind them. You see some that are these nasty little impish looking creatures that leap from section to section and usually travel in packs. But they all have business; they carry small satchels at their side. They mingle with the rest of the efreet and the other denizens of the city unmolested, unbothered, unprovoked.
Liam: I wave at a couple. Quietly.
Matt: From a distance, you're not getting too close. No one seems to pay mind.
Laura: Senokir, what is that place?
Matt: "That is the embassy. We shouldn't go by there."
Travis: Why? What's in the embassy?
Matt: "Well, that's where the ambassadors to the Nine Hells reside."
Travis: Right. Nine. That's a lot.
Marisha: Is it like a cityscape?
Sam: We have diplomatic immunity.
Travis: Senokir, did that exchange go about the way you thought it would?
Matt: "Sure." (laughter)
Travis: Good.
Liam: This guy likes to party.
Matt: As you continue, eventually you come upon the outside of this beautiful temple that is made of hundreds of heavy, dark iron and metal hammers that are all molded together in this mish-mash that forms this giant archway. As you walk past it, Senokir pipes up again, "And that is the Smoking Hammer Shrine that was spoken of. Which means--" And he points over to the right. There you can see-- it resembles a home that is conical in its advancement. It's thick at the base, and it spirals upward, made of black metallic substance. Rough around the edges, like it's been pushed together, similar to the shrine you saw. But it's this spiral that continues upward. This very thick spiral that quickly tapers off into a point. You see there are levels to it, and there appear to be openings and windows. This is an abode of some kind. A very massive abode, and to a certain extent one of the more impressive buildings you've seen in this immediate vicinity.
Laura: Big enough for a giant to live in?
Matt: Easily. As you get to the front of the building, there are no windows that lead to the bottom floor. There is one very heavy door that is a half-circle. You're not sure how, where, or from which direction it opens, but it is this big, round, metal slab that stands there at the front. You do see a brass knob in the center of it, that is roughly about eye-height to you, Grog. And that's the extent of it. As you approach, Senokir turns around, "So I believe we've found our way to the home of Juuraiel, as you acquired the information about. Your turn."
Marisha: Yes, we know. Sorry.
Matt: "So? What is your intent here?"
Sam: Well, gang. I don't feel like we should say the name of the thing that we want, in case she doesn't know what it is?
Laura: Maybe describe it? I feel like the more we make it seem like it's valuable to us, the more they're going to ask in return. So maybe make it seem less valuable?
Liam: She won it in a card game and hung it on the wall as a decoration.
Laura: She could think it's a fucking trinket. It could be like nothing. It could be like a candlestick.
Travis: Do I know if giants have any natural enemies that they hate?
Matt: Other giants. Well, they have, depending on the type of giant, many natural enemies, usually that exist within the topography they're used to. You only really know about stone giants in the Cliffkeep. And maybe hill giants. There is no specific, sworn, vengeful enemies to the stone giants that you're aware of.
Travis: Did he say that Sugan, being the brains of the two, enslaved other giants?
Matt: You got the essence that there was a large coup. There was a larger free citizenship of fire giants that existed within the city. Through some circumstance, these three currently remaining giants sold the rest of their kind within the city into slavery or had them ousted. The three that did so elevated their social status and became more powerful figures within the City of Brass.
Travis: I think you might have to play him in a game of cards.
Sam: Yeah.
Marisha: Yeah.
Sam: Wait, Keyleth will?
Marisha: No. I will not.
Laura: Scanlan will.
Marisha: That's a Scanlan or a Percy thing.
Sam: Me?!
Travis: (singing) You're a hustler, baby!
Liam: I don't want to do anything. I want you to win this in a game of cards. But I'll be a plan B. They're not going to see me.
Taliesin: If you have the magic still, we could find out precisely where the armor is.
Marisha: That's true. That spell lasts for ten minutes, the Locate Item spell.
Laura: So I'd have to cast it again. I only have one more level two spell because I don't have very many spells.
Marisha: I can cast it, because I shouldn't speak here.
Travis: You did so good, though.
Marisha: Thanks!
Travis: Oh, fair fire giant! Fair? Hammering at an anvil. 20 feet tall. Oh, fair, gentle fire giant!
Marisha: Oh, giant. My fair giant.
Travis: Do we do the spell when we get up there, or now?
Laura: Do it now, because it's 1,000 feet.
Marisha: I'll cast Locate Item.
Matt: All right. As you go and pull up your component, you snap a twig.
Marisha: No one's around and going to maim me, right?
Matt: You take a moment to wait until there's no immediate approaching individuals that might see it. As far as spells go, it still requires a lot of physical action, but you can keep it condensed. As soon as you finish, you feel the immediate glowing beacon of your intent within that structure.
Marisha: It's here.
Taliesin: Is it on the ground floor? Or does it feel like it's above us?
Matt: It appears to be maybe 25 feet up from where you currently are at an angle, on the inside of the building.
Marisha: It's going to be right on the inside, hanging on the wall.
Travis: Can't Vax do some Spider-Man shit and check out the windows? He's all invisible.
Sam: It's risky.
Travis: Why? If he falls, nobody will see it. We'll just hear it.
Liam: Yeah! And then you pretend like you tripped!
Marisha: Are there really high windows?
Matt: There are no windows on the bottom floor. On the second floor up, there are, yes. Which is about 40 feet up.
Laura: No, it's definitely on the first floor.
Marisha: They're 20 feet high, so, high up.
Laura: That's what it is. It's on the first floor, up high.
Liam: So let me go.
Sam: Yeah, dude! This is what you do!
Laura: He just said there were windows on the second floor.
Liam: I'm already climbing. Would this be acrobatics?
Matt: For climbing, this would be athletics.
Liam: Athletics. Dang it, Bobby. That's a 16.
Matt: Dang it, Bobby! All right. Thanks to the rough construction of this building, it isn't too difficult to find handholds, though there are certain moments where you have to leap and catch to get there. It takes you probably the better part of 15 minutes to eventually get up to that area. The first opening you see, even though it's a window, is an oval porthole in the side of that structure. As you glance inside, getting your arm up in there, you are inside a servants' quarters, but even the servants' quarters are very large. It's simple. You see two beds in there, but the beds are 30 feet long, 20 feet wide with various hides and furs that have been patched together in this quilt-like fashion, but haphazard in their stitching. Other than that, it's not very pretty.
Liam: I think there might be a lot of giants potentially in here at any one time.
Matt: You see two very large metallic pissing pots that currently reside at the edge of each bed.
Laura: Eww, you could take a swim in it! (disgusted noises)
Matt: Were you so inclined, you definitely could.
Liam: But nobody in here now?
Matt: Nobody in here now, no.
Liam: Are there any other windows along from where I am? I know they would be a ways off.
Matt: It's a ways off to the next one, but you could try to climb over if you'd like to.
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: I need you to make another athletics check for me.
Liam: That's a 19.
Matt: You slowly shimmy over. While the rest of you guys are waiting, as you're sitting there, you can't see what's happening; you occasionally see a pebble (thunk) and a bit of dust fall. Senokir's like, "Well, how about we walk around for a moment, so we aren't looking weirdly in public doing nothing."
Sam: You're right. If you think we're looking weird, we should trust that.
Matt: "Well said." Tugs the chain, and you guys begin to be dragged in a heavy circle around the nearby street.
Marisha: I radio over the earpiece to Vax and say, hey, we're going to walk the block.
Liam: Yeah cool, I'm just hanging.
Matt: All right. You leap over, grasping, lose your hand for a second, and get back up there. The soreness is starting to kick in; you're not used to this much physical activity of this type of strength, and it's kicking your ass.
Liam: So fast, but so weak.
Matt: So fast, but so weak. It's already hot here, and the beads of sweat are pouring down your face at this point.
Liam: I have little indoor fans, like I'm a baseball mascot.
Matt: Yeah, basically. Thankfully you have fire resistance so you don't have to worry about the heat getting too much on you. It's more of the physical exertion that's getting you. You do eventually pull over to the next window. As you get to it, you pull up into the lip, and as you reach out to grab, your hand hits something. You look up, and you see that this particular opening has an imperfect, thick glass window or at least a glass surface that is currently blocking the entrance. This is actually a window that is closed.
Liam: Is it transparent?
Matt: Somewhat transparent, yes.
Liam: So it's just cloudy?
Matt: It's somewhat opaque, because of the nature of its creation it wasn't perfect glass. It's about that thick, and the entire oval is about six feet high, and about four feet wide.
Liam: Can I check for traps?
Matt: Sure, go for it. Make an investigation check.
Liam: Okay, oh good, 27.
Matt: All right. This window is trapped. As you glance around, you can see that it is. It is a window that has a slot on the side. The glass is wider than the window in a slot that's pulled up through chains that you gather would probably lift it from the inside, like a winch that would pull it open or closed. However, on the bottom, you can see along the edge. On the very bottom edge, you can see some sort of slight bit of material that doesn't match both the glass or the blackened iron structure of this building. It's a silver plate that rests where the glass sits down. As soon as it would move, a weight would shift, and something would happen.
Liam: Looking at it, do I think I could disarm it from this side? Or is it something from the inside of the room?
Matt: It would need to be something from the inside. Even if you were to attempt to do it from the inside, you would have to be at the base of the structure. From this side, it's too big for you to do anything, really.
Liam: Okay, and I can't see shit.
Matt: Make a perception check.
Liam: Natural 20.
Matt: Which gives you a total of?
Liam: Oh, perception? A total of 32.
Matt: All right. As you peer in and close your eye on the inside, you can see another bedroom similar to the one over there that you just passed by. But this one is exorbitant in its decor. You see beautiful deep red tapestries along each wall that are the full length of it. The bed itself is a canopy bed that is 40 feet tall with heavy dark silks and fabrics that dangle from it. This is a gaudy bedroom for some sort of a giant.
Liam: Any armor on the walls?
Matt: No armor visible from this perspective, no. You do see small pieces of art. There are other metallic trinkets that are built into the wall. But nothing that resembles armor, unfortunately.
Liam: Well, my arms are starting to do this thing so I'm going to start going down.
Taliesin: There's a giant velvet Elvis.
Matt: You eventually make your way down and wait for the rest of your group to return. You guys had a nice awkward walk being led quietly through the street and back around.
Travis: Can we be the monks from Monty Python?
Taliesin: Pie Iesu Domine. Dona Eis Requiem.
Matt: As you guys begin chanting to yourselves, Senokir goes, "Actually... sure, go ahead," and keeps pulling you along as you guys chant in whatever phrases you decide upon. You come back around and you see the rest of them arriving at the door, although they cannot see you. Senokir does glance over in your direction. "Ah, it appears that our walk was just enough time."
Laura: Oh shit, you can see him?
Matt: "I have my ways, yes."
Ashley: What kind of ways?
Matt: "Your brother is a fun character."
Laura: You mean a dick?
Matt: "From your standards, yes. Being from where I'm standing, I find it hilarious." (clipped laughter)
Travis: Oh god, his laugh's the worst.
Matt: "Now shall we?"
Ashley: Let's?
Sam: We don't even know how this door works. What if it's like a DeLorean and flips up or something?
Laura: Do you know how to open this door?
Ashley: Do we just knock?
Matt: "Well, let's try. I have not been here." Just knocks on it. It barely makes a noise.
Travis: Sounds like bubbles popping.
Matt: It's like the knuckle against the stonework; it's making this dull, awful sound. Nothing.
Travis: Should I knock? Do you want me to knock, or do you just want me to knock?
Sam: Knock.
Taliesin: Knock.
Marisha: Knock.
Travis: Which one was that, I don't know. (laughter)
Sam: The big one.
Travis: Okay. Can I lean back and slug the door using siege?
Matt: Yes, you can. Go ahead and roll an attack. No weapon bonus though, just your strength.
Travis: Yeah, so that's a 15.
Matt: Okay. So that's your strength bonus and your proficiency modifier?
Travis: Not my proficiency modifier.
Matt: So that would be 20. You reach back (heavy impact) and you watch as his hand hits the section where the engraved metal door is, dents inward, and leaves this big heavy dent in the front and the impact is like a dull thunderous clap of lightning. You hear it echo on the inside.
Ashley: It's engraved with something?
Matt: There was some very faint texture or pattern to it. Yeah, a design that was built into it.
Travis: Knuckles. By the way, can I see that manhole cover you guys have been carrying around this whole time?
Marisha: Yeah, sure.
Travis: It's got Giant runes on it. Runes of Giant.
Marisha: Help me. Hey, Pike, can you help prop it up on that side?
Travis: Do I recognize any of these runes?
Matt: You recognize it's Giant. You cannot read.
Travis: Yep. This is very important script. It says that you must carry this at all times, and if you let it go prematurely you will die.
Marisha: What?
Ashley: I don't think he's telling the truth.
Taliesin: Better safe than sorry, though.
Matt: Grog, make a deception check.
Ashley: We'll hold it.
Travis: Natural 20!
Marisha: What! Bullshit! Goddamn it.
Matt: Which is a grand total of?
Travis: It's a grand total of 21.
Matt: Keyleth, Pike, I need you guys to both roll insight checks.
Taliesin: This is the first time that actual Travis has really leaked into Grog.
Laura: Yeah, no shit.
Marisha: Natural one!
Taliesin: Wow.
Travis: The stars are aligning.
Ashley: That's a 14.
Matt: Okay. Suddenly, as Grog says this, you realize, him being of giant kin and the seriousness in his eyes, and the stark intensity in the way he describes this: If you drop this, something terrible is going to happen!
Marisha: Pike, I need to readjust my grip! Here, I want to put it on my back.
Ashley: Grog, maybe you should hold it then because we're not as strong as you.
Marisha: Yeah, I don't want to drop it. Will it kill all of us? Is it a blast radius thing?
Travis: The fable goes on to say that if you hand it to one of your friends, you will shit everywhere. Immediate bowel loss. Green apple splatters all over your feet, just awful.
Ashley: That doesn't sound true.
Travis: The giant tales are to be respected.
Matt: You probably don't believe the second half, but you do believe the first half.
Travis: It is a fable.
Sam: So it could be metaphor.
Ashley: Safe than sorry, we'll just hold it.
Matt: It's at this point you hear this (thunk) and you hear this heavy, low (clicking) as the sound of chains being tightened and winding forward are followed by the large doorway rising up.
Laura: Oh, it lifts!
Liam: Does it get stuck with the dent?
Matt: You watch as it rises, and there is a small carved slit where the knob itself rises up and fits as the door entirely lifts into the structure leaving the front walkway open and there standing, you see with arms off to the side apparently finishing the rotation of this chain--
Sam: A wench.
Matt: No, you see two male fire giants, fully armored with large blocky black metal swords staring down at you from each side.
Marisha: What are they wearing?
Matt: They are both wearing dark plated scale mail, and both of them have these black bands of metal across their neck that have a small, pulsing red gem in the center.
Sam: But Matthew, are they fuckable, though? Those guards? Would you do them?
Matt: Scanlan, that's up to you, man. You've done some freaky shit in your time. Although in this circumstance you'd be the gerbil.
Sam: I'm the gerbil.
Marisha: Lemmiwinks!
Matt: You are Lemmiwinks in this. If you want to gain some experience, that's up to you.
Taliesin: And really interesting fanart.
Matt: Anyway. They both stand there expectantly, saying nothing.
Travis: Is this where we let the master do the talking?
Marisha: We're here to speak with Juuraiel.
Matt: There's a small pause. You hear a voice echo from further back in the room, though you see no source for it, "What is your business with this Juuraiel?"
Marisha: We have a deal we'd like to make. We have a token of our-- We want to play cards?
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Marisha: Oh Jesus.
Travis: Why are you talking? Persuasion check?
Marisha: I'm the only one not in chains! I'm the only one who can! It's bullshit!
Laura: You could have made any of us look like not--
Marisha: No, I can't. It's only a self spell or else I would've. Oh, that's not too bad. Persuasion? 18.
Matt: There's a pause and you hear a few heavy footfalls, getting louder as they go. Emerging from around the side, you see now a tall, broad-shouldered, female fire giant with a very strong square jaw. Her hair is pulled into this long red braid that dangles past her lower back and you can see it drifting behind her with this large metal ring that it's braided into at the bottom. She's not wearing any armor at the moment, just wearing casual clothes, and these clothes are lined with gold and platinum. This is a very expensive ware that she has on, as well as rings that encrust both of her hands. As she steps forward and looks out towards you. "So you want to play cards and make a deal you say?"
Marisha: I lift with Pike the big manhole cover.
Matt: She reaches over and grabs it, from both of you.
Travis: The fables were a lie!
Ashley: We're safe.
Matt: She glances over it, and puts it over in her hands. "So, you have spoken with Whaska?"
Marisha: Yes.
Matt: "Okay, I will hear what you have to say. Let's hear your deal. Let them in!" She turns around and walks across to the end of the room, as the two giants step to the side, removing their crossed swords from the entryway that scrape across the stone. And you may enter the premises.
Laura: I want to look around immediately, all the walls.
Matt: Make a perception check.
Liam: 25.
Laura: 29.
Matt: As you guys walk in this central chamber, the foyer, if you will, it's beautiful. The use of autumn colors mixed with various golds and metallics to create this archway that is a band of brass, a band of gold, a band of platinum, a band of brass, and repeats itself onward. It has this tunnel-like feel, and within each of these walls, there are a number of weapons. Large, giant-sized weapons that are bolted into the wall and have beautiful runes inscribed within, and wooden plaques on the bottom that contain language that only you recognize, but can't read. There are shelves that contain large books that are locked up behind glass and chains roped across it. This is a collection. This is like a small personal museum. To your size, it is huge. To Juuraiel's size, it's like a nice den.
Liam: Are there any pieces of armor with a sun on it?
Matt: As you guys continue inward, there is a large desk on the opposite side, as well as a few comfortable chairs off to the sides and a staircase that spirals upward to a second floor. There are very bright red burning torches that the flame itself would be a heavy bonfire by comparison to any of you. It burns and licks the edge of the interior without any damage done to the beautiful construct of the foyer. This desk at the end, which she has now walked around and sat on the opposite side, is made up of beautiful dark green wood and has gold leaf designs all throughout the legs. Everything here speaks of projected affluence. Juuraiel, this fire giant you have come across, makes a statement with her wealth, with everything she presents. The other two giants that you saw at the entryway, who had the binding on their necks, close the door behind them, place their weapons up leaning against the wall, and both lumber behind you as you walk in, slowly keeping watch as you progress inward. Juuraiel raises her finger and says, "Could you please bring a means of my guests to speak eye to eye?" And the two giants diverge slightly, both grab two of the chairs and scoot them in, up to the edge of the desk. These chairs are about head height to both of you at the resting point, so you'll have to climb up into them, and then probably get to be up at the desk level.
Liam: The cards are going to be like giant novelty cards.
Travis: Can I ask a question? In my bag, I have two vials of fox's cunning. Is that a potion?
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: Can I drink one?
Matt: If you'd like to.
Travis: It's so hot outside! I'm so thirsty! I would like just a sip. I had it made because I'm an idiot. Just in case the sewer plate says "eat these and enjoy" or something.
Laura: Yeah. She already took it, though. I'm looking at the walls at around 20 to 25 feet. Do I see it, up high on the ceiling? Because I've been looking.
Matt: As you guys get to the desk itself, on the back wall behind the desk, above her shoulder, you see a beautiful ruby shield that refracts the light in the room. It's roughly, from head to toe, Grog's size. It's pointed at the bottom and rises up almost like it's designed to look like a flame. It has this uneven, flickering, frozen in time of the construct of the top of the shield. On the other side of her other shoulder, you see, much smaller in size, but a beautiful set of-- make sure I get the description right on this-- beautiful brass armor with priceless cut rubies all across the rest of the silver inlay of the armor itself.
Laura: You're going to be blinging out; we got to get it!
Liam: How many feet up the wall?
Matt: It is about 25 to 30 feet up the wall. It's up where it's resting about the top height of the shield, so there's an even point and it's about five feet down from the ceiling.
Laura: Should we let just Keyleth and Senokir up on the chairs?
Sam: I would like a seat at the table, if that's all right?
Marisha: Let me get us out of this. Juuraiel? Do you mind if we speak candidly and dispose of our guises that led us here?
Matt: "But of course. You've already presented trust from one of my allies. You are safe within here."
Laura: Can I roll an insight check on the whole allies thing?
Matt: You may.
Laura: I was having difficulty choosing. 19?
Travis: I told you the fables were true!
Sam: Oh yeah, you know, like Loot Crate and stuff.
Taliesin: Loot Crate. Magical Loot Crate.
Sam: Doctor Strange. Use 'criticalrole' for 10% off your Loot Crate guys, code 'criticalrole'!
Matt: You drank the potion, Grog?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: So you have advantage on intelligence checks.
Travis: Nice. Do I gain any temporary intelligence?
Matt: There's a clarity in your mind that hasn't been there in a while, not since being an eagle.
Travis: Do I look over at the symbols and do they all of a sudden start to mean something?
Matt: No?
Laura: Oh no, you can't read still.
Matt: You need to learn to read still.
Taliesin: You have a deeper understanding of the tragedy of that.
Travis: I got to A, B, C. We'll work on it.
Liam: While you don't recognize them as letters, they're like little characters that you're familiar with: the burly guy, and then the cross guy, he's holding swords.
Travis: Yeah, that's the tree. Yep, that one's the wiener.
Sam: Keyleth, may I speak?
Marisha: I said we'd dropped our guises so yes, everyone, you can take your slave robes off now.
Sam: We're all chained.
Travis: Not wearing robes.
Matt: You see Senokir looks over at Uten.
Marisha: Senokir, can we--?
Matt: "Not to worry. Uten, if you don't mind." Uten pulls out the ring of keys that he has and goes through and begins undoing your guys' shackles. This will take a little while.
Travis: Did the door to the room close?
Matt: It's closed. The two servant giants closed it. Juuraiel leans forward with a grin, "So, please. What do you come here requesting?"
Sam: Hello. Hi, there. Hi.
Matt: "Even smaller!" And now leans in real close to the edge of the desk. The massive size of her face and the breath; it's delightful. It's a combination of rotting vegetation and very dry earth. But her teeth are gleaming. The smile is interested in whatever you're about to say.
Sam: Hi there. I'm a bit of a gambler. I'm known around the worlds as being one of the luckiest men with a deck of cards you've ever met. I've won games in many of the different planes. I see that you collect many treasures that you've won in matches as well. Is that true?
Matt: Eyes shift back and forth over the rest of you here, "I have an interest in games of chance on occasion, yes. So, you come all this way to play games?"
Sam: Yes, I have. I spend my life just playing games. It's my livelihood. I've won many things over the years. In fact, all of these great people, large and small next to me, I won in various card games around the planes. That one over there, the big one, I won him in a game of Gin Rummy in the Feywild. This guy I picked up in a game of Fish. I'm here to collect, possibly, one of your items, if that's all right with you?
Matt: Make a deception check.
Sam: 32. (laughter)
Matt: Leans even farther forward, to where it's about two feet between you and her large eyes that have come in, and her chin is scraping against the wood to get a really good look at you. She looks over, her red pupils slowly inspecting you. The grin grows even wider as she leans back, "Well, you intrigue me, small one. If your luck has been so great as to collect these fine specimens of strangers and you bring them all with you to such a place. Where do you hail from, if I might ask?"
Sam: Places. That information is not relevant right now.
Matt: "Fair enough. So! You come to play me for what?"
Sam: Maybe I'll decide after our match.
Matt: "Well, I need to know what the ante is, so I can ask for a suitable request for my side."
Sam: Certainly.
Taliesin: I'm going to lean in and-- (no vocals)
Sam: There's a large ruby shield back there, is that true?
Matt: "Ah, yes."
Sam: He wants that, but I think his taste sucks. So I'm going to go for that brass piece of armor back there.
Matt: "Ah, interesting. So you wish to play for the armor?"
Sam: Sure, I'm a little man, and it might help me in a fight someday if I ever lose.
Matt: "Fair enough. So." She leans behind and pulls out a wooden box from a small cubby. And you now look behind the desk and there are a series of cubbies that are embedded in the wall. And there are different things that she's thrown in there. She pulls out this wooden box, unlocks it with her heavy fingers, and opens it. She pulls out a deck of cards that is larger than what you're used to playing with, but small enough that you could functionally hold a hand. Small from her perspective. Kind of. (laughter)
Sam: Let me cut the cards.
Travis: And you die.
Matt: She takes it and closes the box. Begins to shuffle them, without even looking away from you. As she looks at you, she cocks a bit of a half-smile to one side and says, "So for that, do you know the history of this? For you to come so far to play a game, there may be a reason you come. And the thing you select for the game we play has much value to you."
Sam: Honestly, the game itself is what's of value to me. I am just happy to win and keep my winning streak alive. What I get out of it is meaningless.
Matt: "Okay."
Sam: But if you'd like to enlighten me on that object--
Matt: "We will play three hands. The winner of two takes the pot."
Laura: (dry heaves)
Matt: "Request the armor. Me, I request your friends."
Laura: I knew that's where she was going to go with this.
Sam: Well, I was going to offer one of your choosing. But you've only offered me one of your items.
Matt: "Take it or leave it. If you truly have no idea what this armor is worth, perhaps you wish to choose another thing to ante."
Sam: You seem attached to it. I want it. I'll have it.
Matt: "How badly do you want it?"
Sam: Certainly badly enough to risk these scoundrels.
Matt: "Then we have an accord."
Sam: We do.
Marisha: Hell yeah! Let's do this!
Travis: I've never been an ante before.
Liam: Stone-cold gnome.
Taliesin: So many bad ideas start with--
Laura: Do we need to all sit on the table, then?
Marisha: Does it work like Vegas? Are all the odds on the house?
Travis: Is it wizard's chess?
Sam: May I ask what game we're playing? Blackjack? Are we playing--
Travis: Strip poker!
Sam: Strip poker? Five-card stud? (laughter)
Matt: "We refer to it as the Tinder Start. But you probably know of it as the Gambit of Ord."
Sam: We've played this before?
Marisha: Wait, did we end up playing it?
Matt: This is the thing you didn't end up playing.
Marisha: Fucking fuck! We didn't end up playing this. But wait, we remember the rules?
Matt: You didn't play it. You, make an intelligence check. Being a bard that you are. And add a +2 to it.
Travis: Get the Hand Cone out!
Sam: 21.
Matt: You have played this game.
Laura: Thank god! Do you suck at it?
Sam: I suck at everything.
Matt: The hand is represented. Each of you roll a d8, but you keep the die hidden. Then you both roll a d6, and then keep it secret. Then you both roll a d4, and then reveal them all together. But you can raise it as you wish.
Travis: You raise after each roll?
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: What's the goal? What are you trying to get to?
Matt: The highest number between the three rolls. But you can fold if you want to. This usually is done in a betting type circumstance, so we'll see how things go from here. Anyway, finishes shuffling. Tosses you a series of cards. Takes a couple cards for herself. Sets the deck aside, right in front of her. The two guards in the back, by the way, we hear them stepping away and retrieve their weapons, and head back behind you guys. Just keeping them at their sides.
Liam: So in this room, let's say you're her, and we're all where we are, and the giants are behind the group, is that about right?
Matt: Yes.
Liam: And how much room is there behind her and the wall?
Matt: Maybe 15 feet, 20 feet.
Liam: I'm going to slowly tippie-toe around the side of the wall, carefully avoiding giants. I want to stand not directly behind her, but off at an angle.
Matt: Make a stealth check.
Liam: 30.
Matt: Okay. You both take a look at your hands. Go ahead and roll a d8. Okay.
Sam: And now?
Matt: So, for this circumstance, we'll go ahead and take a d6. Roll it and put it next to the die. All right. And now take a d4.
Sam: And if we fold, do we start over?
Matt: If you fold, you lose the round.
Sam: Oh, well then it's just a number.
Laura: So it's just numbers, at this point?
Matt: At this point, yeah. You walked into a game of her choice.
Laura: There's no way to cheat.
Liam: So there's three rolls in a row, and she's done two. Can we see them from where I am?
Matt: You currently went around the table?
Liam: Yeah, I'm at an angle, but I'm a lot lower than she is.
Matt: Make a perception check.
Liam: Luck. That's fine. 22.
Matt: You get a good glance at the first two cards, yes.
Liam: Can I (mutters inaudibly) in the earring, as quiet as a mouse? Can I just breathe it?
Matt: Make a stealth check.
Liam: With advantage?
Matt: Not with advantage because it's an audio thing.
Liam: Is it three rolls? I don't understand the game.
Laura: There's no way we can cheat! Because the ante's already on the table!
Liam: Yeah, I'm going to wait.
Laura: Right, there's no way to cheat?
Matt: That you can think of.
Laura: Unless you can fudge the dice!
Marisha: But that's risky.
Laura: It's technically cards.
Matt: It's cards. The dice is just the mechanic for it. Take a look at your hand.
Sam: I know my hand. Wait, am I rolling the d4 or no?
Matt: We rolled the d8 and the d6. She looks down and goes, "All right. So, to make this even more interesting. I'll wait. Let us see how the first hand goes, shall we?" And she puts her third card in front of her, face down. Roll now.
Sam: (quietly) Not good, you guys.
Matt: "And call." And she turns the cards over. "Four, six, one." A total of 11.
Sam: One, five, two. Total of eight.
Matt: "That is an unfortunate way to open it, my small friend. But you seem keen on winning, and I respect that." She takes the cards, places them to the side. Deals out a new hand, brings it back to her. "Shall we begin?" Go ahead and roll your d8.
Sam: Oh, man, this is just straight rolls.
Travis: We're going to kill everybody in this motherfucking house!
Laura: There's no way to fucking sleight of hand this shit, is there?
Marisha: Can he add his Bardic Inspiration?
Matt: No, this isn't an ability check.
Ashley: If I cast Enhance Ability on him?
Laura: Maybe, can you pray for Sarenrae?
Matt: This is quite literally a game of chance. If you wanted to try and fuck around with a creative way to cheat, you're welcome to try. That could also go very poorly, depending on how it goes. Before you do the next one, she stops and goes, "So, as I was going to say before. How about, as your friends are the ante on the table, throw yourself in as well?"
Sam: And what will you give me if I win?
Matt: "Perhaps the ruby shield?"
Sam: I love myself a lot. A lot more than a bunch of rubies and a handle, I'll tell you that much. If I'm giving myself to slavery forever, I want something a hell of a lot better than that. I'm a man who's won 500 straight card games in a row. You think these slaves are something? You should see what I have at home.
Matt: Make a deception check.
Sam: 32.
Travis: Uh-oh.
Laura: Oh no.
Matt: She nods.
Sam: I'll give you myself as a slave if you do not draw your next card and skip straight to the third, and that's your number. I get all three.
Matt: "Very well."
Travis: Oh, nice, dude!
Laura: Oh, hopefully she didn't roll an eight on that first one.
Matt: She rolled, the first die is placed there.
Laura: She rolled an eight?!?
Travis: She rolled an eight?!?
Sam: Oh, fucking balls. Fuck balls. (laughter)
Laura: We have to be ready to fight. Grab it and then Jenga out.
Matt: She rolled her last card but is not showing.
Ashley: But take the shield, too, though. Take the shield!
Sam: (whispers) Pretty bad.
Taliesin: No, we're good. Tell her to show her last card.
Laura: Maybe it's a one.
Matt: It's a two. "A ten. What did you roll?"
Taliesin: I cast Minor Illusion on the first card, to turn the three into an eight.
Matt: As you begin to mutter the incantation under your breath, she says, "I would not recommend bringing incantations into our game of chance."
Sam: Before I reveal my cards, I have one more proposal.
Matt: "Yes?"
Sam: (whispers) I don't know what it is. (laughter)
Laura: Maybe we can perform for her?
Sam: I'll come clean with you. We know exactly what that fucking piece of armor is.
Matt: "I had a feeling." (laughter)
Sam: We want it. We're not leaving here without it. I'm sorry, I'm not going to show you my cards. Because before I do, you'll be dead. Sorry, guys.
Matt: She turns her head to the side, "You do not want to walk this path, do you? Because if you truly cherish the lives that you and your friends here have, based on your current change in tone, this tells me that they now belong to me. Perhaps you would wish to continue to make this agreement you came to make. Show me your card."
Sam: I drew a three, and a three, and a three.
Travis: Oh, that sucks!
Matt: "By one each time. Perhaps it was time for you to lose cards after all. Based on our agreement, you and your friends are now property of Juuraiel. However, I see that you are traveled. You seem capable. You are bold. You walk in here after acquiring the will of Whaska. So, you want freedom, yes?"
Sam: Yes?
Matt: "Then perhaps there is a favor you can do for me. In exchange for this favor, I will nullify our contract, and you will be free to go. Does this sound viable?"
Sam: Possibly. Is it a card game?
Matt: "The other choice is you are now mine. Or, as you threatened boldly before, that I was to die. But I can say, given the current place that you reside, the enchantments I have on this room, the friends of mine that I have at your back, you will not have the outcome you wish."
Sam: What is your offer?
Matt: "Do you agree?"
Laura: Did you ever meet a dragon named Thordak?
Matt: "No."
Laura: Fuck. Big red guy? Took a lot of fire giants with him?
Matt: "There are a number of red dragons that walk."
Laura: This one was special. He had an enormous jewel in his chest.
Matt: "Sounds worthwhile. But do you agree to our arrangement?"
Sam: Just curious, can we draw the third hand? I just want to feel what it feels like to win once.
Ashley: What about best out of five? You're probably so bored with life; why not?
Sam: My slave speaks the truth.
Matt: "You are full of spunk and life. And you are foolish. Do you agree to our accord?"
Sam: I'm really curious about this last hand. If you beat me in this last hand, I agree.
Matt: "If I beat you in this hand, you agree. Otherwise, what? I still own you?"
Sam: Yes. Well, that's the deal.
Travis: Yeah, I like that. Maybe you'll win one.
Ashley: One more hand?
Matt: "We will see who wins this hand for your own sake."
Sam: Thank you. That would make me feel so much better about myself.
Matt: "It does not change our deal." First die. Second. And third. She reveals four, four, four. Literally rolled all fours.
Travis: God! Matt! You!
Taliesin: Wow.
Marisha: Wow.
Sam: I'm really just bad at everything.
Travis: Did you roll an 11?
Sam: I rolled an 11.
Matt: Oh my God!
Travis: You are a deity.
Matt: I wish I had this luck in Vegas! Like, literal gambling.
Travis: It's just four hours.
Sam: Best seven out of 13! (laughter)
Matt: "You have agreed to our accord as per the agreement."
Sam: I have agreed. I'm already your slave, so I couldn't really say no. So yes, I agree to our accord. What favor can I grant you?
Matt: "You will have your freedom and the armor you seek. My lover does not live because of an altercation with one who frequents the city. My partner, Drogat, died needlessly in the streets of an innocent altercation with Ghurrix, a pit fiend that lives at the embassy."
Laura: (groaning) Ah jeez.
Sam: Sorry, we're not supposed to go to the embassy. We were told so by our tour guide.
Matt: "Oh, you should never go to the embassy. But this Ghurrix is tied up with a lot of politics in this city. As much as I would love to squeeze what infernal life he has, I fear it would cause the execution of me and mine. So, I sit and fester with the need of vengeance. I need you, if you're as capable as you promise, to go and find Ghurrix, in whatever way you see fit, and carve the life from his body. Now, Ghurrix frequents the Arches, which is the slave market of the city, where he finds rare and unique servants for the Nine Hells and his masters there. Goes about once a week and is probably due there in a day or two. Go, slay Ghurrix, and return to me with no mention and no trace that can be brought back to my home. Then the armor is yours, as is your freedom. There is no agreement. You've already agreed. So go."
Sam: Yes, we accept. Thank you, my master, we will go do so right away. Two days, you say?
Matt: "Two days, yes."
Laura: Does that mean we don't have to answer to you anymore? You're equal to us?
Sam: Yes.
Marisha: High five, yeah!
Sam: I release you from your slavery.
Marisha: And into another one.
Sam: What does he look like?
Matt: She reaches down to the side of the desk, and pulls out a very small book, relative size, and flips through, and opens a page to turn towards you. "This is what I seek to see destroyed. You can tell, Ghurrix wears a symbol of his station. It is a thick, black chain. And at the bottom, it has the symbol of two manacles intertwined within a red symbol that pulses with anger. That is your mark."
Sam: Are you sure you don't want just a game of Pinochle instead?
Matt: "You try my patience, small one."
Sam: Please, call me Kenny Rogers.
Matt: "Two days. Go!"
Sam: Let's go, slaves! I'm sorry, equals, peers, let's go!
Matt: As you guys step down, the two giant guards step back and begin to walk towards the door to let you out.
Laura: Actually, madam, master. Do you have any symbols that you can give us, like something we could show people so they don't try to claim us for themselves? Because we're a lot smaller than everyone else here. Something that shows that we're your slaves?
Matt: "Hmm." She gets up from behind the desk, and walks up the stairs for a moment.
Laura: Is she out of the room?
Matt: She's out of the room, currently.
Laura: And two other giants are behind us?
Matt: Yes.
Laura: What are they doing?
Matt: They're standing watching all of you.
Laura: All of us except for--
Liam: I'm standing there, but I'm not--
Laura: Jump up and fucking see how it's attached to the wall!
Travis: How big is the suit of armor, the Dawnmartyr?
Matt: It would fit a human. A minute passes. You hear the footfalls return. As she comes down the stairs, with her hand in a fist, she throws her hand open. Hitting the ground, and scattering across the stonework, some of them stopping at your feet or beyond, a series of black, metal rings that match the ones that the two giants wear around their neck.
Travis: But smaller.
Matt: But smaller. Various sizes. There's probably like a dozen or so you can pick from. Some will fit better than others. "These I had made, but I had no need for servants of your size until today. So, go. These should be enough."
Laura: Thank you. They're lovely.
Travis: Yeah, I put mine on. I like it a lot.
Sam: Have a lovely afternoon.
Matt: "You as well. Good luck. Please, kill it. Return."
Travis: Do we want to stay the night here?
Marisha: Yeah, I was going to ask that.
Sam: Gross, but okay, go ahead.
Travis: A quick query. We're, like, visitors. We don't really have a place to stay. Now that we're yours, do you have like a broom cupboard?
Matt: Senokir pipes up and goes, "Actually, you're welcome to stay at our place. We have facilities that could function. Besides, it's a lot of chain we have to carry back now."
Taliesin: It's true.
Laura: We'll do you the favor, Senokir, of carrying this chain back to your place.
Matt: "That's wonderful, thank you."
Laura: A favor for a favor. (giggles)
Matt: "Indeed. We'll talk soon about mine."
Travis: He's going to wear us like winter coats. Going to make a suit out of our skin.
Marisha: Nice lampshade.
Laura: Ooh, his eyebrows literally going up when you said that. I think he wants to do it.
Matt: So, the door is lifted. You guys are led back out onto the street. Closes behind you. The time that has passed now, I need everyone once again to roll another constitution saving throw.
Travis: But I drank that Fox's Cunning.
Marisha: Am I okay?
Taliesin: We're going to be fine, anyway. We have the mansion.
Travis: 24.
Taliesin: 11.
Sam: 20.
Marisha: Do I still have fire resist?
Matt: Your fire resist would have gone away. You could cast it again.
Marisha: I'll just roll this time. It's just straight constitution?
Laura: Saving throw.
Ashley: With a saving throw?
Matt: Yeah.
Ashley: So roll another.
Matt: Well, no. You roll and then you add your saving throw bonus.
Marisha: Seven.
Matt: Vex?
Laura: Four.
Ashley: Three!
Matt: All right. Pike, Vex, Keyleth, and Percy all suffer a point of exhaustion. Pike, your speed is halved right now.
Laura: Oh no, Pike, but you're already so little!
Ashley: My what's halved?
Matt: Your speed is halved, so you are trailing behind everybody.
Laura: Grog, pick her up, she looks like she needs some water.
Ashley: Grog, I'm just so tired.
Travis: You look so mopey.
Ashley: I feel very mopey.
Travis: Did you want a piggyback ride?
Ashley: Yeah.
Travis: All right, I pick her up and I put her on my shoulder.
Matt: You guys eventually make your way back, being led by Senokir back to his establishment. Let's go ahead and take a little break for now. Go ahead and use the restroom--
Travis: You looked like the creepy guy was saying we should take a break for just a second.
Matt: "That would be frightening, wouldn't it?" All right, guys, we'll be back in just a few minutes, we'll see you in a second. [break]
Matt: Welcome back everyone to Critical Role. That was terrible.
Travis: The timing. Well, she's been gone.
Matt: She's been gone a while. It's okay, welcome back.
Ashley: I'm sorry.
Matt: Ashley, you're amazing.
Ashley: I'm just not working right now.
Matt: That's okay. So. You guys have returned to Senokir and Uten's establishment to rest until you feel is necessary to undertake this endeavor. But it is your guys' prerogative as to if you want to wait over the next day, day and a half to jump to it or is there anything you want to do to prepare for this circumstance? What do you want to do?
Taliesin: Let's sleep in the mansion so we can gain some of our--
Laura: Yeah let's sleep in the mansion till we can at least get rid of this heat.
Sam: If it's a day or two, we could go back to Daxio and check and come back. But then we'd have to get back into the city. That's probably a terrible idea.
Marisha: Can I bamf right here? What's your name? What is Simma sina--
Travis: Sequin.
Marisha: Senokir. Took a ten-minute break and that's it. Senokir, is there a way we could-- If I wanted to Plane Shift home, is there a way that I could Plane Shift right back here and not get, you know, our heads chopped off for it?
Matt: "I don't know. Is there?"
Marisha: Let me check, guys. You know, let me check the druidic texts and see what they say.
Matt: Specifically, you can choose a target in general terms. It'll probably bring you right back to where you arrived here. So you'd be back to the outside of the city.
Liam: At the respawn point.
Marisha: Well, I can't say Senokir's jewelry shop in the City of Brass?
Matt: You can specify a target or destination in general terms. So the City of Brass or Dispater on the second level of the Nine Hells. You appear in or near that destination.
Sam: No guarantee that we'd be back in. So we should stay.
Matt: Up to you. Crapshoot, it's possible.
Laura: As long as we know that Allura will send us a message if something goes wrong.
Liam: Did it get dark out at all? Or no?
Matt: Actually, by this time, as you guys have gotten back and ended this rest you guys have really come to get really thirsty, and as the exhaustion hits in, you all continue to reach for your waterskins and they're dried up.
Taliesin: We should go back into the mansion.
Sam: I agree.
Matt: The sun, however, has gone to a darker red color, like a soft eclipse almost. And as it does, the heat remains but the light gets dimmer and dimmer into a red twilight. And as it does, the city shuts down. Everybody goes home, locks up, and nothing but the efreet that you saw wandering the streets earlier with the little flaming brooches or amulets in the uniform outfit wander the streets.
Laura: Why doesn't anyone go outside at night?
Matt: Pardon me. (sneezes)
Marisha: Bless you.
Laura: Bless you, Senokir.
Matt: (sneezes)
Travis: Give me a third one.
Marisha: Bless you again.
Matt: Fuck you. Hate you so much. Live gaming. You ask this to Senokir?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: "That's largely because the Illuminated maintain a curfew. And if you don't follow the curfew, you'll wind up in chains."
Laura: Okay. Different chains than regular chains?
Matt: "At first, yes."
Laura: Okay.
Travis: Waterskins from our servants--
Liam: Who's that guy? What is that guy?
Offscreen: Thanks, Gov'ner.
Laura: What are we at?
Matt: "Kill him." (laughter)
Matt: "If you require water I can procure that for you, if you like."
Laura: Hmm?
Matt: "If you want water I can procure that for you."
Taliesin: Can we get water from the--
Sam: Well, we have water in his fucking jug.
Laura: Yeah. We've got so much water.
Marisha: I can also create water.
Laura: Yeah, but he's got a jug full of it.
Marisha: Pike and I can create water. Me and Pike both can.
Travis: I can create water. Don't say it like it's cool.
Taliesin: They're not speaking in metaphor. We know you can create water.
Matt: All right, so, what do you guys wish to do?
Liam: I mean, are we in a hurry, do we want to try to make this happen tonight?
Taliesin: Let's mansion for the night and then I think in the morning. We can't find him tonight. Can we?
Liam: I'm not talking about him, I'm talking about doubling back to the house and trying to get through the servants' window.
Sam: You really want to try to break into this fire giant's house?
Liam: If we're in a hurry, I mean we've killed some pretty gnarly things, I know they're big. So are we.
Laura: She could be gnarlier than the giants that we've fought.
Travis: And there might be an unbelievable amount of fire giants in that building.
Sam: Or traps.
Marisha: Or allies nearby. It's in the middle of a city.
Liam: Yeah. And I'm sure the other thing will be super easy.
Laura: The pit fiend?
Liam: It's on the table. I mean, whatever, you know. I'm going to follow your lead.
Sam: You want to do a smash and grab?
Laura: Run in, grab the armor, Plane Shift out. Can they chase us down if we do that?
Marisha: Classic B&E? Plane Shift takes a minute--
Laura: No, it's instant. Remember, we checked it.
Matt: It's an action.
Marisha: It takes an action. As long as we're all in a circle holding hands.
Travis: Oh shit.
Taliesin: And what happens if you can't Plane Shift out of that house? We probably want to get out of the house and then Plane Shift.
Marisha: In case it's magically locked down?
Taliesin: In case it's magically locked down.
Laura: Yeah, that's pretty smart.
Taliesin: In which the phrase, "I have many enchantments upon my home," led me to believe there's probably--
Travis: I mean, I really don't see what the problem is, right? Hellfiend goes, "Oh, time to go shopping for slaves." He walks up to the Arches, we set a trap, Vax goes stabby-stab-stab, Percy goes (gunshot), Pike goes, (high-pitched) "Hi", and like, donesky!
Taliesin: You're writing the best children's book ever.
Laura: I mean, I'm down, I think that's a great plan, Grog.
Marisha: He also said that the pit fiend could be there in one to two days.
Laura: Yes.
Sam: Could be there tomorrow?
Marisha: Also, do we know how much time passes in the fire plane versus the real world?
Matt: You're not entirely certain, comparatively the time. You feel like you've been here for, I mean, a while. By the cycle of the sun-like light source in the sky here on the plane, it seems like you've been here for about a day.
Laura: Oh, shit.
Marisha: Do we remember any type of relative time jump when we were here last time in and out?
Matt: No, but you were only here for maybe a handful of hours last time you guys came here.
Travis: Were you worried about being away from Fort Daxio for too long?
Liam: Yeah, that's what I was suggesting.
Marisha: Yeah, I mean we could come back to Thordak just destroyed everything.
Travis: Can't we scry on the fort?
Marisha: I can't scry between dimensions.
Matt: It has to be on the same plane.
Laura: Can you scry on the pit fiend?
Marisha: Yeah.
Sam: We know what it looks like.
Laura: And you know like a thing for him, right? We know his name.
Travis: Thank you, watering boy.
Marisha: Yes, I could.
Sam: Cabin boy, thank you.
Travis: That's what I meant! That's what I wanted to say!
Marisha: Yeah, can I use the scrying eye to try and scry on the pit fiend?
Matt: You certainly can. So you have secondhand knowledge of the pit fiend.
Marisha: And trying to imagine his emblem that she described with the two manacles and the black chain, because that was pretty cool.
Matt: So, focusing on the emblem that you were described, you close your eyes and concentrate, holding the orb of scrying within your grasp. Okay. What's your spell DC?
Marisha: 19.
Matt: What's the spell DC of the scrying orb?
Marisha: It doesn't say.
Matt: It would be 15. Unless you cast the spell, right?
Marisha: Yeah, I get to do it, so it should still be mine, right?
Matt: Usually it would be set for the item, but for the purposes of this it won't make a huge difference. What's your spell DC?
Marisha: 19.
Matt: 19, okay yeah, so it won't make a difference. You close your eyes and you see a brief fuzzy vision of the city from your perspective and then your vision jumps suddenly and comes to fire, then comes to black, then comes to a quick view of that weird citadel, carved out of black obsidian hands reaching over each other, the one that you saw earlier, the embassy. Then you feel a wall and you're thrust through a series of walls, not able to really take in any visuals, the process is so fast, wall after wall, then you come to a darkened room, a wide chamber that contains a long series of papers and scrolls that are laid out in a specific format. You can see, chained to the walls, individuals moaning and crying. And you see, sitting in this small circle in the center of the floor, a humanoid-- a humanoid in the sense that it has arms or legs-- but you see the pit fiend sitting there, almost meditating, eyes closed, large teeth, jagged and pointed, coming out of its large jaw, dark red horns that curve behind its head, these large wings that are folded around it from the back as it sits its knees out, crosslegged, its arms resting upon the edges, eyes closed. It appears to be sleeping. Or at least resting.
Marisha: Can I get a focus on what the slaves look like?
Matt: Unfortunately you can't, the target of your scry is about the most you can focus on; you can give a blurry atmosphere around them, you can barely pick up the aspect of their presence, but that's the most you can do with the scry spell.
Marisha: Okay. Well, he appears to be in his bedroom, definitely in the citadel. As she said.
Laura: Does he have any, like, cuts on him, anything that looks weak?
Marisha: He had big gnarly teeth and slaves.
Ashley: Did he look scary?
Marisha: He looked very unpleasant.
Travis: But it's just him, right? One dude?
Sam: We could take one dude!
Marisha: Well, he also had a bunch of people chained to the wall, and this was after my vision being slammed through several walls. It seemed to be very deep in the labyrinth that is the embassy, which seems like a labyrinth.
Laura: So we'll have to wait until he comes out.
Taliesin: Can we trick him into the mansion?
Sam: The mansion door, I think, is only ten feet tall.
Laura: How tall is he?
Sam: 20?
Matt: Best that you could tell, probably close to 15 feet.
Laura: He could duck in.
Marisha: He's a little taller than Grog.
Ashley: What kind of slaves did it look like he had? All types?
Marisha: I tried to look. I couldn't tell. Looked like a nice variety.
Laura: If we said, "Hey, I heard there's really good slaves up in this mansion--"
Sam: And then what do we do in the mansion?
Taliesin: We can quietly attack him from all sides. Have a fight that won't draw the attention of the guards.
Sam: Something tells me that people fight in this city a lot.
Laura: Yeah, but I don't think the slaves attack the owners very often.
Taliesin: There's nothing we could damage in there that would remain damaged.
Marisha: Unless we tried to use ourselves as slave bait again, put a few of us on the auction.
Liam: You seemed to be able to talk Yenk into doing whatever you wanted. Do you think you could do that with this guy?
Sam: I could certainly make an appearance of Yenk.
Liam: I meant convince him to come inside.
Sam: You mean Dominate him?
Laura: He could be much more intelligent than Yenk was, though.
Liam: Could be.
Sam: I can try.
Taliesin: He wears jewelry.
Marisha: He has a logo.
Travis: He meditates.
Laura: He meditates?
Travis: Yep.
Taliesin: Bikram yoga.
Laura: Is that the hot one?
Taliesin: That is the hot one.
Travis: Should we go recon on the auction as slave shopping or whatever it is?
Laura: In the morning. Not now.
Travis: Set up the door outside of the market or whatever.
Sam: So, he's going to the auction to slave shop?
Taliesin: Yes.
Travis: Unique slaves. He likes unique slaves.
Sam: Seems crazy that a gigantic fucking pit boss, whatever he is, would be like, "Oh, sure, I'll step into this creepy door, weird stranger!"
Laura: The mansion door is rather creepy, isn't it?
Sam: Yeah, for sure! Everything about me is creepy, guys!
Travis: But it's unique, and what if inside the door we make it look even more unique?
Laura: Yeah, can't you make the mansion look like anything you want?
Matt: Within reason.
Travis: That's important to say.
Matt: There are limitations. It's still a mansion.
Laura: I mean, if it looks like a sexy den or something.
Travis: Yeah, and if he doesn't come in the door, then we kill him.
Sam: This seems like a plan C to me. Convincing a giant killing machine to step into a nice house seems like it's a desperate plan of people without anything at all.
Taliesin: He's not a giant killing machine, he's a businessman looking to purchase--
Travis: What, do we go and make a deal with the devil? (goofy chuckle)
Sam: The deal is we just attack him and kill him! What's the big deal? We were sent on a killing mission here.
Taliesin: Where are we going to kill him?
Sam: Wherever we see him! Let's talk to Sonny here, creepy Sonny.
Liam: What about this? This is a terrible idea. Could one of us goad him into following us out of his abode or some building, somewhere, and you plop the mansion door outside the actual door? So he goes to try to leave the tavern or whatever the fuck, he goes into our house?
Laura: Ultimately, if we can get him in a building and then back out of the building, great. But if we can get him in that building, why can't we get him in the fucking mansion?
Matt: As far as you understand, for a person to walk into the mansion, they have to know they're walking into the mansion.
Sam: So we can definitely entice them. You guys can pose as slaves and show him some amazing feats and say, "There's more where that came from, inside the mansion!" but if he says no, then what's our plan?
Matt: Senokir pipes up at this point. He's been listening in to this whole conversation off to the side. He goes, "If you are indeed going to fight a creature of this esteem, I will request to not be present. Thus, you will be masterless in this city. I don't know how to protect you the way you look."
Travis: Don't we have the neck rings, the collars, to mock that we're--
Matt: "Perhaps. That will be helpful. Just make sure you have a solid story, or another way of masking yourself. Otherwise--"
Sam: I can make us all look different. What would make us passable in the city?
Matt: "Well, dressed more like us, or the others who are free. It all depends on what you can look like."
Travis: Less appealing. Less different.
Matt: "Or, at least, amongst the elite of this city, where you won't be bothered."
Sam: I can make us all robes and stuff.
Ashley: Don't we want to look unique for him to want--
Laura: One of us.
Marisha: Seeming allows you to tailor us, right?
Sam: Sure, sure.
Matt: Actually, what does Seeming allow?
Sam: I can shrink or grow us by a foot, change our general appearance and clothing.
Marisha: How about we do a little bit of both? We can have a few of us, maybe two, as slaves, the rest as masters, walking around incognito. Once one of us gets sold off, we track him back so we're not fighting a member of the Embassy of the City of Brass in the middle of the market.
Laura: That would be bad.
Liam: I like the mansion idea. What if we pitched the mansion as a traveling magical boutique slave shop? Artisan slave shop? We lube this guy up in a loincloth and this guy after a hard day's tinkering, and we sell them! This guy can sell anything! This guy could sell a hunk of shit to the Emperor of Emon.
Marisha: These people have seen a lot of shit, not just one hunk of shit.
Laura: What if you and I dressed in exact, identical clothing, and then we're unique? We're, you know, twin slaves?
Taliesin: I was actually going to say quintuplets. We could all look the same.
Marisha: Is that a fantasy that people have?
Taliesin: It is now.
Liam: That's the plan!
Sam: I'm sorry, what's going on? We're all looking like you?
Liam: We're septuplets! Sextuplets! And you're the salesman.
Sam: I'm selling a group of identical sextuplet slaves and the advantage is just that they look cool? "Check out my slaves; they all look alike!"
Travis: If you give us one order, we all understand the order!
Taliesin: Somehow, a stamp with an upside-down airplane is worth a fortune. This, obviously, is more rare.
Sam: I could make you all other ways unique.
Liam: I mean, we're fairly attractive! I feel like six of us would be worth the price of admission.
Laura: Although you can only grow us or shrink us by a foot, so this would be a really little--
Taliesin: We'll make her taller and you two shorter.
Marisha: Can I also throw out that maybe six might be pushing it a little? Maybe we should drop it down to, like, quadruplets?
Taliesin: No! Because six is what he's walking around with! He's got more back in his shop!
Liam: It's got the word "sex" right in it! Sextuplets! Sex sells! Sextuplets sell!
Travis: You can do it. Magic door, sextuplets.
Sam: I love this idea, don't get me wrong, but I feel like convincing him that you are able-bodied slaves with magical abilities might be even more of icing on the cake than, "Hey, they look alike!"
Travis: I like that! You vamp, baby, you do whatever. Do what you do. SAM; All right, and when it doesn't work, Sonny, can we fight him right there in the Arches? Will people be like, "What the fuck's going on? Arrest them all!"
Matt: "He is a known entity in this city. If you wish to fight him in the open, I would recommend having a way of perhaps having the Illuminated on your side."
Sam: That's the guards?
Matt: "That is the guard."
Liam: Artisanal half-elf slaves.
Laura: Wait. If we can convince them that he's broken a law of some sort--
Travis: Bribes.
Laura: Bribes.
Sam: We could also try to convince them that he's broken a law or done something horrible.
Laura: What's against the law here?
Matt: "Well, going against the sultan is the most grievous of things. He is a paranoid one."
Laura: He's the one in the big-- no.
Matt: "In the Charcoal Palace."
Sam: I could make the image of our mark standing out there in the middle of the Arches, cursing the sultan's name and pissing all over the place.
Travis: Right, but listen, I don't know if we have enough to bribe all the efreet. What if we went to the Charcoal Palace, spewed a tale, and said that this pit fiend is plotting to overthrow the Charcoal Palace and all we want is to remove the problem for him?
Matt: "I can really recommend you not go near that palace."
Laura: Yeah, let's not do that.
Travis: So, we do it.
Laura: No, let's not.
Matt: "They have wards to pierce through lies. You will find yourselves never heard from again, if you have falsehood in your midst."
Taliesin: Does the sultan mark his slaves?
Matt: "The sultan, I imagine, would, though I am not aware of it myself."
Taliesin: Does he have a seal?
Matt: "I believe so."
Taliesin: If we were to sell ourselves as slaves, we could be marked as the property of the sultan.
Sam: And then what?
Taliesin: And then we could claim that he was trying to steal property of the sultan.
Sam: Are we still sextuplets in this scenario?
Taliesin: You don't get to negotiate that aspect. Even if we're just sneaking back into the house and stealing the armor, we're doing it as identical sextuplets. There's no fighting that anymore.
Liam: One addendum. Our sizes don't change, right?
Sam: I can make you a foot taller or smaller.
Liam: We could be the Matryoshka nesting dolls. From biggest to smallest. That's unique!
Sam: That is unique.
Marisha: I feel like we're spending a lot of time on this, and maybe not enough time on our battle plan.
Liam: Oh, that would go to shit anyway.
Sam: Okay, so far, let's recap. Recap, vote, and move on.
Laura: Senokir, if you saw a bunch of people who looked the same, that went from small to big, wouldn't you want them as slaves?
Matt: "Depending."
Laura: They were totally hot, too.
Matt: "Probably."
Ashley: And also, if they had skills, each of them had a separate skill?
Matt: "Most likely. There are many unique slaves that pass through the Arches."
Laura: Oh, really? What's the most unique one you've ever seen?
Matt: "They've had a few celestials through before. Those generally fetch a pretty penny with the individuals you're speaking about. The winged ones, they apparently are very sought-after by the Nine Hells."
Laura: Wings! You have wings!
Marisha: Or we could Seeming wings?
Laura: Yeah, but they could probably see through that shit! His are real!
Liam: So far, only Cinnabons here has been able to see through my shit.
Laura: I feel like they'd be able to tell. But whatever.
Taliesin: If each of the sextuplets-- I'm never going to get tired of saying that-- were unique in their own way, and yours was that you had a trace of celestial which is why you have wings?
Travis: Do we still want to try and get him in the mansion?
Taliesin: Yes.
Sam: So wait, I'm going to recap these plans, here. Plan A, making us all sextuplets and trying to get him into the mansion.
Travis: Celestial sextuplets.
Sam: Plan B, we're all sextuplets--
Matt: Seeming does not add wings. It has the same arrangement of body parts. But if one of them has wings, you could change those wings into a different color.
Marisha: Can I use Alter Self, because Alter Self gives-- because I can give myself gills and stuff like that.
Sam: So, Plan A, again, sextuplets, slaves, mansion. Plan B, we're still sextuplets, but this time, we're somehow framing him for dishonoring the sultan and then attacking him in the middle of the square.
Taliesin: Which is why Plan A is much better.
Sam: Plan C, still sextuplets, that doesn't change, but now we're just ambushing him in the center of the Arches and we've paid off the guards to turn a blind eye.
Taliesin: We don't have enough money to pay off the guards.
Sam: We have tons of money!
Laura: We don't have that much money.
Sam: I mean, we could bribe them with six identical slaves. So what's it going to be? Plan A, the mansion that's certainly going to fail? Plan B, the framing job? Or Plan C, the bribery slash ambush?
Laura: Plan A, into plan B if it doesn't work!
Sam: All right, great!
Taliesin: Remember, we're just to show off. You've got more.
Sam: Of course I've got more.
Laura: What is the sultan's name?
Matt: "The sultan's name is the Grand Sultan of the Efreet, the Lord of Flame, the Potentate Incandescent, the Tempering and Eternal Flame of Truth, the Most Puissant of Hunters, Marshal of the Order of the Fiery Heart, the Smoldering Dictator, the Crimson Firebrand, Marrake al-Sidan al-Hariq ben Lazen."
Marisha: It's like when you start the little Halloween sing-y things.
Laura: I almost got it memorized though.
Travis: I thought Percy's was long, shit.
Taliesin: Mine's better.
Liam: Scan-Man, can you rearrange the inside of the mansion to look like whatever you want--
Sam: Yeah, what would it be? A slave auction house?
Liam: Could it be a theater for presentation, or a ring to show off amazing skills? Wings, arrows?
Sam: A circus side-show thing?
Taliesin: Somewhere between the Folies Bergere and Caligula's living room.
Sam: Caligula's living room, I can do.
Marisha: Maybe have a little side area with hookah and some nice dancers, you know? As he watches, to add to the atmosphere?
Sam: I mean, sure, I can do some of these things. Within reason. Right?
Matt: Maybe.
Sam: Once the mansion is built, does it stay built? It rebuilds every time?
Taliesin: I think it's like a Windows PC. You can change the desktop settings.
Marisha: What if the ladies went on a redecorating tear really fast?
Laura: They hung a bunch of fabric up and lit some candles?
Marisha: Dim the lights.
Matt: It's still a mansion. You have an indoor foyer. You can customize any other floor plan you like, and the decor of it, but it still looks like a mansion.
Laura: So we can put pieces of fabric up.
Ashley: Opium den style.
Liam: Can we build a stage out of chickens?
Taliesin: You could have little slave chickens.
Sam: I mean, that sounds so great. I'm on board. Let's try this stupid, crazy plan. So, we're going to go to the Arches tomorrow, disguised as the slaves of what's-her-butt?
Laura: Juuraiel?
Taliesin: You've already made a sale, and you have more back at the--
Sam: Sure. So, you're slaves, I'm a slave-master. What do I look like?
Laura: Whatever you want to look like.
Sam: No, I've got to look like a slave-master. Senny, what would I look like?
Matt: "I would recommend not being a pink-skinned gnome like yourself. Perhaps something that could live in this city."
Laura: Like maybe an imp!
Matt: "An imp would be interesting."
Sam: An imp with jewelry and such?
Matt: "However, an imp would not be solo and would probably still be behooven to the Nine Hells, and would work and be considered a subordinate to a pit fiend. I would not recommend an imp."
Sam: Give me a thing.
Laura: Something little.
Matt: "Perhaps an azer."
Laura: What is that?
Matt: "Well, as you would consider, close to them-- a dwarf. You may have seen a few." You've seen a couple of strange individuals throughout the city as you've walked by. They're dwarf-like, they're thick, they're muscular. They look like a dwarf, except for instead of hair and a beard, it's fire. A wreath of fire across dark grey, almost obsidian skin.
Taliesin: Baby Ghost Rider.
Laura: Awesome! Be one of those!
Matt: To give you a specific visual, to give you a feel for what I'm talking about here, when I say--
Taliesin: That's baby Ghost Rider!
Laura: That is awesome!
Sam: I'm in.
Liam: (high-pitched) Flames!
Liam: (high-pitched) Flames on the side of my face! Heaving, heaving breaths.
Taliesin: (high-pitched) Flames on the side of my face! Heaving, heaving breaths.
Matt: (high-pitched) Flames on the side of my face! Heaving, heaving breaths.
Sam: I'll make a mansion for the night. We'll all take a rest and then go tomorrow.
Matt: "I was going to make some beds. We have--"
Laura: Oh, that's so kind of you! But we have beds that are specific to us, and we--
Taliesin: Just the break from the heat is the only thing that would force us to deny your hospitality.
Matt: "Very well."
Taliesin: But we will keep the door to our rooms, of course, in your abode.
Matt: "Of course. We'll discuss soon our arrangement. Good night."
Taliesin: Why does he keep doing that?!
Ashley: Should one of us sleep in his house?
Laura: No, nobody should!
Taliesin: There's something wrong in it. There's something in the basement.
Travis: I have a quick request. Before I go to sleep, can I try and find Pike and see if she will teach me the alphabet, before my fox's cunning wears off?
Taliesin: That's the saddest thing I've ever heard.
Matt: You go and find Pike in her room. She comes to the door, already groggy, no pun intended. Sorry about that. You open your door and you see Grog standing there, looking a little sheepish.
Ashley: Grog, what's wrong?
Travis: Yeah, look, I had trouble sleeping, and I actually know Giant, but I can't read it. Do you think maybe, before this fancy smart-potion wears off, you could teach me some letters?
Ashley: Well, if we have a book or something, I could. A Beginning to Read Giant, is there anything like that where I could know what the letters are?
Travis: Well no, I don't see a lot of Giant, just even Common or--
Ashley: Just Common letters? Yes, I can show you the alphabet. I'll write it out. Okay? Do you know how to spell your name? Okay. It's very easy. You have four letters in your name, but there are two of the same letter. So you really only have three letters in your name.
Travis: How many-- I'm not so hot on the numbers, either.
Ashley: Okay, well, we won't talk about numbers. Okay, what's the first letter of the alphabet? This you know.
Travis: G.
Ashley: That's the first letter of your name.
Travis: Oh, it is!
Ashley: Yes, but that's not the first letter of the alphabet. You've said it before. Ah--
Travis: Ah-- I. Hey!
Ashley: Oh! It's the first letter, well, you wouldn't know that, because you don't know how to spell.
Travis: Fucking A, this is tough.
Ashley: Oh! You said it!
Travis: Fucking? A?
Ashley: A! A is the first letter of the alphabet.
Travis: A. Ay. A. A.
Ashley: And we can keep going-- (laughter)
Matt: Okay, for the purposes of the narrative, you spend the next few hours with Pike in your room, beginning to learn elements of the alphabet of Common. You go through enough of it where you pick up some of it and as the potion fades, so does the memory of the last three hours. (yelling)
Marisha: That's so mean!
Matt: This is Flowers for Grogernon. But it wouldn't have mattered because the Common alphabet and Giant runics are totally different things.
Travis: Yeah, totally. I just wanted to know something.
Ashley: Did I at least teach him how to spell his name?
Matt: Make an intelligence check, Grog.
Travis: Do I still-- no, it wore off, right? I don't have advantage.
Laura: You can do it, Grog! Roll a natural 20!
Matt: I'll say, as you feel the potion fading from you--
Travis: I burp, and I get a little bubble?
Matt: Sure. Go ahead and roll an intelligence check.
Travis: Oh, that's even worse. Aw, minus two, fuck! Twelve.
Matt: You get "Gr--" and that's where it ends.
Travis: My cursive is sweet. I'm so tired. You know, I've learned all of these but I'm really sleepy.
Ashley: We'll keep working on it.
Travis: I'm not sure we will. But yeah, keep working. Good night. Thank you, Pike.
Ashley: You sleep so well, okay?
Liam: Smash cut to a year later where he's going, "See. Kevdak. Run."
Ashley: No! That's so cute! Before I go to sleep, I am going to cast Lesser Restoration on myself, to maybe get rid of one point of exhaustion.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: Out of curiosity, sleeping outside of the effects of the heat should make--
Matt: That'd the Greater Restoration, technically, to try and--
Liam: There's AC in here, isn't there?
Taliesin: There's AC.
Laura: In the mansion. Not in the studio. (laughter)
Matt: Greater Restoration reduces exhaustion. But you can do that as well.
Ashley: I'll cast Greater Restoration before bed.
Matt: Okay. So you reduce a level of exhaustion.
Taliesin: I am going to send a little time working on a couple things for the fort when we get back. Netting ammo for the trebuchet, just a sketch. To start to design a very simple bolo for the trebuchet.
Matt: Okay. Just designing?
Taliesin: Just penciling and then penciling-- I've got a notion for a watch tower that's super super simple. Platform for two people, tops, with a rope that connects to a bell so when you start heading down it, it goes (high voice) Fuck!
Matt: Great. All right. So, as you guys all come to consciousness the next day, you gather your things and you step out of the mansion into the center of Senokir's shop.
Marisha: Do we recover our point of exhaustion when we sleep?
Matt: With the long rest, you recover a point of exhaustion, so you'll all back to baseline, including you, Pike, because your Greater Restoration. Your spells are recovered, HP is recovered, if there was any loss of it. So, the day is yours, what do you wish to do?
Sam: Go to The Arches. The golden arches. Wait, first we've got to cast Seeming.
Marisha: Are we going to scout-- I guess we still need Seeming.
Ashley: So we're all going to look like Vax?
Laura: And Vex.
Ashley: And Vex. All the girls are going to look like Vex.
Liam: Three Vex's, I mean, it's kind of the same.
Laura: I mean, yeah, but one's got boobs.
Liam: Which one?
Laura: Which one? (laughter)
Sam: We're going, right? All right. So, yes, I'll cast Seeming on everyone. Making them various level heights of Vex and Vax, I guess. (laughter)
Laura: (shouting) This is awesome.
Sam: And they're slaves, right? They're slaves. Tattered clothing.
Laura: No. No, make us look like good slaves.
Taliesin: Simple white robes.
Sam: All right. Simple tattered white robes. (laughter)
Laura: No, I want to look pretty.
Ashley: You're so rich, you want us clean.
Laura: Make us clean, like pretty slaves.
Sam: You're clean. That's right. You're the best of the best. You would have the best robes. Right?
Ashley: Like Princess Leia, Jabba the Hut.
Sam: Totally right. The best, finest simple white.
Travis: And we still have the neck thing.
Sam: Absolutely. And wait, am I making him celestial-ish?
Laura: Oh yeah, make his wings, when they come out, like white wings.
Sam: Is that a celestial? What does a celestial look like? Do they glow all the time?
Taliesin: They have white wings, correct?
Matt: Most angelic entities have white or gold wings.
Marisha: Did we find out if I could Alter Self wings?
Matt: You could not. It has to be the same physical structure.
Travis: Wait a minute. We don't want him walking through the streets, to The Arches, as a celestial. We want to get him in the house.
Taliesin: When he pops his wings, the wings will be gold.
Travis: Yeah, we haven't started walking though.
Liam: Can they be gold, delayed later, when they pop out?
Matt: We'll find out.
Liam: Oh, shit. Well.
Ashley: Can you hide them under a cape?
Sam: I don't know where you hide them normally.
Laura: They only last for an hour.
Liam: In my shoulder blades.
Sam: They're in you? Ew.
Liam: Yeah, well, it feels that way.
Sam: Are you Wolverine?
Taliesin: We are learning way too much about everyone.
Travis: So Seeming on everybody but Vax, right?
Sam: No.
Laura: No. Why?
Liam: The Seeming on us-- We look like us already.
Laura: It's just clothes, though.
Travis: Have we headed to The Arches yet?
Sam: We're walking there right now.
Travis: We're going to walk with a celestial in the middle of the streets?
Laura: No, we're saying we're not making his wings look like that yet, dude.
Matt: You guys are not sure where The Arches are.
Laura: Oh. Senokir?
Matt: "Yes?"
Marisha: Should we maybe go scout the location first as regular slaves?
Laura: No.
Sam: No.
Taliesin: No.
Matt: "What do you require?"
Laura: Hi, where are The Arches?
Matt: "Do you require guidance there? Uten, why don't you bring them to The Arches. I will not be joining you."
Taliesin: That's very fair.
Matt: "I wish not to get involved with a pit fiend. I will ask though, just to be safe, if I could have, of your choice, one small bauble to remember you by. As we still have an arrangement to discuss, and knowing, to an extent, your capabilities, there's a chance that you might escape without returning to me."
Liam: Is that for memories or for some voodoo shit?
Laura: It's voodoo shit.
Matt: "It is to make sure that should you abscond without upholding your end of the deal, I can find you."
Liam: From each of us or--
Travis: I can give him one of the Sandkheg bottles.
Marisha: No, it's okay. I Druidcraft a band around his arm.
Matt: "Thank you. That'll die soon."
Marisha: You can, like, preserve it.
Travis: No, it's going to die, Keyleth. Don't--
Matt: "It'll still function. It just will be lifeless. So, continue please. Stay safe."
Taliesin: Okay.
Sam: Yeah, great.
Travis: We go.
Matt: Uten is like, "Okay, follow me. I will lead you." Even he is looking a little weird over at Senokir.
Sam: And when I cast Seeming, I also cast it on myself, making myself look like an azer?
Matt: An azer. The flaming beard dwarf.
Sam: Yeah, I don't know if I can make flames with Seeming.
Matt: We'll say for the purposes of the illusion you can pull off something that resembles flames enough to the point where it should pass.
Sam: All right, great.
Matt: All right, so, as you guys walk out into the city, you are lead by Uten on a similar path that led you by the Pyriculum where you met Whaska, but you continue past that in the northeast direction heading towards, as he tells you as you pass, near the naval grounds of the Sea of Fire. Beyond that, you guys find the streets become wider and the network of clusters of metal cages begin to adorn portions of the center street islands. Within these cages, you see humanoids of all walks of life, creatures, beasts; it's a collection, a veritable zoo of entities from all the planes, all bound to various cages, chains, and other elements, whereas efreeti individually bark from top in a language you don't understand. You see large banners and streamers set across elements of the road to mark various segments of this area, and at this point Uten turns to you and goes, "Well, you have officially reached The Arches. I will bid you adieu as I also will not want to deal with a pit fiend. Good luck."
Laura: Wait, Uten.
Matt: (sighs) "Yes."
Laura: So what happens? Are these all for sale then and--?
Matt: "All the ones that do not look like they're yelling for you to buy something. Most likely."
Laura: Okay, and then other people come through. So, if you like do the door thing here then this could potentially be a market.
Marisha: Is it okay to just set up shop?
Matt: "If you are convincing enough."
Laura: Convincing enough?
Liam: Do we need a shingle to put out front?
Sam: A sign?
Liam: Flowers to make it look pretty?
Taliesin: Keyleth, can you shape something?
Liam: Oh my god, you look just like my sister! You look just like me! That is fucking weird-- (laughter)
Liam: I'm going to go stand over by Grog. I'll talk to you later, never mind.
Matt: You go walk over to Grog and look up at a much larger, slightly butcher version of yourself staring down at you.
Liam: Yeah! Slightly? Completely butcher! (laughter)
Travis: What's up, me?
Sam: Are we going to pose and start selling?
Laura: I mean, we'll set up shop and only sell to him.
Marisha: I could also, theoretically-- I just don't know well these things can see through other things. I could do Hallucinatory Terrain right around this and make us look like a little legit kiosk. With a little entrance incorporating your door.
Sam: How much can you change the--
Marisha: I can control it as much as I want.
Taliesin: Can you grow a gazebo?
Laura: Yeah, but people will see the gazebo appear out of nowhere.
Taliesin: It's a magical tent.
Sam: What do we need to sell people? We just need a slab to put them up on. To say, "Look here, there's this one for sale."
Laura: Yeah, but we need the mansion door to get him inside so we're not going to have us outside. Are we?
Sam: Yeah, of course, we're going to have you guys outside. How else are we going to convince him that there is more good stuff inside?
Laura: Oh, I understand.
Liam: We're the showroom window.
Taliesin: Can you grow a gazebo out of grapevines?
Sam: Or just a stone slab? We don't need much. Let's not break the bank.
Marisha: I mean, I could do some Druidcraft but that's minor. Growing a gazebo out of vines, that's Plant Growth. I guess I could do Plant Growth fairly instantly, without the full-- because it's a one or the other kind of a thing.
Laura: I thought you said Hallucinatory Terrain?
Sam: Why do we need a fucking gazebo?
Laura: Let's just fucking stand here.
Liam: We don't want to look like Three Card Monte guys with a cardboard box--
Laura: What if we danced?
Sam: Matthew, what does everyone else have around them?
Marisha: I still feel like if we are a crowd of slaves at a door--
Sam: What are the other kiosks? Are there any?
Matt: There are many scenarios in which you see people being sold. You find elevated wooden platforms, you find metallic stages that are being lifted by slaves, held up, where the barker shouts out among them. There are all sorts of presentations, each person is trying to shout over the other. Many of the various humanoids and efreeti you see in the vicinity are all yelling over each other and trying to catch attention. It's this weird constant barking, almost auction type atmosphere, where it's a lot of din, noise, music, and voices shouting over each other. It's also very crowded in this area. There are a couple small parts, there's like an alleyway nearby where there is a little more of an opening. Like if there was a spot to set up it would be there, if not there's-- probably could traverse the rest of the vicinity of the slave market but currently where you are that's the one space that's not too close to an existing shop.
Travis: Set up there.
Laura: Yeah, set up there. Then Grog, you lift him up and make him look super tall and we're doing this around him.
Travis: The celestial will sell itself. We don't need anything fancy.
Liam: In a row, in a row.
Laura: In a row, doing the same move.
Marisha: Can I Druidcraft some nice inviting looking bushes?
Travis: Shrubs?
Marisha: Shrubs, yeah.
Matt: Sure, which will definitely catch attention because no vegetation exists here for the most part.
Marisha: Never mind, then.
Matt: I'm just saying it would catch attention if you want people to look in your area.
Taliesin: No, it will be fancy. I think it will be fancy.
Marisha: What?
Taliesin: Plants where there are no plants is fancy.
Travis: What?
Ashley: And if a slave can do that, that's pretty special.
Travis: Maybe we wait until we see him so we don't get unwanted buyers.
Ashley: Maybe you can do some flair as people are walking by.
Sam: Should we sit here and wait for a while?
Travis: Yup.
Taliesin: Let's keep an eye out. Why doesn't whichever one of us is the one that can be sneaky and look around.
Liam: We all need to be voguing.
Travis: We're staying together.
Laura: We'll look as we're voguing.
Taliesin: All right. All right.
Travis: We wait to see if the pit fiend shows himself.
Sam: Can you guys all do like the Robert Palmer video? (laughter)
Matt: (singing) Simply irresistible.
Laura: Do you want to give us instruments and we'll all play something?
Sam: Sure, sure. I'll play a little ditty. We'll jam to it.
Matt: There is a series of smaller buildings in the area. There is the main street that runs through here and across that street is where there are many of the various slave blocks and larger platforms set. You guys find the entrance to this alley way, which curves around behind you and there is a large wall that leads to another section beyond that. This is where you begin to set up or where you're planning to set up shop. So you guys wait there for a while. Looking about, you can see, most of the people that are selling slaves there-- some of them are humanoid, some of them are kobold servants, some of them are worse for wear, looking like they are hoping to get sold soon before they expire. You do see, across the way, two young boys maybe about 15 or so years old, light blue-- (laughter)
Matt: No, Scanlan, no. (laughter)
Matt: Light blue skin and pupil-less. They are held by red-colored chains and they look broken of spirit and they are both sitting with a hunch.
Laura: Aw, can we get them? Go get them.
Sam: Poor Nightcrawler.
Laura: Go get them and see if we can get them.
Travis: Are they celestials?
Sam: I am going to go over there and buy these two kids? For what?
Laura: Maybe and then we can set them free once we're out of here.
Sam: All right.
Travis: What?
Taliesin: What?
Travis: No, leave them alone.
Sam: This isn't our fight.
Travis: Stay on target.
Sam: Do one of you want to go over there and say hi, slave to slave?
Laura: Yeah, I'll go over there.
Sam: Yeah, sure, go on.
Matt: Okay, Vex, by the way, your alignment's back up to Chaotic Good.
Laura: Oh! (fake sobs)
Matt: That was the last little push there with that instance.
Liam: I murder an old lady. (laughter)
Liam: Welcome back.
Matt: All right, so what are you doing?
Sam: I'll walk over with her so it doesn't seem weird that my slave is wandering around, I suppose. I guess?
Laura: Yeah, talk to the guy and I'll talk to the slaves.
Sam: They have an owner?
Matt: Yeah, as you approach the two of them, with the red chain around their necks and arms and they are leaning over the edge of the small wooden platform looking dejected at the ground. And approaching them, the skin itself is like a soft white porcelain with a slight translucent blue hue to it, white pupiless eyes. They look human, but they are beautiful and out of place here. Even in their destitution, you can't help but be struck by their presence. Both their chains are currently locked to this stump that is in the center of this wooden platform and behind it you see this grotesque-looking dwarf in very fine clothing that is very very dirty and old. He stands there clutching the edges of his lapel going, "All right, we've got here before you two, two I found and kept beneath my will. For sale. With angel blood within them."
Sam: (French accent) Hello, I am slave master Francois Australia and I am curious about your two angel boys. (laughter)
Matt: "Well, if you're looking to purchase, these will both set you back about 10,000 gold apiece or 18 for the set."
Sam: (French accent) What can they do? I would be curious to find out.
Matt: (whispering) "Whatever the fuck they can do I don't know. I wasn't selling them for their skillset. I was selling them for their uniqueness."
Sam: (French accent) How do you know anything about these boys? How did you get them?
Matt: "What's it to you, small one?"
Sam: (French accent) I like to see a chain of ownership so I know that the previous owner will not hunt me down and kill me in the night!
Matt: "There is no previous owner! I went and got them myself! The chain of ownership is this chain right here." He points to the one on the stump. You can see greasy black hair that is parted in the middle, mustache comes down into a weirdly fluffy beard that has weird oily portions of it. He's an awful-looking dwarf. "So, are you going to buy or shall I wait for the ones I'm looking for?"
Sam: (French accent) Which ones are those? (laughter)
Matt: "Piss off."
Laura: (whispering) Offer him 15 for the pair.
Sam: (French accent) (whispering) Merci. (normal volume) Would you take 15 for both of them?
Matt: "Are your ears clogged? I said ten each or 18 for the bundle!"
Sam: (French accent) Yes, but you don't seem to know where they come from, who they belonged to before. It's a risk that is possibly worth 3,000 gold.
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Liam: This is how Sam wooed me in 2008. (laughter)
Sam: Is this persuasion, solely? 20.
Matt: "Cash on hand? 15. (whispering) Don't tell anyone I said that."
Sam: (French accent) Oui. Oh, slave, can I have the gold? (laughter)
Sam: (normal voice) Are we really going to do this?
Laura: Yeah, we are going to buy them. We are buying them!
Travis: We're taking in everything.
Laura: They're so young! They're innocents.
Taliesin: And then we have extra slaves, it's beautiful.
Matt: "Haha. Well, it's been fine doing business with you." He puts the coins away, pulls out a piece of paper. "What's your full name?"
Sam: (French accent) Francois Bertrand Jean-Luc Australia. (laugher)
Matt: "Here you are. Transference of ownership." Grabs the chains, unhooks them, takes the lock and hands it to you. "They're yours to take. Now you two shove off! Do what the man says."
Sam: (French accent) Do they have names?
Matt: "No! It's your choice to name them!"
Sam: Au revoir.
Matt: So as the two of you walk back with these two chained boys who walk behind you--
Laura: Do you speak Common?
Matt: (stuttering) "Yes."
Laura: How did he find you?
Matt: "Well, we--" They both look at each other. "It doesn't matter, it's you who own us now."
Laura: It matters, dear.
Taliesin: Let's not have this conversation with them yet, sister, until all has been taken care of.
Laura: Ugh. (retching)
Travis: I see why we got them now. Even better bait.
Laura: Come stand over with us.
Taliesin: What, sister?
Liam: (retching)
Marisha: This is what we are now.
Liam: Grog, slap me really hard across the face right now.
Travis: Done.
Matt: Oh! He hits you and it's numb for minute. You realize, why is the world sideways? He knocked you to the ground.
Liam: Sweet, sweet ignorance.
Taliesin: Do you need a hand up, brother?
Travis: Stop hitting yourself.
Liam: I'm taking off a hit point.
Matt: The two children follow you back. They are chained and you have them at your disposal. What are you guys going to do?
Travis: We're waiting.
Sam: We're just waiting, I guess.
Laura: Do we have the mansion up?
Sam: Not yet. I'll say to the boys  You two, have you been for sale for more than a day or two?
Matt: "He's had us here for three days. Sorry."
Sam: It's all right. In that time have you seen a large red thing with big wings?
Matt: They both recoil, "No, no!"
Sam: Okay, all right. Thank you. We just wait, I suppose.
Laura: Yeah, I guess so.
Sam: You want to go buy a few more?
Laura: No, no, no, sorry. I'm sorry.
Ashley: You could just say, Angels for sale!
Liam: Wait, did you drop a bunch of gold on them?
Laura: No! No, no, no, we got an amazing deal.
Liam: Like how much?
Laura: Like, 50 gold. It was so affordable.
Taliesin: I want to do an insight check on that.
Matt: Go for it.
Taliesin: Insight check, okay, that's 22.
Matt: Make a deception check.
Laura: With my gold. Yikes, no, I don't win.
Matt: She is lying through her teeth.
Taliesin: You're an idiot and I'm very proud of you. Don't do that again.
Laura: Don't talk to me right now. Just don't. (laughter)
Taliesin: What if I were to do a very strange accent?
Laura: No, also not attractive.
Sam: (Vex impersonation) What if you were to talk like Vex?
Laura: Don't! Stop. (laughter)
Liam: I have found, put your hand up here like this when you're talking to them because Percival sounds like Percival.
Matt: While they're talking, Keyleth, you notice, across the way, the dwarf they had spoken to and purchased these two from has packed up his things and looks around, pulls a wand out, does a large circle, and him and his kiosk vanishes.
Liam: We fit right in.
Marisha: See, there are a lot of pop-up vendors here, guys.
Taliesin: Good to know. So if you summon your magical room--
Marisha: Maybe you'll be more impressive.
Sam: Makes sense.
Travis: Can I survey the road in the direction of the embassy. Do we see anything?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Travis: Natural one.
Laura: Aw, man!
Matt: You look over in the direction of the embassy and you stare at the embassy and from this far away it's hard to make out the shape but--
Travis: It looks like the letter ah--
Taliesin: You only know two. Pick one. (laughter)
Travis: And I stay there.
Taliesin: G and R, that's what you've got.
Laura: That is so sad.
Marisha: I could try and scry on him while we wait.
Sam: Yeah, scry again.
Travis: Nobody else wants to check the road?
Marisha: There is an alley behind us that we set up in front of?
Matt: Yes, there is an alley behind you for about 20 or so feet and then it curves off.
Marisha: Does anyone seem to be behind the alley?
Matt: From what you can see currently, no.
Marisha: Scanlan.
Sam: Oi?
Marisha: Do you want to come with me back into the alley for a little bit and watch, in case anyone sees? You could be giving me a good firm scolding, just in case.
Laura: Scanlan should be visible at all times.
Marisha: Well, it takes a minute to do the Scrying.
Sam: Vax, Vex, don't argue, we'll get through this. I mean, I'm going to go back with you so--
Marisha: Stand guard, I'll be right back.
Sam: Sure, I'll stand watch.
Marisha: I go back to a little dark corner and I pull out the Scrying Eye.
Taliesin: Pike--
Ashley: No, no, my name is Vex.
Taliesin: Vex, sister, do you want to perhaps do a walk around with the two boys and see if we can't attract some attention?
Ashley: Sure.
Sam: We're splitting the party.
Taliesin: I'm not getting far but I'm going to take the two boys--
Laura: You be careful with them.
Taliesin: I'll be very careful with them. I'm going to say, don't talk to anyone, don't look anyone in the eye, and don't answer any questions without my permission, do you understand?
Matt: "Yes."
Ashley: And don't be scared.
Matt: "Okay."
Taliesin: I've got a plan, follow my lead. This should be interesting.
Matt: As you guys begin to wander off with the two boys, Keyleth, you hold the scry crystal in your hand and, as you focus, you see this flash of heat in your mind and then darkness again. The spell has no effect.
Laura: He's not even here.
Sam: Or he's blocking it somehow.
Laura: No, I bet he's in the fucking Nine Hells right now.
Sam: Getting some money to go and come to the slave market.
Laura: Yeah, he's probably sold all the people that were hanging out with him last time.
Matt: Just so you're aware, the scry spell fails if they're not on your plane of existence or if they succeed their saving throw.
Sam: Ah!
Taliesin: You can try again in ten minutes.
Marisha: I can try again.
Taliesin: I'm going to look around for something interesting.
Matt: Okay, you begin to walk around, you hear the barking of various heavy-throated creatures. You come across this large, it looks almost like a wolf or dog but the face is a little less pronounced like a wolf and a little more humanoid in the front, but it is still bestial and monstrous. The coat is gray and matted and you can see these long fangs protruding. It barks and snarls but every single time it reaches for the bars-- and the bars themselves look like a flimsy wood-- but as it tries to tear at them or bite there is a spark of arcane energy and it backs up and seems to recoil from the attack and begins to pace back and forth in its cage again.
Taliesin: I try and discern who runs this establishment.
Matt: You also see behind that, there are two more cages that contain these very large insect-like creatures that have very long bodies with multiple legs, looks like a set of eight or so legs, almost like an oversized praying mantis, the giant pincers in the front, but they are currently collapsed on the ground within their cages resting in the heat. Behind them you see an individual that appears to be a similar racial background as Senokir, but is older with this red and graying goatee that comes to a very defined point at the end of the chin and is currently sitting, sipping off of a wine skin and watching you. (slurp)
Taliesin: Most humble greetings, good master.
Ashley: I'll bow as well.
Taliesin: My sister and I have been sent by our owner to peruse the market for things that he might enjoy and I have been asked to inquire upon the nature of what you're selling and your suggested price. Never making eye contact.
Matt: "Very well. We have today, and today only, two ankhegs for sale. Mind you, not bound. The will is yours to break. And one barghest at the front. The prices: the ankhegs are 500 gold apiece, the barghest, 8,000 gold."
Taliesin: My master is always interested in creatures of unusual disposition and he will be excited to know what you have for sale. I thank you for your time. May I please leave your-- I've lost my brain.
Matt: "Yes, please, go."
Taliesin: I bow, I back off properly. What are you feeding me in this cup? (laughter)
Matt: As time progresses and you guys have been wandering around, eventually the image does come across your mind as you wish to-- You wanted to Scry again?
Marisha: Yeah, whenever I can.
Matt: Okay. Still no success, unfortunately.
Taliesin: I'm making sure that the whole market knows that there is someone perusing and purchasing for unusual creatures and making sure they see the weird twins and the two angelic-- I'm making a show of it. And I'm making a show of our non-chained obedience.
Matt: As it progresses, the actual twins, you notice far up the way to where The Arches begin, you see a sight you've been seeking this entire time. You see a large, deep red entity begin strolling down the street with its burly rippling armored muscles, its giant red wings flared out behind it, its horned head and crest piercing the sky behind it as its burning eyes and fanged jaw and mouth. He lumps forward with each step, and as it does, you begin to see the essence of the necklace that had been described previously, dangling around its neck.
Liam: Preemptive jenga.
Sam: All right, we go back to the sales area.
Taliesin: We're not going to hurry. We're going to meander so that maybe we get seen.
Ashley: He gets a glimpse, yeah.
Liam: Can I tell you something really quick? I am super impressed with you. That was very kind. That's it. Get ready.
Matt: As you guys wait in the spot that you've chosen, the pit fiend, as you've rightfully designated it at this point, begins walking through and slowly making its way through the crowd. As it glances around, you can see it strolling up to a few bars and running its claws across. You hear the (clanking) sound of it-- thank you, Criss Angel. You see it running its claws across the bars with a heavy (clanking). It seems disinterested by many of the creatures that it passes by.
Marisha: Should I do something theatrical? Magicky?
Sam: I'll play a song. (singing) Hot in the city, hot in the city tonight! Tonight!
Matt: Make a perform check.
Sam: 23.
Matt: (heavy footsteps) It begins to eventually cross paths with the alley where you guys are situated. It turns its head and looks down to you, with your flaming beard and fire-wreathed head, playing your song. It slows its gait ever so slightly. It is an imposing and frightening entity. Even just being in its presence, even as you play the best you can, you feel everything almost slowed down in its proximity as its sheer immensity passes you, leaving you in its shadow for a momentary bit of time. In that moment, you feel the back of your neck stand on end. All the hairs immediately come to full point. You feel cold and alone as it sets its eyes upon you. It moves its gaze beyond and continues walking.
Taliesin: I'm going to walk by with the slaves.
Matt: Okay, so you come by, the other direction, as you guys finish your meandering. As you walk by, it (footsteps stopping). Looks at the two boys that you've procured and slows.
Sam: I'll call out to Percy  (French accent) It's no use! No one has enough money for our slaves! Forget it. We should clean up and go home.
Taliesin: Of course, master.
Ashley: Of course, sir. We tried so hard.
Matt: The pit fiend has turned about and is standing there with its arms crossed, watching this transpire maybe halfway up the block where you guys had set up. Its eyes narrow with a bright spark of yellow light that situates where its face is. (heavy footsteps) It saunters up in your direction, looks over to where the rest of you are, and where the two--
Sam: Is he coming over?
Matt: He's heading in your direction.
Sam: Okay, I'll summon the magnificent mansion door, and I'll say to the slaves: (French accent) All right, it was worth a try, but we must pack it in.
Matt: As you're saying this, the pit fiend puts a hand up. Its mouth doesn't move but you hear a voice piercing deep inside your head. It says, "Stop. I have discourse to make with you, small one."
Sam: But of course. I am here to sell, if you are here to buy.
Matt: "I have interest with your aasimar."
Sam: (French accent) They are for sale, for a good price.
Taliesin: I've already brought them into the mansion. I've already handed them off and said: Put them very far downstairs. Hide them.
Matt: You bring them into the mansion?
Taliesin: Oh yeah. I've brought them into the mansion and have put them downstairs. The servants are taking them down.
Sam: (French accent) We have already packed up for the day, but if this is a serious business proposal, well, I can go in and fetch them.
Matt: The creature leans down toward you, the pit fiend's very presence itself almost causing the air to vibrate around you. Though it is not the largest creature that you've faced, there is something about its presence that is purely evil. A bastion of power across all elements of the cosmos that you haven't had stare you down at this proximity. As it leans forward, the voice once again pierces the center of your brain. "It would do well to bring them forth."
Sam: (French accent) I cannot just communicate with them. Would you join me inside my shop? There you will see many other fine specimens.
Matt: "What is your price?"
Sam: (French accent) Well, you haven't seen what I have to offer.
Matt: "I have seen enough."
Sam: (French accent) So you are not interested in the naga, the goristro, the other celestial beings? The orcs?
Matt: Make a deception check.
Travis: Deceiving the devil, come on, baby!
Sam: 31.
Liam: (airhorn noises)
Matt: "Perhaps in time, but now I seek the aasimar in your possession."
Liam: But I did the airhorn!
Sam: (French accent) If you please, and with due respect, I do not see any jewelry or fineries on your person. Can you afford such prices that I will quote you?
Matt: As you say this, the eyes narrow. It leans back as its head cocks slightly. "Have you never done business in this city before?"
Sam: (French accent) I'm afraid that I haven't. But if you are serious, and it seems that you are by the way that you are not moving your mouth--
Matt: He begins walking away from you.
Sam: (French accent) Wait! Would you like to come inside with me and see them for yourself?
Matt: It has completely written you off and is walking northward, back from whence it came.
Travis: Quick, throw a price out!
Sam: (French accent) 30,000 apiece!
Matt: (footsteps) Slows its gait, turns around, (footsteps) keeps walking.
Sam: (French accent) 10,000!
Matt: It stops. Turns around and starts heading back toward you. (footsteps) The voice once again pierces, this time even more intense, more oppressive. You've seen shadow. You've never really felt it inside you before. The voice itself presses against your will. You hear it say, "Your price is acceptable. You know the Embassy is good to pay. Present the charges, and I will take them."
Laura: Can I come out and bow before Scanlan and say, "Forgive me, master, for interrupting, but the female aasimar is fighting back."
Sam: (French accent) Well, put her-- ugh-- I'm so sorry, sir. I must go deal with this. I don't want to make you wait here. You are clearly a man of respect.
Matt: "I will wait." It stays there, across the way, with its arms crossed, about ten feet from you.
Sam: (French accent) I will be right back, I promise.
Laura: I know she is much more powerful than the boys, but we cannot control her.
Sam: Did she use the magic?
Laura: All of it, my master! All of the magic!
Sam: Oh my god. Oh my god! I run into the mansion.
Matt: I would like you to make a deception check and you to make a deception check, please.
Travis: (laughing) Did she use the magic?
Sam: Can I inspire myself? Can I, after I know my roll?
Matt: Yeah, that's part of what's good about it.
Sam: Oh. Well, then fucking yes, I'll inspire myself. That helps.
Matt: What'd you roll?
Sam: One.
Matt: That's an auto-fail.
Laura: I rolled a 28.
Sam: Hey, she's good!
Matt: Well, as you charge in, and you're staying outside of the door? You watch as the creature, staring at Scanlan-- or his persona-- talk to you and then charge through the doorway. The pit fiend (sniffs) looks over to you.
Sam: Inside the mansion, I run up to Grog and I say: Cut me! Cut my face, cut my arms, cut me. Right now.
Travis: Okay, I pick him up by the top of his head and I do a one, two, three!
Laura: While I'm outside, I say  Could I offer you some refreshments, great master?
Matt: The voice echoes through your head in a way that is genuinely the stuff of nightmares. You feel your will crack slightly at its presence. It says, "No."
Laura: (small voice) Okay.
Travis: I also spit in your eye so it starts to water.
Sam: Great. I run out of the mansion. (French accent) Oh my god! Oh! It's incredible in there! She is so powerful! She cut me with her mind! Please, come with me, I will need help with this.
Matt: The voice says, "Your deceptions are angering and useless. If there is no business to be had, I will let the embassy know. You will not have business in this city ever again."
Liam: I slowly flex out my black wings, slowly, and lower them, and take a step half-covering you, and say, Are you all right, master? Do you need my help?
Sam: I think so? I'll say to the young man  All right, I am sorry to play these games and haggle with prices. I will go fetch them immediately. I'll go in the mansion and yell: Fucking jenga! We've got to fucking kill this guy! We've got to go kill him right now! Come on! Let's go!
Travis: Well, we're inside. Do we want to set up a sneak attack? Can we?
Laura: It's too late!
Travis: Why?
Laura: Because he's outside, dude! I'm out there with him. So is Vax.
Travis: Who's inside the mansion?
Marisha: We didn't really specify.
Matt: Yeah, you're in the alleyway still.
Marisha: I'm in the alleyway with the twins.
Liam: How are the twins and boss-man here arranged in the alley, or outside the door?
Matt: The doorway is in the alley. It's right where the alley meets the street. Keyleth is behind the alley. The twins are on the sides of the doorway, so you guys are along the sidewalk of the street. Grog is inside, along with Scanlan, Percy, and Pike.
Liam: What's our proximity to him?
Matt: He's about 15 feet from you guys. He's across the street, at this point, with his arms crossed, keeping a distance.
Marisha: 15 feet across the street?
Sam: I can go out with the two angels, get him to come over and look at them, at least. Then you guys can pour out? I don't know.
Travis: You can bring them out in front of the house if you want to. Then when he walks over we can--
Sam: Yeah, bring them up.
Laura: I don't want him to hurt them.
Marisha: I packed this, just in case.
Sam: You want to be an angel?
Marisha: No, I packed Feeblemind.
Laura: What does that do?
Sam: It could maybe work.
Marisha: It's an 8th-level spell, and it makes him stupid.
Sam: Can you look like an angel?
Marisha: No. Well, I could use Alter Self.
Laura: Can you make yourself step out-- no, I said there was a female.
Marisha: As one of the female aasimar?
Matt: You guys are having this conversation over your earpiece?
Sam: No, but we're in the-- oh shit. She's not there.
Matt: I was going to say. But you're in direct line of sight to the pit fiend.
Laura: So I'm not saying anything. I'm sorry.
Marisha: This guy has to make an intelligence saving throw.
Sam: All right, you do whatever you want. Give me the angels. I'm going to go back out there.
Marisha: Do you want me to try and make this guy stupid?
Sam: Yeah, if you can! Do whatever you can! All I'm trying to do is get him to stay long enough for you guys to do something.
Travis: Yeah, get him to come toward the door.
Marisha: He's 15 feet away?
Sam: Are you inside the mansion?
Marisha: No, I'm outside. I'm in the alleyway. How many feet away am I from him?
Matt: From him right now? About 35 feet.
Marisha: Is he aware of my presence?
Matt: You don't know.
Marisha: I'm going to saunter further down the alleyway. This has a 150-foot range.
Matt: Okay, so you pull even further back? Okay, make a stealth check.
Marisha: Ooh, that's good. 21.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: I've got the angels. I'm walking back out. Right?
Laura: No!
Ashley: I'll be behind them.
Matt: Okay, so Pike is coming out with the two aasimar.
Laura: Fuck.
Travis: I'll exit the mansion too, and start walking toward the embassy a few steps, slowly. Just to get distance.
Laura: I get ready. The minute, well, never mind.
Marisha: Okay. So wait, what are you doing?
Sam: I'm going outside with the two angels.
Matt: So, you exit with the reddish chains in hand and both of the boys exit with you. As soon as they walk out of the portal and they see, across the way, the pit fiend standing there with his arms crossed, they both (gasps) you hear the breath escape their lungs as the fear hits them. The pit fiend's arms go lax. You can see a bit of a smile on its face, now. It looks like its pensive frustration in waiting has been expended. The voice says, "You will be paid."
Sam: All right.
Taliesin: Money first.
Sam: I don't want to fucking bargain with this thing.
Marisha: As he goes to hand over the chains, right as he goes to reach for it, I'm going to do Feeblemind.
Matt: Feeblemind, okay.
Marisha: Jesus fucking Christ!
Sam: Don't miss and hit me, babe!
Matt: All righty, what's the DC on this?
Marisha: He's got to make an intelligence saving throw.
Matt: Correct, and what's your spell DC?
Marisha: 19.
Matt: 19. Okay.
Laura: Oh god. Natural one, natural one.
Marisha: Come on, come on.
Matt: All right. As it takes one step forward toward Scanlan, you, in the back of the alleyway, extend your finger. You watch as this slight shift of light travels forward, like a slight ripple, almost like a miniature breaking of the sound barrier. Strikes across the air. Seems to collide with the front of the pit fiend. As it hits, the energy (fizzling) dissipates, not affecting its form. You watch as the pit fiend suddenly, its attention--
Marisha: He takes 4d6 psychic damage.
Matt: He does.
Liam: Was Scanlan walking toward him, or had they gotten right up against each other?
Laura: I release Trinket from my crystal necklace.
Marisha: He saved from it, didn't he?
Matt: He does not appear affected by the ability.
Marisha: He's not affected by the ability?!
Matt: I mean, he took damage, but the Feeblemind did not seem to alter him.
Laura: Are there any of the efreeti guards around?
Matt: Currently, you do not see any. However, let's go ahead and pick up this confrontation next week. It's 11:00. If we jump into this now, we'll be here past midnight.
Taliesin: No, yeah, we're calling it.
Marisha: Gives us time to think.
Laura: We took too long.
Matt: It's all good.
Taliesin: This got wonderfully bad.
Liam: I'm going to forget by next week. Is Scanlan walking toward him, or had Scanlan gotten right next to him?
Matt: Scanlan stepped out of the door and walked out just enough-- Scanlan is probably ten feet from the door, there, right behind him, just emerged from the doorway. He's about ten feet from Scanlan, and 15 from-- Correct. I'll set up the arrangement for next week. I'll put something together for you guys so you know what we're going to start with next week. But yeah, we're going to jump in, next Thursday, into a mid-street City of Brass battle.
Liam: Sextuplets!
Sam: Vex, Vax, Vax, Vex, Vex, and Vax!
Matt: Here's the one thing I'm going to leave you with, because I feel this is important. As soon as you guys watch this slight dissipation of arcane energy splash across the torso and head of the pit fiend, and it steps onto its back foot, and you all realize this is the Jenga moment. As you're preparing to go into combat, you watch as the pit fiend narrows its eyes and, from immediately to its left, a small, localized gateway tears open and out from it you watch a humanoid female with large, red, feathered wings, carrying some sort of glowing lasso or rope at her side, armor, and a large weapon, with a bow slung across her shoulder, flies out next to the pit fiend. "You rang?"
Laura: Aw, fuck.
Matt: And that's where we'll pick up next week.
Laura: We're doomed.
Matt: So, we'll see you guys next week. Thank you very much. Thank you, Ashley, for coming and playing.
Ashley: I won't be here next week.
Matt: You won't be here next week? Aw, you're filming Thursday? Aw.
Liam: What you going to be working on?
Ashley: I don't know. Stuffs and stuffs.
Travis: Yay, Pike!
Marisha: We'll get you that armor!
Matt: Well, guys, thank you very much. Have a good night, rest well. Thank you, Loot Crate. Is it Thursday yet? See you guys soon. [music]

[START OF EPISODE]
Sound: (no audio)
Sam: -- is today's sponsor. A leading publisher of science fiction and fantasy for over 30 years. That's almost as old as I am. Do you like magic? Pirates? Knives? Royals and adventure? Then check out Shades of Magic, the series from Tor Books. The conclusion of which, A Conjuring of Light, was just released, so check out the full three-book series. Go to, there's a promo link somewhere on this page-- I'm gonna say right there. Let's say right there.
Travis: Yeah, sure!
Sam: So check that out. And the thing about sponsors, guys, is we really need to show them our love. And really show them that we appreciate what they do for us every week. They're a big part of the show, without them we would-- For instance, without sponsors, Taliesin would only be able to dye his hair platinum blond or brown.
Taliesin: Oh, no.
Marisha: It's true.
Taliesin: It's called Malibu Sunset.
Sam: Yeah. Laura's dice budget would go way down. Instead of throwing away 250 dice a week, it would maybe be more like 240, 230.
Laura: Oh God. Terrible.
Sam: I mean, Liam might have to go back to shaving his beard and selling the beard shavings to those in need.
Matt: To be fair, it was worth it. Look at them on my shelf.
Sam: I have just a few ideas for ways that you guys could show your love for our sponsors. Take them out for a candlelit dinner. I'm not talking Bennigan's, I'm talking something high-end. Shake Shack, Outback, maybe even P.F. Chang's. How about sending some romantic texts to spice things up? Keep it classy, like: Hey, Critical Role Sponsor, I wish you could be with me right now. Or, I had a dream last night, and Critical Role Sponsor? You were in it. And hey, compliments always help. Critical Role Sponsor, do you have a map? 'Cause I'm getting lost in your eyes. Or: Hey, Critical Role Sponsor, of all the beautiful curves on your body, I'm most in love with your smile. Or even: Critical Role Sponsor, on a scale of one to ten, you're a nine, and I'm the one you need.
Marisha: Don't use that one, either, in real life.
Taliesin: That would work on me.
Sam: Or you could just go to their website and buy their products. (all cheer)
Sam: So, Tor Books, thanks so much.
Matt: Thank you, Tor Books, and thank you to all those mentioned restaurants that will never be a sponsor for us now, and it's probably for the best.
Travis: The Bennigan's and the Monte Cristo.
Laura: Oh man, I hit up Bennigan's a lot.
Matt: I know, I was holding out for the P.F. Chang's but, y'know. Thank you so much, Sam, and thank you, Tor Books, for being our awesome sponsor tonight. Make sure to check out A Conjuring of Light, now available to you. All right, next up, the new episode of GM Tips is out. It came out today and this one is about suggestions on homebrewing content for your systems in game. I have, I think, three more episodes that are going on in the coming weeks, so look forward to those.
Marisha: And then we hand it off to someone awesome.
Matt: Exactly. We have a new person stepping in, after those episodes, showing their own flavor to the series. I'm excited about that.
Marisha: Because you can only learn so much from one teacher.
Matt: Exactly.
Marisha: The best teachers will teach you that.
Matt: Yep.
Travis: The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles only had Master Splinter.
Marisha: Shut. Up.
Travis: Daniel-san only had Mr. Miyagi.
Marisha: This is the real world, okay? This isn't fantasy.
Sam: They were homeschooled, okay?
Matt: And how many times did they have to reboot that to make it work?
Travis: That's a good point.
Matt: Eventually ending with the Michael Bay films. So check out that episode of GM Tips. As a reminder to all you guys looking to homebrew: It's hard. It's time consuming. It's not for everybody.
Laura: But it's so rewarding, Matthew.
Matt: It can be rewarding.
Liam: Could you do it different though?
Matt: Ugh. So check out the episode knowing that, and we'll have next week's episode next Wednesday.
Taliesin: Your other friends tell me that they miss you too. So yeah.
Marisha: Mm-hm. That's true.
Matt: Yeah, I know. I'll see people again soon. Also, I wanted to give a shout-out. We're in the final 24-hour stretch for the Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire crowdsourced campaign. So if you haven't yet, or you have interest in seeing the sequel to that, go and check it out. They're doing a final 24-hour stream over on Obsidian's stream channel, of course after our episode tonight. Go give them some love. And last, I have my list here, I was just able to announce that I voice Deadshot in the upcoming Justice 2. (all cheer)
Matt: Coming out in mid-May.
Laura: I play Supergirl!
Matt: Yeah! Fantástico! So look forward to that. There may be some more surprises as the cast is announced progressively down the road. Super happy to be a part of it.
Laura: Super happy.
Taliesin: (groan)
Marisha: (groan)
Matt: I need more alcohol. (all laugh)
Travis: Immediately.
Matt: Immediately. Taliesin, you wanted to mention something about your new show?
Taliesin: Yeah, we had the very first episode of The Wednesday Club this week.
Travis: Yeah!
Taliesin: I have now had eight hours of sleep, which is pretty magical.
Marisha: It was so good.
Taliesin: It was fun. And we're gonna be back this week with our next episode. We're actually gonna be talking about a lot of things, including characters with mental health issues in comic books, both superhero and otherwise. Including Legion, from the X-Men, who has currently got a show on FX which is magical.
Travis: Yeah he does. It's really good.
Matt: It's really, really good. Holy shit.
Taliesin: It's so good. So tune in, it's noon 'til two on Wednesdays, on the twitch stream where you probably are right now.
Matt: Noon 'til two Pacific.
Taliesin: And I think we bumped it to Alpha, but I don't remember, maybe not. And then it'll be on the rebroadcast if you wanna see it, but it's gonna be a lot of fun. Matt Key and Amy Dallen will be there, it's gonna be great.
Matt: Cool. Thank you, Taliesin. If nobody else has anything else to say...
Travis: Cheese is for everybody. Not just me.
Sam: Did you just say Jesus for everybody?
Travis: Cheese.
Marisha: Cheez Its?
Liam: Jesus for everybody.
Matt: Cheezits Christ for everybody.
Travis: Cheez Its Crust. (all laugh)
Matt: Without further ado, let's bring us into tonight's episode of Critical Role. (opening credits)
Matt: Hello, and welcome back. So, picking up where we last left off. Vox Machina, having defeated the Chroma Conclave, and restoring order and, for the time being, peace to the landscape of Tal'Dorei, resurrected your friend, Scanlan Shorthalt. However, he realised he needed some time to himself, to both connect with his interest in direction and life, and with his estranged illegitimate daughter, Kaylie. Upon leaving, the party proceeded to find their way to close all the loose ends that they hadn't quite had time to get to with the Conclave's assault. That involved returning the ashes of Senokir's wife to Vasselheim, and then making your way to Ank'Harel to deliver the hands of Ripley to the Scarbearers guild. On your way there you encountered a new adventurer, Taryon Darrington, who was looking to join an adventuring group for experience--
Liam: He's my favorite.
Matt: Yes, he's the best. He paid his way into your service and upon being returned to Whitestone you gave him a hazing, which broke him enough to be a little more honest with his reasoning for going on this adventure.
Laura: Let's not call it a hazing. It was an audition.
Matt: It was an audition, it was a brutal audition.
Marisha: (singing) Don't call it a comeback!
Matt: There you go. In which, knowing more about your new companion, you accepted him for the time being, understanding the dangers that are involved in following your path and he accepted. You made your way to Emon, looking as a way to find passage towards Vesrah, the home of the Water Ashari and the hopeful completion of Keyleth's AraMente. Upon finding and hiring a crew under the Captain Adella, you made your way onto your new ship and began to traverse westward onto the Ozmit Sea.
Travis: Shit, we're on a boat. We're on a boat motherfuckers!
Marisha: (singing) Don't you ever forget! (all laugh)
Matt: There is that.
Liam: We are noble creatures.
Matt: So.
Travis: (gasps) I hear the ocean.
Sam: That's someone snoring. (all laugh)
Taliesin: It's a rainstick.
Matt: So you guys have been at sea for a handful of days. It's been relatively uneventful. The boat slowly rocks, as the waters of the Ozmit are much calmer by comparison to that of the Lucidian Ocean. Making them a much more popular trade route pass between the various continents on this side of Exandria. Now the slow rocking of the boat, across the somewhat choppy waters, leads some of you into a relaxing lull over these days. Others, into perpetual bouts of nausea. But you notice that Captain Adella runs a relatively tight ship. Her crew works like clockwork, at her order, and the skies are thankfully clear these first few days, and the journey so far is mild. What would you guys like to-- Is there anything you wish to accomplish as you are travelling across the sea?
Taliesin: I've got a little bit of sketching, and working on something simple, that I might even try and build while I'm here.
Marisha: I'll catch up on some reading, I guess. Some of my alchemy reading.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: Stephen King novel.
Marisha: From I've been doing, trying to make that better.
Matt: Fair enough. Anyone else?
Liam: I have been sort of shadowing Grog for a couple of days, 'cause he doesn't have any gnomes to hang out with.
Travis: Oh that's right. Oh, fuck, it's real when you said it!
Liam: I have been playing Boulder, Parchment, Shears, and telling him stories.
Travis: The non-violent kind.
Liam: Yes, yes. Just hanging out, off and on.
Matt: Okay. Vex?
Laura: I guess I've been trying to get to know Tary a little bit better. And also flying like Vex-Kite behind the ship.
Matt: Okay. And Taryon?
Sam: Lots of push-ups, trying to beef up my pecs. I also, at the start of every day, I'm going to take two of those-- I have a bunch of silver coins that I carry around with me, and I'm gonna cast a couple of spells into them, just to have them at the ready. I cast Fly into one and Blur into the other.
Matt: Okay, good to know.
Sam: And then I would probably wander down to good old Percy, and just ask him if he needs help with any tinkering.
Taliesin: Oh yeah, no, I wanna see what he has, too. Like, there's gonna be some trading. I'll show stuff.
Matt: I'll show you mine, if you show me yours?
Taliesin: Oh yeah.
Matt: Perfect. So, as the two tinkering nerds begin to reveal their secret inner interests, Vex, you, about three days into this venture, you catch what looks to be a dark spot right on the horizon. Midday, maybe like two o'clock in the afternoon, it's a warm sun, this far, as you start moving westward and southward, you head closer to what would be the equator of the planet. It's getting warmer, and the sea spray is coming up, the smell of seawater and brine occasionally meets your nose, as the ship hits the various waves as they come across, but you're still keeping a keen eye out. And it's just endless sea in all directions, you see no landmass, but you see a little bit of something appearing at the horizon.
Laura: Like land, potentially?
Matt: It could very well be land.
Laura: I guess I'll fly down and-- I'm gonna try and stay off the deck as much as possible, since it makes me so nauseous.
Matt: So you just glide around the--
Laura: Yes.
Travis: Your imaginary character is also nauseous.
Laura: Potentially, yes.
Travis: That's a bummer.
Laura: I know, right. Vex hasn't had a lot of experience with ships, you know.
Liam: Does your real self also get sea sick?
Laura: I may have fed a couple sharks in my lifetime.
Travis: She painted the ocean. It was amazing.
Marisha: Ooh.
Laura: I'm gonna fly down and tell Captain Adella.
Matt: Okay. Keeping an eye out, and as you move, you catch a little more of the shape in the distance. It looks a little small to be a landmass. If it is landmass, it's a very small one.
Laura: Oh.
Matt: But it's stationary.
Laura: Oh, it could be another ship, possibly.
Matt: It could be a ship, it could be anything that would be stationary. Literally, it's only because of your keen vantage point, and your honed eyesight, that you're able to even make that slight, little bump in the horizon from here.
Laura: All right. Captain?
Matt: As you fly down, you see her, she's at the front of the ship. She has her one hand currently on the wheel, and she's looking out, chatting to the side with one of her crewmates, and turns around as you fly down next to her. She's surprised at your immediate appearance and she's like, "Oh, (gasps) sorry, I--"
Laura: You'll get used to that someday.
Matt: One of these days, I'm sure.
Laura: (laughs)
Matt: "What can I do for you?"
Laura: I see something on the horizon; do you know of any masses in the area? Maybe a ship, or island, or--
Matt: "Take the helm." She hands off the wheel to one of her compatriots, and she rummages over in one of the small chests to the side, and pulls out a large scroll and slams it onto a table she keeps maybe ten feet off to the right of her. And she goes through and pulls out a few instruments. Marks the sun and takes a good five minutes or so getting a really strong idea of where the positioning is. She looks down. "No, not much in the way of landmasses out here, my dear."
Laura: Do you have a telescope?
Matt: She goes and pulls out her particular eye glass. It's small, but functional. Glances over, and you look over in the direction and point it out. There's nothing on the horizon.
Laura: May I take that and fly up? I swear I'll give it back.
Matt: There's a long pause--
Laura: I've got nowhere to hide.
Liam: Careful, butterfingers.
Matt: Passes it over.
Laura: Up.
Matt: You take off, look up, extend it, keeping a close view. Go ahead and make a perception check.
Travis: First one of the day.
Laura: (screams) First one, first one, first one. Which of you?
Travis: Set the tone. Roll like a champion.
Laura: Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Liam: Natural one, the spyglass has fallen in the ocean.
Laura: Shut up, don't say it out loud!
Travis: Why did you go with the weenie one?
Laura: Shut up. 21?
Matt: 21? Okay. You take a moment and glance out in the same direction you were, and you scan past the horizon. Nothing.
Laura: Motherfuck. Well, I come back down. It went under water, whatever it was. Does that mean it was big enough to be some sort of sea monster? Was it a sea monster?
Matt: "I sincerely hope not, for all of our sakes. But, nevertheless, I'm gonna go ahead and have the men man our ballistas. Just to be safe."
Laura: How quickly do those things move?
Matt: "What things?"
Laura: Sea monsters.
Matt: "Depends on the sea monster."
Laura: This one was very large.
Matt: "Hopefully slowly." And she shouts off, "Full sail!" A bunch of the deckhands start pulling the ropes down, letting the sail come to a full-- flutter of wind itself isn't too terribly strong, but it's enough to at least inflate the sails even further, and give a little more of a speedy direction.
Laura: I wanna go back up and keep an eye, with the spyglass, on any kind of movement, that looks like it's coming towards us.
Matt: Okay, cool. Some of her men go over and start loading the large ballistas to the back of the ship. Anybody else hanging out on the deck?
Travis: Can I run to the bow of the ship? Heading for a new land.
Laura: Oh wow.
Travis: In New York you can-- No, sorry. (all laugh)
Travis: On the bow of the ship.
Matt: There you stand, at the bow of the ship. You see at the very front there's the point, the-- oh man.
Taliesin: Are you really?
Travis: What?
Marisha: Are-- you're not...
Travis: No, I'm just looking to see what I can see. Like one leg up, Captain Morgan style.
Matt: There you go. As you glance out, with your hand above on your brow, guarding the bright, cloudless sunlight down upon you, it is just endless ocean.
Travis: Is there one of those amazing naked ladies on the front of the ship? Holding out the pole, that comes out from the front?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Travis: Come on, Gil. Three. (all laugh)
Matt: It's still hard to see from this vantage point. You'll probably have to climb out there, and climb down in front of the ship to see.
Sam: He's in the back of the ship. (all laugh)
Travis: Do we mean to be going backwards?
Marisha: I go up to the deckhands who are manning the sails. Hi, heard it was full sail, full-- Do you need help with anything? To do-- you need--
Laura: Wow.
Marisha: I can make, like, wind.
Travis: Oh, you can!
Marisha: And we can maybe get there faster.
Matt: The gentleman who is there, currently wrapping a rope around his forearm, as he's pulling it down with his full weight, you can see he's maybe in his late twenties, though still going a little grey in the beard, for such a young age, but his skin is weathered, he's kind of missing a few teeth. He's got a large piece of-- like a bandana of cloth wrapped around the front of his head, and just a leather tunic. He kind of looks back to you. "Um, I've got it, but thank you."
Marisha: Oh, okay. 'Cause I can-- You're doing great. Good work.
Matt: Right, okay.
Taliesin: I'm gonna grab Bad News and run up to the crow's nest and see if I can see anything.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Guess word has gotten around the ship then.
Matt: Yeah. Well, she did shout 'full sail,' I guess maybe you went up to see what was going on. You get up to the crow's nest. Go ahead and make a perception check.
Taliesin: Make some room in here. What is my perception? That's 20.
Matt: 20, okay. You get up there, lean out, getting a view, you can see maybe 45 feet up, Vex is also keeping her eye out via broom. Taking her lead, and the direction she's facing, you glance out in that direction, but it's just open sea.
Taliesin: I'm gonna keep an eye out for a moment, for a little bit.
Liam: Is Tary down below?
Sam: I was, but I came up too. Hi, hello, hi. I have one of those little sticker things you put on the back for motion sickness. (all laugh)
Sam: One of these.
Laura: One of those things you put on your wrist? Yeah.
Sam: Hi, good day, good day, all.
Travis: Bidet.
Sam: Good day, hi, hi. That's it. (all laugh)
Matt: All right.
Marisha: I shout out to Percy, what are you guys looking for? Everyone's so excited! This is so exciting.
Travis: Why are you shouting? We have earrings.
Marisha: I was-- because we're on the high seas, and that's what sailors do.
Travis: Is it?
Marisha: Yeah! See, we're sailors, now!
Travis: We're sailors now.
Taliesin: She doesn't have to know what sailors actually do.
Matt: The shiphand who's manning the sail who's a foot from you right now just reaches up and covers his ear and goes, "Uh. We don't really yell that loud all the time into each other's ear, but thank you."
Travis: Yo-ho-ho! And a... help.
Marisha: Yeah.
Taliesin: Keyleth, ask the captain if she wants to have extra speed from your wind.
Marisha: Captain.
Taliesin: The captain, yes.
Marisha: I was-- I'm not talking to you, anymore, Percy. Captain.
Matt: As you approach from behind, she's currently holding the wheel, and she doesn't even turn her head to you, goes, "Yes?"
Marisha: Would you like more speed behind those sails?
Matt: "I mean, always, but--"
Marisha: Okay! And then I go back and I start doing Gusts into the sails.
Matt: Okay, Gust is a what-level spell?
Marisha: Well, it's a cantrip, or I could do a level three Gust of Wind.
Matt: Gust would be like a (pfft). It's more of a heavy fart.
Marisha: Sorry, level two Gust of Wind.
Laura: Basically you're blowing really hard.
Matt: A level three Gust of Wind, you said?
Marisha: Level two, level two. Gust of Wind.
Matt: Concentration for up to a minute, so okay. So as you focus-- actually, this is not a spell--
Laura: We're gonna be so fast for a minute.
Matt: Second-level spell, and it cannot be done at a higher level.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: However, it gives you a full minute of a very focused gust of wind of, as it-- the sails billow even further. You can see the ropes tighten, the guy with the rope around his arm goes, "Ow ow ow ow!" Has to unwind it real fast, go in and ratchet it to the side. But the sails pick up, and the ship itself picks up speed. For the next minute you've got a nice burst or so. You watch as the captain looks over the shoulder to you and gives you a nod, an approving nod, wordless, but--
Marisha: Captain.
Sam: I turn to Doty, and I say, take this down. With an efficiency and an effective leadership role model for everyone, the redhead continues to propel us forward, faster and faster, to everyone's surprise and respect, including the captain. As the salt licks my nose, and the sweet smell of adventure is in the air, I know that with her on our side, we will be strong and we will be protected. End of chapter.
Matt: The tension on the ship--
Marisha: Hey, look! I've got rubber booties! (laughs)
Sam: You're amazing.
Marisha: Aren't I cool, Tary?
Sam: Yes you are, ahoy!
Marisha: Ahoy!
Sam: (hearty laugh) Delightful!
Matt: The tension on the ship slowly recedes over the next hour as there is no sign of anything else.
Laura: Nothing?
Liam: Hey, man!
Travis: What?
Liam: You can't walk off in the middle of a game of hide-and-seek again. I've been in a barrel for an hour! I fell asleep in there!
Travis: I'm sorry, I get so distracted. Did someone find you?
Liam: No, I just woke up in a barrel, I don't even know what time it is--
Travis: Found you.
Liam: Touché, Grog.
Travis: Hey, do you want to help me? I think there's one of those wooden naked ladies on the front of the ship but I can't really see.
Liam: Uh.
Travis: Wanna reach a hand around and see if you get a handful of wooden boob?
Liam: Do you want me to do a reach-around, is that what you're asking me to do?
Travis: I might not ever ask you again, but right now, yes.
Liam: Okay, yeah, this is not like the wood nymph-- Never mind.
Travis: No, no, no.
Liam: I go ahead and do a reach-around, I suppose.
Matt: Okay. You shimmy out onto the front of the ship. You do actually see just the cusp of what looks like a pair of hands that are clasped, carved into the top of where the wooden point at the front of the ship is. So there is definitely a figure there.
Liam: Yeah, I'll hang down.
Matt: Okay. You hang down, and reach, as one would. (all laugh)
Taliesin: This got weird quick.
Matt: As you kinda grasp over and hold and feel around there--
Laura: This is so ridiculous.
Matt: -- not finding much in the breasts, but you find a bulge. It does indeed have a figure at the front of the ship, this one is not female.
Liam: Is it a wang?
Matt: Yeah.
Liam: Nice.
Matt: I mean it's a bulge where one would be, yeah.
Liam: Okay.
Marisha: This is an equal opportunity ship.
Laura: That's right.
Liam: Pat, pat, pat.
Travis: What you got down there?
Liam: Oh, she's a beaut, Grog, I wish you could see her. (all laugh)
Travis: Really? Describe her to me in vivid detail.
Liam: Oh, uh. Athletic, hearty. You know, curves in all the right places.
Travis: I'm loving this.
Liam: Yup, yup. Your type, I think.
Travis: Man, battle scars?
Liam: Uh.
Travis: How many breasts? Please say three.
Liam: It's one good, one good chest, here. You know what, I will draw you a picture. All right?
Travis: Yeah, that's great!
Liam: Okay. I'm gonna try to climb up without falling into the drink, all right?
Travis: Oh, yeah, that'd be good.
Matt: Okay, go ahead and make an athletics check real fast
Travis: (giggles)
Liam: Is this my character sheet? (all laugh)
Liam: That's a five.
Matt: That's a five? (laughs) You hear this brief bit of tension (sound of exertion). And then a (splash).
Laura: (gasps)
Travis: Vax? Vax? Yeah, okay, right, you fell off the ship. Right? Vax? Um?! (all laugh)
Sam: First player death.
Travis: I think Vax may have fallen overboard.
Marisha: Grog, what did you do?
Travis: I know it could be a very elaborate joke, but you know that sound when you deuce, and it goes  (ker-ploop)? (all laugh)
Travis: I just heard that and I think it was Vax.
Marisha: Ugh.
Laura: Can I look down in the water?
Matt: (laughs) Yeah, you look down, you don't see anybody in the water, but a moment passes and you glance over and there, up the side of the ship, with two daggers, climbing, and soaking, sopping wet with seawater, which has caused all of the heavy, thick black fabric to just become an additional 40 pounds on him, you watch Vax make his way up to the top of the ship once more.
Liam: This is the best this armor has smelled in weeks! (all laugh)
Liam: Ugh. I love the ocean!
Laura: I'm gonna land in the crow's nest with Percy.
Travis: That was amazing! You are so drenched right now.
Liam: I'm twice as heavy as normal.
Travis: Man. Yeah, no seriously, she's that stunning, huh, in the front?
Liam: I start--
Travis: I can't wait for the picture.
Liam: Oh yeah, yes, big.
Travis: Yeah.
Liam: Big.
Travis: Big booby. (all laugh)
Liam: That's you.
Travis: Big booby.
Marisha: I kinda do a quick, like, Druidcraft gust and dry him off a little bit.
Matt: Okay. It's like holding a hairdryer to him, just (loud whooshing). (all laugh)
Matt: His lips are like (pbbbft) off to the side briefly.
Liam: I shake like a husky a little bit.
Matt: Exactly.
Matt: All right, you said you head to the crow's nest with Percy?
Laura: Yes.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: Okay. Anything in particular, just keeping watch?
Laura: Just keeping watch.
Taliesin: Sitting and sketching.
Laura: Yeah.
Taliesin: Looking out every now and then.
Laura: I don't feel as nauseous up here, it's nice.
Taliesin: Quite nice.
Matt: All right. About two hours later, I'll have you both roll perception checks, if you could.
Liam: This is the laziest day we've ever had.
Laura: I know, it's nice.
Matt: Mm-hm.
Taliesin: Wow, no.
Matt: Days at sea, it's nice.
Sam: Meanwhile, Whitestone burns. (all laugh)
Matt: Shh.
Travis: Getting flashes.
Laura: No!
Marisha: No!
Taliesin: To be fair, I'm not really looking very much.
Matt: Fair enough.
Taliesin: 11.
Matt: Okay. 11. Yeah, you're distracted.
Travis: Oh, jeez.
Taliesin: I'm distracted.
Matt: With your companion.
Laura: 18.
Matt: 18. Okay.
Taliesin: You're less distracted.
Laura: Uh, pretty distracted for Vex.
Travis: Is it clear skies or are we sailing through fog?
Matt: Uh, no, it is clear skies.
Travis: Right, so we could just look up, and see horror.
Taliesin: Wait, what?
Travis: What?
Laura: We're not having sex, we're just talking.
Travis: Oh!
Taliesin: Just having a chill. It's just to chill up there. It's nice.
Travis: Oh, right.
Liam: Just like a prom make-out, that's all.
Laura: No! Just chatting.
Taliesin: You're just sitting and drawing in a basket!
Laura: Yeah.
Travis: In a crow's nest? Like a big laundry basket? It's just like--
Taliesin: Yes, it's basically a hamper.
Laura: Yeah. TRAVIS Oh, okay.
Liam: It's the most privacy you've had--
Sam: Any hand action going on?
Taliesin: Oh my God!
Matt: (laughs) Jesus Christ!
Laura: No hand action, no hand action.
Taliesin: That got dark.
Matt: Anyway, you guys, due to distraction, catch it about the same time the rest of the party does. As you look ahead and notice that there is a fog bank forming maybe a few hundred feet ahead of the ship.
Travis: Called it.
Laura: Oh, shit.
Marisha: Who sees it?
Matt: Well, everybody does now.
Marisha: Oh, everybody does now. Can I do a nature check to see if it looks like natural ocean fog?
Matt: Go for it.
Marisha: That's not great. 14.
Matt: 14. It doesn't take much for you to realize that this fog is pretty localized. It's not an entire bank that covers the entirety of the ocean in actuance. You kind of travel from one side of the boat to the other to get the scope of it. It's pretty narrow and pretty focused in its direction.
Marisha: Does this look like something that I would have? Like, is this another druid doing a fog cloud spell?
Matt: You recognize this to be of similar size although magnified.
Marisha: Bigger than us?
Matt: A little--
Marisha: Than my spell. Bigger than my spell?
Matt: Bigger than the usual spell that you are used to casting but it does appear localized enough to be of a similar-type spell or effect.
Travis: Hey, Keyleth?
Marisha: Yeah.
Travis: Quick question. Is there a d-- decor-- uh, like a proper way to announce ourselves?
Sam: Protocol.
Travis: Thank you.
Marisha: Well, I--
Matt: The ship suddenly lists a bit as you watch as Adella is now turning the wheel and turning the ship to try and veer around the fog bank that suddenly has appeared, and she's shouting off to some of her crew. They're starting to man the ballista at the back of the ship once more--
Laura: Is this normal? Is this a sea monster?
Matt: "Um. It's fog!"
Travis: (laughs)
Matt: "I have not yet encountered a monster that creates fog! But I'd rather not be caught off guard."
Marisha: Wait, wait, wait, this--
Sam: I can communicate with semaphore if that's something you'd like me to do?
Travis: What's semaphore?
Sam: It's communication with flags. It's a primitive communication technique that I learned in many of my studies, boat-to-boat it's really helpful. I pull out a couple of pieces of fabric and start gesturing--
Travis: Holy shit. You're that guy. (all laugh)
Travis: Where is the other boat?
Sam: Well, you just said to announce ourselves, I could announce. Vox--
Laura: I wonder if they can see through the fog?
Sam: -- Ma--
Travis: Yeah, we should have him do that. You should go to the front of the ship--
Sam: -- chi--
Travis: -- and just make sure they know we're coming.
Marisha: Can you do any flourishes?
Sam: -- na.
Marisha: Can you do any like tosses? Like color guard?
Sam: Oh, no, no.
Marisha: Oh, damn. All right.
Sam: That would be really cool, though.
Marisha: Sorry, Captain? How close are we to our destination? This could be Vesrah.
Matt: "From the recent calculations I made on our map, we're at least a day and a half out."
Marisha: Really? Does this look to be island-sized?
Matt: She's glancing over the front and-- you guys, by the way, are up there in the crow's nest and one of the ship hands is now climbing up the rope net to get to the top as part of his job--
Laura: It's a little crowded up here, but--
Matt: -- he gets up there and goes, "Um."
Laura: I hop on the broom and get out of it so he has more room.
Taliesin: I'm used to this enough, I know how to make room from last time I was on a boat.
Matt: He hops in and pulls out his spy glass and begins looking out. Shouts down to the captain. "Captain! It's moving!"
Laura: It's moving!
Taliesin: It's moving?
Matt: And you watch as she shifts-- the ship begins to turn wide to move around and the fog shifts to meet the direction of the ship.
Laura: Oh, shit.
Travis: Smart fog.
Laura: I just pull out an arrow and get ready.
Marisha: So it's coming towards us?
Matt: Mm-hm, or the ship is going towards it.
Laura: I'm going to tie off a rope to the broom.
Taliesin: Not a bad idea.
Matt: All right. She continues to try and move around, and the fog cloud shifts around, shakes her head and you hear as Adella shouts out, "All right, looks like we're going in. Be at the ready!" And eventually the fog bank hits the front of the ship, and within moments your visibility is cut to nothing.
Travis: What?
Matt: You can see no more than maybe a few feet past the edge of the boat, and for those at the back of the ship, the front of the ship is obscured. Those at the front of the ship, the back of the ship is obscured. It is a very, very thick fog that has completely immersed the outside of the ship.
Travis: Vax, don't try anything.
Taliesin: Everybody keep checking in.
Sam: I will flip a coin to Jumbo over there and tell him, listen, if things get hairy you might want to use this.
Travis: Use what? I can't see you.
Sam: Oh, God! Shit! (all laugh)
Marisha: I do another Gust of Wind and clear the ship deck and clear the path ahead of us.
Matt: Okay. They clear out, and slowly the fog begins to choke back inwards. Slowly, it does help temporarily, but as the ship moves forward basically you move past the area that you've cleared out a little bit, and the rest of the fog tends to envelop it.
Marisha: I'm going to see if I can see what this is from underneath the water. I'll be back. And I swan-dive off of the edge and into the water.
Laura: Did you say it over the earring?
Marisha: Yeah, bye. I'll be back. Bye! I'm going to do Alter Self to give myself little gills and little fin hands and go with the ship.
Sam: As I see her do this, I am going to alter myself to have the same.
Marisha: Oh! What's up, Tary?
Sam: I pick up the coin and hand it to Grog and say, this will make you fly. And I'll dive over the edge as well.
Matt: Okay, Tary gives a graceful, if a little clunkier, dive. In full armor, which makes it hard to swim.
Sam: Oh, shit. (all laugh)
Matt: But you can breathe underwater. It's medium armor, it's not too crazy, you're fine. But you with a much heavier splash. You look behind you, and see Taryon has met you in the water with the gills also kind of extending out of the sides of his neck. I would like both of you to make perception checks. (all laugh)
Matt: Make perception checks, please.
Marisha: Don't fuck me, Gil.
Sam: 16.
Marisha: It was cocked. It was right on a 20, which sucks. That's all right, perception check, 24.
Matt: 24. Okay, as you guys hit the water and go underneath for a second, you can see amongst the water, which is relatively still out here, and there's still the fog above, you see a slight displacement in the water.
Sam: Oh, there's something in the water, a boat.
Matt: Keyleth, you look over and you can see the displacement. There is nothing dark, but it's almost like something is pushing down into the water, or like there is a concave portion of the water.
Marisha: But nothing under the surface? Nothing breaking the surface tension of the water?
Matt: It is breaking the surface tension, like it's in-- as you glance over you can see there's what appears to be an unnatural break in the waves like a path.
Laura: Like it's invisible?
Matt: It's like another ship or something of that size is currently keeping in time with the Drensala Vis.
Taliesin: Oh.
Marisha: It looks smooth. It looks man-made?
Matt: Well, you don't see what's there. All you see is the break in the water.
Marisha: It's invisible. Okay, I come up out of the water and I use my earring to communicate that to everyone else.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: Do you still have your fucking gills on?
Marisha: It's, you know-- I don't know, do I?
Laura: Does that mean you choke?
Travis: Yeah are you like--
Marisha: Can I communicate?
Sam: She has gills but she keeps her mouth and stuff right?
Marisha: I can still talk.
Matt: You can still speak, I'd say, once you break the surface of the water.
Marisha: Yeah I come out of the water and communicate it.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: You sound like Kim Carnes. Everybody, this is great. (all laugh)
Marisha: A little bit like Linda Blair.
Matt: All right, you guys hear Keyleth begin to inform you as you hear off to the left side of the ship two localized sounds-- it sounds like wood slamming into wood or some sort of a heavy impact, two in rapid succession. And you watch as from out of the fog two extremely long metallic jagged and almost like hooks or giant grappling hooks slam into the ship with chains behind them that suddenly grow taut. The rest of the crew begins to turn around and move their ballistas in the direction of where the chains come from, but you still see nothing there. The fog is too thick.
Liam: I'm going to hide.
Matt: Okay, go ahead and roll a stealth check.
Travis: And we can see the hooks, right?
Matt: You can see the hooks, yes.
Laura: Can we see the hooks from the crow's nest?
Matt: It's just out of view. You watch them pass through, and you see them arc below you, and then vanish into the fog. And you hear the impact and the ship kind of (impact noise) from the hit.
Laura: I want to try and hover down so I can see a little better.
Taliesin: Are you with me?
Laura: Yeah.
Taliesin: I'm going to very quietly say that I'm going to grab onto your broom and head towards that end. I'm also going to activate the spider climbing boots.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: I would definitely like to go and see the giant sea creature claw that just grabbed onto the boat.
Matt: Okay, you rush up to the edge of this giant claw that's hit it and you can see it's a thick-- like a dark iron pole maybe about that long--
Travis: Oh!
Matt: -- it's about that big around and has a large chain affixed to it that just progresses off that side of the boat into the fog. It looks like a series of giant hooks or curved spikes, and it has jammed and dug itself and dragged and caught on to the actual deck of the ship.
Travis: Good news, not a sea monster. Bad news, a big hook that leads to nowhere.
Laura: Get it off the ship. Can you pull it off?
Travis: Sure. So I'll try and lift the hook off the ship.
Matt: Go ahead and make a strength check.
Travis: 15.
Matt: 15. You're lifting right now and it's not shifting. Unfortunately, the weight of both the ship moving forward, the tension on the chain and the hook, and the hook being so heavily dug into the deck, like versus that portion you're just not getting enough of a lift. There's too much torsion on the actual connection to the ship.
Travis: You know what, I want to see where this leads. I'm going to leave it here.
Liam: Fuck you, physics.
Marisha: I'm going to swim closer to where the chains are coming from and swim closer to the invisi-ship.
Sam: I join her.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Trinket's going to run up next to Grog.
Matt: Okay, so Trinket and Grog are now heading to the left side of the ship--
Travis: Hey, buddy.
Matt: --you guys are swimming in the water towards that direction, and you watch as suddenly what was once a slight displacement in the water becomes visible. And you see before you a smaller, more compact-looking ship, but it has a series of iron plates all across it in various places. It's armored from all directions, haphazardly. Not a beautiful construction per se, but made for function.
Marisha: I'm going to come up-- oh, go ahead.
Matt: You look up, and from what you can see on the edge of the ship, and you can see what appear to be two small gray crystals that are giving a faint glow, and it looks like they are actually creating and emanating this fog that is surrounding the space.
Travis: Awesome.
Taliesin: Fog machine.
Marisha: I'm going to come up and, in the path as the ship is going by, can I do a poof of Faerie Fire in front of it? To see if I can Faerie Fire the ship?
Matt: Okay, well, you can only Faerie Fire creatures in a small area, a ship--
Marisha: It's not going to do it.
Matt: --probably shouldn't be Faerie Fire.
Marisha: Okay, then I'm going to see if I can-- can I try and grab onto the side of the ship?
Matt: With just your fingers? It's pretty-- I mean-- okay, you know what, I will say because of the iron plating there is a little bit of a grip.
Marisha: The seams?
Matt: Go ahead and make an athletics check.
Travis: With your webbed fingers.
Sam: Can I join her on this?
Matt: Mm-hm. You can, indeed.
Marisha: Natural one.
Matt: You reach up and grab, and about three nails snap, and you lose your grip, falling back into the water.
Laura: Oh, shit.
Taliesin: Oh, ow.
Laura: That's just mean.
Marisha: That shit hurts.
Sam: Athletics?
Matt: Yes.
Sam: Ten.
Matt: You barely hold on. You don't climb, but you hold on and watch as Keyleth just--
Sam: Oh! I'm alone. (all laugh)
Sam: Do I see her in the water?
Matt: You see her splash and disappear under the water below. The fog is starting to close around the area.
Sam: Shit. She can swim; she'll be okay. She's so strong and powerful.
Marisha: Do I see Tary?
Matt: You just went under the water. You come back up and you watch Tary vanish as you're now being left behind. The ships are traveling faster.
Laura: Keyleth, can you do anything about this fog?
Marisha: Yes! Once I track down the ship. I kind of swim up and I say, Tary can you catch-- this might be bad. Do I see any type of-- what are they called? Cleats. The ship cleats. Do I see anything like ship cleats? Right?
Taliesin: Yeah, no, that's right, it's the little prongs.
Marisha: Like the little things, the prongs. Do I see anything like that? I want to try and do a-- like a grasp-- like Thorn Whip myself to the ship.
Matt: You see one, it's a little ways up from where the ship is actually hitting the water. You would have to probably swim close enough to get there. I'm going to say, make an athletics check to see how quickly you can try and swim against the ocean just for this brief moment. You're going to have to roll pretty high.
Marisha: Well, that's not great. Just straight athletics?
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: Athletics is pretty good! 15!
Matt: 15?
Marisha: Yeah!
Matt: I'll say you don't fall too far behind the ship, it's still going faster than you and the water is kind of up and down. Using your Alter Self gills, you can dive below the surface to try and avoid the choppiness of the ocean, and you come back up. What's the range on your Thorn Whip?
Marisha: 30-foot range.
Matt: 30-foot range, and it pulls whatever is there ten feet towards you. We can say it'll pull you ten feet towards it. So it gives you a slight arc, but not enough to actually reach the ship, you can just cruise past the grasping range of Taryon. So, Taryon, as you're there on the side and you glance over and you watch as Keyleth suddenly produces a large thorny whip, a druidic vine that wraps around the small cleat on the side of the ship.
Sam: Oh, shit.
Matt: And you watch as she arcs out of the fog towards you, reaching her hand out in your direction.
Sam: I will--
Marisha: Tary!
Sam: Yes!
Marisha: Tary!
Sam: Yes, grab my hero's hand. (all laugh)
Matt: Okay. You grab her hand--
Marisha: Tary! I want to apologize right now. Because in this moment, I am a damsel and I am in distress! (all laugh)
Marisha: So cross it off, bitch. Come on!
Matt: Make a strength check.
Sam: Okay. Okay.
Taliesin: Oh, please. Oh, please.
Sam: Wait, strength?
Matt: Yes, just a strength modifier bonus.
Sam: I'm feeling lucky! Yeah. (all laugh)
Sam: 19.
Liam: Hey!
Matt: Okay. All right. You grab her, and you-- it pulls you from two points, but you had managed to keep your hold and grasp Keyleth, now dangling from your arm.
Sam: I did a lot of pushups today! Ow, ow, ow, ow.
Matt: It is. You're very sore-- (all laugh)
Matt: You are very sore, but you manage to get her right up to the edge of the ship, and she manages to get a grip onto the edge.
Sam: I. Was amazing. (all laugh)
Marisha: You were. Today, in this moment, for this 30 seconds of time--
Sam: Augh! (all laugh)
Taliesin: I'm gonna be in the middle of this for months.
Marisha: --you were a hero.
Taliesin: I'm gonna be right in the middle of this. For months. Okay.
Sam: We'll omit that part. (all laugh)
Taliesin: Did it leave a little stain?
Sam: It's in my nose.
Marisha: Thanks. Okay.
Matt: You look up at this point and you can just barely see the chain, and you watch as a couple shapes, just barely visible through the fog, are now leaping across the chain towards your ship. So--
Marisha: I give a heads up. Heads up, heads up, people. Incoming forces, coming your way!
Matt: You guys in the ship, you glance over where the chains are currently pulling taut. You watch as a series of humanoid figures wearing dark, dark green and black leathers, their faces partially obscured, rush onto the ship, weapons drawn. I'm gonna ask everyone to roll initiative.
Marisha: Fuck. I hope these aren't my--
Travis: Right. You ran into our ship!
Marisha: --these aren't, like, my people, right? I haven't found out who they are.
Laura: I know! What if they are?
Travis: We gonna kill 'em.
Marisha: No!
Taliesin: Whoa! I don't feel good about that.
Laura: Look at that!
Marisha: Yay, it's a boat!
Travis: Boats!
Sam: There's a boat! Oh, wow, the top-down view looks so three-dimensional right now.
Laura: Yeah, really, it does.
Sam: It's really cool.
Laura: This is insane! This looks so 3D!
Travis: Well done, man!
Sam: 1980s graphics!
Matt: I can't take full credit for these. These were already premade
Travis: Aw.
Taliesin: This is like the finest arcade that I've ever been by.
Laura: This is so cool.
Travis: Which one's us?
Matt: All right. There's the two of them in the ocean currently off to the side.
Travis: You dingalings.
Laura: They can fly. They can fly. Oh my goodness gracious. This is so cool. What is this? What is that?
Matt: All right, so. Up in the crow's nest, we have Percy, one of the other shipmates, kinda up there. We have, down here at the wheel, the captain. These two, wielding two different ballistas.
Travis: At the bow of the ship, heading for --
Laura: -- a new land!
Matt: We have Doty, just hanging off to the side, watching and trying to take record of whatever's happening at the moment. Grog, where are you?
Travis: Wherever that grappling hook was.
Matt: That would be right here.
Sam: (roars)
Matt: With Trinket right by your side.
Travis: Welcoming committee.
Laura: Yeah.
Sam: We're gonna eat it.
Laura: Me and Percy had said we were sort of on our way down.
Taliesin: Or actually, we had sort of headed towards the other boat.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Right, so you guys had made your way. So, yeah. So--
Taliesin: I was gonna ask you to drop me at the other crow's nest on the other ship.
Laura: Oh.
Travis: You need more iron in my diet.
Marisha: These are probably the Water Ashari, aren't they?
Matt: So you guys are heading this way? Are you taking him with you?
Taliesin: If you're down.
Laura: Uh, I was going to. I wasn't going to go all the way to the other boat, but I can. If you want to go with us.
Taliesin: Oh, please!
Sam: Toy boat, toy boat.
Sam: Toy boat.
Taliesin: Toy boat.
Laura: Toy boat.
Taliesin: Toy boat.
Laura: Toy boat.
Sam: Tor Books.
Sam: Tor Books, Tor Books. (all laugh)
Taliesin: Tor Books, Tor Books. (all laugh)
Taliesin: Tor Books, Tor Books, Tor Books. It's actually kinda hard.
Sam: Yeah.
Matt: All right. Vax, where are you? Since you are hiding.
Liam: Well, I did a stealth check, and I got a 25--
Matt: Right.
Liam: I didn't know what the boat looked like, so if there's stuff in the bottom, I'd hide there, but if they're gone, I could also have gone up to the crow's nest. Whichever.
Matt: You could probably be hiding amongst one of the low sails probably. So we'll say you're up in this sail.
Liam: Okay.
Matt: In that vicinity. All righty. So. Bringing us now to the initiative order.
Taliesin: Oh, boy.
Matt: 25 to 20?
Liam: Shit.
Matt: All righty.
Laura: Oh, no.
Sam: Yikes.
Liam: (knocks on table)
Matt: 20 to 15?
Taliesin: 15.
Laura: 18.
Liam: 18.
Matt: All right.
Laura: Eee.
Liam: Yeah.
Marisha: Twins.
Liam: Wapetopetok!
Laura: (explosion sounds)
Liam: (explosion sounds)
Travis: You both had 18?
Laura: Yeah!
Travis: Nice.
Matt: 15 to ten?
Travis: 14.
Matt: Grog. All right.
Marisha: Oh. 11. Sorry.
Matt: That's all right. Keyleth. And then?
Sam: Eight.
Matt: Tary.
Laura: Hey, look, some things don't change. (all laugh)
Matt: Nice!
Taliesin: Burn!
Sam: Stings.
Matt: All righty. So. You watch as these figures just jump across from the chains that are lashed onto the boat, and as two of them make it across, suddenly, up the side of the ship, you watch as if a singular wave seems to (water rushing) and splash onto the edge of the ship. However, as the water crests and splashes into the ground, it forms up into its own physical entity.
Sam: Ooh.
Travis: What?
Marisha: Oh shit. Water elementals.
Matt: You've seen this form once before, that Keyleth has taken--
Laura: (gasps)
Matt: --this is a water elemental.
Laura: What if this is the Ashari?
Marisha: It probably is. Just haven't figured that out yet.
Matt: (laughs) Where did I last put it? All righty, so. That being the case, I'm gonna go ahead and pull these up there.
Laura: Did we say we did anything about the fog? The fog is still there.
Matt: The fog is still in this vicinity right now. So, you're under the effect of a Fog Cloud spell... for the area. So, basically, the area around is heavily obscured. So that will increase uh, AC to a number of individuals. Perfect. All right, so. So first off, this elemental rushes forward to Grog, splashes around in your direction. Grog, it's gonna go ahead and take a series of swings at you.
Travis: Sweet.
Matt: Yeah, it's gonna take two slam attacks. That is a 23 to hit?
Travis: Hits.
Matt: And an 18 to hit.
Travis: Hits also.
Matt: All righty. So you suffer 12 points of bludgeoning damage. That's full damage. You're not raging.
Travis: Nope.
Matt: And that is 15. 15 points of bludgeoning damage.
Travis: Total? Or 12 and 15 both?
Matt: 12 and 15.
Travis: Gotcha.
Matt: All right, that ends that guy's turn. Next up is Vax and Vex.
Laura: I was on my way over to the other--
Taliesin: Drop off.
Laura: -- towards the other ship.
Travis: Bludgeoning.
Taliesin: As long as you roll by, I'll just let go.
Laura: Okay.
Taliesin: You can drop me off.
Laura: Percy wants to be dropped off at the crow's nest, so I'll fly over that direction.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Keeping an eye out for anything visible that I can shoot at.
Taliesin: The minute I see a rope, I'll just let go and drop. So she can just keep moving.
Matt: Okay. So we'll say--
Laura: Flyby.
Matt: As you guys make it onto the other side of the ship--
Taliesin: You know, you could've spent your time making two very complex Lego pirate ships. All week.
Matt: You're right.
Taliesin: I'm just saying.
Matt: But I don't have that time, unfortunately. (all laugh)
Matt: Right, so you guys, right over to this ship here?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: You drop him in the crow's nest.
Laura: Uh-huh.
Matt: All right. And you are currently on your bow? Is that all you're gonna do?
Laura: I'm on-- yeah, I'm on my broom. I'm just riding my bow around.
Matt: Fair enough.
Laura: Can I drift down to where I can see anything and I say to Keyleth, Uh, fog? Can you do anything about the fog?
Matt: On their ship?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Okay. So as you coast down a little lower, I want you to make a perception check.
Laura: I like that one. 31.
Travis: Jesus.
Matt: 31. You glance down, and as the fog parts, you see on this ship, there are three other similarly dressed, dark green and black leather humanoids that are now beginning to rush over the chain, and standing back, on the back of the ship, arms crossed, you see a large humanoid with a fish-like head. It has no nose, a big fish-like mouth, big bulbous throat, kind of a greenish-blue skin color, very turquoise, with big fin gills at the side and a large crest that goes down the head. But it's wearing fine billowing silks, and a large vest, and its lower torso, from this giant oversized kind of plump belly, the lower torso is just this swirl of water that sits there, and it looks like it's currently concentrating through the fog on the opposite side.
Laura: Oh, jebus.
Matt: It does not seem to notice you at the moment.
Laura: Then, I'm gonna try to Bramble Shot that motherfucker.
Matt: It is right there.
Marisha: Well, that's pretty cool.
Laura: I'm gonna try to shoot a Bramble Shot at him.
Matt: Go for it.
Laura: Okay. 20?
Matt: 20? Hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
Laura: Yes. Okay. Oh, Hunter's Mark. Motherfuck! That's okay, sneak attack.
Travis: It's all right, you've never played this game before.
Laura: Why? I can't help it, I get so happy. Okay.
Matt: Let's see. Actually, roll again. Because in the fog cloud you do have disadvantage on strikes.
Travis: Oh, that's cruel, man.
Laura: That's cruel.
Travis: (laughs painfully) Don't do it.
Matt: One?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: Oh. That sucks.
Laura: That's okay. That's okay, I'm gonna try to do another shot. And in that downtime, I'm gonna fucking Hunter's Mark.
Sam: Yeah!
Matt: There you go.
Sam: Turn them lemons--
Travis: Into orange juice. (all laugh)
Matt: So this entity is currently Hunter's Marked, and you can take your second attack, if you like.
Laura: Okay. I can't do a Bramble Shot again 'cause that was wasted? Or does that mean-- Does a Bramble Shot only work if it connects?
Matt: I'm gonna say for the purpose of this Bramble Shot, 'cause it's only fair and it's a powerful vestige, it only works if it connects. That should change the wording on that.
Laura: Okay. Okay, I'm gonna try.
Matt: Go for it.
Laura: 19?
Matt: 19 does hit.
Laura: Yes! Okay. 15 plus four lightning damage.
Matt: Slick.
Laura: Plus Sneak Attack. Woo, an 11 for the Sneak Attack and Hunter's Mark. And then the DC of 17 or be restrained. That's strength save.
Matt: Gotcha.
Laura: And I'm gonna do the Bramble Shot damage now.
Matt: That is a 13.
Laura: Hoo, yes! He's restrained.
Matt: Go for it, roll the damage. For Bramble Shot.
Laura: Ooh. Is that a sev-- that's a one. 16.
Matt: 16. Okay. I'm gonna go ahead and make a concentration check on him. He succeeds. With a 26. All right, so, the first shot whips past and just slams into the ship. You watch as this giant fish entity kinda glances off to the side, looks down and starts looking up into the fog cloud, but you're right above it at this point, or just off to the side, and you fire your second arrow, it turns just in time to see it hit it in the shoulder, as it glances up, tries to snap it free. The wooden shaft of the arrow suddenly sprouts all these vines and thorns that begin to wrap around it and it tears in its body, and it's currently stuck in place. It cannot move.
Laura: Awesome. And I say, Percy, spellcaster, right below you. Fish guy.
Taliesin: (exhales) Got it. Not sure what to do.
Sam: Noted.
Matt: All right. So, ending that, we come to Vax's turn.
Liam: One of the assailants is directly across from me, on the other side of our boat, right?
Matt: There is one crossing right now.
Liam: But there is one guy who made it onto the boat?
Matt: There's two of them who made onto the boat, right there.
Liam: Right there? I'm gonna attempt to Assassinate that motherfucker.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Oh, god!
Matt: So you're-- we'll say you're up over, you kind of shimmy your way along the edge of the sail, and you're looking right down below him.
Liam: Okay.
Matt: This guy right there.
Liam: So, advantage on this.
Matt: The guy closest to Grog, or the guy who's alone right there?
Liam: The one that you are touching right now.
Matt: Okay, gotcha.
Liam: Yeah. So that is a 32 to hit.
Matt: That will hit.
Liam: So this is Assassinate, it's an auto-crit--
Matt: Did you roll at disadvantage because of the fog cloud?
Liam: Well, no, but I'm at advantage because of Assassinate, so the first roll was a 19.
Matt: Yeah, so you're fine.
Liam: Which is still a 32. Here we go.
Laura: I get 2d6 now for Sneak Attack.
Matt: You do. So roll another d6.
Laura: Another six!
Matt: Nice!
Taliesin: Hey, that die!
Matt: That's 48 points of damage in one hit.
Laura: Bramble Shot, motherfucker!
Liam: Doing my maths over here. 32, 36, 72. That's 80 points of damage.
Matt: 80 points of damage.
Travis: What the fuck? No wonder Tary almost died.
Liam: Is he still standing?
Matt: No. (all laugh)
Travis: Assassinate!
Matt: Just leaps off the chain and pulls out what looks like-- for this, it would be a dagger and a rapier. Glances around and goes lunging in for the captain of the ship. Gets maybe two steps, before your blade sinks into the back of the neck. And he just hits the side, and collapses, right at the edge of the ship right there. Done.
Liam: Okay, just for funsies I will throw my second dagger at the one right in front of Trink.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: So, that is not that good.
Laura: Ooh.
Liam: That's a 13.
Matt: Okay, yeah. Even with disadvantage. Okay. So this one you fire, and just disappears off to the side of the ship, but returns to your belt. Are you gonna stay where you are?
Liam: No, I'm gonna drop down.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: And circle around Trinket's tush.
Matt: All right. Make an acrobatics check.
Liam: Sure.
Matt: Just to land from the top there.
Liam: Yeah, 25.
Matt: Yeah, you're fine. So you move around behind Trinket. All righty.  That ends your turn, Vax. Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: Okay, I'm gonna take a quick look around to see if I can figure out what's causing this fog because it's annoying me.
Matt: Perception check.
Taliesin: That's a 19.
Matt: Glancing about in the area, it's hard to see, especially from this vantage point. The area is so heavily obscured with fog. You do glance and see what looks to be a very, very faint general glow in a lower area towards the edge of the ship. But that's all you can make out.
Taliesin: Starboard? Port?
Matt: It'd be on this side.
Taliesin: All right. Somebody take a look at anything. There's a glow coming from the starboard side of the enemy ship. It's the one closest to our ship. We need to find out what's causing this fog. In the meantime, I'm gonna slowly make my way down a couple of the ropes. Is that an enemy right there? That guy?
Matt: You're up here.
Taliesin: Yeah, I know. I'm asking if that's an enemy on our ship, right there.
Matt: This is an enemy right there.
Marisha: The water elemental.
Matt: These are enemies. These are your guys, the guys with the red cloaks; the red color signifies your own crewmates.
Taliesin: Okay, so we have two enemies that are currently on their ship.
Matt: Two enemies in their ship, one that's currently crossing, and one that is on the other side.
Taliesin: Okay, I'm gonna slowly start making my way, just maybe a few feet down, and I'm going to shoot those two people who are on the very edge. Both of them in the back.
Sam: There's no honor in that.
Taliesin: No. There is, on the other hand, fine comedy about to happen.
Sam: True, true.
Taliesin: I'm gonna very, very carefully. And I'm at disadvantage with this?
Matt: Disadvantage with each strike, yes.
Taliesin: Oh, that's annoying. Okay, I'm gonna use the pepperbox, the Animus, and I'm also going to burn a Grit for a push.
Matt: For which one of these guys?
Taliesin: What about one on each?
Matt: One of these two?
Taliesin: Both of them. I'll start with the first one, and work my way down.
Matt: Okay. First one there.
Taliesin: All right, so, let's see what happens.
Marisha: Big money, no whammies!
Taliesin: That will do. That's a 28?
Matt: 28 will hit.
Taliesin: And that's-- I'm sorry, you know why I'm a little confused, I just had to switch, again. That's, wow--
Marisha: That's good.
Taliesin: -- that's good. That's 17 points of damage and five points of psychic damage.
Matt: Nice!
Taliesin: And he goes ten feet away from me.
Travis: Ah.
Laura: Oh!
Marisha: (yelps)
Taliesin: (laughs)
Matt: As he's trying to step across the chain--
Liam: Wilhelm scream.
Matt: (gunshot)
Marisha: (Wilhelm screams)
Matt: He gets blasted. And (Wilhelm scream) just plunges off the side of the chain, loses his footing, tumbles over, and vanishes into the fog. And you hear this splash, a moment later.
Taliesin: Next! I love boats.
Matt: So this guy? Disadvantage on this shot.
Taliesin: Yep. Here we go. That's, oh that's good, 29. I'm rolling really well.
Matt: Yeah, that will hit.
Taliesin: Not as well as yesterday, but really well.
Marisha: (singing) I got a nautical themed, pashmina Afghan.
Taliesin: And that's five, six  that's 11 points of damage and five points of psychic damage, and a ten-foot push.
Matt: All righty. Okay. He also (snapping sound) falls off, grabs the chain, catches it with his finger, but because of the sea spray and the fog, it's too slick and (slipping sound, Wilhelm scream) just falls.
Taliesin: I was just gonna say, he's happy to grab, and I'll deal with that too.
Matt: Yeah. But they both have fallen off the ship.
Marisha: That's what she said? No.
Taliesin: I can make him drop things. I have that power.
Marisha: Oh. My god. Drop the chain they're holding on to?
Taliesin: I've been wanting to watch somebody holding on and make them drop it. I've been wanting to do that for like, probably a year and a half now. God, is there anybody fun on our side?
Laura: The fish guy.
Taliesin: You've got him grappled.
Matt: You've one guy walking across, right now, on the chain, and the guy below you who is grappled, and the water elemental that's also attacking you.
Travis: Yeah, don't you get advantage on grappled guy?
Taliesin: Technically I would. That would cancel out, wouldn't it?
Matt: He is restrained, which means attacks on him are with advantage, so it would cancel it out.
Taliesin: It would cancel it out automatically. Oh. In that case, I'm gonna take a shot on him.
Laura: And it'll probably get a chance to be unrestrained as soon as it's his turn.
Taliesin: Okay, good point. So, I'm gonna take a Sharpshooter shot. I'm also going to-- is he holding anything?
Matt: Not that you can see.
Taliesin: That's good. And he's a magic? Yeah, that will do. I'll just take a good old-fashioned Sharpshooter shot. So that's-- that's not as good. That's 18 to hit?
Matt: 18 to hit? Just barely hits.
Taliesin: Oh, thank god. Okay.
Liam: I hope these aren't your cousins.
Marisha: They might be.
Taliesin: Well. They were a little--
Travis: Nobody's tried talking yet?
Marisha: We'll figure that out.
Laura: We're kind of being ambushed. So...
Taliesin: That's kind of heavy. That's gonna be 24 points of damage, and three points of psychic damage.
Laura: I don't think your cousins are fish people.
Marisha: My cousins might be fish men.
Liam: They could be werefish or...
Marisha: They could be anybody. They could be werefish.
Matt: Gotcha. Okay, so you managed to fire (gunshot) the third shot out from Animus. You see it blasts into the upper shoulder and back portion of this fish-like creature. (growls) It does not look terribly happy. But it is currently still bound by the various thorny vines that have wrapped around it. End your turn?
Taliesin: Yeah, and I'm just gonna crawl a couple feet into the ropes in that direction.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: I'm just gonna keep rope-swinging. There we are.
Matt: There you go. All righty, that brings us to Grog.
Travis: After getting hit by the water elemental, can I go, Hey! What do you want?
Matt: The water elemental just (gurgling growls).
Travis: Fuck it. You got saltwater in my eyes; I would like to rage!
Matt: Okay.
Travis: I go into a rage.
Marisha: It's not me, Grog. It's not me.
Travis: Oh, I hadn't thought about that. (all laugh)
Travis: And I beat the shit out of it with the dwarven hammer. Two hits.
Matt: Go for it. Two strikes.
Travis: Are these at disadvantage? Or I'm right up there?
Matt: No, you're melee, you're fine.
Travis: Hey! Reckless attack.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Oh, my.
Liam: Hells yeah.
Travis: 23.
Matt: That hits.
Travis: Nice. 17.
Matt: 17 damage. Okay. Now your last strike?
Travis: God, those are balls! They're not literal balls. 22.
Matt: That hits.
Laura: Nice!
Travis: 24. 24 points of damage.
Matt: 24 points of damage? Okay, nice. So you start bludgeoning its watery form. Even though you see the water splashing around, and it's soaking everything in the vicinity, you are still watching as each blow forces the creature to kinda shift and move, and you hear this (gurgling sound) kind of dull thud sound, and a pained noise seems to emit from this elemental creature with each impact.
Travis: You can do better than that.
Matt: Does that end your turn?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: All righty. That brings us to the rest of the crew. So these guys-- the water has now pushed them past a bit. They are moved and they're starting to try and swim their way to the edge of the ship, and they're starting to actually-- Let's see what their rolls are for their athletics. Natural 20, nice. Okay, so they both make their way up to the side of this side of the ship and latch onto the edge, right beside Keyleth and Taryon.
Sam: Oh, great.
Marisha: Can I say something to him?
Matt: Yeah, as both (grunts) get out of the water, they're pulling up right alongside you, pulling blades out.
Marisha: Hi! Kaitiyaki. Water Ashari?
Matt: You hear them just growl as they pull their blades out, and continue.
Marisha: Hm. Hm.
Liam: Kick his ass.
Travis: Yeah, we tried to talk.
Matt: So for this one, each of them are gonna make two strikes against each of you with their rapiers.
Sam: Oh, great.
Matt: Taryon, that is a 21?
Sam: Yeah.
Matt: And a 21.
Sam: Yeah.
Matt: I rolled the same number twice in a row. So you take--
Travis: What's your AC there, big guy?
Sam: 15.
Matt: Nine points of piercing damage and five points of piercing damage.
Sam: Sure.
Matt: As it just thrust--
Sam: Ow!
Matt: -- holding onto the side of the ship's armor, thrusting the rapier into you, scraping past your armor. One catches you in the hip.
Sam: Ugh.
Travis: Ooh.
Matt: Keyleth, the other one's gonna make two strikes against you. That's gonna be--
Marisha: Cousins?
Matt: An eight?
Marisha: No? Oh. Nope, that misses.
Matt: And a 27.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: And that's gonna hit you for ten points of piercing damage.
Marisha: Okay. That's-- yeah.
Matt: And it looks like their ascent has stopped and they're just right now happy to just continue to pierce these two stowaways that are gripping onto the side of the ship. This one stumbles across the rest of the chain. And turning and seeing you guys there on the edge, Vax as you dart around the side of Trinket, it's gonna move, avoid the bear, step across, and attempt to attack you twice with the rapier, once with the dagger.
Liam: Sure.
Marisha: Jeez Louise.
Matt: So the dagger's gonna be 11?
Liam: No.
Matt: Not very good.
Liam: That's a no.
Matt: However, that is a 26.
Liam: That hits. Uncanny Dodge.
Matt: And a 19.
Liam: No.
Matt: No. All right, so, they get one rapier strike towards you. That is going to be nine points of piercing damage.
Liam: Halved.
Matt: As it just cuts across the center of your armor in the midsection. It doesn't actually get the skin, but it's enough of an impact where you can feel a bruise coming.
Liam: Tight.
Matt: All righty. Ending their turn, that brings us to Keyleth.
Marisha: Okay. Am I still on the side of the boat?
Matt: You are, yes.
Marisha: I'm gonna climb up that boat.
Matt: Okay, make an athletics check.
Marisha: Ooh, that's good, 17 plus my athletics, which is good, which is seven, so 24.
Matt: Okay, so you get up on the edge of the ship, it does get one attack of opportunity against you as you move up. It's gonna slice at you with a rapier. That is gonna be an 18.
Marisha: Miss.
Sam: Whoa.
Matt: Nice.
Marisha: No. Hit. Sorry.
Matt: Okay, there you go, that's all good. That is ten points piercing damage.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: As the rapier just catches you in the back, and you're like (groans), and you climb up and get back onto the edge of the ship. As you glance around, you can see that there is the weird fish-looking guy in the center of the ship right now. It's currently bound by the vines around him.
Marisha: Any sign that these could still be my people? Pretty certain they're not.
Travis: I think you can let that go now.
Matt: You're pretty sure there's not much of a tribal sign--
Marisha: Nothing?
Matt: -- that resembles anything Ashari-related universally.
Marisha: Guys, real pirates! And then I'm going to do Control Water. And I'm going to raise water 20 feet around me, and start sinking this bitch. I want to sink this ship. 20 feet, just tidal waves coming over the boat, and I'm sinking it.
Travis: Oh, shit.
Matt: Control Water, what level is this?
Marisha: Fourth level.
Laura: We could steal this ship. Okay.
Taliesin: It might have stuff.
Marisha: Nope. I'm sinking it.
Matt: Okay, as you get on the edge you begin to pull your arms up, and as you do, you hands begin to glow with a dull blue-turquoise color, similar to the skin of this fish-like creature, and it glances over at you, and its jaw opens. You can see this burbling sound as the edges of the water begin to rise up and splash and pour into the ship, perpetually filling the lower, usually air-filled section of this ship. And it begins to immediately (thud) list a little bit to one side.
Marisha: Do I have any movement, or is that it? Probably getting up is my movement.
Matt: That's gonna be your action, and climbing up is gonna be your movement. So that's kinda where you are.
Marisha: Okay. Cool.
Matt: You can maintain concentration on it.
Taliesin: We're gonna want to break the chains.
Marisha: I maintain concentration.
Matt: You get the sense, it's gonna take a few rounds, but if you keep at this, you'll probably have a  good chance of achieving your goal.
Marisha: Cool. It's what I like to hear in life, in general.
Laura: You might bring our ship down with it, Keyleth.
Travis: If you keep at it, you might be able to achieve your goal.
Marisha: No, it's localized.
Laura: No, but, the chains attaching two ships.
Marisha: Eh. We've got time.
Taliesin: That's the correct response.
Liam: She says as she destroys everything.
Travis: Yep, yeah, yep.
Marisha: Destroy reality?
Matt: Ending Keyleth's turn, it is now the crew's go. So the crew here is gonna turn the ballistas around, as the captain leaps off down and goes behind the guy who attacked you, Vax. She pulls out a scimitar, rushes forward screaming, "Yah!" and just does a full downward arc into the back.
Laura: Oh, shit.
Liam: Adele Dazeem, ladies and gentlemen.
Laura: Like Xena. (war cry)
Marisha: Adele Dazeem.
Laura: What does Xena do? (Xena fighting call)
Matt: That is 18. That hits.
Travis: That's it.
Liam: Yeah, that's it.
Matt: Second strike is a 23. Both hit.
Liam: She also breaks hearts.
Laura: Left and right.
Liam: Left and right.
Taliesin: Oh, man.
Liam: You can relate.
Travis: Disappointed!
Matt: That's better. 24 points of slashing damage. That ends her turn. These two guys are gonna fire ballistas at the ship. (firing sound, splash)
Travis: Yes! Yes!
Matt: One of them unfortunately just coasts off to the edge and misses the ship.
Travis: Damn it! He's fired.
Matt: The other one is a natural 20.
Travis: Boom!
Laura: Damn!
Matt: Oof, that's gonna be nasty. That, yeah, okay.
Travis: Wow.
Matt: That is 42 points of damage--
Travis: Damn. From one of the ballistas?
Matt: -- to the side of the ship. You watch as one of these ballistas has a similar-looking, like, giant iron arrow, but it's designed to just split and destroy wood on impact. It's pierced, but it seems to splinter out, so it hits, and then breaks as it goes.
Travis: Oh, shit.
Matt: And as it slams into the side of this ship, just above where Taryon and the other guy are. You watch as it (crashing sound) slams and wood splinters and breaks. The impact shakes the side. I'm actually gonna ask both you and that guy to make a strength saving throw.
Travis: Come on, buddy.
Sam: That's sorta cocked, but that's okay, I'll take it. That's a five.
Matt: Okay, both of you guys--
Sam: Maybe I'll use Luck, and go again.
Matt: Okay, go for it.
Sam: Ooh, yeah. Yeah, that's ten.
Matt: Okay, that's two. That's enough to hold on. The other guy did not make it. So you just hold on from the impact, the other guy (screams) falls back and splashes into--
Sam: You should've worn boat shoes! (all laugh)
Matt: Perfect.
Laura: I like to picture you in full armor with boat shoes on.
Marisha: Boat shoes on!
Matt: As you hold on, you watch as the ballista, which has a chain attached to the back of it as well, is now being ratcheted back. And as it slams through and is pulled back, it's tearing sections of the ship apart. And you can watch now, as it's pulling down and breaking a whole section.
Sam: Jesus.
Matt: That's gonna go ahead and end this crewman's turn. This guy is gonna go ahead-- crossbow and try to line it up, towards-- I can only see the guy below, with disadvantage. Oh, it's a shame, it's a natural 20. And a 19, actually. Still manages to hit, even with the disadvantage from the fog cloud. Okay, that's eight damage to that guy. All righty. And then this guy over here is gonna move to the water elemental and take a strike on it and misses. (whoosh) It goes and strikes, but the water elemental shifts out of the way, the blade moves past, without an impact. End of the round, we have Taryon.
Sam: Yeah!
Marisha: Taryon!
Sam: Yeah! So, the guy right next to me is gone, right?
Matt: Yeah, he's splashed back. Both of these guys are in the water, back ten feet.
Sam: Oh, they're gone. Okay.
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: Okay, Can I see? No. I'm gonna climb up.
Matt: Okay, athletics check.
Sam: Okay.
Travis: Watch this go bad.
Sam: No, no. It's okay. 16?
Matt: Yeah, that could climb up and get onto the edge of the ship, right next to Keyleth, who's currently concentrating. You see her eyes kinda glowing, and her hands glowing with this faint aqua-look as the water is now, immediately to the right of her, curling up and splashing over the bow of the ship, and just pouring into the ship below.
Sam: So cool. So cool. Okay, I just yell back to Doty, Get rid of the grappling hooks! I don't know, I have no idea what I'm doing.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: And then I see that the giant thing in front of me, right? Do I see the thing?
Matt: You do see it, yeah. It's currently bound by the series of thorny vines.
Sam: Great. I'll reach into my magic bag, and pull out a vial of acid and just throw it at the thing.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and roll an attack. It is restrained, so you have advantage on the ranged attack roll.
Travis: Yeah!
Sam: What do I add?
Matt: Add your-- it should say under the class.
Sam: My spell attack bonus?
Matt: It should say under the class's ability.
Sam: It says--
Matt: What's your bonus next to it on your sheet? Under your attacks.
Sam: Oh! Oh, it says--
Matt: It should be there.
Sam: No, it doesn't.
Matt: Doesn't? Ah, damn it.
Sam: Oh, wait, no, it says it. But it's cut off. It says, "DC one". I'm sure there's something after that, but are you talking about just to hit it?
Matt: Right. It's their saving throw. It's your spell DC to get past it; I think is what it is. It's not an actual ranged--
Sam: Okay, so then it's 17.
Matt: 17? Okay, good to know. Which, he has disadvantage on it, which he rolled a one in the first one, so no.
Travis: Yeah!
Matt: So go ahead and roll full damage.
Sam: Great, so that's 7d6.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Okay.
Marisha: LED six!
Laura: They're really pretty.
Taliesin: They're really fun. Yeah, I like it. I know.
Marisha: LED. Six.
Sam: 26.
Matt: 26 points of acid damage.
Travis: Wow.
Laura: Nice.
Taliesin: That's good.
Matt: All righty.
Travis: Does he let out a fishy scream?
Matt: You watch as you lob your vial, it (shattering sound) burst across the creature's chest--
Taliesin: (gurgling)
Matt: --and the acid (burning sound) begins to burn, burning part of the vines that currently keep it restrained, but--
Sam: Oh, shit! Sorry, sorry! I don't know how this stuff works!
Matt: But it does burn. You see it (gurgling grunts) trying desperately to break free, as you see the smoke of its burning flesh rise up off its body (sizzling sound).
Sam: Okay.
Matt: End your turn, Taryon?
Sam: I have a bonus action. I'll use Sanctuary. On myself.
Matt: Okay. There you go. And with that, Doty's gonna go ahead and reach down and try and grab-- nope. Not with a four. As you see, (creaking noise) you hear the metal kind of creaking, but not getting any sort of actual--
Marisha: Aw.
Taliesin: Knees, not back.
Matt: I know.
Travis: Lift with your knees.
Taliesin: God, robot!
Matt: All right, ending that round, that brings us to the top. The rushing waters: the ships continue to move forward; both of these guys shift backward.
Liam: Bye!
Matt: They're being left behind by the boats.
Taliesin: Good!
Matt: They're trying to swim forward. That brings us to Marid. Okay.
Taliesin: I've been waiting for this so for pretty much a few months.
Matt: So this guy is currently up in the side. And he's looking around, he's gonna make a quick perception check, just to look around. He got shot by you. He got shot by you. He's gonna go ahead and glance up in your direction. He's gonna go ahead and use a Water Jet ability against you.
Taliesin: All right.
Matt: Actually, let's see here--
Travis: Water Jet.
Laura: (explosion sound)
Matt: You know what, now? No, he's not.
Travis: He's not?
Matt: He is, but he's gonna use a Water Jet--
Laura: Is he not grappled anymore?
Matt: He's still grappled. He's restrained, but he can still do abilities.
Laura: Oh, shit.
Taliesin: We're fine.
Matt: 60, fine. Yeah, you're up there, but it sees the cluster in that direction. That's his own guy. He won't do that.
Travis: He wouldn't?
Laura: Ooh, honorable.
Matt: Hold on, I'm trying to see what's the most useful--
Sam: Maybe they're family.
Laura: Maybe they are.
Matt: He can't move. He can't angle it. It's really frustrating for him.
Liam: For him, right? For him? It's frustrating for him.
Matt: Yeah, for him.
Travis: It really frustrates him.
Matt: And for that, he's gonna aim for Trinket and Vax.
Laura: What is he doing, what?
Matt: Aiming for Trinket and Vax.
Laura: (gasps)
Matt: So, all of a sudden, it turns its head this way, opens its mouth (hoarse gasp) and you watch as this small spiral of  greenish energy begins to swirl. And a singular burst of extremely accelerated water just (hard impact sound) fires through the fog out of sight. You hear this (whoosh) sound, and you turn just in time to watch as it blasts towards both you and Trinket. I need you to make a dexterity saving throw, and Trinket as well.
Liam: Vax or Vex?
Matt: Vax.
Liam: Vax. Yeah, you're fine.
Laura: Yeah, I'm fine.
Liam: Oh, you're doing Trinket, right.
Laura: Whoa! Trinket rolled so good!
Liam: 17.
Matt: 17?
Laura: Hold on, hold on, holda.
Sam: Hoda, hoda, hoda, hoda.
Laura: Hoda, hoda, hoda, hoda. 20!
Matt: All righty. So Trinket manages to (whoosh) duck down, taking half the damage.
Laura: He was very zen about that duck down.
Travis: (Trinket groans)
Laura: Matrix style, he's diving in. No.
Matt: So 15 points of bludgeoning damage to Trinket. 30 to you, Vax.
Liam: But halved, 'cause if I fail, it's halved. If I succeed, it's zero. It's a dexterity so it's Evasion.
Matt: Yeah. Evasion--
Liam: Evasion is for dex saves. If I fail, I take half damage, and if I succeed I take no damage.
Sam: Ooh! That's sexy.
Matt: Right.
Liam: It's how I survive dragon fights.
Matt: Yes, yes.
Travis: (singing) How I survive dragon fights.
Sam: Guys, we're having a water battle.
Laura: You guys!
Taliesin: I've been waiting for this for so long.
Laura: Well, we're having a pirate battle.
Travis: Super soaker!
Sam: Super soakers!
Taliesin: Super soakers!
Travis: Super soaker 250, super soaker 500, super soaker 1000. You remember those?
Taliesin: Oh yeah.
Sam: Yeah. I didn't know they had gauges.
Taliesin: Oh, yeah.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: So you take 15 points of bludgeoning damage. However, you are pushed 20 feet away and knocked prone.
Sam: Ooh. Ooh.
Laura: Oh, no.
Sam: Off the ship?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: (whoosh) Off the edge of the ship.
Sam: Oh! No!
Laura: (gasps) Bro!
Matt: He (splash) into the water below. (splash) It's with such force, that you aren't even given a chance to grab at the ship. You're thrust off at an arc.
Liam: Mm-hm.
Matt: And (splash) into the water. (splash) into the ocean--
Laura: Gosh, thank god Trinket ducked.
Matt: -- soaking you down into the wave. The elemental creature swirls up and occupies both the space of Grog and Trinket, and is going to go ahead and turn it into a whelm. So it's going to uh, attempt to whelm both of you, and I need you and Trinket to make strength saving throws.
Travis: Strength saving throws. I have advantage because I'm raging. 26.
Laura: 18.
Matt: All righty. You guys, both pushed out of its space. So it forces you out. However, you both manage to escape any sort of damage as its giant spiral, this whirlwind of water spins around and you both barely force your way out of it before it can do any serious damage to you.
Laura: Bearly.
Matt: All right, that leads us to Vax's turn.
Liam: Okay, so in the water, click the boots, and the wings shoot-out, and I explode up, out of the water into the air.
Sam: Wow, so cool.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: And I just start gunning it towards the guy who knocked me in, right?
Matt: Okay.
Liam: And when I'm about, I don't know, 30 feet away from him, I'm gonna-- because I'm hasted I get 120 feet of movement just for regular movement.
Matt: Yes.
Liam: And when I'm within 40 feet, I'm gonna throw Whisper at the guy.
Matt: Okay, that will put you about there.
Liam: Yep.
Travis: Hit him. Hit him!
Liam: That's 26?
Matt: 26? All righty, that hits.
Liam: And I'm gonna bamf right up to him as I hit.
Matt: (poof)
Liam: That is just a little ten, plus-- 15.
Matt: 15 points of damage with that strike. Okay.
Liam: And I should have one more. So I used bonus action for the wings, I did movement, I did action, so I've got one more action.
Matt: Your offhand attack, yeah.
Liam: Yeah. So I will shank him again.
Travis: Shank shank!
Laura: Shank shank!
Sam: Is that a new thing? Shank shank?
Matt: You have advantage on these strikes now. Because you're right up against him, and he is restrained.
Liam: 20.
Matt: 20 hits. And you do get your Sneak Attack, because of your advantage on him.
Travis: No more dagger dagger dagger.
Sam: Just shank shank?
Laura: It's just two. It's shank shank.
Sam: Okay.
Liam: That is just a nine! And I'll unload some poison into him as well. The DC is 15.
Marisha: I feel like 'shank shank' is less attractive on a t-shirt.
Matt: That is a nine. He does not succeed!
Liam: Okay, so he takes 2d10. Do I roll that, or do you, Matty?
Matt: You roll that.
Liam: All right.
Matt: So what's the damage initially?
Liam: It's nine. Plus 13 poison damage.
Matt: Okay, so 22. Are you gonna roll Sneak Attack damage?
Liam: Why would I get that here? Is he up against anybody?
Matt: No, you have advantage on him because he is restrained.
Liam: Oh, advantage, yay, I love you.
Matt: And he is not immune to poison.
Liam: 20 Sneak Attack damage. Thanks, Matt.
Matt: How much is that total?
Liam: 20 for the sneak attack.
Matt: 20 for the sneak attack. 20 plus 22.
Laura: You're attacking the guy?
Matt: We'll see if he maintains concentration.
Laura: How'd you get all the way over there?
Matt: He does not. So. Let me double-check one thing real fast, here, because this will be interesting.
Liam: Shank-shank-shank. Shank-shank-shank.
Liam: (singing) Shank your booty. Shank your booty.
Taliesin: (singing) Shank your booty. Shank your booty.
Laura: (singing) Shank your booty. Shank your booty.
Marisha: (singing) Shank your booty. Shank your booty.
Matt: Okay, got you. So he loses concentration. He is now poisoned and restrained. He has to make a saving throw, actually, to see-- which he did not. So yeah, still restrained.
Laura: Yes.
Matt: Whoof. That sucks. Okay, that ends Vax's turn. Vex, you're up.
Laura: Awesome.
Liam: Get him!
Laura: Cool, then since he's got my brother next to him, I'm gonna fly down so I can see him better, and shoot him two times with my blazing bowstring on the first one.
Liam: She shouts as she flies through the air.
Laura: Blazing bowstring! Activate!
Marisha: (electric guitar sounds)
Laura: Do I still get disadvantage?
Matt: You do, the fog is still present.
Laura: Okay. 28.
Matt: 28 hits. Second attack?
Laura: Second attack is just-- can I do regular?
Matt: Yes, that's fine.
Laura: 18.
Matt: Hits. Go ahead and roll damage for both.
Laura: 12 with three points of lightning damage.
Travis: Did you add your Hunter's Mark?
Laura: I'm about to. 13 additional. And then ten with the blazing bowstring-- nine more with the blazing bowstring.
Matt: Nice, all right.
Laura: And then my second attack--
Matt: Correct.
Laura: 11 plus three lightning.
Matt: All righty.
Laura: I don't get Sneak Attack again, but I do get Hunter's Mark.
Matt: You do get Hunter's Mark, yes.
Laura: And three more for Hunter's Mark.
Matt: Nice. So, after he's stabbed in the side, and the poison pulses through his system, turns around, and as the arrow slams into him, burst of flame and lightning arcs through his body.
Laura: And I'm gonna fly back a little so he can see me less. And then I'm going to have Trinket, for my bonus action--
Marisha: (gasps)
Laura: -- run forward and attack the guy on the edge of the ship.
Liam: Is it a leap year?
Marisha: This hasn't happened in like 20 games.
Laura: I know, I know.
Marisha: Oh my god.
Matt: Is Trinket doing just a regular attack?
Laura: Yeah, because it's my bonus, so he can just do one attack.
Matt: Because if you wanted to, instead of going for a damaging attack, you can go for a shove.
Laura: Oh, I could? I didn't think I was allowed to do that.
Matt: Yeah, you can do it, you can sacrifice an attack for a shove strike. It doesn't do damage.
Laura: I want him to do that. That's what I wanted him to do.
Matt: I was wondering if that's what you were going for. Okay, so go ahead and roll an athletics check for Trinket.
Laura: Athletics... is that strength? That's just five.
Matt: Five? Okay, yeah, so Trinket goes up and slams into the guy, and he gets pushed against the side of the ship, but not with enough force to shove him over the edge, and he (grunt) catches himself.
Laura: So Trinket just stands up, he's got his paws on his chest.
Matt: Just pressing (growls) on there, yeah.
Laura: Growls loudly into his face.
Liam: (growls)
Matt: All right, that ends your turn. Percy, you're up.
Laura: I mean, that's scary, a big bear. Especially if these guys are on the sea. They don't see bears very often.
Taliesin: All right. That guy's still in the vines, right?
Matt: Correct, yes.
Taliesin: He's becoming a problem, though. Okay, I'm going to, if I can pull this off, is it possible that I can break the rope that I'm currently holding onto and do a little Errol Flynn like fly down to the bottom of the boat?
Matt: You can do that, yeah.
Taliesin: Is it possible that the rope I have to shoot is in between me and him?
Matt: Uh... sure.
Marisha: You going to kill two birds with one stone?
Taliesin: I'm going to use a piercing shot, and I'm going to try to do both with one shot and Errol Flynn this shit.
Travis: Oh shit! Oh shit!
Matt: Okay. Make an acrobatics check as part of this.
Marisha: Errol Flynn this shit, is that what you said?
Matt: This is specifically the kind of shit acrobatics is for.
Travis: Totally. 100%. Swashbuckling.
Taliesin: Acrobatics... that's a 23.
Matt: Yeah, go ahead and take it-- still at disadvantage.
Taliesin: Still at disadvantage.
Matt: Because of the fog.
Marisha: Oh man, now you're in an Angelina Jolie movie.
Taliesin: Nope.
Matt: Nope?
Taliesin: So this is gonna be funny, because I was using the Animus.
Matt: Yes.
Taliesin: So depending on how mean you wanna be here, I'm gonna take my 2d6.
Matt: Oh, you misfire?
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: (laughs)
Taliesin: So this is gonna be funny. I'm gonna take my 2d6, and that's six points of psychic damage to me, that's cool, that's cool.
Marisha: What if one day you died because of that?
Matt: Okay, so you use your piercing shot to shoot both at him and to shoot the-- or to shoot the rope and then swing down?
Taliesin: Yes. So does the psychic damage mean I let go of the rope I'm holding on to? Or does it not? Also, my feet are sticky and my hand has--
Matt: Your feet are sticky, but your hands are not.
Taliesin: But my hands are not.
Matt: It's the blast of psychic energy. You know what? I'll say go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw.
Taliesin: Okay, I'm down for this.
Matt: Yes, make a wisdom saving throw to see if you can withstand the blast to your brain as your vision goes white.
Taliesin: So that's an eight.
Liam: Goes in the drink.
Matt: Nope.
Taliesin: Here's the next question  do I have any chance of grabbing anything with my hands and feet on the way down?
Matt: Unfortunately, no. What happens is, as you grab the rope and you fire-- as you slash the rope and go to swing down, you go to fire, and as you do, it backs up, and your vision just goes white and you feel your whole body go instantaneously numb. You're not sure if you're even holding the rope anymore. All of your--
Taliesin: So I'm just gonna wake up on the deck of the floor of the boat.
Matt: -- and the pain sears in your brain, you hear the (heartbeat) the pulse of pain through, and as your vision comes to, it clarifies, and color comes back just in time for you to see the surface of the ship rocketing towards your face. (impact sound) And you slam into the ground, straight across, landing prone at the base of the ground in front of the fish creature.
Laura: Oh, no!
Travis: It was so cool!
Laura: That one was seriously bad.
Sam: Can I yell out, No! New best friend!
Matt: You can. You take 12 points of bludgeoning damage from the fall.
Taliesin: 12 points of bludgeoning damage. And can I burn a bonus action, am I okay, or--
Matt: You could use-- I mean, that was your action, you land, yeah. You're still prone, but you can still use the rest of your attacks if you want.
Marisha: I'm sorry, your best friend?
Taliesin: I can use the rest of my actions?
Matt: I mean, that was an attack. The piercing shot. So you still have your two other attacks, if you wanted to use them.
Taliesin: Just because it hurts and I'm irritated, I'm just gonna pull out Retort and fire in the general direction.
Matt: Okay, so two more strikes, both at disadvantage.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Sam: (gunshot sounds)
Taliesin: Oh, that's not bad.
Marisha: What the fuck?
Taliesin: 28?
Matt: 28 hits.
Marisha: That's not as good.
Taliesin: 16.
Matt: 16 does not hit.
Taliesin: Okay, so the 28 one does, though. That's seven points of damage.
Matt: Seven points of damage. Got it. Okay. So as you roll over on your back and pull out Retort and just fire two shots, one just goes off into the fog. You see it tear through the ship mast for a second, some wood splinters, the other one, you hear the creature take the impact from the blow. You're not even really paying attention where it's going, you're just hearing the sound and shooting in that direction. All right, that'll end your turn, Percy?
Taliesin: Oh yeah.
Matt: (laughs)
Taliesin: What a turn. What a terrible way to go.
Matt: Grog, you're up.
Travis: I wanna keep hitting the water elemental.
Matt: All right. So, you turn towards it over there. Go for it.
Travis: Reckless attacks, please.
Matt: Yes.
Travis: First one's a 30.
Matt: That'll hit.
Travis: 21 points of damage.
Matt: All righty.
Travis: Second attack. It's very methodical. 26.
Matt: All righty.
Travis: Does that hit?
Matt: Yes.
Travis: And 17 points of damage.
Matt: 17 points of damage, all right. So you rush in and slam twice in this elemental again. You see its form with each hit is just splattering water against the ground, and where once it came up as this solid force of water, it's starting to have difficulty keeping its form together. Where once it was focused genuinely on you and Trinket, it seems to be lashing out now in a frenzied state, it's just punching all around. Does that finish your turn?
Travis: Am I not good enough to hold your attention? Yeah, that finishes my turn.
Matt: Okay. Got you. All right. This guy here's gonna squeeze past the side.
Laura: Trinket attacks him on the way over.
Matt: He hasn't moved away from Trinket yet.
Laura: Damn it.
Matt: Actually, no, he's gonna squeeze this way instead because Grog's on that side. He's gonna go ahead and move past the bear and let Trinket push his weight into the side of the ship, and is going to go ahead and take three strikes at you, Grog.
Travis: Yay!
Matt: With advantage.
Travis: Another play-friend.
Matt: That's gonna be two strikes against you and one against Trinket. First one with advantage is gonna be a 24.
Travis: Hits!
Matt: Dagger is gonna be a 15.
Travis: Misses. With advantage too?
Matt: Yeah, his first attack roll was a one. All right, so you take ten points of piercing damage, reduced to five.
Travis: Okay.
Matt: And then the other rapier attack's gonna go against Trinket. Which is a natural one. Jesus.
Travis: Wow.
Matt: So he just swings and Trinket catches the blade in his teeth, and he draws the rapier back, which is now covered in bear slobber.
Travis: This is not the time to choke, buddy.
Matt: That ends his turn. This guy here is gonna go ahead and turn to face off with Captain Adella. He's gonna make three strikes against her.
Marisha: C'mon, Adele Dazeem.
Matt: That's gonna hit. First rapier strike, second rapier strike, and the dagger, all three hit, unfortunately.
Laura: We're all such dicks.
Travis: You guys are awful.
Marisha: We've got these shitty nicknames for everyone.
Matt: 14, and, okay. Total of 21 points of damage on her.
Travis: 21 points.
Matt: So as she tries to parry to the side, the pirate just catches her off-guard and gets three good hits in, but Adella parries off to the side, gets pushed back a bit, and then forces her way forward, preparing her counter-attack.
Travis: Come on!
Matt: That brings us to--
Travis: We should probably protect the captain.
Matt: -- Keyleth.
Sam: Okay.
Marisha: Oh, shit. We're still attached to this boat, right?
Sam: Multiple times.
Matt: Currently, yes. If you're still concentrating on this, the water's still pouring into it.
Marisha: I am. How much slack do we have before I start pulling our boat underwater, because I don't want to be that-- kinda thought someone would start--
Matt: It depends, right now it'll be probably two rounds before it begins to genuinely start sinking heavily. Depending on if the ballista get another shot at the side or not.
Marisha: I wanna keep doing this. Can I concentrate my flooding of water so-- there's now a hole in the side of the ship, under where Tary was, right? I had to think not to say Scanlan.
Matt: Correct.
Marisha: I wanna flood in more water. Can I flood it more on this side, to where I try and-- or can I do something fancy, like a giant hand of the gods from the wave come up and--
Taliesin: Kind of like Fantasia?
Marisha: -- take the fish-head guy?
Travis: What the shit?
Marisha: Or can I at least try and flood that side to where I can try and toss him over?
Matt: You can either choose to continue to flood the ship, or use Control Water to attack the fish character. One or the other.
Travis: Don't look at us, man.
Marisha: Let me see if I can Control Water and take a wave to toss him overboard.
Matt: Toss him overboard?
Laura: He's a fish! That'll help him.
Marisha: He is a fish.
Matt: He is very plainly a fish-based creature.
Marisha: He is very definitely a fish.
Matt: The lower half of his body is a swirl of water.
Marisha: Oh, right.
Travis: So put him in the water.
Laura: I don't think putting him in the water's gonna help us very much.
Travis: Water and water makes--
Marisha: You know, I'll just keep sinking this ship.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: I'm gonna keep concentrating.
Laura: You could get rid of the fog.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: I can't do that right now.
Matt: The torrent of water continues to shove down into the ship. You've redirected it. As it's pouring into the side, you use your other hand to pick up another portion of water and start spraying it into the wound that was left right above, Taryon, you're getting sprayed by water overhead as it's just traveling over you like an Epcot Center water fountain.
Marisha: You're good, right, Tary?
Sam: Yes?
Marisha: All right.
Sam: This is so weird!
Marisha: Good! This is like a Tuesday for us.
Matt: All right, so the crew on this side, this guy's gonna go ahead and move up higher up there and take a swing. Misses, unfortunately. This guy's gonna take another crossbow shot down at the one that's attacking the captain. That will hit, actually.
Travis: Yes! Get him!
Laura: Get him!
Matt: All righty. And then these two guys are gonna take two more ballista shots as they load up, pull it back. This guy continues-- actually, this guy doesn't get a shot, because he spent the last round winching and pulling it back, so he gets one shot retracting. This guy managed to pull it back and take a secondary shot at the ship. That hits. It's not a critical, but it's still pretty decent. That is 14 points of damage on the side of the ship. This one slams into it maybe about five feet to the left. Keyleth, actually all of you who are on the ship, you feel the impact as the second blow hits, and it pulls out the side, this time much lower, and water is now really pushing, the ship is slowly starting to capsize to one side. That ends that group's turn.
Sam: I've read about this. Many of us will die. (all laugh)
Matt: Tary, it's your turn.
Sam: My turn?
Matt: Yes.
Sam: Okay. Is there water all over the deck, is it hard to move, is it okay?
Matt: I mean, it's wet, and the deck is currently listing to one side.
Sam: Okay.
Laura: Is it listing towards Keyleth and--
Matt: It's listing this way.
Travis: Boat shoes!
Sam: Yeah, those are like impervious to water. (all laugh)
Sam: Okay. Once again, I'll yell back at Doty and just say, Ahh! The thing with the grappling hooks again!
Matt: Doty actually does succeed this turn. (all cheer)
Matt: Doty lifts it out, and now that it's starting to pull, the chains are very taut, as this ship lists, the ship's being pulled a little ways towards it, the chains are strained, so as soon as Doty pulls it up, it just goes firing off the side and plunges off the water to the other side. The ship's now beginning to slowly turn this way as the other chain is now tugging it from that direction, and this is now listing to that side. So, what are you doing, Tary?
Sam: Yeah, I'm going to cast Haste as my action. And I get a second action, now, because I'm hasted, right?
Matt: You get to use a second action that's a melee attack.
Sam: It has to be a melee attack?
Matt: Melee attack, disengage, hide...
Sam: Can I use-- it said I could use a magic item.
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: Or use an item, use an item.
Matt: Yeah, use an object.
Sam: Oh, use an object, not an item. I can't use my ring or anything, right?
Matt: I'll say, for the purposes of this? Sure. Why not?
Sam: Okay, so I'm hasted, I will use, I pick up the Ring of the Ram, and I'll ram the fish-man.
Travis: Oh, yes!
Laura: Oh, nice!
Matt: Okay. How many charges does it have?
Travis: Ring of the Ram, that's been a while.
Sam: Three charges, right? So I can use two?
Matt: You can use as many charges as you want that the ring holds. It should tell you up to a certain amount--
Sam: It has three charges.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Well, it says I can use an action to expend one to three of its charges. Okay. I'll do all three, right? (all laugh)
Matt: All right. So, it is still restrained, so go ahead and roll with advantage an attack roll plus seven.
Sam: Ooh. 19.
Matt: With advantage?
Sam: Oh. Natural 20. (all cheer)
Matt: Oh, shit. Well. Okay. Roll 6d10 force damage.
Travis: Holy shit. 6d10?
Taliesin: How many do you need?
Matt: Well, then we double what he rolled, because it's a critical.
Marisha: Six, you need six?
Travis: And that's force damage.
Sam: Okay. 35. 70.
Matt: 70 points of force damage against the creature. So as you focus on your ring, there's a burst of divine white-looking energy that turns into this giant plate-like shield in front of you, and it just stays there. You're like, huh? And suddenly it thrusts forward, and out the front of it, like a portal, a giant spectral ram-head just slams into the chest, throwing it off the ship, as it screams, it just turns into sea foam. (all cheer)
Travis: You killed it!
Matt: It's scattered into the ocean across from you. It is destroyed.
Sam: Can it be like a kid who's holding a rifle, but not up to him, so it hits him and it really throws me back a little?
Matt: Which, yeah, sure. Roll a dexterity saving throw.
Sam: Five.
Matt: Off the ship, into the water.
Sam: Yes!
Matt: Splash! Into the water.
Travis: Back in the drink again!
Marisha: Are there still bad guys left?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: There are. There's two over here, and there's two currently in the water below. Ending your turn--
Marisha: But nothing left on the ship, right?
Laura: That we see?
Marisha: That we see?
Matt: Correct. These guys are trying to swim forward. That was cocked. Nope. These guys, at the top of the round, get pushed back.
Marisha: Bye!
Matt: Taryon--
Sam: I lost Alter Self when I hasted.
Matt: Yeah, so you're just generally swimming, but you also float back in the ocean. You're now caught in the water behind, so the ship carries on without you.
Taliesin: And that was the last anyone saw of Taryon Darrington. (all laugh)
Matt: All right.
Marisha: He got his $50,000 worth.
Matt: The water elemental's going to go ahead and take two slam attacks.
Sam: You there! Hello.
Matt: It's taking a slam attack against Grog, it's taking a slam attack against the pirate.
Travis: Yeah!
Matt: So against Grog, it has advantage on you because you used reckless.
Travis: Yep.
Matt: That is a 23.
Travis: Hits.
Matt: 16 points of bludgeoning damage, reduced to eight.
Travis: Okay.
Matt: And against the pirate, that hits. And the elemental reaches around, and as it punches Grog in the face, it slams the other pirate in the head, its fist engulfing his head, and he just kind of stands there, trying to find a way out, and it just drowns him while it's standing, and it drops the body to the ground.
Laura: Oh, fuck.
Travis: Oh, it killed him?
Matt: Yeah, it lashed out.
Laura: One of our guys?
Matt: Did enough damage-- no, one of the pirates.
Laura: Oh, shit. He is untameable.
Matt: Vax, you're up.
Liam: You know when you look at a cat that's alarmed because it's nervous and all the hair is puffed out? Vax's feathers are all going like pffft, watching Keyleth wreck the boat, I could fucking watch you do this all day. Up into the air, and I go and get Tary out of the water.
Sam: Aw!
Matt: You go grab Tary.
Liam: And I'm gonna pick him up and dump him back on our boat, towards the back of the ship.
Matt: Okay, carrying him, we'll say you're at half speed, so that gets you just to the edge of the ship.
Liam: Cool. I'm good. Wait, no, do I have an action left? Can I use Divine Sense right now?
Matt: As you're hasted, you have the haste action...
Liam: Yeah, I am hasted.
Matt: I'll say you can use Divine Sense, sure.
Liam: Okay. I pat him down and go, we're good, we're good, and I'm just gonna make sure he's not a demon.
Matt: Oh. Taryon.
Liam: Yes.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: A demon? What?
Laura: Why a demon?
Marisha: What? Why would you think he's a demon?
Sam: Guys, the conclusion of the epic series Shades of Magic, A Conjuring of Light, was just released, so go pick it up. It's put out by Tor books, a leading publisher of science fiction and fantasy for over three decades.
Matt: Okay. That ends Vax's turn. Vex, you're up.
Laura: Okay. I'll fly over to Percy, who's on the fucking ground.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: And I say, are you good?
Taliesin: It was worth it. Good.
Laura: Lovely. Get off this boat. And I'll fly over and try to help out the fight on the other side.
Matt: Okay. We'll say that's 20... 40... yeah, you can get over here.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: You'd still be just above the fray.
Laura: And then I'll shoot some arrows at--
Matt: There's one guy left, and the elemental.
Laura: I'll shoot 'em at the guy.
Matt: Okay, go ahead for two strikes on that.
Laura: Yeah. Oh, disadvantage, too?
Matt: The fog is still around, so yes.
Laura: Oh, damn it. Okay.
Travis: Oh, one of them was a--
Laura: Yeah, but. 20 on the first one, and 15 plus seven on the second one. 22.
Matt: Both hit. Roll damage.
Laura: Awesome.
Marisha: You have a d3?
Sam: I need a d3.
Taliesin: It's a d6.
Marisha: It's a d6 cut in half.
Sam: Wait, two, four, six or something? Okay.
Laura: Oh, Jesus, this is terrible, this is terrible.
Taliesin: There is actually a d3 that has two ones, two twos, and two threes.
Laura: 17. Plus three lightning damage. And then... 16 plus two lightning damage. And then for my bonus action, Trinket's gonna-- and it was Sneak Attack, because there's something next to him, huh?
Matt: Correct.
Laura: (cackles) Five for sneak attack!
Matt: All righty.
Laura: And then Trinket will attack him too.
Matt: Roll an attack for Trinket.
Laura: Okay.
Liam: (bear noises)
Laura: Yes. That is-- what is that, a bite attack?
Matt: Whichever one you decide.
Laura: Sure, it's a bite attack. A 24.
Matt: That hits. Roll damage.
Laura: It's 11.
Matt: 11. As both arrows staple, one into the guy's knee, he falls down to the ground on one knee. The other one hits him in the side of the body, and he looks up just as Trinket chomps down over his head. (all cheer)
Matt: And just crunches down. You watch as his skull collapses with the force of the bear's jaw, and the arms just go limp at the sides. (all cheer)
Matt: Trinket then shakes him a bit, and his limp body just goes whoompf, whoompf, just slamming and breaking into the side of the ship, and then drops it on the ground, and Trinket turns around and looks in your direction.
Laura: Good job, boy!
Liam: That made us all so happy.
Laura: Yeah, it's great.
Marisha: See a guy get thrashed.
Laura: I wish Scanlan could've been here to see that.
Matt: All righty.
Sam: 87 episodes. One kill.
Laura: He's had more than one.
Matt: Two of the guys are trying to swim, but they're not able to keep up. You just watch them slowly vanish behind you in the fog. All right, Percy?
Taliesin: The water elemental's still a problem, I take it?
Matt: You can see it still lashing out, yes.
Travis: And there's one hook left.
Taliesin: I'm going to stand up, dust myself off, pull out Bad News, take careful aim-- slightly irritated aim at that water elemental, and see what happens.
Matt: Go for it. Disadvantage on the shot.
Taliesin: Disadvantage on the shot.
Travis: Has the fog not dissipated because fish-head got done with?
Laura: No.
Taliesin: Not yet. I'm actually going to spend a grit to gain my advantage back.
Matt: Okay. Go for it.
Taliesin: Come on. Thank god I didn't do that too weird. That's 20.
Matt: 20 hits.
Taliesin: I'm also gonna blow through most of Cabal's Ruin, 'cause that's funny. I know, I say that a lot. So that's standard damage, is 15 points of damage, plus where is--
Marisha: 1d4 plus four... 1d6 lightning damage per charge expended.
Taliesin: Okay, 1d6 per charge. You know? Let's end this. Should we just end this?
Marisha: That's good. Lightning's bad for water. Not that I'd know.
Taliesin: I figured it would be. I'm just gonna blow eight of the charges, so do you have five more--
Marisha: Yeah, I do. Five more, of course. Dream come true, make it happen.
Laura: If this doesn't end it...
Taliesin: So plus (counting) 23 points of lightning damage on top of that.
Matt: Okay, so as you bring Bad News down and aim across the way, fire the bullet, it blasts across, and you guys see this glow of electrical energy that just shoots through the air, the bullet enhanced by the Cabal's Ruin vestige enchantment. As it blasts into the side of the elemental, the elemental gets blown back through the air, and as it does, it just vaporizes. (all cheer)
Marisha: Is that everyone done?
Matt: All the enemies currently seem to be not on the ship, or dragging behind. However, (creaking noise)
Taliesin: I'm going to stop, I'm going to wave, and I'm going to go walk over and start looking to see if I can see what that glow is. I'm going to deactivate this, because I want to loot this ship.
Matt: Okay. Make a perception check.
Taliesin: Ooh, that's better. That's 25.
Matt: 25. You glance in the side, and you see now, there is a singular small palantír-type orb, but smaller, that is a foggy gray color on the inside that's slowly swirling, and you can see it's gathering condensation and mist around it.
Taliesin: Does there seem to be any mechanism for turning it off or otherwise?
Matt: It looks like it's just embedded into it.
Marisha: Take it with us, take it with us.
Taliesin: I'm going to at least try and pick it up, and--
Matt: Make a strength check.
Taliesin: Okay.
Liam: While he's busy, I'm gonna jet over next to Keyleth.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Oh, are we in combat rounds?
Matt: We're going to stay in order for a second.
Liam: Oh, okay.
Matt: There is a bit of a--
Taliesin: That's adorable.
Marisha: That's sad.
Taliesin: Three.
Matt: (straining sound) You feel something pop in your back shoulder, and your right arm gets a little numb.
Taliesin: That's so mean. (all laugh)
Liam: It's like when you just reach out to pick up something--
Marisha: Yeah, you never know. Getting old, man.
Taliesin: There's no way to--
Matt: As you go over to it, you see it's there, but it's currently held in place by something that's beneath the orb, or at least it's either adhered or glued to or held there, you just don't have the strength to lift it.
Taliesin: There's gotta be a way to turn this off.
Matt: So that's your turn.
Marisha: I shout to--
Matt: It's Grog's turn, actually.
Marisha: Sorry.
Travis: I go over to the harpoon hook, and like, fuck this harpoon hook. Can I try and get it out of the ship with my strength?
Matt: Sure, go ahead and roll a strength check. With advantage, because you are raging.
Travis: Hey. 25.
Matt: One-handed.
Laura: Hey!
Matt: (tink, fwoomp) And it just flies out of your grip from the tension out of the ship. You have to pull your hand back 'cause the-- one of the giant gnarled edges of it almost take your arm off in the process.
Travis: (gasp)
Laura: You almost lost that gauntlet!
Matt: It tears a section of the edge of this boat off. Just the railing on the side kind of pulls through it immediately.
Travis: I'll pay for that.
Matt: Trinket has to pull off to the side and the one guy kind of backs up immediately as it shoots off into the water below. For you guys, the ship, now that it doesn't have the tension to the side, is now capsizing very quickly and turning on the side.
Taliesin: Oh, god.
Travis: I feel like I did something bad.
Marisha: That was cool!
Travis: Oopsie.
Matt: Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: I say  Hey guys! Cruises are really trashy! (laughs)
Travis: Jokes while you're doing that.
Marisha: And I still have Control Water going.
Liam: Tip your waiters.
Marisha: Can I flush out the bottom of the cruise ship and bring whatever treasure is up out of the bow with what water is there? Just kind of (whoof)?
Taliesin: Like a spigot.
Matt: You're kinda off to the side. You can look down, it's not very well-lit on the inside at all. Like, it is not lit on the interior. You do have your elven darkvision for a few feet, so you have to glance over and look into the room below, but right now all you're seeing is seafoam and ocean pouring into the side of the ship.
Marisha: Okay, I stop sinking the boat. Because we're not dying.
Matt: Okay. The ship is still sinking. You filled it with water, and currently the side of it has been blasted twice.
Marisha: I bring the water up like a fountain of wealth and youth. Just coming up. Out of the bottom. (all laugh)
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Wow.
Marisha: Just other way.
Liam: Oh, boy!
Marisha: Seeing what comes out from the bottom of the ship.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Hopefully not dead bodies or like--
Taliesin: (sings) It's rainin' men...
Laura: I know, if there were slaves--
Marisha: Slave trade or something sad-- yeah, like slave.
Laura: Fingers crossed. Let's not do that to Keyleth.
Marisha: Oh, come on!
Travis: It's just kids!
Marisha: He's looking at his notes like it's a thing!
Travis: It's just kids.
All: (laughs and groans)
Travis: Kids and puppies!
Marisha: That's my worst nightmare!
Matt: You're terrible!
Travis: Kids and puppies!
Liam: Gosh!
Matt: Okay, so as the water comes rushing up from underneath, you see a lot of genuinely soaked food items come shooting up, large chunks of broken wood, what appear to be additional iron ballista spears.
Marisha: Oh!
Matt: And lots of chain come firing up from the inside.
Marisha: Watch your head! Points!
Matt: Furniture, chairs, occasionally (water sound effects) just pieces of broken things from the interior. You're not seeing much else than that at the moment.
Marisha: Aw. These were lame pirates! No treasure.
Taliesin: Let's get the orb at the very least.
Matt: (sarcastically) Good pirates keep all their treasure on their ship at all times.
Marisha: Lame! (all laugh)
Liam: Just hundreds and hundreds of NES classics.
Laura: We really should've kept one of them alive.
Travis: Do you wanna check the captain's quarters before it all goes down?
Laura: Yeah! What if there's a map to treasure?
Liam: (sighs) Looks like it's going down pretty fast, though, yeah?
Travis: Those of you on the boat--
Taliesin: Doing it now-- yes, we want to it now while there's an order of operations based on a die roll!
Marisha: I have control! I have control!
Matt: Taryon!
Sam: Yes?
Matt: Anything you wish to add to this circumstance? You're now soaking wet, but your winged savior has lifted you down onto the edge of the ship.
Liam: (ting)
Taliesin: (sings) And I would do anything for love.
Sam: How many of you can fly?
Liam: Two or three, give or take.
Sam: Amazing! Incredible! Stupendous! No, I have nothing to add, other than-- do you need my assistance in cleaning up any of these ruffians? Oh, also, one question.
Liam: Yeah?
Sam: Did I hurt the beast?
Liam: Man, you did great! You knocked that guy clear off!
Sam: Really?
Liam: Yeah.
Sam: I killed it!
Liam: That's a good start, man.
Sam: What was it?
Liam: What was it?
Sam: Yes!
Liam: Oh, you need to ask the white-haired one. I dunno.
Sam: Okay!
Taliesin: Oh, that's me!
Sam: Was it bad?
Liam: The worst!
Matt: All right, so you spend your turn conversing.
Liam: Yes.
Sam: Pretty much!
Liam: Six seconds of dialogue, right there!
Matt: All right, we'll say for the pace of things here, guys, the ship is maybe 30 seconds from fully sinking into the water. Anybody you guys wanna--
Laura: 30 seconds?
Liam: I'm gonna do what I said before, and I'm gonna go and land next to Keyleth.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: See if we can grab the orb. I'm gonna run downstairs and see if I can see paperwork in the captain's quarters or anything-- or run in the captain's quarters and just do a massive loot, really, just as quick as I can.
Matt: Investigation check with disadvantage. The room is currently tilted pretty heavily, and everything has slid and collided onto one side of the room. It's just a giant pile of broken furniture.
Marisha: I said I balanced it out and that I'm kind of doing that.
Travis: You want me to jump over there and go get the orb?
Laura: Yeah!
Marisha: We also kinda put a bunch of holes into the side of it.
Matt: Yeah, there are a bunch of holes in the ship--
Marisha: So I can only do so much.
Matt: Your Control Water can localize some cool effects, but overall the ship itself has taken too much damage.
Travis: Can I use my boots of Feral leaping to leap from one ship to the other?
Matt: Sure, make an athletics check.
Laura: I want to fly down and help Percy investigate. If there's time.
Liam: We're pretty flush already. Let's make it quick.
Taliesin: Well, there might be something magic. Okay. My investigation check is 19.
Matt: 19 with disadvantage?
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: Nice! All right, pulling from the inside and rummaging through, you find--
Taliesin: Any papers I'm just gonna grab.
Matt: Yeah, you grab whatever papers you can, there's a small leather tube, you grab that. Looking about inside, there's a ring of keys. You find a bunch of scattered coins throughout the room. It looks like there was a couple of small chests that just opened up and--
Taliesin: I'm looking more for magic, I don't care about gold-- magic or weird.
Matt: Right.
Taliesin: Catch the eye. Are the keys, like--
Matt: They look like some sort of opening device, yeah.
Taliesin: Oh, no. Okay, yeah, I'm gonna grab them anyway.
Matt: Okay. So you grab the keys. Cool. All right.
Travis: 22. To jump across.
Matt: To jump across, okay. So you make it across, and you try and go underneath now. The ship, now, not only is it listing to one side, but it's starting to lift up a little bit.
Marisha: I try to balance it as much as I can.
Matt: So you're slowing the process. Slowing it.
Marisha: Yeah.
Travis: Make my way to the orb. Rip it out.
Matt: The ship is also slowly moving behind the other ship, as it's no longer maintaining speed. All right, so what are you doing?
Travis: I'm trying to make it to the orb that he was too weak to pull out--
Matt: Strength check.
Taliesin: I hope you pull something in your knee.
Travis: Hah! 25.
Taliesin: God damn it.
Matt: (popping sound)
Travis: I got it! Throw it in the water?
Taliesin: No! Let's keep it, let's bring it to the other ship.
Marisha: Put it in the Bag of Holding, Grog.
Travis: In the Bag of Holding.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: And I run, and I try and jump back to the other boat.
Matt: Make an athletics check.
Travis: I'm not gonna make it, but--
Laura: You might.
Liam: You might.
Travis: 23.
Matt: Five, ten, 15, 20... You catch the edge and are dangling on the side of the ship as your fingers are right there.
Liam: Looney Tunes!
Travis: (breathing hard) I'm good.
Sam: You could have flown.
Travis: I swallowed the coin.
Matt: Percival, water is now starting to spill in underneath you, and you're now about knee-deep inside, and everything's-- all the papers that you haven't already grabbed are soaked and floating up at the top.
Taliesin: I'm gonna run out. There's-- oh, man. I don't hear anything coming from down below, do I?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Laura: Did you ever hear that I wanted to go help Percy investigate, was I able to do that?
Marisha: Please tell me I didn't kill someone innocent again.
Matt: Yeah, you could fly over. Because you're behind him. As you rush in to help him, he has a couple armfuls of things, the room is now about knee-high with water and is tilting heavily to this side, and there's just floating bits of paper and soaked books and pieces of broken wood and furniture-- the room is utter chaos.
Laura: Anything interesting?
Taliesin: Yeah, I don't know. Hold on. I'm gonna listen for it.
Marisha: Hopefully no innocent people.
Taliesin: Perception check.
Sam: (muffled) Help me, I'm an orphan!
Taliesin: You're terrible. 17.
Matt: 17? You take a listen. Through all the splashing of water, the sound of wood creaking, and the ocean outside, you don't hear anything.
Laura: What are you listening for?
Taliesin: I show the keys. I'm worried there's a cage down there. I still have the spider boots, so I'm holding on.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Can I hear anything with my elven ears?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Taliesin: You've got an elven perception check.
Liam: They're taking the hobbits to Isengard.
Laura: What do your elf eyes see? Oh, nothing.
Liam: It was a one.
Laura: It was a one.
Matt: Okay, yeah. You go down and listen, and as soon as you do the water splashes up into your ear, and you get a bunch of salt water in the ear canal. Up in your nose a bit. You're like, ugh.
Laura: That was awful. We should get out.
Taliesin: I'm gonna hand her a bunch of stuff, including some of my things, and be back-- I'm gonna try and see if I can just--
Matt: Spider-boot down.
Taliesin: Spider-boot and see if I can hold my breath and look.
Laura: Don't drown, Percival.
Taliesin: I'm gonna grab, and try and use the lenses on my mask to even get a clear shot of what's under there.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: And I'm just trying to visualize with the last ten minutes that I have of Control Water to clear the bottom of this passage.
Matt: So you can do that. You can prevent, slowing the sinking, to part water.
Marisha: The rushing-in, that's what I want to do. I wanna part right where Percy's heading.
Matt: Okay. As you do that, the ship begins to list even further back and at an angle, and you watch as the front of it comes upward, and everything on the ship begins to slide past--
Travis: Yes!
Matt: -- in the direction of Keyleth and Vax.
Marisha: Sorry, physics.
Liam: Get off!
Matt: Can I have you both make dexterity saving throws, if you could.
Marisha: What, me too?
Matt: Yes.
Marisha: Jesus F. Christ.
Matt: A bunch of barrels just (rolling sound) in your direction.
Marisha: Oh, that's not too bad. Just straight dex saving throw. Plus five.
Liam: Natural 20.
Marisha: What did I roll? 16.
Matt: Okay, yeah, you both manage to just sidestep out of the way as they tumble past and splash into the water below.
Taliesin: Get out of here, you two!
Matt: You're starting to lose your footing a little bit. You probably have one more round before you just start sliding off the edge.
Liam: Let's go, man!
Marisha: Quick, quick, quick!
Taliesin: I'm fine. Vex is here, you two leave.
Matt: Percival. Perception check, as the water separates in the room.
Taliesin: Yeah. That's what I'm hoping for.
Marisha: Aw, you rolled a 19!
Taliesin: That's 26.
Matt: Okay. As you push down into the chamber with the walls of the water to the sides-- as you look down, and most of the furniture that was thrust up out of this area is cleared out. You do see two cages in the far back, one of which is empty. The other one does seem to have some sort of humanoid inside.
Taliesin: I'm going for it.
Marisha: Come on.
Matt: Okay. You rush up to the cage, and you look inside and you can already see what looks to be a slumped-over humanoid. You see no features, and there's no light down here, and your human eyes don't make out a lot of detail. The fact that you rolled so high-- it's only the little bit of light comes down here that's reflecting around.
Laura: Shit.
Taliesin: I've already got the keys in my hand and I'm just going to start going for it.
Matt: First key, nothing. Second key, nothing. Third key, noth-- (creaking sounds)
Sam: Cut the red wire!
Matt: Water begins to pour in from another side, and the ship itself is pulling back. I want you to go ahead and make an intelligence check.
Marisha: Come on, Percy. Come on.
Taliesin: I'm going to choose to use a Resolve. That's a save, isn't it?
Matt: That's for a saving throw.
Taliesin: God damn it.
Travis: Why didn't you roll the snitch?
Matt: What did you roll?
Taliesin: I rolled a one.
Matt: A natural one. You start getting the keys in, and there's probably a good 15 or 16 or so keys on here, and you get through about six of them before the ship itself has gone into a fall, and the cages begin to slide--
Taliesin: Okay, I'm rolling. There's someone in there, but I can't get it! And I'm going to spider-climb on the upside, on the wrong side of the wood and stay out of the water and crawl out.
Liam: Was he under water, or was the water--
Matt: The water is being parted by Keyleth, currently.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: The cage is beginning to slide now, towards the back of the ship.
Taliesin: I don't know what to do. And I'm running out, I don't know what else to do.
Matt: Okay, so.
Marisha: What?
Taliesin: There's someone in a cage. I don't know what to do!
Liam: I'll fly at that.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Are you going? I'm gonna try whatever last bit of Control Water I have to try and part and calm the waters where Vax is going, and I say, go Vax, go!
Matt: Okay, so you just fly in?
Liam: If there's a cage, I'll go to it.
Matt: As you rush down inside, you watch as these two large, heavy cages are tumbling in your direction. An empty one slams just past you, and the other one slams into that, itself turning up a bit, and something inside slumps to the side of the bars.
Marisha: I'm trying to calm the water as much as I can.
Liam: Can I even see the lock or where the keys were?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Liam: All right.
Matt: The keys you do not have. Percy has--
Taliesin: I have the keys, but none of them were working.
Liam: That's a 21.
Matt: 21. You manage to, as you leap up using your wings in little bursts-- this is a small, enclosed space, you can't use too much of the air to fly. In what little bit of parting of the water's being done, you catch up and climb onto the top, and you can see the cage has turned on its side, and the doorway is on the top. So you can see the actual lock.
Liam: All right. While I'm hasted, do I have an action left to get up there and pick it?
Matt: I'd say yeah.
Liam: Yeah? Okay.
Laura: Go, go, go!
Marisha: Go, go, go!
Liam: 32.
Matt: You reach out and pull out your picks, and as you look up-- Keyleth, at this point you're parting the water, but the ship is now sinking, and you are-- you're sliding off.
Taliesin: I grab. Can I make a jump to grab?
Matt: You can. Go ahead and make a dexterity check.
Marisha: And I'm just holding concentration, hoping someone catches me.
Taliesin: My dexterity-- save or check?
Matt: Either.
Taliesin: They're both the same. It doesn't matter.
Marisha: That's good, that's good.
Taliesin: 22.
Matt: Just catch Keyleth as she's about to slide off the edge, and you hold her there. Now, I will not require a concentration check from you, however, you're about to both go under water.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: You're holding her at the edge of the ship. You get the door open. It slams over on the side. And looking down inside, you can see what appears to be a slumped-over, soggy mess of a person. Unconscious.
Liam: Okay, can I keep going here, or--
Matt: Yeah. Grab them, pull them up, fireman's carry--
Liam: And then just try to slowly, messily float him up and out of here.
Laura: I want to go help if I can.
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: Yeah, there's not much room for flight, it's more like--
Liam: All right, so pull.
Matt: -- leaping through, as you make your way there. You just get up onto the edge as the water goes past both Percy and Keyleth. You guys, your faces just (splash) beneath the ocean water.
Marisha: Yeah!
Liam: I shout out, Twinnie!
Laura: I help, I help, I help.
Matt: You rush down from the broom. He goes and flings the person over your lap, and you take up on the rest of the ship as the boat now is completely submerged. You watch the tip of it just (splash) beneath the water. Bubbling the water up around as--
Marisha: I drop Control Water, switch back to my Alter Self, grab Percy, head back to the boat.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: While this is going on, I'm asking Captain Adella's crew for towels. Could I get a towel? Or some sort of-- I'm really wet, here.
Matt: They're all on the edge of the ship, watching this happen. With one in the crow's nest, keeping an eye out. And they're not paying any attention to you.
Sam: I'm just worried that this will rust if I don't get it dry soon, so if I could get some towels, or maybe someone to fan it off, that would be great. Thank you.
Matt: All right. No response, but you are eager to repeat your question. As you make your way over, Keyleth, you pull Percival-- because both of you guys sink quite a bit below with the ship. As soon as it goes under, it goes under fast, and as soon as you glance up to watch that Vax makes his way out, and you can just see over the surface, you relieve that to start swimming up, and both the two of you-- you release your boots, and begin to make your way to the surface. It takes a moment, and you just get to the cusp of what you can hold your breath, before you both break the surface. Percy takes a deep breath, and you guys eventually swim your way over towards the edge of the boat. The fog, by the way, has begun to dissipate now, and has been slowly doing so since your removal of the orb from the edge.
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: As you guys all manage to make your way back onto the surface of the ship, waterlogged and tired, we're going to take a break for the restroom.
Travis: Nice! A fight at sea!
Marisha: A fight at sea!
Travis: We made it off the Titanic!
Taliesin: I fell off a boat.
Liam: This is stupid, Rose! This is stupid!
Travis: This is stupid, why would you do that?
Marisha: Like Battleship, but better.
Matt: So we'll be back here in a few minutes. We do have a Wyrmwood giveaway for you guys in the chat room. Be active in the chat room, just you have to use the phrase 'Wyrmwood', w-y-r-m-w-o-o-d,  in the chat room, once they initiate the actual contest, and we'll come back from the break with the winner. So we'll see you here in a few minutes, guys.
Travis: Yeah! [break]
Matt: Hello, everyone, and welcome back to Critical Role! First off, thank you again to our evening's sponsor, Tor Books!
All: Tor Books!
Matt: For coming out and sponsoring this episode, make sure to check out A Conjuring of Light, the conclusion to the Shades of Magic series is now available. Also, we had a contest in the chat for this fantastic mahogany dice vault by Wyrmwood, the winner is Terrythesortofgamer. (all cheer)
Matt: Congratulations, Terry, we're gonna go ahead and get this signed and shipped out to you ASAP. Thank you all for entering, we'll have more giveaways in future episodes as well as Talks Machina on Tuesday with Brian Foster. Anyway, let's bring it back in.
Travis: Yeah!
Matt: So, having returned to the ship, the fog lifted, and the path before you now clear, the rest of the open, cloudless sky before you, you continued ahead in the southwestern direction towards the Islands of Anamn, which is where Vesrah exists--
Laura: But I wanted to see the prisoner--
Marisha: Yeah, the prisoner.
Laura: -- are they okay? I mean, did I check them out while I was--
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: We're getting to that right now.
Marisha: Let's bring 'em back.
Laura: Okay.
Travis: Fuckin', just cool your jets.
Marisha: We wanna talk to him.
Laura: Well, I mean, I had him on my lap as I was flying back. I wanted to make sure they were okay.
Matt: Right, so you come back to the-- as you bring the prisoner down, you lay him down-- and it is a man, early, mid- thirties-ish, maybe looks grizzled, kind of a half beard growing in--
Travis: Kill him.
Matt: -- he is drowned at the moment.
Laura: (gasps)
Sam: Oh, he's dead?
Matt: He's not breathing, he is waterlogged, and even at a quick glance, you can see he has scars all over his body--
Laura: Oh no.
Matt: -- his clothes are tattered--
Marisha: Do I have any residual Control Water left? Yeah?
Matt: I'd say yeah, you're still concentrating--
Laura: I roll him on his side.
Marisha: Can I see if I can pull any water out of his lungs?
Matt: You know what? Make a wisdom check.
Liam: Out come the lungs.
Laura: (vomit noise) And he's dead. Dead dead.
Marisha: That's good! Just straight wisdom?
Liam: He's inside out.
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: Straight wisdom?
Travis: What is dead may never die!
Marisha: 21.
Laura: Oh no, you keep scooching back.
Matt: 21!
Marisha: Just straight wisdom?
Liam: What the heck, Laura.
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: So you get down on the low, and you reach out and grab the shoulder, and using the last moments of your Control Water spell, you focus and begin to just siphon the water out of the lungs, and immediately the body kind of convulses, the throat opens up from the outside, and you can see the water just project outward as the chest pushes inward, expelling the rest of the liquid from the lungs. Immediately, (coughs).
Marisha: Vax. Help.
Liam: Yeah.
Laura: Pat, pat, pat, pat, pat.
Liam: I do pat, pat, pat, except I cast Lay on Hands when I do it.
Laura: Yeah, well, I cast Cure Wounds while that happens, so go fuck yourself.
Liam: Seems oddly competitive at this moment, where we're saving a man's life, but all right.
Matt: What last murmurs of this man's life that remained as he began to fade to the drowning, you both manage to just bring him back from the cusp of death, and coughing profusely over the next 30 or so seconds, turning onto his stomach and gathering himself, taking breaths, spitting out whatever seawater still remains in his lungs, he looks back up at you all, and you can see he has a ragged, mouse-brown hair on top, and it's shorter on the sides around the ear, rather large ears, kind of square jaw but very scrawny, and once again from the tattered clothes and scars all over his body, some fresh, some old, looks like he's undergone a rough recent weeks--
Laura: I feel like we're finding Percy all over again.
Marisha: No shit.
Matt: Kinda looks up at everyone. "Wh-- Where am I?"
Laura: On a boat!
Taliesin: Different boat. Ship.
Liam: Our boat.
Matt: "What do you want?"
Laura: How long have you been in that cell?
Matt: "Who are you?"
Marisha: Sorry.
Laura: We're your saviors.
Matt: He leans back, falls onto his palms a bit, and is just kinda laying back, too exhausted to move away, but trying to just move back a bit.
Laura: Can I insight check him and make sure? I just don't trust anyone.
Matt: Sure. Insight check.
Laura: Ooh, natural 20. Wow wow wow.
Sam: He's a demon.
Marisha: Oh shit.
Liam: It's Hotis, it's Hotis, it's Hotis, it's Hotis!
Laura: Oh it is, it's Hotis, it's Hotis!
Marisha: Oh, I don't wanna fight Hotis on the ocean.
Sam: Guys, feel free to keep--
Marisha: What you got? What do you got, Grog?
Matt: Shove off, Travis.
Sam: Keep tweeting those pick-up lines to @TorBooks. They like 'em. I do, anyway.
Liam: Guys, I'm gonna make a Tor Books run, does anybody want anything?
Matt: Curse you, Travis.
Sam: Grande fantasy novel?
Laura: Don't worry.
Matt: (coughs)
Laura: Your captors have been defeated.
Matt: "Well that's good, eh?"
Laura: You're safe. What's your name?
Matt: He leans forward, sits up and looks at you. He seems to soften a little bit, though he's still guarded. "Thenton Groose. First Mate of the ship Tempest Fang. Yeah."
Laura: Tempest Fang?
Matt: "Tempest Fang. Yeah. It was taken by a bunch of bastards, kept me in that cage for a few weeks."
Laura: Weeks.
Marisha: Tempest Fang-- where do you hail from?
Matt: "Who wants to know?"
Marisha: Keyleth, of the Air Ashari.
Matt: "From around."
Marisha: From around?
Matt: "I'm a businessman of the seas."
Marisha: Not the sailor type, then?
Matt: "Sail a bit."
Marisha: What were you doing on the Ozmit Sea?
Matt: "Making a shipment across to Emon from Issylra, and this group of thugs decided to go ahead and ransack us from the side. Took our ship down and most of the crew. Kept a few of us alive underneath. Seems like I was the one who lasted the longest."
Marisha: From Emon to where?
Liam: From Issylra to Emon.
Matt: "From Issylra."
Marisha: Oh, from Issylra.
Liam: What was your cargo?
Matt: He looks at you for a second, reads you up and down as you step into the conversation. "General goods. Few fancy textiles--"
Liam: Insight check.
Matt: "Some silks, some furs."
Taliesin: Insight.
Matt: Insight check.
Liam: 18.
Taliesin: 19.
Laura: Ooh.
Sam: Oh boy!
Laura: Again, again!
Sam: Lots of whispers, guys.
Liam: Just come sit with us.
Marisha: All the whispers.
Laura: Oh, but do you just wanna hang out over here? 'Cause Travis is just gonna fuck with your shit again.
Sam: Hey, in the future-- Travis, what do you think about this-- don't shake your butt.
Marisha: Yeah!
Sam: That's disgusting.
Marisha: Get it, Levi's, yeah.
Sam: What if we-- here's my pitch. What if we have two tin cans and a string that just goes to Matt, and we can do like one of these things.
Matt: That's a great idea.
Sam: Ah! Ah!
Laura: That would be so cool.
Matt: "Yeah, I'm just-- I'm glad you came along."
Taliesin: Tell me, friend. Why did they keep you alive?
Matt: "That's a good question."
Taliesin: It is.
Matt: "I don't fucking know."
Taliesin: What did they ask you?
Laura: Can we get some food?
Taliesin: I think that's a great idea.
Matt: Immediately his eyes widen--
Laura: I was talking back to Captain Adella or one of the crewmates. Not you, Grog.
Matt: As soon as you do that, Captain Adella goes, "Ah, I don't get food. You get food!" And one of the other crewmates, "Oh, oh right." And he immediately jumps down below the deck.
Sam: I'm gluten-free!
Liam: Well, we saved your life, how else can we help you, friend?
Matt: "Oh, just drop me off at the nearest port you get to, please."
Taliesin: That's going to be a while.
Marisha: Yes.
Matt: "That's fine. That's fine."
Marisha: Have you sailed frequently before? What was your exact duty on this ship?
Laura: First Mate?
Marisha: Oh. Right. He already said that. So, you sail a lot.
Matt: "A fair bit, yeah."
Marisha: Yeah.
Taliesin: Any tattoos on him?
Matt: Yeah, actually, a handful visibly.
Taliesin: Any I'd recognize? I was on a boat for quite a while, as well.
Matt: Right.
Taliesin: It was a long time ago.
Matt: Make a history check.
Taliesin: All right. Let's say 18.
Matt: 18? Okay. None of the symbols you recognize, necessarily, however, the arrangement of them-- the placement of them and the general design are not used as-- there's tattoos you could see they're decoration, there're tattoos you could see that are meant as-- they mean something to the person. These tattoos and their placement seems intentionally to intimidate.
Taliesin: Huh. Okay.
Laura: Was he a pirate?
Travis: Mr. Theton Groove, is anyone looking for you right now?
Matt: "I don't think so, my crew went down with the ship."
Taliesin: What was your captain's name?
Matt: He kind of looks over at you, "Wha-- what-- why--"
Taliesin: I was just curious how quickly you'd answer it. It's fine. Carry on. You will be getting food, don't worry, this is not us being threatening, we're just... it's odd finding a man in a cage in the bottom of a terrible ship filled with awful people. That alone makes us like you, but you are a bit weird.
Marisha: That's true. That's all true.
Taliesin: It is true.
Marisha: Yeah.
Laura: Forgive us, we have to be a bit wary.
Marisha: We've seen a lot.
Matt: "No, no, that's--"
Taliesin: We don't mind if you're disreputable, we just would like to know if you're our kind of disreputable.
Sam: If I may, new companions.
Travis: Oh god.
Sam: When my father would have--
Taliesin: Oh boy, okay.
Sam: -- sort of a cagey individual that he needed to interrogate, he had an employee named The Dog who was a large man, who would come and just squeeze them until they talked. Why don't we just do that here? It seems like it would be much quicker than talking in circles like this.
Marisha: Do you have The Dog with you?
Sam: Well, we have this guy, who's pretty big--
Marisha: Oh.
Sam: -- and I bet he could squeeze--
Travis: I mean, I second that method, but I'm just seeing if anybody else--
Taliesin: I feel like that's deeply premature.
Travis: It's deeply immature. I would never do something like that.
Taliesin: Immature indeed.
Sam: Well, all right.
Laura: Plus he's so frail right now, I'm afraid Grog would just break him in half.
Travis: Probably.
Matt: He is noticeably looking nervously back and forth between Taryon and Grog, and--
Travis: I mean, after all, we saved your life, right? You wouldn't be (yells) hiding nothing, would you?
Matt: "No?"
Travis: See?
Marisha: Honestly, this is how we treat people we like.
Taliesin: God, that's also true.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: "Does anyone have any water?"
Laura: Yes.
Taliesin: Oh yes.
Matt: "Fresh water? Oh, thank you." And he pulls it out and just starts drinking thirstily from it.
Marisha: All right. So we've cleared a few things, right? You seem untrustworthy, and broken, so therefore we like you. What else can we learn about you?
Matt: "I don't know what you're talking about. Look, I have business contacts, I can get you paid, just get me safe somewhere."
Taliesin: What sort of business contacts?
Matt: "The sort that I do business with, I told you. We deal in trade across the Ozmit."
Liam: Yeah, I mean, he's shifty as fuck, but it's no skin off my back, right?
Taliesin: No, not really.
Travis: We got any cages on this boat?
Taliesin: Oh, we're not-- we don't need that yet, where's he going to go?
Laura: Do I see any, like, Clasp markings on him at all?
Liam: That question might be great, but I think we're all right.
Matt: Nothing Clasp. Not really.
Travis: Gotta sleep at some point.
Matt: You kinda glance over and look at the middle of his shoulders and his shirt is kind of billowing, and torn. No symbol of the Clasp.
Laura: Those scars on your body. Were they from before you were captured, or after?
Matt: "Some-- both ways. The cages don't really protect very well."
Laura: What were they doing to you?
Matt: "They were just having fun, trying to get information about my company, and, you know. Being general pirate arseholes."
Travis: Sounds fun.
Marisha: And you're sure they were just pirates, yeah?
Matt: "Well, what else are they? Not the most pious men I've ever met."
Marisha: I don't know. I've never met a real pirate until just now.
Matt: At which point, one of the crewmen comes up with a small cluster of biscuits, and hands them over as he greedily reaches out like, "Oh!"
Marisha: Wait, one of the crewmen?
Taliesin: One of ours.
Marisha: One of ours?
Matt: Yes.
Laura: Yeah.
Liam: Yeah.
Laura: I asked if they would bring him food.
Sam: We asked for food.
Matt: Adella just sent him for food.
Laura: I asked him to bring food.
Marisha: Why is he acting like he's starving?
Laura: Because he's been in a cage for two weeks. They didn't feed him very much.
Marisha: Oh, him, not our crewmate.
Travis: Holy shit.
Taliesin: Oh, okay, I--
Matt: The crewman brought food, and he reached out for it.
Marisha: Oh, sorry.
Matt: That's okay.
Marisha: Sorry, we were confused. Sorry.
Matt: That's okay.
Liam: Can't you see everything around you? It's all here.
Travis: He brings up a plate of biscuits and hungrily starts eating.
Taliesin: Bangarang. Bangarang!
Marisha: I brought you biscuits! (eating sounds)
Taliesin: Congratulations, Peter.
Matt: The crewman's a dick, by the way. Just--
Marisha: Do you want these?
Matt: These are good biscuits, starving guy! To be fair, that is kinda your style.
Laura: Thenton, you will forgive us if we don't give you free rein of the ship while you're on here.
Matt: "Oh no, that's fine. That's fine. I mean, lock me up, whatever you need. Just get me back to land, please."
Laura: We'll promise not to poke you.
Matt: "That's appreciated."
Marisha: So, you said you travel the Ozmit Sea frequently, yeah?
Matt: "Yeah."
Marisha: Have you stumbled upon the island of the Vesrah? The Ashari people of this ocean?
Laura: (laughs) Of the Ashari.
Marisha: Of the Ashari (laughs).
Matt: He says, "If what you're referring to is the Islands of Anamn, we generally steer clear. Too many reefs."
Marisha: Of Omand? Alland?
Matt: Anamn. A-N-A-M-N.
Marisha: Almond?
Sam: Aman.
Taliesin: Joy.
Laura: A--
Marisha: Almond Joy.
Taliesin: Sorry.
Marisha: The Island--
Matt: A-N-A-M-N. Anamn.
Marisha: A-N-A-M-N.
Taliesin: Cluster.
Marisha: Anman. An-amn.
Travis: Well, we should introduce ourselves, at least.
Laura: Yeah.
Travis: We are Vox Machina, a travelling group of acrobats, and--
Laura: Defeaters of dragons. No big deal.
Travis: Yep.
Liam: I do Van Damme splits, just as he finishes that sentence.
Laura: Trinket gets up and starts dancing around like he knows what to do, when we say we're performers.
Marisha: And I light up my fire hands.
Travis: We do have two smarter members that are not here, Scanlan and Pike, but maybe you'll see them later if you stick with us long enough.
Laura: She's a sailor, too.
Travis: Yeah!
Matt: "Great."
Sam: Percival, am I misreading the scenario here? Can I please just pour acid on him until he talks to us? It seems like he's holding back, am I misreading, here?
Taliesin: No-- well, sort of-- not really-- sort of. It's complicated. We don't pour acid on people-- well, that's not true. No, that's a lie. We don't just pour acid on people, I feel like that's reasonable to say. We don't just pour acid--
Liam: Context. Context is key.
Taliesin: -- there's usually context involved. Things are complicated.
Sam: I am following your lead. But--
Taliesin: When it is time to pour the acid, we will undoubtedly make sure that you are on the front-- not yet--
Sam: Okay.
Taliesin: -- but you're good.
Sam: All right.
Liam: Hey, Captain.
Matt: Adella's behind you guys--
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: -- just kinda watching this whole thing with her arms crossed. One of her crewmates is currently at the helm.
Liam: I mean, the closest place to us right now is our desination, most likely, right? We're not gonna be able to dump this guy before we arrive, do you think?
Matt: "Yeah, no, we got maybe a day and a half travel 'til we reach the islands, so--"
Liam: Oy.
Laura: That's all right, he can stay on the boat.
Travis: We got an extra room for him?
Matt: "We got a-- we can throw him in the brig."
Taliesin: We can make the brig comfortable.
Laura: Yeah. We'll give him food. It's all right, right, Captain?
Matt: "We'll set some of-- one of our men on guard. All right! Pick him up. Throw him in the hole." Two of the crewmen come behind and pick him up, and kind of lean over the shoulder, like, "Ooh, thank you. Thank you very much, all of you." And he gets dragged off down below into the ship.
Liam: Byeee.
Marisha: Bye.
Laura: Captain, have you heard of the Tempest Fang?
Matt: "I've heard a thing or two."
Laura: Oh, really?
Matt: "Yeah."
Taliesin: Is it a pirating vessel?
Matt: "Yeah." (all laugh)
Matt: "I was gonna let him finish his whole diatribe before we had a conversation, but he's one of 18 working companies out of the archipelago, so--"
Travis: I believe it's arch-i-pelago.
Sam: Sea diarrhea!
Travis: Jot this down! (horn noises)
Liam: That was sudden!
Taliesin: And the tension is relieved.
Marisha: So, wait. If he works for one of 18 companies of the archipelago, that means the archipelago has pirates--
Laura: -- 17 other companies.
Marisha: 17 other pirate ships?
Matt: Pirate companies. It's a very-- some of them have alliances, some of them have very, very deep-rooted rivalries, and yeah.
Taliesin: The companies themselves have more than one ship, if I recall.
Matt: Some of them do, depending on the size.
Marisha: Wait, did we just sink one of the other 17 companies of the archipelago?
Travis: Is there any extensive damage to our ship? Are we still pretty good, other than the railing getting ripped off?
Matt: "Looking around, my crewmen tell me we're doing all right. So we'll do some repairs when we drop off at your location. Once you do your business, we'll have some time to go ahead and do a once-over of our ship."
Taliesin: I may have some charts that I stole from the other ship, as well.
Laura: Oh, yeah. I put them in the Bag of Colding for the time being. Pull it out.
Matt: Okay. Glancing about, a lot of them are maps of portions of the archipelago, the Hespit Archipelago, some are markings of various pirate headquarters, various places of parlay. A lot of them are waterlogged and soaked and damaged, but you can see elements that are-- a lot of them are hand-drawn notes in sections. The leather tube that you found, you pull it open, and there is a very, very immaculate piece of vellum paper that appears to have a number of glyphs scrawled across it.
Laura: Shit. Do we understand?
Sam: May I see that?
Taliesin: Sure.
Sam: I will Identify it.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: What? (all cheer)
Sam: Much easier this way.
Laura: That's great! You can Identify things? How many times a day can you do that?
Sam: I think all? Scroll of Programmed Illusion. Scroll allows an arcane caster to use an action to cast the sixth-level spell Programmed Illusion. If the spell is higher-level than the caster can use, they must make a spellcasting blah-blah-blah-blah-blah.
Laura: Are you an arcane user?
Sam: I think I am.
Matt: Yeah.
Taliesin: Is this basically like the thing in Superman 2 where Lex Luthor's playing chess--
Travis: In the prison cell?
Matt: Kind of?
Taliesin: Okay.
Matt: You have to look up the spell for the specifics, but yeah, it's got some interesting uses.
Sam: Are you arcane?
Laura: So basically it's you. You can use it.
Sam: Am I the only arcane?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: Yes, I'm a natural caster. You're the only arcane caster.
Laura: I mean, hold on to it in case we run into Scanlan again.
Travis: I am a powerful magician.
Laura: Or you can use it.
Travis: And with that, I take out the little gem thing that I pulled off the other ship.
Sam: Ooh! Should I Identify that?
Taliesin: You should Identify it.
Marisha: You should.
Sam: Can I, more than once a day?
Matt: Look at the ability. It's the spell-- I gotta look.
Sam: It's the Identify spell.
Matt: Yeah, it's a first-level spell.
Marisha: All the papers. All the papers in the world.
Taliesin: I imagine you're sitting here going--
Matt: It's a first-level spell, so as long as you have a first-level spell slot.
Sam: Oh.
Laura: Oh, I have a spyglass, I didn't even need to ask for Captain Adella's.
Sam: It's a ritual, though, is that--
Matt: Oh, yeah, if you can use it as a ritual, then it won't use a spell slot when you do that.
Marisha: You just do it, it just takes time.
Sam: All right. I will ritually Identify that. What's that all about?
Matt: That is a fog marker. It can be used by holding it a round, but it is generally used to create a 100-foot-wide fog cloud that lasts for an hour when used.
Sam: Do we know how to activate it?
Matt: To activate it, you have to spend a ten-minute period of time concentrating on the orb, and then as it gets moved, it carries the fog cloud with it and lasts for an hour.
Laura: That's cool.
Sam: Could be useful.
Laura: Super useful.
Taliesin: At the very least, it could be installed in the ship. They could have it as a possible--
Sam: Cloaking device?
Travis: You could put it in the guts of Dottie.
Sam: Doty.
Travis: Yep.
Laura: Deedee?
Marisha: Could you do that?
Taliesin: I don't know. It's not like he's hollow.
Marisha: In Doodie?
Sam: I mean, he's got a lot of stuff in there.
Travis: But that's not important, that stuff in there.
Liam: What kind of stuff?
Taliesin: Things.
Sam: You know.
Liam: No.
Sam: When you have two wheels and some ropes and it makes a pulley system--
Travis: Okay, no, just give it back to me, I'll put it back in the Bag of Holding.
Sam: All right.
Travis: Thanks.
Taliesin: How big is the orb, out of curiosity?
Matt: The orb is maybe seven-inch diameter. It's about that big.
Taliesin: All right.
Marisha: It's seven-inch--
Matt: Yeah, it's about that big.
Taliesin: Interesting. All right.
Matt: So the ship is still progressing in that direction.
Marisha: Can I do a nature check on it? On the orb?
Matt: To? What do you want to do with the nature check?
Sam: To see if it smells like nature.
Marisha: Did it come from any Water Ashari, or anything like that? (all laugh)
Travis: What?
Matt: Roll a nature check.
Sam: Are you my brother? Are you my brother? (all laugh)
Marisha: 14?
Matt: It looks like a magic item.
Marisha: That's awesome. That's cool.
Taliesin: Does it have smoke inside when you turn it?
Matt: Yeah, when you turn it--
Taliesin: Like those weird balls filled with weird sand--
Matt: Yeah, actually, it kinda looks like that. As you shift it, it swirls on the inside. It causes the air-- intense condensation that eventually drips from the outside of it when it's activated.
Laura: Cool.
Marisha: (laughs) Outlook cloudy.
Matt: All right. So as everything rests down in the ship you can use, you have about a day and a half travel until you're supposed to reach the islands.
Travis: Can I post up outside of the brig where stabbed-in-the-body McGee is sleeping?
Matt: Yeah. And as he--
Travis: I'll forego my room. I just want to sleep sitting up.
Liam: Do we have rooms? I thought it was like Amex City on this--
Laura: No, we have rooms. But they're combined.
Matt: Yeah, they're clustered, you have many people per room. They're like bunks. So yeah, you post outside of the brig. As evening comes, the night passes. Is there anything you want to do? You just rest for the night?
Travis: Yeah, just keep the other guard company.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: Just to give him a little expert help.
Taliesin: We've been tinkering on the ship, so.
Matt: What have you been tinkering?
Sam: Science-bro stuff.
Taliesin: Science-bro stuff. Do we have to tell you what it is?
Matt: To tinker it, so I can give you a DC, yeah.
Taliesin: So he's got this really cool--
Matt: "We tinkered something really cool. Did it work?" Sure, it succeeds. "We built Voltron."
Taliesin: You were very cagey about knowing what it is while we were on break, so I didn't know if this was a thing.
Sam: So, using one of the opals from my Helm of whatever, Brilliance, he wanted to craft a housing for it--
Taliesin: So I've built a couple housings for these opals. So, you pop the opal in, and it will allow it to create either a concentrated beam--
Sam: Spotlight.
Taliesin: Spotlight, basically, like a little flashlight, a radiant beam like a torch--
Marisha: Floodlight.
Taliesin: Like a floodlight, or while it's on spotlight, it's got a little railroad thing, it's got a little slot that will go in and give me a little bit of a red vibe, so we can have a low-light red light, and I'm also going to make a little clip so I can stick it on my gun, so I can have a little spotlight on my gun when we're going through a--
Liam: It also ensures you cannot get a prom date.
Taliesin: Hey, I'm doing okay, just saying. Percy doing okay.
Laura: I don't know, you've been tinkering a lot lately.
Matt: Okay, so that's doable. The opal doesn't perpetually glow--
Sam: Yeah, it lasts for an hour. Is that something we can turn off and on and it lasts for an hour, like a battery, or is it just an hour, it's off--
Taliesin: And then we have to pop a new opal in.
Matt: Generally, you have to pop a new opal in.
Sam: Okay, no problem.
Taliesin: But you crack the opal, you put it in, it's like one hour of either flashlight, and then a little blinder to turn it on and off-- it's basically like a little train lantern.
Marisha: I was gonna say, like an old-school lighthouse.
Matt: Go ahead and roll a tinker check.
Taliesin: Doing this together?
Sam: Can I help him?
Matt: Yes, you would be giving him advantage as you attempt to do that. So you just roll it twice, Percy.
Taliesin: That was pretty good.
Sam: Did we get two 16s?
Taliesin: I got a 19.
Sam: Oh. I got a 16, but I get plus ten with my tinkerer's tools.
Taliesin: And mine's proficiency bonus and dex bonus on top of that 19? So that's 30.
Matt: Between the two of you guys, it is not an issue. Even with your limited materials, but your travel-tinkering capabilities-- you manage to deftly create this seamless, beautiful, you could sell it on the street.
Taliesin: So they can-- we may even make a little headband so they can pop it on.
Sam: Sure, sure.
Matt: (laughs) You guys are so cute. All right.
Marisha: I spend my evening reconnecting with Vax.
Matt: Okay. (all laugh)
Sam: The Hallmark card way of saying fucking.
Taliesin: Well, there goes our sponsor by Hallmark.
Matt: Yeah, thanks. Sorry, Hallmark.
Liam: It's a couple days-- we've been traveling for a while, right?
Matt: It was three days before this encounter, you have a day and a half left.
Liam: And has a day passed since that fight?
Laura: No.
Liam: No, this is that night?
Laura: This is that night, yeah.
Matt: This is the evening afterward.
Taliesin: I'll see if I get my charges back.
Marisha: I don't want to say I feel like I'm being replaced. You know? It's not that. It's just that Percy's kinda found a new friend.
Liam: You're losing some friends.
Taliesin: We're not hanging out all the time, we're being social.
Marisha: No, it's not that. I'm a good friend, right?
Liam: Oh hi, Percy.
Sam: I was going to say we're being social.
Taliesin: I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You guys aren't there. I got distracted.
Matt: No, you guys are busy tinkering. You two are having a conversation where Vax is trying to console Keyleth's sudden friendship crisis.
Sam: Oh! Oh! You've got a little smudge right there.
Marisha: I mean, I know I can't--
Liam: You're missing your friendo time, I understand. (all laugh)
Marisha: I can't fulfill every need.
Liam: We hear them laughing from their room. (all laugh)
Taliesin: (snorts)
Matt: It is a very thin wall.
Travis: Yes, snorting.
Sam: And it was the metric system!
Sam: (exaggerated laugh) (all laugh)
Taliesin: (exaggerated laugh) (all laugh)
Marisha: I will never know what the metric system means. I don't know what that is.
Liam: They're both, you know, really special and--
Marisha: I'm still a good friend, right? I'm still a good friend?
Liam: Yeah.
Marisha: Am I a good friend?
Liam: Yeah. You're his best friend.
Marisha: All right.
Liam: Yeah, that's just new--
Marisha: Okay.
Liam: -- and those two have never met--
Marisha: No, I know.
Liam: -- a nerd as pure as the other.
Sam: (laughs)
Marisha: I know I told them to like, bond but now-- I mean (sighs). No, it's fine, it's fine. I'm cool. I'm cool.
Liam: You're more than cool.
Marisha: I've missed you.
Liam: (chuckles) Hi.
Marisha: Hi. (crying sounds) (all laugh)
Liam: I dry the tears away. Do you know--
Marisha: (tearfully) New guy and the new guy dynamic! And I don't know what the new guy's chemistry's like!
Liam: Do you know what's really cool, though? We're not on the verge of death every fucking day right now.
Marisha: (tearfully) That's true.
Liam: Yeah, you know, pluses and minuses.
Marisha: (tearfully) I'm glad the new guy's the worst of our problems. (all laugh)
Liam: Come here, you.
Marisha: (tearfully) I just love Percy so much.
Liam: I know, I know.
Matt: Aw.
Liam: I know.
Matt: An evening of consoling and the rest of you guys get your evening's rest, you outside the brig, uneventful.
Laura: I did want to talk, but that's okay.
Taliesin: I get that.
Laura: I can talk later.
Matt: Oh, did you want to talk? Go for it. Go for it.
Travis: (burps)
Liam: Go interrupt the party.
Laura: Yeah no, I was going to. TALIESIN; Well, I was going to say, you're welcome. We're finishing up, you're welcome in.
Marisha: (sobs)
Laura: Oh! Only when you're finishing up.
Travis: Ooh.
Taliesin: Well, I don't know when you were-- We obviously did it.
Sam: We built our--
Taliesin: I love that so much, it's so--
Travis: Wow, wow.
Liam: Did it?
Taliesin: Yeah, we put the whole thing together.
Liam: Put the whole thing?
Taliesin: The whole thing put together.
Matt: Phrasing.
Liam: Sure, yeah.
Marisha: Man, you're going for it. (all laugh)
Matt: You hear, as you guys are finishing up, you hear a knock at the door.
Travis: Cleaning up your--
Laura: Hello?
Taliesin: Yes! Come in.
Laura: Is it filled with smoke in here?
Marisha: (laughs)
Laura: Oh, hi Tary. I didn't see you.
Sam: We were welding.
Laura: Fun! Exciting! On a boat, even. Wow.
Taliesin: It's relatively safe.
Laura: So! What'd you make?
Taliesin: (sighs) Can I crack one?
Sam: Let's do it.
Taliesin: All right.
Sam: Oh wait, we're using one?
Taliesin: We're using one.
Sam: All right, sure. Why not? It's 1000 gold, but okay, sure. (all laugh)
Taliesin: It's his father's money.
Laura: (laughs)
Matt: (crack, dink) As he flicks the opal, it gives off a bright equivalent of the Light spell.
Laura: Oh.
Sam: Daylight.
Matt: Daylight! I'm sorry. This is--
Laura: Oh, shit.
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: The power of the sun.
Laura: That's powerful.
Matt: Basically, there's a sun in the room suddenly (crackle).
Taliesin: Wait.
Laura: Oh wow, you guys made a--
Matt: You're literally blinded for a moment.
Taliesin: (laughs)
Matt: Your eyes just go (crackle).
Taliesin: We put it in the box, contain it.
Sam: Well, wait, open it just a little bit.
Taliesin: All right.
Sam: And then I'm gonna take my Helm of Brilliance and just put one of the diamonds up to the laser beam like light coming out so it makes like a dazzling light across the--
Laura: Wow.
Matt: It's a beautiful prism, which you're able to see in about 40 seconds. (all laugh)
Laura: It's a lot, it's just a lot of spots right now, but I'm sure.
Taliesin: Sorry.
Laura: Eventually. Oh! Pretty. Um, get out. You, not you. If you don't mind.
Sam: I don't at all.
Laura: I mean, of course you can stay--
Taliesin: Get out. It's okay.
Sam: I have a lot of dictation to do.
Taliesin: Out, out, out, out, out.
Laura: (quietly) Hi.
Taliesin: And I boot him out. Oh hi, thank god. And--
Laura: So, Percy.
Taliesin: Yes, dear?
Laura: I've been meaning to bring something up to you.
Taliesin: Yes?
Laura: At the risk of bringing up Scanlan again--
Taliesin: Oh.
Laura: Something I'd rather ignore.
Taliesin: Yes, me too.
Laura: When he left, he said something that caught my ear, which was that he heard. He heard Pike and his daughter, calling to him.
Taliesin: Yes.
Laura: From the other side. Which is strange really, because when I was on the other side, I don't remember hearing anything. What about you?
Taliesin: Okay. I'm gonna sit down and open up a bottle.
Laura: Busting out the Courage again?
Taliesin: The Courage, I think, is long gone at this point.
Matt: Yeah.
Taliesin: I'm going for the Tear whiskey, fuck it Take a swing, and I pass.
Laura: Mm.
Taliesin: I was not in a good place, I was-- what I am choosing to describe as great motivation to live a long life. There was pain and sound and I've tried hard not to think about creating words to articulate it, but it was the feeling of being-- it was not pain without end, it felt like pain that would have an end because eventually there would be nothing left of me. I felt consumed. And yes, I heard. It was the only thing I heard. Yes. I know you well enough to know-- trying not to embarrass you, but--
Laura: All right.
Taliesin: -- yes.
Laura: I'm not embarrassed.
Taliesin: Well, I would've, honestly-- I would've never hoped otherwise. You're far too wonderful for an idiot.
Laura: (laughs)
Taliesin: So (sighs), but I'm more hopeful. I'm not quite as fearful of whether-- I'm worrying less about what may happen when I die again and if I'm going to go back there.
Laura: Well, that's good. I would hope he's not waiting on the other side for you.
Taliesin: I hope not either, and--
Laura: What about when you were killed by Raishan?
Taliesin: That was quick. It was fine, but it was quick, so I'm not sure if that means anything yet. I've overthought this quite a bit and I don't know if you care to hear too many of my fears in this direction, but, I do think about it.
Laura: You can always tell me your fears, Percy.
Taliesin: Where do the people I kill go? I know you don't have an answer, I don't have an answer either, but--
Laura: I don't, I suppose it depends on them, doesn't it?
Taliesin: Does it? Or does it depend on me? Or does it now depend on this thing?
Laura: You don't think they were doomed to suffer the same fate that you were?
Taliesin: Maybe. I don't know, maybe I keep feeding it every time--
Laura: Oh no.
Taliesin: I don't quite know how to find out, other than I had a moment where I thought about shooting someone, bringing them back and asking them.
Laura: (gasps)
Taliesin: There was a moment I thought about shooting someone. Well, if it comes to it, it's something I've had in my back pocket as killing two birds with one stone.
Laura: Maybe we can just try that on someone who we already need to kill.
Taliesin: That's my thought.
Laura: Right.
Taliesin: And, I worry about what all of this is doing to us, but at the same time, I have such faith in-- I have such faith in you and Keyleth, and occasionally Grog, and occasionally your brother.
Laura: (laughs) Are you listening?
Taliesin: (laughs) But I'm starting to wonder if this is what all those heroes I read about when I was young, if this is what they felt, is just a lot of getting very comfortable with not knowing and being nervous and wondering if you're really just the villain of someone else's story.
Laura: I'm sure that's how they feel. No one's ever sure they're doing the right thing.
Taliesin: But I did hear you, sorry to-- I did hear you and sorry that I didn't say.
Laura: No, it's all right. Takes the pressure off, really, knowing that you know.
Taliesin: I treasure every minute, and you remind me to not be so serious.
Laura: Yes. So serious.
Taliesin: I'm not saying that you're not serious but-- (sighs)
Laura: (exasperated voice) You can go play with Tary some more if you like.
Taliesin: I'm done with Tary for the evening.
Laura: Great! Then you can play with me! (all laugh)
Taliesin: And crossing the whiskey off the inventory.
Matt: Off the-- yeah.
Taliesin: (laughs)
Matt: All right, as the evening--
Travis: Amazing.
Matt: -- the evening comes to a close, the next day's journey is met with a coming cloudfront, does not appear to be storm-bearing clouds but the clear skies seem to have come to an end.
Marisha: I'm restless in all of my night's sleep as we get closer.
Matt: Mm-hm. As the next day comes to a close, the sun setting, you hear a call from the top of the crow's nest that shouts out, "Land ho!"
Laura: We go running up.
Matt: You guys all catch up and you can see--
Liam: (quietly) You got this.
Marisha: (groans)
Matt: -- just as the last bit of sunlit glow behind the clouds begins to fade into darkness, you see ahead the gentle shape of islands just breaking the horizon ahead, and one by one, little lights (click click click) coming on.
Marisha: I rush to the bow of the ship.
Matt: As you come up to the bow of the ship, you can see at this point now, Captain Adella is starting to shout off to the side, "Keep it all high!" and is currently moving around and you see there are three guys at the front who all have lanterns out and they're watching the water below and they're shouting out, "Five to the right!" and they're giving different degrees and she's navigating through what looks to be a channel of reefs, as you glance over the edge. And you can see there are pathways here, but it looks like a lot of this water is very dangerous water and eventually you get to a point where one of them shouts, "Stop! Stop!" and they immediately throw down the sails and someone throws the anchor off the side and the ship (crunching) comes and slams to a halt as the anchor clicks and you can feel it grinding for a bit as it catches the edge of one of-- it looks like a reef below, but the ship eventually stops as you glance over, there maybe 15 feet away from hitting the edge of a reef. (grinding sound) It stops and the water (whistling) slowly comes to rest as the ship comes to a rest. Looking over the edge, you can see the water maybe about 20 or so feet down with what little bit of light the lanterns have put over, you can see the very top of various reef cliffs and hints of beach shelf beginning to rise up towards this cluster of almost like still fairy lights in the distance, unmoving. Captain Adella comes up to the edge of the ship and goes, "Well, that's about as far as we can get with this ship. My apologies."
Marisha: No, this is fantastic. And I run to the edge of the ship and I shoot a Daylight into the spell and throw a Create Water and make a rainbow over top of us.
Matt: Wow.
Marisha: (tch boom) Ooh.
Matt: So with that (pffff) the spray of vapor in the air of the night sky, the darkness ahead of you that was currently-- the clouds obscuring any sort of starlight, suddenly is showered with a spray of vibrant colors across the entire spectrum, as the vapor slowly cascades around each side of the ship. As it does, a few moments pass and you watch more lights spark open in the distance (puff puff puff puff puff) whatever the source is, you begin to get a clearer view and there you can just barely begin to see the edges of what appear to be a very, very faint outline of a number of buildings all springing up from the water itself.
Travis: (quietly) Oh shit.
Matt: The city is not on one of the islands, the city is in the center of them, there's a triangulation of these land masses and the city itself resides between all three.
Sam: (quietly) Wow.
Matt: Some of the guys in the front of the ship start taking small rowing boats and taking them up and latching them in and setting them off the side into the more shallow waters below.
Marisha: I run past all of them and just jump into the water, not gracefully like before and start swimming.
Matt: Make a perception check. (all groan)
Laura: Oh no.
Marisha: Perception check?
Matt: Yes.
Laura: We're at a reef!
Liam: Don't face-plant on a reef!
Marisha: Fine. Ooh!
Taliesin: There is now!
Liam: I'm on a reef.
Marisha: Oh that's just a dexterity check?
Matt: No, perception.
Sam: Perception.
Marisha: Oh, perception. 28.
Matt: You run to the edge and right as you're about to leap, you look and realize there's relatively shallow reef in the direction you're about to leap, so you kinda turn and (laughs) go at an angle instead and (plop) into the water below.
Marisha: (nervous sounds)
Matt: A second, almost a second after you, the ship (cracks) hits the water below and they start throwing down the rope ladder and you guys are allowed to then step into the rowboat.
Laura: Broom.
Taliesin: Carpet?
Matt: You have the broom. Or carpet if you like?
Marisha: I just start--
Taliesin: I'm gonna get on the carpet and offer it to anybody who likes.
Marisha: Using my cantrips--
Travis: Well, I need the boat 'cause I'm heavy.
Taliesin: What about the boat?
Sam: I want to be on the flying carpet, 'cause that's amazing.
Laura: Trinket will get in a boat with Grog.
Liam: What are you doing?
Laura: No! Trinket's gonna be in my necklace.
Matt: All right. Trinket goes in the necklace.
Laura: Yeah, for a minute.
Liam: Hopping on behind my sister.
Matt: Okay, so your sister, you guys are taking the carpet--
Sam: Yes!
Matt: -- Grog, you're going in the boat?
Travis: I got my own rowboat.
Matt: (laughs)
Taliesin: With a robot. Robot in the--
Sam: Oh yeah! The robot is--
Travis: No. Dottie is not coming with me.
Taliesin: Dottie is coming with you.
Sam: Well, he can come on the--
Laura: No, he can't. It's too heavy. It's too heavy for the carpet.
Taliesin: Doty cannot come on the carpet.
Matt: It's too heavy to go on the carpet.
Sam: I have to stay behind with Doty.
Taliesin: Yeah well, have fun.
Travis: Yep, see you later.
Laura: Get him on a boat. Get on a boat, Tary.
Sam: Is there another rowboat for us?
Matt: They have other rowboats on the side, you can request another one.
Sam: I would like to request another rowboat for Doty.
Marisha: (laughing) A boat for Doty.
Matt: Okay, so as you guys begin making your way, roughly five minutes behind you, as you all are kinda moving forward together via carpet, flight, and her swimming, and Grog strongly pushing his way through, Tary's just impatiently waiting for them to get the other boat off the side of the ship and they're slowly lowering it down, kind of the ropes having to adjust as it goes and you're like (groans). (all laugh)
Travis: I see adventure over this way! Too bad you won't be there to see it!
Sam: I'm missing it, hurry up! (all laugh)
Matt: As you guys begin to approach, Keyleth, your feet eventually hit sand as opposed to treading water, and as you begin to walk up, the water comes past your waist, down to eventually your knees, and that is about as low as it goes.
Marisha: As far as it goes, yeah.
Matt: And looking out above you, you can see this beautiful lagoon that is completely submerged in about a foot, foot and a half of water for a good mile in all directions. And you can see dozens and dozens of these Grecian looking white and green marble structures that rise up out of the water. You can see a series of poles that stand up holding these lanterns that have all been magically set alight to give the city a sort of a glow. You see shapes moving, you see figures shifting out of these buildings and making their way in your direction, and as you're looking at this space in front of you and you guys begin to kind of meet up, you watch as a figure (whoosh) out of the water next to Keyleth. You glance to your left and look down and you see what appears to be a child, maybe about 13 years old, human-like, though his ears come to a bit of a finned appearance. You can see what looks to be gill slits to the side of the neck, and he looks up at you with kind of a tattered, long-stiffened piece of cloth tunic and shorts that end at the knee,and he kinda looks up at you and just kinda smiles with these very, very bright, orange-ish yellow eyes, "Hi."
Marisha: Kaitiaki. And I drop to my knees and drop down and--
Matt: (sploosh) You go face-down into the water.
Marisha: Gah! (heavy breathing)
Matt: Get up and (groans) push the water-- the hair back a bit.
Marisha: And bow again.
Laura: (laughs)
Matt: Okay. "Um... what are you doing?"
Marisha: Sorry, are you the leader-- are you the headmaster?
Matt: "Yes. Yes, I am."
Marisha: Oh! Hi. Uh, Keyleth.
Matt: "Keyleth. " And he reaches out and grabs your hand. "Yulan."
Marisha: Yulan!
Matt: "Leader of the Water Ashari."
Sam: (laughs)
Marisha: I am Keyleth, daughter of Vilya and Korren of the Air Ashari, and I am here to complete my Aramente. And I bow again, under the water.
Matt: (splash) Into the water again.
Marisha: (gasps)
Matt: He shakes his head, you can see now he has these tossed medium-length dreadlocks that shake with his head as he turns side to side, (laughs) He looks up at the rest of you, "So! She yours?"
Laura: Mm. Mm-hm.
Taliesin: More or less.
Matt: "You bad people?"
Laura: Uh-uh.
Taliesin: Nah.
Travis: Not today.
Sam: We're just rowing up. What'd I miss?! Start over, start over! (pants)
Matt: "Is he a bad person?"
Laura: Nah.
Liam: Nah. He's all right.
Taliesin: He's workable.
Matt: "Okay. Well, come with me." And he reaches out and taps you on the shoulder, Keyleth.
Marisha: (gasp) It's just such an honor.
Matt: Come on.
Laura: Keyleth!
Marisha: What?
Matt: He grabs your hand and pulls you up out of the water, and starts running in towards the city, holding you behind him. Just kinda tugging you by the hand.
Laura: Oh, he has legs?
Matt: He does have legs.
Laura: Man!
Taliesin: And he does know how to use them.
Travis: Keyleth!
Sam: (laughs)
Matt: Splash, splash, splash splash splash splash...
Travis: Be cooler.
Marisha: Cooler. Cooler. (blows) And I let a little frost go from my breath.
Matt: (blows) Okay. Splash, splash, splash splash splash splash splash. He's just running through the water. You can see a number of people have now stepped out of the buildings as you guys approach. And each one of them-- all of their clothing ends at the knee. You can see that this entire society walks through and lives partially submerged. There is an ever-present water element to their day to day life.
Laura: They must have the pruniest feet!
Marisha: -- feet.
Matt: (laughs)
Marisha: I know, right?
Liam: (laughs)
Matt: (laughs)
Travis: That was amazing. I would live there in a second!
Taliesin: How did that happen just now? How did you just go there?
Laura: (laughs)
Matt: The sand is soft and still strangely warm beneath your feet, though the night has come. And even through the distant sparkles of light everywhere, this city-- a lot of the buildings seem hollow and open, like what walls that there are, there's large windows. It seems like everything has this very kind of open-air, free lifestyle to it. And as you begin to approach--
Marisha: As he's dragging me, I just start, like, rambling all the questions at once. I'm like, Aren't-- This is such a gorgeous city you have. Are you freshwater or saltwater? Do you have webbed feet? Does everyone have webbed feet? How many people can control water? Wow, look at that. Look at those. Is this fire that you use? Or is it all arcane?
Matt: He's not answering any of your questions, and you hear a voice shout out: "Yulan!"
Marisha: (gasps)
Matt: And the boy kinda stops and drops your hand and backs away with his hands kinda crossed behind his back, and he steps away, bowing his head a little bit and (splashing noise) away. The crowd-- and you can now see, all these different people, most of them appear to be human, elven, there are a handful of dwarves, a couple halflings, it's a spread of races here. You see two half-orcs that have these large tridents off to the side, and they're guarded but they're all deciding whether or not this is a welcoming circumstance, or a careful parlay. The voice that rang out, the crowd parts a little bit, and you watch as the water around you guys begins to spiral into these columns. Each one appears to be similar to the entity you saw rise onto the ship. A series of water elementals begin to rise out of the water, as some of the individuals in the crowd pull their hands together, and then you see four of them rise and begin to circle. Not closing in, but just keeping very close vigil around. And you realize at this point that, while the city is welcoming, they are also a carefully guarded people. The crowd parts, and you see stepping out, with the tiniest of splashes, a very tiny woman. Old, shriveled, most of her hair is gone and these thin wisps of white and gray, a wide oval-like head, the skin itself an olive yellow tint. Very wrinkled and pruny, the eyes are almost these tiny little black beads. Gnome, very old, with a long staff that's twice her height that just kinda with each step (squishing splash) kinda like a weird female Water Ashari Yoda. And just kinda steps forward through the water--
Marisha: Rad!
Matt: "Yulan, you are not to greet our guests! Now, you. What is your name?"
Marisha: Hi. (clears throat) Kaitiaki, I am Keyleth, daughter of Vilya and Korren of the Air Ashari, and I am here to complete my Aramente. I am--
Matt: "Kaitiaki."
Marisha: Kaitiaki. I am honored to be in your presence.
Matt: "I am Uvenda, Heart of the Tides here. I had my own Aramente, long ago. And I knew your mother who came for her Aramente, as well."
Marisha: You knew my mother?
Matt: "She came here for her own Aramente. And now you come to complete what she could not. So--"
Marisha: I'm-- I'm--
Matt: "-- you are welcome, Keyleth of the Zephra."
Marisha: I'm sorry. I'm-- sorry, that just means she visited the Earth, and the Fire, and the Water Ashari. She completed her Aramente.
Matt: "She did not, child."
Marisha: What hap-- She-- I-- Everywhere I've been, she's been. Why not?
Matt: "Come. Come. We shall speak, there is much to discuss, and it is growing cold out here, and you could probably all use a warm fire. So? See to our guests!" And the folks around go from their tense reverie and begin to approach and take, like just instinctually taking your belongings, and helping you unload. You guys (laughs) withdraw, and they back off as soon as they realize that wasn't part of the circumstance. But you are led deeper into this city, and there is a central temple that has multi-layers. Three floors with a number of spiral staircases on the outside of the structure that lead to it. Each floor is still very open and you get the sense that this whole city is built around the flow of ocean air and sea spray. And there is almost like a constant breeze that just blows through. And a lot of the buildings are rounded at the edges. The heavy waves and water that just come through here has-- you can see rounded and brought curvature to all the structures for as long as the city's been around. There are elements of shell-type shapes, there are bits of ocean inspiration to the architecture, it's a very interesting, alien, and beautiful place compared to where you've been before. You're led into this temple structure in the center of this city, you're brought to a series of what look almost like tree stumps, but they're made of a bright, bleached white, almost spongy material. And as you sit on them, food is brought to you, fish, fresh cooked platters. You guys are now being treated like honored guests, as you arrive. As you sit down, Keyleth, Uvenda, has a servant bring a much taller sponged stool than the ones you guys have, and it's set in front of you, and she uses her staff and (grunts) pole-vaults on top of it, and sits, crosses her legs, and sets the staff off to somebody and kinda leans down with her hands in front, her chin resting on them, her little beady gnomish eyes looking down at you. "So, Keyleth, the Aramente is not easy."
Marisha: I know.
Matt: "Do you know what this leg of your journey entails?"
Marisha: I mean, I've made it this far. In my heart, I feel like I'm almost complete, but I feel like you're about to tell me something different.
Matt: "You are near the completion of the Aramente, this is true, and through this, you will learn the strength of utilizing your own capabilities and those of your trusted allies. You will learn various ways of looking at the difficulties and challenges that are before you. And there are lessons as part of this, so listen carefully. For the final leg of your Aramente, we will wait 'til the morning sun comes to these waters, you and your compatriots will be brought down below the waves, below this city, to the Aerie of Torrent, where the Vesrah rift resides to the Water Elemental Plane. The Aerie is where we implant the lodestones that keep the village from sinking, and the rift size contained. The lodestones, unfortunately, do wane in power over time, so we must occasionally cross into the rift, and have our fastest Waverunners recover replacements within the Elemental Plane. The source of the lodestones, in which we have built and maintained this city. But the once-challenging path to these lodestones has now become deadly for all but our swiftest."
Marisha: Why?
Matt: "We would find these stones sparsely scattered throughout the plane, just beyond the rift, leaving us uncertain of their origin for as long as we've been here. For generations, they would just fall and sink to the bottom, or we'd scavenge them from the silt and sand below. However, this last generation of Waverunners have discovered them to be a product. Natural waste of a particular creature that resides within the boundless oceans of the plane. An ancient beast, once guided upon creation by the Titans that claimed this world their own before the gods came and gave light to our souls."
Marisha: What's it called?
Matt: "They are known in many languages, by many names, but the common tongue knows to them as the krakens."
Laura: (yells)
Marisha: (yells)
Sam: (scared panting)
Travis: (excited hyperventilation)
Matt: "Humongous, tentacled beasts, long free of their servitude from their creators. One of these such krakens has taken to the waters near the rift, and made it its home on the other side. And this beast appears to have been producing the lodestones that we relied on for ages. This research, and information they've gathered, however, garnished the attention of this terrible fiend, and was accidentally led directly to the rift where it now nests, and feeds on the other creatures naturally drawn to the energy of the tear between the worlds. We now use the lodestones and our powers not only to control the merging of the planes at the rift, but to also prevent this monstrosity from crossing over into our world and tearing our city asunder. Your task--"
Marisha: So--
Matt: She puts a finger out to stop you. "--would be to descend into this Aerie of Torrent, enter the rift, and recover three of these lodestones, and return to us. That is all. Avoid the beast if possible, for to battle it is folly, and to kill it is to sink our city, and curse the rift, to eventually fade."
Marisha: So, don't kill it?
Laura: Do. Not. Kill. Got it.
Marisha: Don't kill the kraken. Right? Don't kill the kraken?
Travis: No, kill the kraken.
Laura: (laughs)
Liam: Get kraken.
Sam: We can reason with it.
Marisha: Get three lodestones, bring it back, don't kill him because he is responsible for you guys not sinking into the ocean.
Laura: Because he makes the lodestones.
Sam: With his poop?
Liam: Poopstones.
Marisha: He makes the lodestones--
Laura: Basically.
Sam: Poops lodestones.
Marisha: -- with his droppings?
Matt: "Essentially, yes." (all laugh)
Marisha: All right.
Matt: "To use such base terms."
Marisha: All right. So he drops these lodestones at the base of the water plane.
Matt: "Yes. Often found within the vicinity of the rift, but such is the beast. Be quick, be careful, be stealthy, and return as soon as you have them."
Marisha: Do you have an example of these lodestones so that we know what we're looking for?
Matt: "We will show you at the Aerie tomorrow in the morning."
Marisha: All right. So this starts in the morn-- Which is exactly what you said. You totally said that, didn't you?
Matt: "Yes. Yes, I have."
Marisha: All right.
Laura: Is there something that helps those of us who don't breathe underwater breathe underwater?
Marisha: I can handle that.
Laura: Yes?
Marisha: I can handle that. So. What happened to my mother?
Matt: She swallows strongly. "Your mother was a brave woman, very much like you, now that I see you before me. Unsure of herself, and wishing to please, and not disappoint. And it's hard to ascertain but I fear it's perhaps that lack of confidence that may have caused her failure."
Marisha: Did she not make it out? Of the water plane?
Matt: "She brought her own companions, that she had found and brought with her along her path. Our guides brought her to the rift, and her companions did not survive. Your mother did not return, and we sent scouts to try and retrieve her body so she could be interred correctly, but we only found a leg."
Marisha: She's still alive. That means she's still alive.
Matt: "Hold onto that hope. Use it, and finish what she started. She lives through you at the very least. Hold that memory."
Marisha: I will hold on to it, but I hope you know that does not define me. I'm not her.
Matt: "Good. Then perhaps you have a chance."
Marisha: We'll complete your task. Thank you.
Matt: "You've come far, young Keyleth. I have faith that you will rise, and become the Voice of the Tempest. For now, we rest. Eat. Sleep. For tomorrow, you face the pet of the Titans." And that's where we'll leave tonight's session.
Travis: Yeah!
Sam: (scared panting)
Travis: We're gonna kill a kraken!
Marisha: No!
Liam: No!
Laura: No!
Marisha: Kill a kraken!
Sam: No, don't kill a kraken.
Marisha: Right, we're not gonna kill a kraken.
Matt: (laughs)
Marisha: We are going to not kill it.
Taliesin: We are going to irritate a kraken.
Laura: We are going to--
Taliesin: We are going to make it--
Travis: Holy shit!
Laura: -- We're going to steal some kraken's poop.
Travis: I have no idea what that means.
Marisha: We're gonna collect kraken droppings.
Travis: I don't know what a kraken is like in D&D, but I'm fucking stoked to find out.
Taliesin: We're gonna bring a bottle of Kraken.
Marisha: We're gonna bring a bottle of Kraken.
Laura: (laughs)
Marisha: Oh, I'm so gonna bring a bottle of Kraken next game!
Matt: Yeah!
Laura: (excited shouting)
Taliesin: You know what else we're gonna do? We're not gonna finish it.
Marisha: We're not gonna finish it.
Matt: (laughs)
Travis: Yeah, we're not gonna finish it.
Marisha: That's game, we do not finish it.
Matt: That's kind of perfect.
Laura: We're gonna drink most of it.
Liam: (chuckles)
Taliesin: We're gonna drink most of it, but we're not gonna kill the kraken.
Marisha: Except for like one-fourth of it.
Laura: Yeah. TALIESIN. Don't. 'Cause we don't kill the kraken.
Marisha: We let it live.
Liam: We're gonna give that thing some maylox. (proot fart sound)
Taliesin: Don't kill the kraken.
Travis: Nice job, Matt!
Matt: Nice job, you guys.
Travis: Nice C!
Taliesin: Good game. Good game.
Laura: C!
Matt: All right. We'll bring this up next week on Thursday for the last leg of Keyleth's Aramente--
Sam: Hey.
Matt: -- as the party might face a kraken!
Laura: Oh my goodness!
Matt: That'll be interesting.
Liam: One of 17.
Matt: (laughs)
Travis: Yo momma is the kraken.
Marisha: That's what I'm most afraid of!
Laura: Oh my god!
Marisha: I've already thought about it.
Taliesin: Long John Silver!
Travis: Wow. No, no, no, no.
Marisha: That she's the full Long John Silver.
Taliesin: She's gonna go pirate, she's gonna have a patch and a beard--
Marisha: And a peg leg!
Taliesin: -- and a peg leg.
Marisha: She totally has a peg leg.
Laura: Ew.
Taliesin: And like a little cuttlefish instead of a instead of a parrot.
Marisha: (gasps)
Laura: Rad!
Marisha: My mom's a pirate!
Laura: Definitely.
Liam: (singing)
Taliesin: (joins singing)
Marisha: (joins singing)
Sam: That is not the key at all.
Travis: Oh god, get us out of here.
Taliesin: No.
Matt: All righty, guys. (all laugh)
Matt: We'll pick up next week on Thursday. (laughs) Thank you so much for watching. Thank you again, Tor Books, for sponsoring.
Sam: (incoherent background noise) Tor Books, toy boats, Tor Books.
Liam: Tor Books.
Matt: Wyrmwood for being awesome. We're gonna go ahead and rest. Oh, I forgot to mention. I will be on the Rollplay live anniversary game on Saturday. I'm actually flying up to Canada to go play with them in person. So-- (all cheer)
Matt: I'm gonna be jumping in for one episode of the Swan Song series.
Travis: Are you gonna play?
Matt: That will be fun. Yeah! I get to play!
Sam: In Canada?
Liam: In Canada?
Matt: Up in Canada, yeah.
Sam: Each d20 is actually worth 22 up there. (all laugh)
Taliesin: Is that where you have to roll backwards?
Sam: Yeah.
Taliesin: You roll backwards there?
Matt: Yeah, that's how it works.
Marisha: And, as always, don't forget to watch Talks Machina on Tuesday--
Laura: On Tuesday!
Matt: With Brian.
Marisha: With Brian Foster!
Matt: That will be fun.
Marisha: At 7pm.
Liam: Matt's always talking about his campaign up in Canada, I'm not sure if it's real or not. (all laugh)
Marisha: What are you talking about, guys?
Matt: It is real!
Marisha: This is fine.
Matt: It's real!
Laura: Totally real.
Marisha: This is great!
Matt: Anyway. Have a wonderful night, guys. Rest well. Laura, get up early.
Laura: I know!
Matt: I'm sorry. Is it Thursday yet?

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons and Dragons.
Travis: That's what we do!
Matt: Yep! So, welcome. We had a brief break last week as Liam brought us through his delightfully dark and twisted mind. Thank you again, Liam, for running that.
Laura: Creepy!
Liam: I went to Catholic school!
Matt: It was awesome.
Marisha: Why am I not surprised?
Matt: So, anyway, glad you could join us. Before we jump into tonight's game, we have some quick announcements to make. First and foremost, you want to talk about some new merch stuff that just got in there? What the hell you've got right there?
Marisha: What's that?
Ashley: What are these?
Laura: What are these? These shirts are in the store right now! And the color, and they're so soft, I'll be petting you guys throughout the whole night.
Liam: They're soft like the hoodie. They're like a thin version of the soft hoodie.
Laura: If you have the Gilmore shirt, it feels like the Gilmore shirt. Also, the Critical Role dice are coming back in stock very soon, but they are on preorder right now in the store. You can go in and get on that. We also have the CR enamel pin back in stock, so you can check that shit out in the store right now. We'll wait.
Matt: Awesome. Let's see. There's a new Signal Boost coming out this week with kind of a cool person who hosted that. Who's that?
Travis: DM O'Drien!
Liam: I am not cool, so you are not talking about me.
Marisha: It's actually going to play during the break.
Liam: Oh yeah?
Marisha: Yeah!
Liam: So you can hear about all my artsy-fartsy theatrical sad hangups from the past? Oh joy, guys!
Marisha: Yeah, yeah! You'll like it! So stick around!
Matt: Look forward to that. And also, a reminder that MomoCon's coming up, end of next month, where Taliesin, Marisha and I will be guests and, as of recently, our good friend Brian Wayne Foster will also be joining us for a Talks Machina live panel at the event, which will be fun.
Matt: MomoCon!
Liam: Yeah, MomoCon is just fun to say. MomoCon.
Laura: We're all going to say it.
Matt: Yeah. So we'll be there, it'll be fun. It's May 25th to the 28th, in Atlanta, Georgia. Look forward to seeing you guys there.
Liam: Oh my gosh, oh my gosh!
Laura: Oh my, what? How? Why? (laughter)
Sam: It's the start of a new year.
Travis: Why doesn't it wrap around to the back?
Sam: I tried to get the eyes on my nipples.
Travis: Pull it down a little bit. Just give it a little tug. There it is.
Laura: I've never realized how large-- Wow, it's bulging. Those are some bulging eye sausages if I've ever seen them.
Matt: What's great is when you're not stretching it, it looks like that dumb FaceApp thing now where you can see your older version of yourself.
Laura: Have you noticed, the guys turn into girls so much better than the girls turn into guys? I mean, we look so terrible turning into--
Matt: I've seen some girl photos that turned out pretty good. Maybe it's just you guys.
Laura: You have to have your hair pulled back.
Matt: It might just be the three of you, I'm sorry. Although who did Ashley end up looking like?
Marisha: Haley Joel Osment.
Matt: Yeah, that worked out pretty well.
Ashley: Actually, a lot of people tell me that I look like him anyway.
Laura: Really?
Ashley: Him or-- I get--
Travis: Brad Pitt?
Laura: Yeah, definitely Brad Pitt.
Ashley: From the '80s band, it's a guy.
Travis: Keep going.
Ashley: Justin George?
Liam: Narrowed it down. Hum a melody.
Ashley: I can't think of a song. I'll think of it.
Liam: This is the whole episode.
Laura: And she'll just yell it out during the break. Travis makes a really ugly woman, though. I turned one of your pictures into a girl. I never should have done that.
Matt: I don't agree with that. I've seen Nip Tuck.
Travis: Thank you, Matt! Thank you.
Matt: A supportive significant other. Wednesday Club, Taliesin! Do you want to talk about Wednesday Club?
Taliesin: Actually, this one, it's going to be Matt Key is taking the reins on this one, so I don't even-- I'm not sure he's settled on what's going on, but I think we were talking about maybe Brian K. Vaughan and looking at his whole body of work, which would be a lot of fun.
Matt: There you go, that'll be fun.
Taliesin: TV writer and comic book writer. Could be cool.
Matt: Fantastic. And of course we have Talks Machina next Tuesday, live here on Twitch and Alpha at 7PM Pacific with our wonderful host, Brian Wayne Foster.
Travis: Except there won't be one.
Matt: Oh wait, there won't be one this week! Never mind, 'cause they're going to be on vacation.
Travis: 'Cause you're going out of the country. They're going to-- Where are you going, the North Pole?
Ashley: I wish we were going to the North Pole. We are going to Mexico!
Matt: Let's be nice and vague. Going to a place that's pretty.
Ashley: We're going to a place.
Matt: Which, as a note, as far as Brian was saying, you guys really haven't had a vacation together, ever.
Ashley: Never.
Matt: So, super excited that you guys have the chance to do that.
Ashley: We've almost been dating for five years and we've never gone on a vacation together.
Travis: Y'all are dating? (laughter)
Laura: Wait. What?
Matt: Well, that'll be fun. Yeah!
Marisha: Also, your Date with Matt Mercer in a Silk Robe, thanks to Brian Wayne Foster, will be up on YouTube tomorrow at 10AM.
Matt: Ho boy.
Marisha: Is that okay?
Matt: Yeah, it's fine. Prepare for a lot of port drinking.
Ashley: Boy George! Boy George! I get it a lot. I get that.
Laura: What? You don't look like-- With a lot of makeup, maybe?
Matt: Awesome, so tomorrow? All right, for those of you guys who missed it, you'll be able to see it tomorrow. No, that's fine, bring tissues.
Taliesin: That could go a number of ways.
Matt: That it can.
Taliesin: Sorry.
Matt: But no, thank you all. Thank you all who came on Tuesday to chat and talk and create some fun future characters for this storyline in the future, it'll be fun. Anyway, do we have anything else anyone wants to mention, or shall we continue?
Sam: Did you already do the shirts?
Matt: We did the shirts. That is so nightmarish, Sam.
Laura: I love it.
Sam: It's an homage.
Travis: It looks like Mercer's eating the table.
Matt: What I'm looking forward to is the eventuality that you have enough of these shirts that your closet has a section that's just my face.
Sam: Your face, my face.
Matt: Yeah, it's just this face is printed, and just having your wife eventually come up to me and having you go--
Sam: I might have enough that we can all wear one one night. (laughter)
Sam: Let me think on that.
Matt: All righty, then, without further ado, let's jump into tonight's episode of Critical Role. [dramatic music]
Matt: And welcome back, everyone. So, last we left off, Vox Machina, having completed a multitude of various quests over a prolonged period of time, found themselves free of immediate necessity and danger.
Travis: What?
Marisha: Brought peace to the world forever.
Matt: No, that's not true.
Marisha: Nothing bad will ever happen again.
Matt: (laughs) That's not how this works. (laughter)
Sam: Credits.
Matt: So, as the last episode wound down and friendships were strengthened, you all then began to ponder about what you wanted to do with the time before you. And today we return approximately one year after we left off. So, we met earlier this week to discuss this. We went through a various number of things you wanted to accomplish, both as individuals and some of you in groups. So we're going to go ahead and go over those elements for you guys and get everyone up to speed with what exactly has transpired in this year period of time.
Liam: Show and tell!
Matt: So, who would like to begin?
Sam: We're just going to share?
Laura: Just say what we did, what we accomplished?
Liam: Summer vacation!
Matt: Share elements of it, and then some elements will be roleplayed, because that's what I want to do.
Laura: Because that's what I want to do.
Matt: Yeah. So.
Travis: Are you pointing at me? Okay, okay. I'll start.
Matt: All right, so, Grog, what are some of the things you did?
Travis: Because I single-handedly established peace across Exandria, I found myself bored, in need of action. And so I sought out where the fight would now be. I looked for Scanlan a little bit along the way. I didn't find him.
Matt: No, you did not.
Travis: I looked for, like, magical items along the way. I didn't find them. So I went to Vasselheim, which is where the Slayer's Take is. And I think before I left, I wanted to get some personal things, like, done to my body. So I had the bear tattoo that I filleted of off Kevdak, and I had it tanned, and then I got a copy of that tattoo on my back.
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: Because that shit's behind me.
All: Ooh!
Matt: So you now have Kevdak's bear-totem tattoo that was on his chest, now on your back.
Travis: Yep.
Matt: Out of sheer disrespect for him.
Travis: Totes.
Matt: I love it.
Liam: Did you get a bear ass on your bare ass?
Travis: Much better idea. I also took Kevdak's skull, the top of it, and I had a new cup, a new mug made out of it. With metal bits and stuff, with a handle.
Matt: Yeah, yeah. Okay.
Travis: I don't understand how, but it looks really great. It's like metal and bone, and I (drinking sounds). That's me.
Matt: That's delicious.
Travis: I just choked on a peanut.
Laura: Yeah. Oh Grog. I heard it happen.
Travis: So, I went to Vasselheim, and I defended my title in the Crucible.
Matt: Yeah. Met multiple times.
Travis: Multiple times.
Matt: Including once against a familiar individual called Kern the Hammer.
Travis: Kern the Hammer, he came back with that monk shit.
Matt: Yeah. And did not prevail.
Travis: Nope.
Matt: However, he did come back to you, requesting to learn and train under you, to teach him your ways. To which you said--
Travis: I forgot. No. Yes. I said yes.
Matt: You said no.
Travis: I said no. (laughter)
Matt: That's what you told me, at least.
Travis: I said no. I said no, because I was like, you've got to drink, all the time, and this, and he just wasn't up to snuff. That, and I should not be teaching anyone anything. So then I went to the Slayer's Take, right, in search of big game. And I had fun with that for a while, but it just wasn't quite the same. It wasn't crazy-ass, you know, ancient dragons or nothing. It just wasn't quite up to snuff. But I did have my curiosity about the Deck of Many Things piqued. So, at some point along the way, Vex's warnings ringing in my ears, I found a nice drunk sap to--
Matt: So, so, as you are wandering down an evening byway in the Quadroads of Vasselheim, a number of cups in yourself, you hiccup loudly and glance off to the side to find one gentleman who's been far deeper in his cups and is currently trying to steady himself against the stone wall in an alleyway.
Travis: Yup. Hey, you!
Matt: "What?"
Travis: You. You look like a mighty warrior. Do you need another drink?
Matt: "Oh, if you're buying, yeah."
Travis: Yeah, I do. I have one. And I pour him a little bit from the keg. Hey, do you have like, a wife, kids, attachments? Anyone that would miss you?
Matt: "You think if I did I'd be drinking this hard?"
Travis: I'm going to take that as a no. Cool, hey, look, I don't know if you're interested, but I have, in my possession, something really cool. And I take out the Deck. Do you know what this is?
Matt: "I have no idea."
Travis: Great! Great! We're in the street, right?
Matt: Yeah. You're near a thoroughfare and there's a small alley off to the side.
Travis: Good. Follow me into this alley and it'll be a deal. Just follow me over here.
Matt: Make a persuasion check. With advantage, because he's really drunk.
Marisha: For anyone who's watching, this is like, abduction, how to not-- 101, self-defense.
Matt: This is terrible.
Liam: I mean, he's either changing this guy's life for the better, or murdering him.
Travis: 19 plus one.
Matt: (laughs) You watch as in the center of his pupils a little sparkle of interest kicks in. And, I mean, five percent soberer at the prospect of something fun of this stranger that gave him a drink and goes: "Wait, what are you talking about?"
Travis: Well, listen. I am kind of like an evangelical spreader of good news. And I found this. And one time I pulled a card out and I got a magic weapon. It was amazing. And I just figured, like, you look like a guy that would appreciate such a weapon, so--
Matt: (belches)
Travis: -- and I open the Deck. I thought maybe you would like to draw a card.
Matt: He takes a second and looks around. Looks at the Deck. "Is this some sort of a magic trick?"
Travis: Yes. Yep.
Matt: "All right. Do you want me to tell you what it is?"
Travis: Sure. Yeah. Just draw it and-- Actually, just hold it and don't tell me what it is.
Matt: Okay. Let me get my cards out.
Laura: Oh my God.
Ashley: You have an actual set?
Laura: What the actual fuck is happening right now?
Travis: It was a fucking year. Did you not think this was going to happen? (laughter)
Travis: It probably happened in the first week.
Liam: This is the first of ten guys.
Travis: Lot of problems, lot of drinking, lot of fighting. Ran out of shit.
Sam: What if you die? What if you die right now?
Travis: I'm not. He's drawing the card.
Laura: Yeah, but you could still die.
Sam: It could kill-- It could kill you too.
Travis: Could it?
Sam: I think so.
Travis: I'm not really sure on how this shit works. But I need another card to come out of that Deck.
Matt: Yeah, maybe.
Laura: Oh my God. Oh no, what did he pull. What did he pull?
Matt: No. No. No. Huh. I'm going to let somebody else pull this. Who wants to pull it?
Travis: Oh, you raise your hand to pull from the Deck? Thats some bullshit.
Laura: Oh no. Should I turn it?
Travis: Ooh. Ooh.
Laura: Do you know what that is?
Travis: No, I don't remember.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: It's just, it looked ominous.
Travis: It was a face card, though.
Taliesin: It was a face card. Oh. Oh.
Matt: (laughs)
Laura: Oh no. Is it amazing? Did he get something really good?
Taliesin: You're the DM now.
Matt: Hold on. I have to roll a die first. (laughs) He takes the card and looks at it. Turns around and shows you, and it's this tarot card of a beautiful moonscape, with an open night sky. I believe that's what it is. Yeah, that's what it is. He puts it back in the Deck, and is like: "All right, what's the trick? I'm-- I'm feeling a little-- a little strange."
Travis: Could you describe to me how you feel right now?
Matt: And he's like trying to contemplate it. He goes: "Wait a second. I wish that I was a powerful lord of the Quadroads." And there's a strange, tingling visual image as the cloth around him that was tattered and worn-out becomes beautiful silks--
Laura: Oh my God.
Matt: The drunkenness fades from him ever-so-slightly, and now he looks washed. And you glance over at the far end of the alleyway, and there's a guy there who's dressed in long, long tails and a coat and goes: "Sir, how long are you going to be?" He goes: "Right with you. I don't even know what his name is. Well, thank you so much, stranger." And he pats you on the shoulder.
Travis: Grog. Grog.
Matt: "Grog."
Travis: Grog Strongjaw.
Matt: "Grog Strongthings."
Travis: Maker of kings.
Matt: "Great."
Travis: Yup.
Matt: "I still got one more of these." And he walks off and runs off to the carriage.
Laura: He got two wishes?
Matt: 1d3 wishes.
Travis: Are you fucking serious?
Sam: Wait, he got two wishes? You gave away two wishes?
Travis: (shouts) Wait! What was your name?
Matt: The queen of diamonds was the card.
Travis: Did I get his name?
Matt: You didn't get his name. He just runs off.
Taliesin: Lord of the Quadroads, now.
Sam: You just got a cure for cancer, and you gave it away?
Laura: Wait, wait, I have a question. Once a card has been pulled, is it gone from the Deck, or does it go back in?
Liam: Some go back, and some--
Laura: Oh my God.
Travis: I should just pull all of these right now. (groaning)
Travis: I mean, obviously, it was just a little appetizer, the first one.
Matt: Well, let me see here. Let me see. Let me see.
Travis: That is way better.
Taliesin: (laughs) You want to pull another one.
Sam: Matt's verifying.
Laura: Verifying that he did the right thing?
Travis: He's double-checking.
Sam: This is important.
Laura: I know. Yeah.
Matt: Once the card is drawn, it fades from existence.
Taliesin: Oh there's no other-- No, the Wish card goes.
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: The best card is fucking gone. It is the best card, isn't it?
Liam: Now the Deck is slightly shittier.
Sam: Way shittier!
Matt: But you know what?
Travis: You know what? Only one person picked that card from the Deck. So it's not really my fault.
Sam: It's Laura's fault?
Taliesin: Good roll, Laura.
Laura: Thank you, thank you. Hey, man.
Matt: That one's gone, now.
Taliesin: Lord of the Quadroads now owes you a favor.
Laura: Yeah!
Marisha: That's true!
Travis: It was the queen of diamonds, right? Yeah.
Ashley: I say, at the end of all this, we all pick one.
Liam: Who was that man? That was Taliesin Jaffe, Mayor of Ren Faire!
Taliesin: Huzzah!
Ashley: Huzzah!
Laura: What's going on, Matt?
Matt: Just double-checking to make sure the card goes away, and it does, according to how it's written.
Travis: Clearly, nobody in my group knows what they're talking about. This Deck is a mighty gift!
Laura: Fuck.
Taliesin: We're doomed.
Travis: And I put it back in the Bag of Holding.
Matt: Okay. I was like, "Oh god, is he going to draw another card?"
Liam: Two-hour combat scenario.
Travis: I want to, really bad, but I have an open bar tab.
Matt: Okay then! You, in your time away, radically changed some poor man's life! And, apparently, Wished himself to some level of nobility within the Quadroads of Vasselheim, with one Wish still standing!
Laura: That's amazing.
Travis: Okay!
Marisha: Remember that guy.
Travis: Lord of the Crossroads? Quadroads?
Matt: Well, there are many lords and ladies of the Quadroads, he's just now one of them.
Travis: Good deal. That happened.
Matt: I was thinking to myself it was either going to be that or some grim reaper's going to show up and cut his head off.
Travis: That's all I wanted, really. Just cheer him on, maybe have a little better counterweight for my expectation of the Deck, but now I just want to pull one every day. Nothing but good shit happens! Magic weapon! Fucking Wishes!
Matt: So if this happened early in your year, do you still resist the urge as the year progresses?
Laura: Oh no.
Travis: No.
Laura: Oh, Jesus!
Taliesin: Yay!
Matt: How long does it take until the urge creeps up again?
Travis: I mean, oh god, why do I have to be so fucking true to my character?
Taliesin: There's nothing we can do!
Laura: We're not even there!
Liam: Probably thinks he has three birthdays a year, right? So.
Travis: I will probably wait to take it back so that I can open it with my good friend, Pike. Because she'll understand that this is an awesome deck.
Matt: Which actually plays into her opening. The other thing you did, which happens towards the end of the year, is you said you went to the Frostweald.
Travis: I did, yeah. I was curious about the werewolves. So I went to go see the nymph in the frozen lake. You know, the one that's all about Grog.
Matt: Mm-hm.
Travis: So I had a conversation with her, and I felt really bad because I wasn't as affectionate as last time, so I gave her this palm-sized ruby that was at the bottom of the bag. Looked really pretty, so I gave it to her.
Matt: She thanked you.
Travis: She did. We hit it off. And I asked her if the werewolves were just in the Feywild. Turns out--
Matt: Lycanthropy is scattered throughout the planes.
Travis: Well, I didn't fucking know that.
Matt: Now you do. She passed that information on to you. All right. So. That's the truncated example of Grog's year. We might come back to it here in a minute. Next up would be Pike, because that's a good transition point there. So, what'd you do?
Ashley: All right. So I followed, in the beginning-- did the guy pick the Deck in Vasselheim? Or were you--
Matt: It was in Vasselheim.
Travis: It was in Vasselheim.
Ashley: So I went with Grog to Vasselheim. And because I wanted to go and read and work on some things--
Matt: Check in on your temple that you built there.
Ashley: Yes. I ended up fighting (laughs) because I saw him fight, and I was like, oh, I should probably just try it!
Travis: Yeah!
Ashley: And did well.
Matt: Yeah!
Ashley: I'm the second champion under Grog.
Laura: Fuck yes!
Matt: And as everyone was pitting both of you against each other for another championship bout, you both decided to--
Ashley: Do it. No! To fight!
Travis: To kill each other.
Ashley: We didn't end up doing it.
Travis: Nope.
Ashley: We just shook--
Travis: Yep. ASHLEY -- and we knew both of us were just too powerful--
Travis: Too true!
Ashley: -- and I would win. So we just decided not to do it.
Travis: Two monsters of a feather stay in leather.
Ashley: Two monsters of a feather. Also, in that time, which was a five-month period, we had a lot of lessons and taught Grog how to read.
Laura: Yay!
Ashley: Just a little bit.
Travis: Just a little.
Matt: You can slowly read four- to five-letter words.
Marisha: Five-letter words is a big deal!
Laura: That's a big fucking deal.
Matt: He knows how to write his name now.
Laura: Yeah!
Matt: And he can write a full sentence over a short rest.
Travis: Yep. (laughter)
Travis: Meat. Cat.
Liam: Farts. Farts.
Travis: Doody, with a Y.
Marisha: Does he get exhausted from reading?
Matt: We'll cross that bridge when we get to it. (laughter)
Ashley: Wait, what did you ask?
Marisha: If he gets mentally exhausted from reading. Takes a point of exhaustion when he tries to read.
Ashley: I'm so tired!
Travis: I'm tired now!
Ashley: I took some time to learn how to be just a little bit more stealthy.
Laura: Yeah!
Ashley: Just did a little bit of training. Not a ton, but maybe, we'll see. I also went to check on great-great-grandpappy Wilhand to see how he was doing, and he's doing fine. He's older.
Matt: Wilhand. Yeah, he's doing good. The home that was damaged in the Umbrasyl attack on Westruun, your room has been repaired. Though it's taken a little while, because it's mainly just him hiring who he can at the time. But he's doing well. He's "an old gnome, but still kicking around! Still doing his best, still doing his prayers to Sarenrae, glad to see you coming, saying hi."
Ashley: Oh, of course. Always.
Marisha: Does he still have Fassbender?
Ashley: I've totally forgot about Fassbender! Didn't he die?
Laura: No, no, no, we left Fassbender with him.
Ashley: Oh shit, I forgot about Fassbender.
Sam: No, I thought that we lost him in the dragon fight.
Laura: No, no, no, we left him with Wilhand.
Ashley: He's keeping him safe. He probably helped build the house.
Matt: If you ask him about that, ask him where Fassbender is, he's like, "Oh, this nice older fella came by and said it was his property? So I gave it back to him. He seemed very--"
Laura: It was that dick.
Matt: "-- very intent on receiving his property, and I wasn't about to argue."
Ashley: That's okay.
Laura: He was technically his.
Ashley: It was technically his. I also sent a little bit of money to -- I don't know where they are, but I hired somebody to send a letter and some money to some of my family.
Matt: Yeah, some of the Trickfoots.
Ashley: Yeah. And what else? Oh, last, but certainly not least, we opened up a bakery.
Sam: Oh, yeah!
Laura: Yes we did!
Sam: What's it called?
Ashley: It's called-- tell 'em.
Laura: It's called-- well, this was Tary's idea-- it's called the Slayer's Cake.
Ashley: And we have many, many items.
Laura: Delicious Sun Treats.
Ashley: Sun Treats. Bear Claws. Angel Food Cake.
Marisha: Some Tree Bark that Keyleth made.
Ashley: So many treats and treasures.
Sam: Bear Claws?
Marisha: Definitely Bear Claws, yeah. Out of Whitestone, of course.
Laura: Obviously, yeah.
Matt: Bear Claws? Is that it? Did you guys make Bear Claws?
Ashley: So Tary, Keyleth, Vex and I just decided on a drunken evening, we were like, we should open up a bakery!
Laura: Let's just fuckin' do it! (laughter)
Laura: We found this building that was pretty abandoned in Whitestone, we fuckin' put in a bakery.
Marisha: We should just do this tomorrow. We should do it tomorrow.
Matt: Whitestone needs more commerce.
Laura: That's right.
Ashley: It does.
Matt: And there are plenty of vacant buildings that are starting to fill up as people move back in.
Laura: That's why we did it, 'cause we wanted to help the economy.
Marisha: Yeah.
Ashley: Yeah.
Taliesin: Anything to get you out of the wine cellar is such a good idea.
Marisha: Yeah. Plus, small-business tax breaks, it was good all the way around.
Taliesin: You're not getting a tax break.
Marisha: What?
Ashley: I did try looking for Scanlan at one point.
Matt: You did, yeah.
Ashley: But I couldn't find him.
Matt: Yeah. It led you all the way to Emon, I think it was, then it went cold. Yeah.
Ashley: Yeah. Yes. And what was the last thing. Oh, we went to go see--
Matt: We'll get to that.
Ashley: -- something great.
Matt: Yeah, we'll get to that.
Ashley: Yeah. So that's what I did on my year of break.
Matt: All right, who wants to go next?
Sam: Are we going in order, or-- what are we doing?
Laura: I mean, I guess we can, yeah. All right, well, I spent my beginning of the year trying to find the baby of the Grey Render that I sent on its way. Mortally.
Matt: Yes, you discovered that there was an offspring. There was a singular offspring in the Parchwood, not too far from where you saw it emerge in your vision. And upon finally finding it, it was young and defensive and feral and, after--
Laura: Very angry.
Matt: Very angry. And day after day you returned with various foods and meat and trying to connect with it, and did not succeed.
Laura: I did not. I failed miserably.
Liam: So many shit rolls.
Laura: So many shit rolls!
Matt: Yeah. It fled southward into the Parchwood, and while you now have sent your Grey Hunt that is now working below you to keep an eye out for it, it has not been seen since.
Laura: Yes. I am on the lookout in case it comes close to our territory. I want to keep our people safe. But I'm not going to go and try to kill it just for the shits.
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: Yeah. I also built my house!
Matt: Mm-hm.
Laura: Yes! New house, new house! And built up the guard. And I made a nice little animal sanctuary for Trinket, a nice garden area for him to hang out in, and other wildlife should they so desire. Oh, and Tary, Tary moved in.
Sam: I didn't have a place to stay.
Laura: And I have such a large house, you might as well just come and live over here, right?
Sam: Well, I mean, if you'll have me.
Laura: Of course, darling!
Sam: I can sleep on a couch.
Laura: No, no, no, you'll have your own room.
Sam: Excellent, because I don't think I could sleep on a couch. (laughter)
Laura: You're wonderful.
Sam: You're not so bad, either.
Laura: Oh, you! And I became, for Whitestone, the ambassador to Syngorn. So I'm working on making a Teleportation Circle, is that what they're called?
Matt: Yeah. You're having a Teleportation Circle placed within your estate in Whitestone, and at the end of the year it's still two weeks out from creation. So it's going to take a little while longer, but it is in the process.
Laura: Trying to make amends, to make peace with my father, trying to forgive and grow and move on. And while Tary was living in the house--
Sam: Braiding hair.
Laura: Oh my gosh, just doing so many things, we decided to make armor out of Vorugal, so I have new white dragon leather armor that Tary helped me enchant. Actually, that Tary enchanted and I hung out with him, for five months, while he did that.
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: Yeah, that happened. (laughter)
Sam: A lot of hard work, but I learned something from it.
Laura: Yeah, that I'm really good company, basically.
Sam: Yeah, yep. She knows two songs. She sings them all the time. (laughter)
Laura: And Trinket gives amazing massages.
Sam: That's true.
Laura: Yes. I think that's pretty much it, outside of the bakery, which has taken up a lot of time, really.
Matt: Yeah. You did also research some--
Laura: Yes! I spent a fuckton of time! I'm building up my library in the house, so I spent a lot of time researching Orcus and the Raven Queen and learning everything that I can about all of them. All of them.
Matt: All right. And Vax?
Liam: Everything's going to start to get a little intertwined here now.
Matt: Which is why I led it along this way, so, yeah.
Liam: Yeah, yeah. So, overarching theme is, there was a lot of Zephra and chill. (laughter)
Liam: Enjoyed not being on death's door every fucking day and relaxing and being the right hand of the Queen back in Zephra, and--
Marisha: Chief.
Liam: I'm still learning the lingo. Getting to know Korren a bit more. Keyleth helped me-- I let a lot of blood and made a small altar to the Raven Queen in Zephra and it's been all flowered and vined out. And while we spent most of our time-- Oh, tattoos, want to talk tattoos?
Marisha: Yeah, since Keyleth-- the mantle's a little heavy and flashy and a little formal to wear all the time, but wanted something to still represent my chiefdom.
Sam: Did you get antlers tattooed on your face? (laughter)
Matt: Just right there.
Laura: Ooh, that actually could be pretty tight. Like those elves in Dragon Age.
Marisha: Keyleth goes hard, yeah. No, I got the traditional Ashari tattoos of the mantle across her chest and shoulders to mimic that.
Laura: That's super tight.
Liam: We went together. Yours took much longer than mine did. Yeah.
Marisha: It took a while. It's old needle-and-hammer style. All traditional.
Liam: Yeah, and about two-thirds of the way through yours, they started on mine, which is just a pair of antlers on the right bicep here.
Marisha: See, he got the antlers.
Sam: Nice.
Laura: Oh, did you really?
Liam: I did. Not on my face.
Laura: Oh, that's great. That's so cute.
Matt: Right next to the barbed wire.
Liam: Yeah. Keyleth for life. So we spent a lot of time in Zephra, but since have-druid-will-travel, we met up with these two quite a bit. About once a month, we would have three- or four-day weekends. We'd spent time in Whitestone. We went to Vasselheim a lot. The twins spent a lot of time in the library.
Laura: Yes, we did.
Liam: Reading a ton. I spent a lot of time at the Raven Queen's temple, getting to know the people there, getting to know what the hell a cleric or a priest or a paladin of the Raven Queen does, since I didn't really have any time to do that.
Matt: Part of your process there, once you had been fully accepted into the Order there, some of the few responsibilities you had were, you were called whenever relatively important figures in the city had passed away, to go and give rites when they were interred and be present during a number of funerals in there. That was one of the earlier responsibilities that was given to you within Vasselheim while you were there.
Liam: I tried to do a little observing, too, in Zephra as well. I didn't want to interfere with their customs, but it's like working at a funeral home, and over time you just get used to it. A couple of bits and pieces. I saw everybody, really. I went on a man's weekend with Grog and killed things, that was awesome. Talked a lot of shop with Pike. God talk. The girls went off on their own a little bit, so I spent time trying to figure out what it was Percival does in his workshop. He lent me a book about the history of Whitestone.
Taliesin: I did, I also sent you on a tour of the frescoes, it was quite nice.
Liam: It's beautiful, once you're not screaming, running on fire, you can really take in art and pass notes.
Taliesin: It had been years since I'd done it without being on fire, running around. Yes.
Liam: Also tried to locate Dr. Dranzel in an effort to find Scanlan, but was unsuccessful.
Matt: Yes.
Travis: You ate raw meat with me.
Liam: Yeah, and kept it down.
Travis: You did. Like a champ.
Sam: Do you like me? Check this box.
Liam: Are we married? Yes or no. (laughter)
Taliesin: Check one. Carry on, carry on.
Liam: Oh, and last thing, Vex took me to Syngorn on one of her trips. Spent some time with little sis. Not as much time with Dad. Some time with Dad. We're all right.
Laura: Eh, it's whatever.
Liam: It's fine.
Matt: Yeah, you've arranged a respect. There is no familial bond, per se, with him, but a lot of the tension has died away and there is a business, positive interaction.
Laura: Yeah, there's finally this feeling that we don't need-- at least, for me-- his approval anymore, which is very nice.
Matt: No, and he acknowledges that, and he seems both simultaneously proud and sad, almost a mild regret that, perhaps, I think he realizes now what he missed out on.
Laura: How fucking cool we are?
Matt: Kind of.
Sam: Well, you were until that. (laughter)
Laura: Just so fucking cool. Thanks for the note.
Liam: In character, in character. You know, elfs going to elf, and there's no getting around that, so.
Matt: Exactly. All righty, and I think I'm to Marisha as Keyleth. Keyleth, what you got going on?
Marisha: Okay, so once again, lot of intertwining starting to go on. Got our tattoos, took a little bit of time. One of the big things that Keyleth did over the course of the year, which took a massive majority of her time, was she went on a diplomacy mission to all four of the tribes as well as Emon and Whitestone, and with the help of Percy and Tary, we came up with a system that we are calling the Crisis Orbs system, is what you called it? Where we put magical orbs in each of the cities that are basically giant panic beacons. And each city got assigned a separate color, to where if anything goes terribly wrong, someone can hit that beacon and all of the crystals will light up and whoever can respond first will do so.
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: What if some shitty 11-year-old kid just runs up and hits it?
Matt: They are heavily under guard.
Travis: Oh. Smart thinking.
Sam: By a 12-year-old.
Marisha: It's like how calling 911 is illegal. You don't do that. You don't do that..
Taliesin: You're not allowed in that room. (laughs)
Marisha: Yes, 'cause Keyleth does definitely-- Keyleth and a lot of the other Ashari dealt with a little bit of guilt after Cinderking Thordak, and wanted to make sure that if anything tragically goes wrong again, we can potentially be faster to respond. And have allies nearby. So that was a massive part of it. I also went to Whitestone and grabbed a little sprig off of the Sun Tree to propagate one of my own trees back in Vesrah. Spent a lot of time working on my alchemy, in between. I imagine we have would have crafting parties in Whitestone, yeah? And then, you know, I would do some alchemy.
Laura: I made friendship bracelets, she worked on her alchemy. So--
Marisha: Yeah, yeah. It was great. It was great. And he made dragon armor.
Sam: I was just making that fuckin' armor. (laughter)
Laura: It looked so good.
Liam: Girl better appreciate.
Matt: It's not like you have to make the armor, you commission the armor. You enchanted it for five months.
Sam: That's right.
Marisha: Took trips with Vax, and had him as my right-hand man.
Liam: Unnecessary bodyguard, yeah.
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: What's his official title?
Sam: Unnecessary bodyguard. (laughter)
Liam: It's Puddin'.
Matt: Coattails of The Tempest.
Marisha: Sir Vax. The Gothy One.
Sam: Cervix? (laughter)
Matt: Maybe not that one!
Liam: That's Cervex.
Laura: I like it. (laughter)
Matt: And thus, another meme was built. (laughter)
Matt: Okay, and since you were the last of one of the intertwined events, the four of you-- Keyleth, Vax, Vex, and Pike-- all took a specific trip.
Laura: And Tary.
Matt: I'm sorry, Tary came along too. So the five of you guys took a journey into the Feywild in search of the Theatre.
Liam: (sings) The fuckin' Theatre.
Taliesin: It was amazing-- I wasn't there, but it was amazing.
Matt: You weren't there.
Marisha: Such a good show.
Laura: They integrated rap, too. It was like--
Sam: History? Wow.
Laura: Yeah, it was like a whole new way to tell history. It was just so good.
Matt: (laughs) So after searching for a few days, up northward in the forest where you recall seeing portions of the tree-- canopy line shifting and seemingly vanishing and then reappearing, you eventually stumbled upon a large, wooden structure-- circular and tall, almost like a giant crown of wood, it sat there-- and noticed that the mists that hugged the base of this marsh, as it's slowly recovering since Sondur fell. Still thick marshland, but not quite as disgusting and corrupt as it once was. The mists that clouded this area were all gathering towards this wooden structure, and you begin to see shapes in the mist. Heads. Faces. Bodies. And you begin to realize that these were all spirits of the marsh being summoned to this structure. You all went, disguised as various small flying insects-- or beast creatures-- and managed to stealth into the entrance doors, into this mossy marsh-rotted wood structure, and on the inside saw the mist form an audience, within the inside of this Globe Theatre-like structure, upon which the central platform remained. A strange, crystalline spark began to form upon that stage, where a doorway opened and then, stepping from it, a half-dozen elvish-looking figures, though their skin is pale white-gray, their eyes white and iris-less, their limbs lithe and thinner and longer than elves you're used to seeing in your experience. And, while none of you could understand-- or most of you could understand the language except for Keyleth and Taryon, I think it was?
Marisha: No, we were the ones that could.
Matt: Yeah, you guys were the only ones who could understand it because you both knew Sylvan.
Marisha: Correct.
Matt: What you saw was a brilliant three-act performance for the undead spirits of the surrounding marsh. Unaware of the serious danger if any of you had been discovered. (laughs)
Liam: Do tell, Matt.
Laura: Yeah, I know. I want to know.
Matt: No. You don't know.
Liam: Aliens!
Matt: Go back. Go back. However, you watched the performance entirely, did not gather their attention. At which, the entity stepped back into a doorway, and it closed off and you absconded from the Theatre before the rest of the audience could shift its way out and become the mists of the Forests once again.
Liam: This is their most sacred ceremony or something?
Matt: You don't know.
Liam: I don't.
Matt: You only know what they told you.
Taliesin: You only have what I told you later, it's pretty much--
Matt: Yeah. So as you guys returned from this and described your experience to Percy, the only person who really had spent a large portion of his youth researching the Feywild, and having an interest in these Fey creatures and their societies--
Laura: He didn't want to go! Yeah, he had things to copy.
Taliesin: I had things to do, I wasn't entirely clear about what you were planning to do. My god!
Marisha: Sorry.
Taliesin: No, it's great! You didn't die, you weren't kidnapped, your soul wasn't taken, you weren't--
Laura: That could've happened?
Taliesin: Yes, you watched the--
Marisha: The Royal Troupe of the--
Taliesin: Unseelie Court.
Marisha: Unseelie Court.
Taliesin: For god's sakes. Yes, a lot could've happened. They have these little vignettes on occasion that they use to sort of-- it's like a nice little trap. They just like to grab people and use them for various things, no one really knows because no one ever comes back.
Liam: Who are 'they'? The 'Unseelie court'?
Taliesin: They're sort of the shadow court, I suppose. They would be the-- for everything that you saw in the Feywild, they are the thing that the Feywild is a little sketchy about and a little worried about.
Laura: Ooh.
Liam: Well, listen, man. If I can't have the arts in my life, I'd rather be dead.
Taliesin: I respect that. (laughter)
Taliesin: And I'm very impressed. You're going to have to draw everything. You're going to have to draw everything. It's very important.
Liam: They looked like Slendermen.
Taliesin: I don't know what that means.
Laura: Very tall and slender.
Sam: They kept singing about a Technicolor Dreamcoat. (laughter)
Taliesin: I have a book about that. (laughter)
Matt: All right. So. Your adventure to finally find the Theatre, complete. I believe that concludes your immediate ventures. Percival.
Taliesin: I had the least vacation-y of anybody's vacation.
Matt: Of course you did.
Taliesin: 'Cause I have technically been on vacation for many, many years. I finally took the mantle of responsibility for not necessarily-- I'm not ruling Whitestone, that's not how it works, but I did take on a lot of the civic responsibility.
Matt: Yeah, you guys converted into the Chamber of Whitestone.
Taliesin: Yes.
Matt: Which is less of a singular family ruling and more of a small series of offices held by Lords or Ladies.
Taliesin: I hired someone to help run the-- my workshop.
Sam: I was doing a lot of work. (laughter)
Sam: Mornings at the bakery-- (laughter)
Sam: -- afternoons at the workshop, and then an hour and a half every night enchanting it.
Laura: Yeah.
Taliesin: And then we drink.
Sam: Yeah.
Laura: But didn't it feel good, Tary, to get your hands dirty?
Sam: It did. I got this thing on my finger, I was later told that that's what happens when you work with your hands. (laughter)
Sam: It's a blister! Yeah.
Travis: How awful.
Taliesin: So, with the help, I had time to start working on a few projects. I finally made a new pair of glasses. Well, I tried.
Matt: You tried.
Taliesin: To make a new pair of glasses.
Matt: You rolled a one. And then you rolled a two.
Taliesin: And then I rolled again and tried to make a new pair of glasses. And then I realized it's very, very hard to make a pair of glasses when you can't see what you're doing because you don't have a pair of glasses.
Sam: Warby Parker.
Taliesin: So then I actually called Tary and said, please fix these for me. He made very, very nice glasses. I think they have your name inscribed on them, they're really gaudy.
Sam: Rose gold is the best.
Taliesin: White gold. White gold. Please. (laughter)
Taliesin: It's got to match the outfit. I automated the system for making shot and powder for the castle. I created a royal guard that-- and have been training an elite group of soldiers specifically to guard the family and the house. They were the Whitestone Musketeers until Cassandra said that that was silly and so they were called the Riflemen.
Matt: Riflemen of Whitestone.
Taliesin: Yeah, the Riflemen of Whitestone. (whispers) Musketeers. (laughter)
Matt: "I'm sorry, Percy, but no."
Taliesin: No. I get vetoed a lot, these days. (laughter)
Taliesin: I began modernizing the city. I have a wonderful dream of turning Whitestone into a shining beacon on the hill of what the future of mankind could be. And the first order of business, one of two big projects that we've started to bring forth our reputation as this modern city, is we've been running steam pipes from the depths through the main streets so that the snow never needs to be uncovered, so that the streets are always clean, and a few of the major houses can be heated this way during the heavy winters.
Matt: It's a heavy endeavor, it's going to take a while to complete.
Taliesin: It's not completed yet.
Matt: It's begun work.
Taliesin: We're also trying to create some series of illuminations at least within the main castle in case the thing in the basement that we're still working on ever turns on us and suddenly we are un-magiced, which is a constant fear. I've upgraded, with Taryon's help, we've upgraded several of my inventions. I've had a proper sword of my family crest made. I finally got the glove more-or-less working. More working, honestly, but I'll get into that later. I've been desperately trying to get you to stop going out into the woods to stop searching for that bloody thing.
Laura: I've been a bit obsessed, I'm sorry.
Taliesin: That covers quite a bit of it, at this point.
Matt: Yeah. That's pretty much everything you've got here.
Travis: What'd you kill, in the year that you had off?
Sam: Time.
Taliesin: Time, and things in the woods, on occasion. We go hunting. And I've also been training men how to use their guns, so there's been a bit of that.
Travis: Boring.
Matt: All right.
Liam: Did you catch a whiff of Galdrick out in woods?
Laura: I've seen a wolf, out and about, but he seems to do his job well, and I'm not going to stop him.
Taliesin: Technically an honorary member of the Grey Hunt, I'd say.
Laura: Yes, quite.
Matt: All right. And Taryon.
Sam: Well... Taryon had a great year.
Matt: You're such a terrible person.
Sam: You've heard much of what he's done. Mainly just building and working and working and building. And in his spare time, he built and worked on things for himself. Chief among them, Doty! Doty 2.0, take this down.
Matt: "Tary."
Sam: Yes, see?
Travis: Oh he fucking talks!
Sam: A little bit. Doty, how handsome am I?
Matt: "Tary."
Sam: I heard "very". And Doty, what do you say when it's windy outside?
Matt: "Tary."
Sam: It's airy. Right? That's what I heard. Oh no, boo!
Matt: "Tary?"
Sam: Yeah, it is scary. He says a lot of things. It depends on the context, you have to sort of figure out what he's saying. But he can say that, he can say one word. It took a lot of money to do that, but it was worth it. He's also got a couple of upgrades. He's got a waterproof slot for the book inside of him so he can store my book.
Matt: The door itself is also a crest.
Sam: Yes, the crest of Vox Machina, right on his chest, emblazoned there. His arm works a little differently, his right arm, which we might see in some sort of competition at some point. And his left arm, thanks to Percival Fredrickstein von Mussel de something.
Taliesin: Bless you.
Sam: He's got a little hole right here in his hand, that--
Laura: That you... never mind. (laughter)
Travis: That was amazing!
Liam: Our hero!
Taliesin: You're gonna pay for that, oh my God, I can feel the radiation.
Travis: It can't be for anything else. Anything else won't compare. Just change it.
Laura: Just a little hole.
Travis: Itty-bitty little hole.
Liam: How wide is the hole?
Sam: It's got some girth.
Taliesin: Well-machined.
Sam: But it can fire a shot, a bullet shot. I've never used it before, but it can shoot something.
Taliesin: It can.
Matt: Once, and then takes a short rest to reload.
Sam: Yep. And I think that's the major improvements to Doty, other than the speaking and the other stuff. Let's see, what else did I do?
Liam: You told me one other thing. Did that get jettisoned?
Sam: Oh, I also bought him-- I bought a lot of stuff. I'm almost out of money, guys.
Travis: What?
Laura: But you're making some, with the bakery.
Sam: That is not what I would call money.
Taliesin: You are technically a civil servant as well, so you're making money there.
Sam: No, I'm talking about actual money that you can buy things with. I bought Doty a pair of boots.
Matt: Yep.
Sam: The Boots of--
Taliesin: Wow, that's a lot of cards!
Sam: Yeah, I bought a lot of stuff. The Boots of Elvenkind, so he's a little more stealthy when we go around.
Laura: Don't you have those, too?
Sam: I also tinkered with my armor, or did I have it tinkered on?
Matt: You don't know how to make armor, so you had the armor commissioned, using the remains of Vorugal's hide. No, sorry, you have Vorugal-- the remains of Umbrasyl's hide.
Sam: Yes, so I have breastplate armor that has black dragon scales embedded in it, right?
Matt: Yes.
Sam: And it gives me a little more protection against acid, and it also looks cool. A little darker flair. And so I could communicate with them, I built myself a little earring-- it's a little different from yours, it dangles and it's got a nice gem on the end, because if you're going to wear it, at least look good. And also, in my spare time at Vex's house, when she was asleep-- she's a snorer-- sometimes I would be awake and I would examine her broom a bit and decided to make myself one too. (gasping)
Laura: Sneaky sneak!
Travis: You made a broom?
Laura: You know we have a fucking flying carpet?
Sam: Now we have two brooms. We can leave those fuckers in the dust!
Laura: That's pretty fucking cool. (laughter)
Travis: You really have no money left.
Sam: I am out of money. I have a teeny bit left. But I also bought some other things.
Taliesin: He's now going to become Whitestone's FedEx though.
Liam: Are we all getting any prezzies?
Sam: Are you back? You were gone?
Matt: All right, is that the end of that?
Sam: And I wrote. A lot.
Matt: Yes.
Sam: Just a lot of writing, and I'm probably halfway through that book by now.
Matt: Awesome. All right. So as the months go by and you all have your individual adventures, as you converse and talk amongst yourselves, the date of Winter's Crest begins to creep up. Now, Winter's Crest is a day that's really only celebrated in Tal'Dorei proper-- occasionally by people in other places who migrated away from Tal'Dorei, but the event that it's based around, Eravon the Ice Lord, was specific to Tal'Dorei. It's not celebrated everywhere in the world. However, it is coming up, and you all decided to celebrate your Winter's Crest festival this year, not in Tal'Dorei. You all instead made your way towards the Bay of Gifts, in Marquet.
Marisha: Tropical vacation.
Matt: Now, how are you guys getting there? Are you taking a leisurely boat trip? Are you going via trees?
Taliesin: Well, we were leaving from Whitestone, right?
Laura: We were leaving from Whitestone because we'd all gathered there for--
Matt: Oh, that's right, before you even left there, you--
Taliesin: That's right, as you were saying, it is based on that festival, and of course Whitestone has its own paganistic rituals dating back many, many years.
Liam: I've read about them.
Taliesin: Yes, you have now.
Liam: And I will start telling you about it.
Taliesin: I've so many text files to send you, my word. So usually at this time, the winter solstice, especially when we have a new Master or Mistress of the Grey Hunt, there's usually a celebration or a ball, and they're not every single winter's festival, but it does happen, but since this was the first, we decided to have a fancy party. She was bestowed with her crest and otherwise and we all dressed up.
Marisha: Did she get a dope crown?
Taliesin: You don't get a crown, you get a cloak-y thing with a medallion piece.
Marisha: Mantle sisters!
Taliesin: You don't really have to wear it, it's just something you get to own. But I also had a piece of jewelry commissioned for everybody.
Sam: I've already got one.
Matt: Keyleth helped you with this one specifically.
Taliesin: This one specifically, because I had to go find our friend in the Fire Plane.
Matt: Senokir, yeah.
Marisha: That's right, that's right.
Matt: "Very happy to help you."
Marisha: And we inform him that we buried his wife's ashes.
Matt: "And I greatly appreciated you being so honorable."
Marisha: Yes, yes.
Matt: "Thank you."
Marisha: Okay, Percy, do your thing.
Matt: "What do you need from me?"
Taliesin: I have this design, and this requires some gemstones, and I have a limited amount of dragon scales from five dead dragons, and I was curious if you could make a hero's crest that is built around these five dragon scales, so that everyone who helped to slay these dragons will always have a token that proves that they were there and they were one of them. And then I also need one made without the dragon scales as well.
Matt: "Understood. Right away." (laughter)
Matt: "You may leave now."
Marisha: Do we come back in, like, two weeks?
Taliesin: He'll call.
Marisha: He'll call? Okay.
Taliesin: Thank you.
Marisha: Is this like a-- do we wait here?
Taliesin: Goodbye!
Matt: "Goodbye."
Liam: (AOL voice) Goodbye.
Matt: You receive word via imp, strangely enough. Which sets you off for a moment, there. But you are notified of their completion, and they're delivered, finished, by this imp.
Taliesin: They're beautiful, and at the ball, I present all of these to you, and each is just a bit individual. And they are crested in the gems and in the dragon scales to give this color wheel of the red, the white, the blue, the green.
Laura: That's really beautiful.
Taliesin: And there's one that doesn't have the dragon scales, but it's just got this flourish around it, and we give it to Taryon because these are meant to be built upon, as we will build upon ours. Your accomplishments will be built upon yours as well.
Sam: Thank you, Percy. That's very kind.
Travis: Is there a pin?
Liam: Yeah, where are they best affixed to wear our bling?
Taliesin: Anywhere you like.
Liam: Okay.
Travis: I don't wear a shirt, so.
Laura: Just right in your skin, Grog.
Liam: Nipple piercing.
Travis: Right in the nips?
Taliesin: All right. Or you could use it as your piece clasp. You could put it on your-- you could put it anywhere. You could put it on your gauntlet.
Marisha: I use it to affix my mantle.
Matt: There you go. Right in the center of the mantle. Right there.
Taliesin: They're just something so that, in the worst-case scenario, anyone will always know who we are, and we will know each other. It can't be replicated. There's no one else who's made anything like this. There's not enough material to make anything like this.
Laura: Ooh, I want to make mine my hairpiece.
Taliesin: And we've got to figure out how to start putting your accomplishments on yours soon.
Sam: Well, I hope to have an accomplishment to add to it.
Taliesin: You have several already. You defeated a leviathan.
Sam: Sure. I killed a marid, right?
Marisha: You helped me unify the world, globally.
Sam: I mean, go on.
Laura: You're a world-class enchanter.
Sam: Mm-hm, yeah, yeah.
Taliesin: Think of it much like your book.
Sam: Pike, what do you like about me?
Ashley: You are so great at baking.
Sam: My profiteroles are really good.
Travis: Profiteroles?
Ashley: What did we name the profiteroles again?
Sam: I don't think we had a name for them. Profite-roll for initiative?
Liam: Profiterolos!
Taliesin: Profiterolos!
Laura: Oh, that's profiterolos!
Liam: You're fun to fucking drink with.
Sam: Thank you.
Travis: Your money.
Sam: Well, thank you.
Ashley: Your hair is lovely.
Sam: It is, isn't it?
Laura: It's very shiny.
Ashley: You're kind. You're very giving.
Sam: All right, all right. Now I'm embarrassed. But thank you. Thank you. Doty, you got all that?
Matt: "Tary." (laughter)
Travis: Jesus. No! (laughter)
Taliesin: So we just have a wonderful evening where we eat too much, we drink too much, we dance and we all look fabulous.
Laura: Fabulous.
Travis: I'm only wearing the pointy helmet, Percy's ascot, and his glasses.
Matt: And that's it.
Laura: No pants?
Travis: I mean, I always have pants on.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: Not always.
Liam: Also, I am not always wearing the Raven Queen's armor. I'm wearing some of Percival's loaner cast-of-Hamilton clothing right now. I, on the break, built a trapped box to slide under the bed so that I can let my skin breathe at night.
Laura: He doesn't smell as moldy after a year.
Liam: I smell lovely.
Marisha: You know, I've crafted him some oils with some herbs. He's good. I helped him manscape a bit, it's good.
Liam: Barely any hair on this body. (laughter)
Matt: Oh! All right, and as you guys-- the ball is complete, you've all gathered. Your hangovers have faded. You all begin your trek toward the Bay of Gifts.
Taliesin: Yes!
Marisha: Wait, are we sailing or are we bamfing?
Matt: That's up to you guys.
Taliesin: I'd like to sail. I need a vacation.
Travis: (sings) Sailing.
Travis: (sing) Takes me away, to where I've always---
Sam: (sing) Takes me away, to where I've always---
Matt: (sing) Takes me away, to where I've always---
Liam: A little nostalgia in that for you, yeah?
Ashley: Yeah.
Laura: That's right.
Ashley: Because I've sailed there before.
Marisha: And we didn't go sailing with Pike.
Taliesin: Teach us some sailing songs. It will be fun.
Ashley: I'll teach you the ropes. (laughter)
Matt: Bah-derr.
Liam: And show us all the best gifs.
Ashley: Okay. (laughter)
Ashley: I'll show you all the best jifs.
Liam: That's okay too. That's okay too.
Ashley: Okay, just kidding. I don't say that.
Matt: I don't know what those are. All right, so you make your way to Emon, then you charter a ship across the Ozmit Sea and make your way to the continent of Marquet. On the northeast base of the Aggrad Mountains of Marquet, which consume a sizable portion of the continent's north shore, there before you stands, as it comes across the horizon, a brilliant crescent-shaped bay of white sands, glittering clear turquoise-colored waters, and the grandiose port city of Shamal.
Laura: (sings) Shamal. (laughter)
Laura: Sorry.
Travis: Holy crap.
Taliesin: God damn it.
Ashley: Oh, man.
Matt: Hundreds of ships fill the bay, from small fishing vessels to massive cargo ships, bringing an ever-flowing mixture of cultures, goods, and characters from across Exandria to its sunny location. Now, while back home Winter's Crest brings seasonal rain and snow, here in the Bay of Gifts the sky is clear, the water is warm, and the sun is ever-shining throughout the day. The streets of the city are draped in white and gold silks, affixed and framing crossways and street corners between torch posts and buildings. The distant sound of waves and seagulls cawing seems to envelop the city at all hours, occasionally stemmed by the sounds of localized musicians. So as you arrived here about midday or so, you take in the nice salty air into your lungs. You have your belongings, your sacks at your side, the city is bustling. What do you want to do with your vacation?
Laura: Oh. What do we do with a vacation?
Travis: Straight to the house of lady fav-- (laughter)
Taliesin: I don't think I've ever done this before. I'm not entirely sure.
Laura: I think we're supposed to just hang out and lay down in a hut and hang out on the beach.
Sam: We need a place to stay. Right?
Laura: Well, yes.
Sam: Preferably a fancy location.
Liam: As close to the beach as possible.
Taliesin: Oh my God, you've done this before, haven't you?
Sam: We used to summer in warmer climes. That's right. And--
Taliesin: We've never needed you more. (laughter)
Sam: Well, we should get some cabanas. (gasping)
Laura: Yes!
Taliesin: I don't know what that is!
Sam: And some people to wait on us. And we should-- Preferably near water. Swimmable water. And we just relax and tan, and sip mojitos. (laughs) (laughter)
Marisha: Do you have, like, a racial advantage to find a place like this?
Sam: (laughs) Vacations are my favored terrain. (laughter)
Marisha: Teach us your upper-white-male ways!
Taliesin: The blood is blue. (laughter)
Sam: I will certainly be of help. I'm afraid I can't pay for us this vacation.
Taliesin: No-no-no-no-no-no-no.
Laura: This is Vox Machina's vacation.
Sam: All right.
Taliesin: This is a group vacation. This is what this is now.
Sam: Well, let's find a resort of some sort. Or a relaxing spa! Or a---
Travis: Some sandals.
Sam: (laughs) Yeah, sure.
Matt: (laughs) All right. So who's helming this journey here? This search for--
Laura: I'll helm.
Matt: All right, make an investigation check.
Laura: Okay.
Sam: I will help her.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: All right. If you're helping her, that's advantage for her on it, then.
Laura: Oh, ah!
Liam: Oh my gosh!
Laura: Okay, well-- It doesn't matter, I rolled it.
Taliesin: The one that got away.
Laura: (hums) 17.
Matt: 17. Okay. Roughly 20 or so gold later, you find the party affixed with the finest of Marquesian sandals. (laughs) (laughter)
Matt: And come upon a place that was referred to you as Dalen's closet. D-A-L-E-N's Closet. Which doesn't sound majestic, but when you were eventually led to where it resides-- the best way I can describe it? It's a field of beautiful hammocks affixed to various tropical trees and structures that are built out of driftwood.
Marisha: Oh my God.
Matt: Right next to a brilliant bright white sandstone structure that appears to be the actual resort, if you will. It's a wide tavern, single-story. But well-staffed, and not terribly busy. But it seems to be very nice, and akin to some of the best places you've been to in your previous excursions on vacation.
Sam: All right!
Matt: So as you arrive there, you are met with a male, dark-skinned, somewhat balding Marquesian halfling at the front desk who smiles as you approach. He puts out his hands. "Welcome, friends! You are here for a-- I imagine to stay within The Closet?"
Laura: Yes.
Ashley: Yes.
Matt: "Ah, I am Guath, and this is for all of you? I will have to charge for your friend, I am sorry."
Sam: Oh, well, he's not really a person, but--
Matt: "You're lucky I'm not charging twice! He's a very big guy. That goes for that one as well."
Sam: He doesn't eat. So--
Matt: "Then he won't order food! But he's going to sleep somewhere, yes?"
Laura: He doesn't sleep.
Taliesin: He doesn't sleep.
Sam: He doesn't sleep.
Matt: "Well then, is he okay with staying out on the beach?"
Sam: Doty? Are you okay with staying on the beach?
Matt: "Tary?"
Sam: He said very. (laughter)
Matt: "Okay, very well. So that would be ba-da-da-- seven and a half? Seven, we'll go with seven. How long do you plan to stay?"
Liam: A couple of weeks?
Laura: A couple of weeks, a week? Something like that.
Sam: Ten days? Ten days?
Laura: Ten days is really good.
Matt: "Ten days?"
Sam: We'll get bored after eight or nine.
Marisha: Yeah, we might hop around.
Liam: We should be so lucky.
Laura: I know what he's about to do to me right now. I know what Matt's going to do.
Matt: "Let me see here." And he brings up this small abacus and starts doing math really quickly on the side you see. "Nine days, you said?"
Laura: Ten days.
Matt: "Ten days, all right. We'll put that at an even-- with discount for friendships, 1500 gold for the entire stay."
Laura: Oh! Well, seems-- and food is included, I'm assuming.
Matt: (laughs) "Oh, no. I'm sorry."
Laura: Where would we go eat?
Matt: "Well, we have a restaurant within as well, and there are plenty of places to eat around the way. We are happy to bring it to your quarters, but there is a surcharge for it, of course."
Liam: Are you going to do the thing?
Laura: Do what thing, darling?
Liam: Your thing.
Ashley: Do you have any specials?
Liam: The thing you do. (laughter)
Marisha: AAA discounts? (laughter)
Taliesin: Rotary club.
Ashley: AAA discounts, tenth night free situation?
Laura: Friends of J'mon Sa Ord.
Matt: "Uh. We do not run discounts here, unfortunately. We are a very premier establishment here in the Bay of Gifts."
Laura: Of course.
Matt: "So do you wish to stay or not?"
Laura: Well, 1500 gold it is.
Travis: We wish to stay.
Marisha: That's fair.
Taliesin: I think we wish to stay. I think--
Marisha: We never spend money on ourselves.
Sam: Yeah, we never treat ourselves.
Liam: Yeah. Ultimately our time is worth far more than our money, so-- let's just go with that.
Taliesin: That's very fair.
Matt: "All right! Fantastic!" So you pay off the 1500. Mark that off on the party gold. You are given some keys--
Ashley: How about some free drinks?
Matt: (laughs) Make a persuasion check. (laughter)
Taliesin: Wow!
Travis: Getting after it! Wasting no time.
Matt: This is training for your vacation next week.
Ashley: I used to come here on a ship and we used to bring you guys a lot of supplies, so, you know. (gasping)
Taliesin: Natural number.
Travis: Wow.
Ashley: 31.
All: Ooh!
Matt: What is your persuasion?
Ashley: It's 12.
Sam: It is?
Laura: Oh shit.
Sam: Pike!
Travis: Why have we not had fucking Pike do things?
Sam: No shit!
Laura: Oh my gosh!
Ashley: Maybe, how about-- If we don't get free food, what about--
Matt: As you're telling him this he goes, "Well, I--" That's right, because you trained in persuasion as part of the skills feat. That's right.
Liam: All right, all right! (laughs)
Matt: So your charisma is-- Sorry, just making sure on the math on this one. Don't want to get lost. What's your charisma?
Ashley: Two. 14.
Matt: 14. Plus two. Plus-- So it would be plus eight, unless you had something else to add under persuasion. Regardless, you rolled really high. We'll go over the math later.
Ashley: Okay.
Matt: "I don't recognize you, but we've had many travelers and you seem--" He looks over the group a bit, especially the large one. "Free drinks. Why not? I'd be happy to give you this."
Laura: All right, nice, Pike!
Matt: He reaches behind the counter and brings out a couple of these small wooden coins.
Ashley: Tokens!
Matt: He passes them out "All right, that is five, six-- He doesn't drink, you said. So that is just seven. There you go."
Ashley: Thanks!
Sam: We said he didn't eat. He drinks. (laughter)
Matt: "So seven for all of you! Enjoy your stay! If you have any questions, requirements, issues, or anything, anything at all, you let me know. We can provide. Okay!" He gives you your keys, leads you to you guys'-- The rooms are clustered in fours, like a little square. They are all adjacent next to each other in groups of four, so there is two sections you guys are given, in square formation with small pathways, but all the walkways, all the alleys between these all just lead right out onto the beach. There are no solid walls on any of the hallways here, it's just the rooms that are closed off. Everything just goes-- you just step off into the sand.
Laura: This is amazing. I'm already, I'm in love with this place.
Liam: We don't need to go anywhere. This is it.
Matt: All right, so. Anything you guys wish to accomplish specifically while you're here?
Laura: No, just get drunk and hang out on the beach.
Liam: Yeah, I'm already peeling off my shirt.
Laura: Yeah! Roll for fucking putting on swimsuits!
Matt: (laughs) That's great!
Sam: I have a gift to give to Vax! I have a gift to give.
Liam: Oh yeah?
Sam: 'Cause we're in the Bay of Gifts.
Liam: I've got my shirt up around my arms. What's up, buddy? (laughter)
Sam: You know, we haven't talked much over this year since I've been helping your fucking sister.
Liam: Well, my sister has locked you up, it's true.
Sam: But, you know, I've talked to her a lot about how you have this ongoing sort of teasing war with Grog.
Liam: Oh yeah?
Sam: And I have acquired something for you to use in this battle.
Liam: Do tell, motherfucker.
Taliesin: (gasps) No!
Sam: Use it when the time is right.
Taliesin: No! No, you are a sadistic bastard!
Liam: Oh. My. Fucking. God! (laughter)
Liam: Oh my fucking God! I pull him into the tightest hug, and I give him a kiss on his forehead.
Sam: Oh, oh, oh! No! Okay.
Liam: You beautiful fuck! Slap! Let's go get in the fucking water! And I run off towards the beach.
Taliesin: That is the darkest thing I've ever seen. That is amazing.
Matt: (laughter) I think I know what it is. All right, so as you guys shed your armor, shed your weapons, put on your beach-faring clothing, you all one-after-one begin to charge your way down to the white beach sands of the Bay of Gifts just outside of the city itself.
Travis: Are there any pool aerobics? (laughter)
Matt: (laughs) No, but you're welcome to start one.
Travis: No, I'll join the rest.
Laura: Grog! Grog! Lift me like Dirty Dancing! (laughter)
Sam: (sings) Ahh!
Matt: Do you wait until she gets to the water before you do that?
Travis: Nope! (laughter)
Matt: You arc a good 15 feet before you go face-down in the sand.
Laura: Oh shit! You're supposed to hold on, Grog. Never mind.
Travis: Oh, you said lift. I did it. (laughter)
Marisha: Yeah, Keyleth runs out and goes, who wants to go scuba-diving?
Ashley: Ooh!
Marisha: 'Cause I can Water Breathe us, and we can go look at the coral reefs!
Laura: Yay! Let's do it!
Liam: Let's do it! Let's do it!
Marisha: Okay!
Matt: All right.
Marisha: We do that.
Matt: All right. So. (laughter)
Marisha: We do that at some point, throughout the week.
Matt: Through the elements of-- which by the way, we're all discovering here now, all the various relaxation elements of magic in D&D. (laughter)
Matt: Which they don't go into in the Player's Handbook as often.
Liam: Oh yeah.
Matt: (laughs) You guys manage to explore the majority of-- over this journey, and multiple trips-- explore a lot of the underwater portion of the Bay of Gifts, which includes a number of wrecked ships, that have just been storms, this is a very, very prominent bay.
Marisha: It's like the Bermuda Triangle!
Matt: You do run into other individuals that are actually either scavengers or pearl-divers or people that deal with gathering kelp and various other forms of plant life off the ground for food or other purposes. It's a very thriving ecosystem here. The people that live within this bay utilize everything in the vicinity. You see that work here, it's quite fascinating, and you see all walks of life. You all are pale as fuck by comparison to the locals here, who live in the sun most of their life.
Travis: Well, me especially.
Matt: But everyone there is friendly. You're little white-ass beacons underwater.
Laura: Do we see any mermaids?
Matt: There are no mermaids in this bay that you find. Sorry.
Laura: It's okay.
Taliesin: Next vacation.
Marisha: I turn to Pike and Vex and go, hey! Hey! Underwater tea party!
Travis: Nope. Not doing that shit. Not doing that. (laughter)
Ashley: Are you going to join?
Sam: I'm still trying to pressurize. (laughter)
Laura: I want to find pearls!
Taliesin: I'll go diving for pearls! Oh, yes!
Matt: All right. Each of you who wants to go pearl-diving, make an investigation check.
Ashley: I want to.
Liam: I want to go!
Marisha: Can I look for shark's teeth? That's fun! Can I do a nature check?
Travis: I'm building a sand castle while they're doing that.
Laura: Investigation?
Sam: I'll help you with that sand castle.
Travis: Okay.
Liam: 26!
Laura: Oh, that's good!
Taliesin: 21!
Ashley: I got a five. I definitely didn't find a pearl.
Marisha: 17.
Taliesin: 21.
Laura: 22.
Matt: You have no luck under the water, but you do find a couple of shark teeth-- at least they look like shark teeth-- along the sands of the beach that have washed up on the shore.
Marisha: Cool.
Liam: 26. 26.
Matt: You don't, what did you roll again?
Taliesin: 21.
Matt: 21, okay. You do manage to find one pearl, it's small but it's pretty. You manage to find a pretty decent pearl. You're not entirely certain-- make an intelligence check.
Liam: All right, I'm okay at that. Not today, though.
Laura: Are you feeling Lucky?
Liam: I'm not burning Luck on this.
Matt: You've burned it on lesser.
Laura: I know, right?
Liam: I'm not burning it on this. 13.
Matt: 13, okay. You gather the pearl you gathered is worth 150 gold.
Liam: Do you want this? I don't. You can have it.
Matt: There you go.
Laura: I rolled 22, as well.
Matt: You and Percival both find similar pearls. Imperfect, maybe worth ten to 15 gold.
Laura: I don't want to sell it. I just want to have it. It's pink.
Taliesin: I think I know how to pierce them. Lovely.
Matt: And you rolled a five?
Ashley: I rolled a five. I found a boob.
Matt: You found a sea cucumber.
Ashley: Oh.
Taliesin: It's the sea hairs that squirt the ink?
Matt: Not that type. It doesn't seem to have any sort of defense mechanism. It sits there sadly in her grasp.
Liam: By the way, I should probably toss out, because we probably haven't all been half-naked together-- you know this, some of you have, but not all of us together-- I still have this big mark in the middle of my chest. This black, veiny thing.
Matt: It's not like a pulsing tumor, or anything. It's a dark spot that looks like a bruise that never quite went away.
Liam: FYI.
Marisha: Tattoo's looking good, though.
Travis: Tary, do you know what I hear they do on beaches? You bury someone up to their head in sand.
Sam: Do you want me to bury you?
Travis: No, I thought we could bury you. Hold on. And I start doggy digging between my feet. I go into a Rage.
Taliesin: You could walk away right now. He'll never know.
Travis: Big hole right there.
Matt: What you don't notice is another traveling couple that's lying on the beach about 15 to 20 feet away are now completely buried in sand with their drinks.
Travis: I end my Rage. Get in.
Sam: All right, sure. We're friends.
Travis: Yeah, totally friends.
Sam: All right. I'll step into the gigantic hole.
Matt: You step in. Doty watches you get inside, not really having an opinion on this.
Sam: Sure.
Travis: Why didn't you pay for our rooms with all your money?
Sam: I've spent a lot of money.
Travis: How much?
Sam: A lot.
Travis: How much do you have left?
Sam: Not a lot.
Travis: I start filling up the hole. (laughter)
Travis: I stop. Just so his arms are out, like that.
Sam: Oh, this is fun. I should have taken my armor off first. It's chafing me.
Matt: All of you guys are beach-dressed except for Tary!
Sam: I thought this was a formal trip.
Matt: Sand's gotten all in the metal joints and the inside of the armor.
Marisha: You know salt water is bad for the armor, right?
Ashley: You should go change.
Marisha: You should.
Sam: Doty, lift me up, please.
Matt: "Taryon." Puts you down.
Liam: He just evolved.
Laura: Yeah, I know. I feel like he said Taryon.
Matt: Tary. It should have been Tary. Good catch.
Sam: Undress me.
Matt: He pulls off the breastplate, starts taking off the armor pieces. You are now currently down to your skivvies.
Sam: Great.
Travis: Do you want to build a castle?
Sam: Let's build the best castle ever.
Travis: Fucking A, man. Do you know how to do that?
Sam: Do I know how to do that?
Matt: Are you trained in sand castle building?
Sam: I am a tinkerer.
Matt: Yeah, and some of those tools may come in handy. You know what I'm going to do on this?
Sam: Sand castle rolls.
Matt: Yeah, we're making rolls for sand castles.
Travis: No shit? (laughter)
Matt: For this, we'll have a skill test for you, because you are a brute strength individual. This is going to be a dexterity check.
Travis: Okay.
Matt: And you're following his plan.
Sam: I'm going to go to my history knowledge and try to base it on one of the famous castles from my youth, of my land.
Matt: All right, from the Dwendalian Empire.
Sam: From the Truscan Empire.
Matt: Truscan area. I misspoke in an earlier episode. The Dwendalian Empire of King Bertrand Dwendal.
Liam: Everybody looks over and Castle Ravenloft is towering above the beach.
Matt: Exactly, yeah. So, make your dexterity check.
Travis: Four!
Matt: Taryon, go ahead and make your history check.
Sam: 16.
Matt: Great. You get the structure built. You map out the right scale structure of this castle, and you get about three-quarters of the way through before Grog (shifting sand).
Travis: What did you do?
Sam: (sighs) You know, maybe we should have-- you know, let's just try one more time.
Travis: Okay. What did we do wrong the first time?
Sam: Just be very careful, Grog. Because you were backing up and I think you knocked into it a little bit.
Travis: You putting this on me?
Sam: It was probably Doty.
Travis: Probably. Doty, go walk over there.
Matt: "Tary." (impact sounds)
Travis: Oh, he listens to me now?
Matt: He walks over about ten feet.
Sam: All right, let's do one more try.
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: And really put some artistry into this. We want a moat, we want defensive towers. I'm going to put a little alchemic fire in the middle of it, so if anyone gets through the gates, they explode.
Travis: Wow. Dungeons?
Sam: Of course.
Travis: With alligators in the moat?
Sam: Yes.
Travis: Okay.
Sam: Let's do it.
Matt: All right, now make an intelligence check to lay out the design.
Sam: Just straight intelligence?
Matt: Just straight intelligence.
Sam: 13.
Matt: That's still good. It's not a very hard DC. You're structuring a sandcastle. (laughter)
Travis: Come on, Gil. Five.
Laura: Oh no!
Marisha: You're with the worst sandcastle partner.
Matt: This one's bigger. This one's coming along great. You're glad the first one fell over because now this is going to be much better.
Sam: Yes, yeah, this is coming along great.
Matt: (sliding sand)
Sam: God fucking-- Grog! You stepped-- I mean, the central structure held the whole thing! I'm getting a sunburn because we've been here for so--
Travis: I think that was my fault. (laughter)
Sam: (sighs) You know what? Just bury me again. Just do that. Bury me again.
Liam: While that is happening, may I hide Taryon's clothing?
Sam: Aren't you skin-diving?
Liam: Time is loosey-goosey. Aren't we playing Dungeons and Dragons here? It's up to him.
Matt: Make a perception check.
Liam: 23.
Matt: You see the opportunity.
Liam: I'm getting him.
Matt: Make a sleight-of-hand check.
Liam: Sleight-of-hand check? Natural 20!
Matt: A gentle pass by, choosing the right moment in which Grog is involved in rage-burying and Taryon has completely given up on his activities, you manage to scoot through the sand, and moving your hand behind you to hide the trail, you drag his armor off back towards the resort.
Liam: Yoink.
Matt: All righty. As you've been buried now, sufficiently--
Travis: All the way up to the head this time.
Matt: Up to the neck. You feel the sunburn is starting to kick in a bit.
Sam: (sighs) I need that helmet, Doty! My helm, please.
Travis: The giant reflective piece of metal?
Sam: Yeah.
Travis: You're going to cook in that thing.
Matt: "Tary."
Sam: What do you mean, "Tary?" (laughter)
Sam: Where did it go?
Matt: "Tary."
Sam: Don't tell me "Tary!" Your number one job is to take care of me, and your number two job is to take care of my belongings! That stuff is worth more than you!
Matt: "Tary."
Sam: All right, just get me out of the hole.
Matt: (impact noise)
Laura: By your head.
Sam: Ow!
Travis: I hand him a seashell. I'm sorry.
Sam: Let's go find my armor. I'm going to go look around for it.
Matt: Make a survival check, because you're now tracking.
Sam: Survival? Ten.
Matt: Ten.
Sam: Oh, no. That's a four, so that's three. I'm a negative one for survival. I thought it was 11.
Matt: You spend the next hour asking from person to person on these white sands.
Sam: Excuse me, pardon me. Sorry to interrupt your vacation. Have you seen a lot of armor and a big golden helmet? No? Okay.
Taliesin: Does everybody speak Common?
Matt: A lot of people do. This bay, in particular, because this bay is a bastion of trade.
Sam: They're all German tourists.
Matt: Exactly, yeah. It's a Swiss drop area. It's great. But while everyone here, for the most part, speaks Marquesian, a majority speaks some level of Common.
Taliesin: I was just curious if he was walking up to people and they were staring, going "oh no", and walking on.
Matt: There were probably a couple, but they probably understood him, they just didn't respond. Eventually, you find your way to the resort. You're tired and you're sunburned and you're exhausted. You walk out and see him in this state.
Liam: And by the way, I went to the front desk and I asked which room Mr. de Rolo was staying in, because I wanted to put some of his belongings there, and I hid the armor in Percy and Vex's room.
Taliesin: You'd better have been able to actually convince them.
Matt: Which is what I'm about to get to. Make a deception check.
Liam: Sure. Here's where the Luck is. Yeah. Persuasion, you say?
Matt: Deception.
Liam: Deception. That's a 20.
Matt: 20. Okay, it takes a little bit of convincing, but eventually he sends one of the employees to go along with you. They let you into the room.
Liam: And now I'm coming back to the beach.
Matt: Okay, so as you guys come in at the close of the day-- you've been here for a few days as part of your excursion here-- you all come in as you've had enough time in the sun and you probably need to get out for a little bit.
Liam: Tary, come here.
Sam: Yes?
Liam: While you were messing about with Grog, Percy grabbed your shit and hid it.
Sam: Percival?
Liam: Yeah.
Sam: My dear friend?
Liam: He was chortling the whole time.
Sam: I don't believe that he would do such a thing.
Liam: All right. I walk away.
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: Oh god.
Sam: Let's go to Percy's room. I'm going to go knock on his door.
Matt: Are you in your room, currently?
Taliesin: Oh god, no.
Matt: No answer.
Sam: I try the door.
Matt: It's locked.
Sam: Chime of Opening. (laughter)
Sam: Oh, I can open any fucking door.
Taliesin: Yes!
Travis: Where have you been all our campaign?
Marisha: It took us a year.
Liam: You're like a Swiss army knife of fixing all our problems and trolling.
Laura: We have the same room.
Taliesin: Okay.
Matt: Opens up. Quick glance inside, and there's sand scattered all across the ground, and in the far end, right next to the bed, haphazardly jammed underneath, you see your armor and belongings. (laughter)
Sam: We were science bros! How could he? Doty, this calls for revenge. What of his belongings are there?
Matt: Of yours?
Sam: Of his.
Matt: Of Percival's. That would be-- because you didn't bring everything.
Taliesin: My stuff and Vex's stuff.
Matt: Yeah, so pretty much all of Percival and Vex's belongings are within the room.
Taliesin: Here, take a look. Guns, swords, boots.
Sam: What can we do, Doty? What can we do?
Matt: "Tary."
Sam: Good idea, but a little bit too cruel. (laughter)
Liam: "Kill them all, you say?"
Travis: "But they need their skin to live!"
Sam: All right. I'll go to my cloak and tear off the Patch of Two Mastiffs.
Taliesin: Oh no.
Sam: They're two big dogs, right?
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: Yeah, all right. And I'll throw some kibble all over the place and be like, go on, just chew everything up and make a mess and pee wherever you want.
Matt: All right, as you pull the patch and throw it in the room, it glows a bright orange and then flashes and burns into two small coal-like embers that when they slam into the ground, crack and open, and from those two embers you see two full-grown mastiffs. (barking and snorting)
Sam: There's food in there. Eat it all. Scratch through everything you want.
Matt: They both start eating. They go nuts on the place.
Sam: And use this as your latrine as well.
Matt: One of them goes, (sniffs) and just pisses on one of the sacks. You're not quite sure which one it is.
Sam: Good doggy. All right. You're free now. Go away. I don't know.
Matt: Do you leave them in the room?
Sam: Yeah, just stay here, go, whatever you want. I don't know. I feel weird. I don't need a pet right now.
Matt: You leave and close the door behind you? Okay. All right, so you guys meet up again. You get more drinks, you begin to wander the city. Is there anything else you want to do while you're out and about for the afternoon?
Ashley: I want to get my hair braided with beads on the end! (cheering)
Travis: Yeah!
Matt: All righty.
Ashley: And Grog.
Laura: Just the beard?
Travis: Yep.
Matt: All right. You guys ask around about a half an hour or so, and you're led to one location that is windowless and has an open archway door with some fine purple and red silks blocking the entry. As you walk inside, there's one woman who's sitting there, in the process of eating a small bowl of fruit. You see she is a dark-skinned Marquesian, but elf lineage. She has elven features. Her hair, which is this dirty brown, is braided in rows that go down past her waist and have a series of multi-colored, looks almost like gems and rings and other cool pieces of jewelry that are woven into it. As she's looking at this small book in her lap and eating the fruit, she turns around. "Oh, I'm sorry. Hello."
Ashley: Hi. Could we get our hair-- yours looks amazing. Could we get some hair braids? Tight and then going down, with some gems and sparkles in it? And same here, on his beard?
Matt: "Oh, the beard. I can do that."
Ashley: Yeah?
Matt: "Yes, of course." Closes her book and sets it down. "Come, sit."
Laura: Some razor blades up in them.
Matt: She calls out in Marquesian for a moment, and a younger woman, probably about 15 or so, comes out. Human, dark-skinned, as well. Both begin to start working on your hair and your beard. Asking about where you're from. It becomes a conversational piece because you're there for a good hour and a half or so to go through all of your hair and get it done, but nevertheless, you now have a fantastic series of braids in your hair.
Travis: She pulled really hard.
Ashley: It looks really good. Do you want to add any jewels in it?
Travis: Jewels?
Ashley: Earrings and stuff like how she has?
Travis: I just want the beads. Little beads and little braids. No jewels. What about you?
Ashley: I want all of it.
Travis: Everything?
Ashley: Just all of it.
Matt: "All of it?"
Ashley: What does all of it cost?
Matt: "If you want more than what I have in mine--"
Ashley: Well, no. Let's not get carried away.
Travis: Do you want extensions?
Ashley: My hair is already so long.
Travis: It is. Do you want other colored hair in there, too?
Ashley: Let's put blue in there.
Matt: "Oh, you wish to color?"
Ashley: Oh, well--
Matt: "No, it's okay."
Travis: Yeah, why not? Fuck it!
Matt: She talks to her assistant, and the young girl runs off for a second with a smile. Comes back, and there is what looks to be some sort of a fruit. Looks like a blue pomegranate that's partially crushed. She takes it and with a mortar and pestle setup begins mashing it and goes, "We can do blue."
Ashley: Yeah!
Travis: Yeah.
Laura: So cool!
Matt: The whole endeavor between the two of you guys is not inexpensive-- few things are in the Bay of Gifts. It's designed specifically to survive and thrive on the trade here. Both of you guys, it costs about 120 gold.
Marisha: Oh shit.
Travis: Not a problem.
Ashley: So how does that break down? For my hair versus his?
Matt: "Oh, for the two? For any sort of masculine hair endeavors, which is not our specialty-- Well, the beads themselves are made from finely blown glass and they're individually colored, and those are made specifically by an artisan who is about three blocks up that way, so those are brought here, and those are purchased on our end, as well. You are paying straight cost of the beads. Time and training, of course, on our end, and we do the finest work you'll find all across Marquet."
Ashley: Well, you know what? I am a very big supporter of small businesses, so support small business, and I will give you 120 gold.
Matt: "The 20 is mainly for him. The 100 was to give you the dye coloring--"
Laura: Oh, it's for both of you guys? Oh, I thought it was 120 each!
Liam: That's all right.
Laura: That's not bad. I mean, that's a lot.
Matt: It's still a lot. But since you've gotten here, you get the sense that it's-- by nature, everything here costs a little more. A lot of it's imported and a lot of it is designed for people that are willing to pay for foreign goods.
Ashley: Great.
Travis: Are we supposed to tip?
Laura: No, she owns the business so you don't have to do as much.
Travis: Are you there?
Ashley: Just 120.
Matt: Very well. So how much blue did you want to get in your hair?
Ashley: Say again?
Matt: How much blue did you want to get in your hair?
Ashley: Just some strips, you know. Just some strips on the white so it pops out.
Matt: Okay.
Ashley: Just like--
Matt: All right.
Ashley: You know, dealer's choice. Just get creative and do what you want.
Matt: All right. Okay. So upon completion-- It's very cool. It's pretty close to what you were hoping and expecting. You end up with three streaks: one central one that goes from the center, and then two that go from the sides and back that way.
Laura: That's way different than I expected.
Ashley: It's awesome.
Matt: And then all the tips go to blue, so it's almost like you have these two blocks of white and then eventually it all goes blue towards the edge.
Ashley: Yeah.
Travis: Yeah.
Laura: Imagine what that'll look like when your hair is down, too, because it'll be like blue all over the top and all mixed in everywhere.
Ashley: Ooh, that's pretty cool.
Travis: Hell yeah.
Matt: So yeah. Anything else you want to accomplish, or call it an evening?
Laura: I think just eat a nice dinner and then head back to the rooms and get ready to wake up in the morning and do all the same shit again.
Marisha: Definitely some magically frozen daiquiris.
Matt: You guys all find your way back with some drinks. The sun has set now, the cold night has come in through the bay, but it's still warm. It's cold by the bay standards, but you guys come from the northern ends, in Tal'Dorei proper it's still a pretty warm night. You hear the waves crashing as you enter the establishment. You all head back to your rooms to get in more evening attire. Percival and Vex-- how long do the hounds last for?
Sam: Let me look.
Taliesin: That's a good question.
Sam: It just says Two Mastiffs. I think they just are. (laughter)
Sam: It's not like a spell or anything, they are two dogs that live now.
Matt: I am so excited. I am so excited.
Travis: They don't live for much longer.
Matt: Okay. So, as soon as you approach, you guys hear, through the door on the other side, this low growl. This (growls).
Taliesin: Vex?
Laura: What is that?
Taliesin: I don't--
Laura: I open the door. Just fucking on guard.
Matt: Okay. You come inside to notice the entire interior of the room has been sundered. Pillows and cloth torn and pulled everywhere. The room smells immediately of heaping piles of dog shit and urine. The bed is scattered and torn open. The curtains have been pulled down, and there, in the center of the room, are two massive mastiffs, mating. (laughter)
Laura: What the fuck!
Taliesin: I grab the door and shut it.
Laura: Who did this?
Taliesin: It was either Grog or your brother. Those are really the only two people who could be possibly responsible--
Laura: Grog! And I take off running to his room.
Matt: Okay. (laughs)
Taliesin: I'm not missing this. I am following.
Matt: Okay. Your door is open, Grog. You're just there sitting down for a second just grabbing your jug. Getting a quick nip before your next nip.
Travis: Yeah, mini-fridge.
Matt: And Vex just storms in, heaving mad.
Travis: Hey. Oh. Hi.
Laura: Did you have anything to do with this? (laughter)
Travis: I feel like I should ask what, but the answer's probably yes?
Laura: The fucking dogs. Grog! I grab him by his beaded beard and drag him back to the room.
Travis: Ah! It's really tight! (yelps)
Matt: Percival, as you catch up-- She comes around the corner just dragging Grog by the beard behind her.
Taliesin: Oh god, she's going to kill you.
Travis: (groans) What in the-- what-- (groans)
Laura: I open the door and throw him in. Did you do this?
Travis: (sniffs) Ugh. What the fuck?
Matt: The dogs have stopped mating at this point and one of them comes over and goes (sniffs, chomp) and just bites into your neck. It does nothing, it just rests there.
Travis: Is this your fucking dog?
Laura: Is this your fucking dog?
Travis: No! Where am I going to get dogs from?
Laura: (huffs) True. (laughter)
Travis: Although I don't think this shit and piss is mine.
Laura: (laughs) That's good.
Travis: Yep.
Laura: What does our room look like? What does our stuff look like? Is it ruined?
Matt: Your stuff isn't--
Liam: Not the magical items.
Taliesin: The stuff in the closet is probably--
Matt: Yeah. You didn't just leave your stuff on the floor, there. You had things put away inside the cabinets and stuff. And the things that were in the cabinets were fine. So most of your general clothing is all right. It's more like your sacks, anything that was just loose. Your boots. All just smell of dog piss.
Laura: How did they even get in? I take off to the front desk. (laughter)
Sam: Oh, shit.
Travis: Can I let the mastiffs have a couple of licks from the alchemy jug full of beer that I was drinking out of?
Matt: They do have a lick. Big old mastiff tongues.
Taliesin: I'm going to go find Vax.
Matt: Okay. As you rush off to the front counter, you can see Guath, the Marquesian, is still there. He's in the process of going through the books, making sure he's keeping everything tidy and he sees you approach. "Ah, hello! Is there anything of--"
Laura: Who-- Hi.
Matt: "Hello."
Laura: Who was in our room? Did you send anyone to our room?
Matt: "Uh. Yes. Yes, there was--"
Laura: Who was it?
Matt: "The other who looks like you. He came by and said that he was supposed to put the-- We had to send--" (laughter)
Sam: Yes!
Matt: "He said he had to put things in the room for you. I am so sorry. I am so sorry. If this is a problem, we can call the-- You wish us to call the guards over here?"
Laura: (scoffs) How? Why? Vax! And I take off running. Vax! Where are you? Where are you?
Liam: I'm in my room.
Laura: Ooh!
Taliesin: I have just turned the corner towards Vax's room. I'm probably just now in eyesight.
Laura: I sprint and I--
Marisha: I just showered, you guys, now's not a good time. I'm just--
Laura: Trinket, off with me, we're ready to fucking fight. He's out of my necklace and we're taking off towards Vax's room.
Liam: Did you say you're coming to the room?
Laura: You are dead.
Taliesin: Can I hear this?
Liam: I mean, practically.
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: I can too.
Travis: We're all making our way over to Vax's room.
Liam: Kiki, might want to go to into the bathroom. I think that my sister is coming. Whoa!
Laura: Keyleth.
Marisha: Hi, Vex.
Laura: Put some clothes on.
Liam: I guess I will as well.
Marisha: I feel like we're in trouble.
Laura: Not you.
Liam: Yoink. What?
Laura: What the fuck did you do? Why the fuck would you do that in our room?
Liam: What did I do in your room?
Laura: Destroyed it.
Liam: Why would I destroy your room on the first day of our vacation?
Laura: Did you-- Did he-- Did you-- Why would you?
Liam: I wouldn't. What are you talking about?
Laura: The dogs. Shit and piss everywhere. I know you were in our room.
Liam: Dogs?
Marisha: There are dogs? (gasps) What kind of dogs are they?
Taliesin: Why don't you come with me and I'm going to go show you while they talk.
Marisha: Okay.
Liam: Are you pranking me? What are you talking about?
Laura: Ooh. I just yank your hair as hard as I can.
Liam: (yells) What are you doing?
Laura: Why would you do it? Why?
Liam: Do what? You have to be more specific.
Laura: Dogs. Shitting and ruining everything in our room.
Liam: What the fuck are you talking about? Dogs? I don't have any dogs.
Laura: Don't you lie to me.
Liam: I don't have any magic. I can heal a little bit and that's it. What are you talking about?
Laura: They're not even magic dogs, they're just dogs! Can I roll to see if he's fucking telling the truth?
Matt: Make an insight check.
Liam: I'll make my deception check.
Taliesin: Kiki, we've always been friends.
Marisha: Yeah, of course.
Laura: 18.
Taliesin: I want you to know this is nothing personal but this is--
Travis: Is that your second Luck?
Liam: Yes, it was.
Matt: That's the second Luck, yeah.
Taliesin: And I open the door and show you. And then I shove you in and shut the door for a moment.
Matt: You can see he's covering up. You don't quite know the full specifics, but you know he's covering.
Laura: I know you were in our room and I know you're lying to me.
Liam: I was not in your room. I am not lying to you, I don't-- (yells)
Laura: I just yank him out of the room. Trinket!
Liam: What are you-- what?
Laura: Sic him! (laughter)
Matt: At this point, she's pulled you out into the hallway. You now see, the bear you've grown up with and loved, for the first time, you realize how massive and scary this bear could be as it (growls, heavy steps).
Liam: I click my Boots of Haste!
Travis: You were fucking naked a second ago.
Matt: Trinket charges you.
Liam: This is improvisation. If I say it, it's real. That's how this fucking works.
Sam: You were putting on your boots?
Matt: So what are you doing? Trinket's coming at you.
Liam: I'm running in my boots!
Matt: All right.
Laura: I have the back of his head. I have his hair.
Liam: Disengage.
Matt: Okay. So hold on. She does have your hair.
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: Technically, it's a grapple.
Liam: Okay. You want to make it a strength check? I know my strength is double hers.
Laura: (gasps) Your strength is double mine?
Matt: It's athletics and acrobatics versus her--
Liam: Okay. Oh, acrobatics, okay.
Laura: Versus my strength?
Matt: I'll double-check real fast. I should remember this, but for this one particularly I want to make sure that I get specifics right here.
Taliesin: This is so great.
Sam: Forget rolling for sand castles, this is it. (laughter)
Matt: Yeah, man. This is the craziest shit. (laughs) I didn't expect it to go this way.
Taliesin: I vaguely wonder what you actually had planned for this.
Matt: Not all this!
Taliesin: This is bedlam, at this point.
Matt: This went in a whole different direction.
Sam: A big title card comes over the frame  Night One. (laughter)
Matt: Okay, yeah. It's athletics or acrobatics versus her athletics.
Laura: Oh.
Liam: Well, I will choose acrobatics.
Laura: Motherfuck.
Matt: Go ahead and roll your acrobatics. Roll your athletics.
Laura: Ugh, it was almost good.
Liam: 29.
Laura: Six!
Matt: You slip out from her grasp right as Trinket comes upon you. What's your speed?
Liam: Fucking wicked, man. I'm double-speed, so 60.
Matt: You don't have your boots on, you just put your pants on!
Ashley: Weren't you in the shower?
Matt: You mimicked putting your pants on.
Liam: All right. 30.
Matt: Okay. Trinket's movement is?
Laura: Oh, he's got 40.
Matt: Trinket is gaining on you. (laughter)
Matt: You watch as an older couple emerge from the room down the hallway and go, "Nope." And close the door.
Liam: I see food trays left by other customers. I start knocking them down and dumping food on the rug behind me as I run. It's improv. It's real!
Matt: There are small baskets.
Liam: I said I saw food!
Matt: Yeah, so you knock some baskets behind you and you keep running. You just emerge from the edge of the hallway. You can see the beach ahead of you. You can see the little bit of moonlight hitting the sand in front.
Liam: What's around me?
Matt: Hallways and doors.
Marisha: Is our room nearby? Did he see me get shoved in?
Taliesin: He wouldn't have seen you get shoved in, but he would have seen me in the hallway at this point, if he passed her.
Matt: I'd say you moved one direction. Trinket went and chased him down the other side, so this is going away from you guys.
Marisha: Hey, Vax? I think they're really mad at us.
Liam: Little busy, little busy, little busy!
Matt: Just as you emerge to part of the sand and you think you're home free, you stop hearing Trinket's footfalls. (whack) Leapt and just impacts you on the sand and both of you tumble, end-over-end, through the sand. Eventually, you land flat on your back and Trinket pounces on top of you, your breath (groans) as your chest gets closed in. And right up in your face, pinning you down, going (growls).
Liam: I immediately start doing this.
Sam: What is that?
Liam: This is me rubbing his tummy.
Laura: Oh. Don't fall for it, Trinket!
Matt: (growls) (laughter)
Matt: You are pinned by a very heavy bear, to the point where your breathing is (shallow panting).
Liam: You hear from under the bear, (muffled) I have been here before, and I will be here again!
Laura: Why would you do it? It's such a beautiful vacation and you ruined it. You ruined all of our things.
Liam: Did I ruin it? What did I ruin? I still don't know what happened.
Laura: Vax, you let two dogs loose in our room and they shit and pissed all over everything, and our bed is ruined. They were fucking in our bed!
Liam: I did not fucking let two dogs--
Laura: Then what did you do? I know you were in our room. I know you're lying to me.
Liam: I was there for five seconds. I put Taryon's armor under the bed and then I left. I was in there for 30 seconds. I don't have any dogs. I don't know dogs.
Laura: Why would you put Taryon's armor in our room?
Liam: Because it was fucking hilarious!
Laura: Wait a minute.
Marisha: That's the trolliest thing you've said, ever!
Laura: Did you tell Tary?
Liam: I did.
Laura: So Tary did this?
Liam: What happened?
Laura: Someone let two giant dogs loose in our room, and they destroyed our things. Just destroyed it. And now, on top of having everything ruined, we're probably going to have to pay for damages. Which will be coming out of your funds, by the way.
Liam: That's the funniest bit, because I have no money.
Laura: Well, then Keyleth. Trinket, stay on him for a while. Just for a while. Feel free to relieve yourself. (laughter)
Matt: Trinket's head slowly turns over back towards you with a, "What?"
Laura: Just a little time. And I walk.
Matt: As you walk away, Trinket's head moves back to you, and if you could see a bear smile?
Liam: Yeah. When she's gone and it's just us, I say, she thinks I care. I don't care. Does she let you kiss her? No, she doesn't. But you get to kiss me all you want, so have at it, buddy.
Matt: Trinket goes, (grunts).
Liam: It's all right.
Matt: And you feel your lower regions get warmer. (groaning and laughter)
Laura: You got pissed on.
Liam: I've been inside a dragon's fucking stomach, buddy. I don't care. The beach is 50 feet that way. Get it all out.
Matt: All right, while you're pinned there, you march off. You guys just now catch up to the chaos.
Marisha: I have to say, wherever these dogs came from, they're very beautiful dogs. Look purebred. Very great muscular structure. Come here, boys. Come here!
Matt: Keyleth's currently getting the mastiffs out of the room.
Marisha: Can I Speak With Animals to them?
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: Come here, boys. Come here. I take out some beef jerky. Come here. That's good boys. Good boys.
Laura: Where did you have beef jerky?
Marisha: Fish jerky from where we were at the casino earlier.
Sam: Oh snap!
Marisha: As Liam O'Brien said, it's improv, so that makes it true!
Laura: I'm just wondering--
Liam: You fucking made out that you were hiding in crystal clear bathwater, motherfucker! If you say it, it's real!
Marisha: Right, so just like the internet, if you say it, it's real. Come here, boys.
Matt: Animal handling.
Marisha: Oh, it smells. You boys did a number in this room. Okay. (laughter)
Marisha: I've got to have some advantage for being a fucking druid, right?
Matt: No.
Marisha: That's a one.
Matt: So you say, "Come here, boys." They both look at you. They rush up, grab the jerky out of your hands, and dart out of the room. You hear them, (barks) vanishing.
Marisha: Fuck these dogs! That's why you said we should never own dogs.
Matt: Taryon?
Sam: I'm getting night cream put on me by Doty. (laughter)
Sam: Doty, could you sing to me?
Matt: (sings) "Tary. Tary. Tary." It's all the same. It's all horribly mechanical-sounding and echo-y. It's not singing more than it's repeating your name over and over again in the same intonation. It's horrifying.
Marisha: Percy?
Taliesin: You're going to have to help us clean at least our personal belongings.
Marisha: I didn't do this! I'm more than happy to help, but I just want you to know: I had nothing to do with this.
Taliesin: Oh, I know. I know you had nothing to do with this. He's useless. You're not, so I'm going to make you help on his behalf.
Marisha: It smells like shit. Like a giant fucking locker down shit in here.
Taliesin: Worse than hell. Legitimately worse than hell. This is making me miss hell.
Marisha: I'm going to cast Control Water. Can I magic this clean-up like it's Fantasia or some shit?
Matt: That is Prestidigitation.
Marisha: No, can I Control Water and levitate the urine?
Travis: Yeah, totally.
Matt: You know what? Yes, I'll let you do that. I will let you Control Urine.
Marisha: I am the leader of my tribe, and I am doing janitorial duties. Ugh.
Matt: After completing your Aramente, after years of training in the druidic arts and becoming the leader of your people, you are reduced to lifting the urine from a ruined hotel room.
Taliesin: I would like you to meditate upon who is responsible for this.
Marisha: Fucking Vox Machina pieces of-- why am I-- why are we us?
Taliesin: This is your boy. I'm taking no responsibility for this one.
Marisha: Okay, I control the water and fling it into the ocean.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: I'm hearing all this over the earring, and I whisper, only to Trinket: I'm back, Trinket. I'm back. (laughter)
Marisha: I control a little of the urine that dribbled in the hall, as well. I don't want us to get kicked out by the hotel.
Matt: The room's still destroyed. For the sake of brevity, here--
Taliesin: Some wild dogs attacked our room.
Matt: Who's talking to the manager about this?
Laura: Percy is.
Taliesin: I'll speak to the manager.
Matt: All right.
Sam: (giggles) Wild dogs?
Marisha: Wild ocean dogs. Beach dogs.
Matt: So at this point, while all this has happened, Guath, the gentleman at the front, sees the bear and is like, "What is going--" (yelps) The dogs go (barks) and jump past him. The slightly chubby halfling comes forward. "What the fuck is going on?"
Marisha: You tell us, man.
Matt: "No, you tell me. This is my place! Whose dogs were those?"
Taliesin: We have no idea. We came back and they were in our room, pissing on our stuff.
Matt: Make a deception check.
Taliesin: This is not deception!
Matt: You know whose they are.
Taliesin: Actually, do I know whose they are?
Matt: You've been hearing it over the earring this whole time.
Taliesin: I don't know where they came from.
Travis: That's true, he hasn't said.
Matt: That's true.
Taliesin: I'll do deception.
Matt: Persuasion.
Taliesin: Persuasion? Well, deception's higher, but I'll try persuasion. (laughter)
Marisha: What the fuck, man?
Taliesin: No, god damn it.
Sam: Honor yourself.
Taliesin: I'm honoring myself. It doesn't matter, anyway. That's 27.
Matt: He goes, (sighs).
Taliesin: I mean, it was upsetting. Your property, our property. This is our problem. All of us.
Matt: "Let me see." He pulls past and makes his way towards the room, and looks inside, and you can see him go, (distressed noise).
Taliesin: Has this happened before?
Matt: "No! I've never seen those dogs here before. The breed? They don't exist!" (laughter)
Taliesin: I've never seen them before, either. I've never seen anything like it.
Matt: (exclaims in a foreign language)
Taliesin: How good a job did you do on our stuff?
Matt: It's still torn and messed up, but it's not covered in urine. It still smells terrible in there.
Liam: Your clothes and bullshit is fine.
Taliesin: I know.
Matt: "I'm so sorry."
Taliesin: It's hardly your fault. This is ridiculous.
Matt: "We'll get you a new room immediately. Hey!" Two servants come out immediately. He starts shouting out to them in Marquesian. They walk off and eventually people start coming in and pulling your stuff out of the room and taking it to another chamber. It's down two halls over, so you guys are separated from everybody else.
Taliesin: We have a lot of foreign guests as well, in our establishment back home, so I know how things can sometimes get a bit crazy, and I certainly don't want to put any undue pressure on you.
Matt: "Oh, it is okay. We will launch an investigation immediately."
Taliesin: Excellent.
Matt: So. (laughs) Vex, anything else you want to do?
Laura: Yeah, I want to go knock on Tary's door.
Matt: You hear through the doorway this really creepy, "Tary. Tary."
Sam: I'll take off my blinders, my night-blinders.
Taliesin: Do they actually have little cucumbers drawn on them?
Sam: My mask. Come in.
Laura: Do you have Doty singing to you again?
Sam: Oh, yes. He sings me to sleep now. It's sort of a ritual we have.
Laura: I shut the door.
Sam: Did you have a nice night, Little Elf Girl?
Laura: I didn't, Goldie. Actually, did you happen to set a couple of dogs loose in our room?
Sam: Well, between you and me, I did.
Laura: Oh, you did?
Sam: You see, Percival played a little bit of a prank on me, and I got him back.
Laura: Yes. Well, you also got me back, and actually, it wasn't Percival, it was my brother who did it. Stole your armor?
Sam: But he told me that it was--
Laura: Yes.
Sam: He told me--
Laura: Yes, and you believed him over your two best friends?
Sam: You've taught me so much, but not about the human heart. (sighs) I am so sorry. I should have trusted you.
Laura: You should've!
Sam: I should have not doubted my staunchest ally, Percival. Of course, someone as trained as he is in the sciences wouldn't lie to me like that. I failed you.
Laura: Tary, you know I can't stay mad at you!
Sam: I'm so sorry! (laughter)
Sam: What can I do to make it up?
Laura: I don't know--
Sam: Doty, go clean their room.
Laura: Thank you, dear.
Sam: I'm so sorry.
Laura: Oh, it was disgusting.
Sam: But your brother.
Laura: I know! Trinket peed on him.
Sam: Trinket peed on him? Well, that's pretty good. I feel like there's more revenge to be had, but you know what? We're on vacation.
Liam: Over their earrings, they hear, he also dropped a loaf.
Laura: He also dropped a loaf, apparently.
Sam: That's nice. All right. I'm so sorry. Will you forgive me?
Laura: Of course I do, dear. Have a wonderful night's sleep.
Sam: You, too.
Laura: I'll send Doty back when he's done.
Sam: He can last forever, so just as long as you need him. He'll wash whatever you need. He has motor skills. Not fine motor skills, but he could try to sew something if anything was ripped.
Laura: I'll check it out and I'll let you know.
Sam: And if you ever need more dogs?
Laura: You're the man to call.
Taliesin: I see Doty appear, correct?
Matt: Yeah.
Taliesin: Doty, they're going to take our things. I know why you're here.
Matt: He just walks past you. (laughter)
Matt: Enters the room.
Taliesin: Are our things even in our room anymore?
Matt: Your things are being brought out in pieces, but the two employees see Doty enter and set them down and Doty starts picking things up and dusts them off. Starts picking up the piles of dog feces.
Taliesin: Tary, call him off.
Sam: Sorry?
Taliesin: Call him off.
Sam: I'm sorry? Call him off?
Taliesin: Call him off.
Sam: He's cleaning your things.
Taliesin: No. We're getting another room.
Marisha: What is he throwing away?
Matt: He's throwing the dung out onto the beach. Starts heading back.
Sam: I should have been more specific.
Marisha: I don't think he's very sanitary.
Sam: This is my earring, by the way.
Taliesin: I know.
Sam: This is how I have to talk with it. I have to dangle it.
Taliesin: I know you have to fiddle your dangle. I'm well aware.
Sam: All right, I'll be right there to give him more specific instructions.
Taliesin: We're going to sleep.
Sam: I'm coming.
Liam: Do you improve the reception by moving it around?
Matt: Okay. Over the course of the evening, the room gets cleaned as best as it can.
Taliesin: We do not tell them what our new room number is.
Matt: You guys, from that point being the most contentious, but you manage to enjoy the rest of your stay here in the Bay of Gifts. You enjoy a nice, well-earned vacation, some of you plotting the next stage in your vengeance, whenever that may occur. Boarding your ship back, making your way to your home in Tal'Dorei, across back to Whitestone proper to finish the remainder of your year's journey. We're going to take a break. Before I go, real fast, letting you guys know, we have another giveaway tonight. This is a nice purple heart Wyrmwood mini holder, which is pretty rad.
Sam: Is that what I have?
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: I love it. Honestly, this is the best color. It's so cool. It's kinda like rose gold, therefore it's the best. (laughter)
Matt: There you go. Yeah, so this is going to go to one of you lucky winners in the chat. The code word for tonight is Momocon. M-O-M-O-C-O-N. So go ahead and we'll do that over the break. Enjoy Liam's episode of Signal Boost.
Ashley: It's so good!
Liam: Man, that was pure Dungeons and Dragons. I took a little pebble and dropped it and it turned into a frigging avalanche on the side of Everest.
Taliesin: That reminded me of the old home games quite a bit.
Matt: I wasn't expecting that to become our beach episode, but it did! (laughs) All right, guys, we'll see you here in a little bit. [break]
Matt: Welcome back, everybody, to Critical Role. (laughter)
Matt: First and foremost, our winner in the chat room goes by the name of Makelovelikewar, congratulations! Congratulations. You won the box. We've all signed it, and it'll be coming to you in the near future. Make sure to contact the folks who run the chat here, and they'll get your information, and well done. All righty, so. Bringing us back in. You guys have been travelling across the Silvercut Roadway, through the dividing plains of Tal'Dorei, onwards to the Alabaster Sierras, and eventually to the homestead of Whitestone. You guys have made your way back.
Marisha: We catch up on so much gossip.
Matt: (laughs) So you arrive. What do you want to do?
Travis: Well, actually, now that we're home, I would like to try and find Pike once we're in and settled.
Matt: So you guys all get settled and you find your way to your rooms. The afternoon comes to a close for the evening, and everyone's gone off to do their business and prepare for a dinner, we'll say, in about an hour.
Travis: Cool. Hey. Hey. Oh, sorry.
Ashley: Hello?
Travis: Hey, it's Grog.
Ashley: Oh, come in!
Travis: Huh, what?
Ashley: Okay. (laughter)
Ashley: Hi, Grog.
Travis: Hi! Hey. Hey. Hey. So, can I shut the door? So I--
Ashley: Yes?
Travis: Oh, okay. I shut the door. So, I have a secret.
Ashley: Ooh?
Travis: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Ashley: Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
Travis: Okay, so. When we beat Thordak, I was rummaging around and all of Emon's treasures were in this one place and everybody was like, "Meh, we want to heal," and I found these little gifts, and one of them was this little itty-bitty deck of cards.
Ashley: (gasps)
Travis: I know, right? Now, here's the thing. It was in a really pretty box: wooden box with gold all over it. I tried to open it, and it wouldn't, so I smashed it.
Ashley: Naturally.
Travis: Like you do.
Ashley: Yeah.
Travis: And I took it out. And I drew a card from it, and this magic sword appeared in my hand.
Ashley: (gasps) So something magic comes out of it when you pick one? Can I pick one?
Travis: Yeah. Do you want to?
Ashley: Yeah.
Travis: Yeah. So I also went and I was journeying around. I went to Vasselheim. Now, here's the thing. Vex was like, "No, don't pick one, it's dangerous. Mm."
Ashley: Wait, it can be dangerous?
Travis: Well, no. She's afraid that it's dangerous, right? Because the sword, it turned to rust, and I got a headache afterwards. Whatever.
Ashley: Okay. Oh.
Travis: But I think I didn't handle it right. But I went to Vasselheim, and I had this other guy pick a card. You know?
Ashley: Okay.
Travis: And he picked a card. He got two Wishes.
Ashley: What!
Travis: Just like that! And he made himself--
Ashley: That sounds like the best thing ever.
Travis: I know! He's the Lord of the Crossroads.
Ashley: The Crossroads.
Travis: Yep.
Ashley: (gasps)
Travis: He's rich; he had a servant who appeared out of nowhere. All of a sudden he had fuckin' dope-ass threads.
Ashley: Should we-- Whoa. Should we pick a card?
Travis: I mean, I feel like we should. I've seen nothing but good things happen. (laughter)
Ashley: Wait, what do you mean this sword gave you a headache, Grog?
Travis: Well, I don't know. So it was a magic sword, right? I was going to be able to throw it and it would fight without me. Like it would just fight things that I told it to.
Ashley: Was it evil?
Travis: No! I tried talking to it and it didn't say anything.
Ashley: Okay, that's a--
Travis: We have a history.
Ashley: That's a red flag.
Travis: I know. I have a history of, you know.
Ashley: So it didn't talk back to you.
Travis: Nope.
Ashley: It fought on its own.
Travis: Yep.
Ashley: A guy that you met, you made him just rich and amazing.
Travis: Yeah. Pretty much. I think it's a Deck of Fortunate Things.
Ashley: A Deck of Fortune?
Travis: I think so. I mean, I haven't really looked at it too closely. Do you want to look at it with your knowledge?
Ashley: I mean, I don't, yeah.
Travis: Yeah.
Ashley: I don't know if I have the knowledge, but I'll look at it.
Travis: All right. I give her the deck.
Matt: All right, make an arcana check. (gasping)
Ashley: Natural 20. (cheering)
Matt: But what's your skill? What's your skill bonus?
Ashley: Plus one. So 21.
Matt: Okay, you take the small sack that contains the cards, and you pull the deck out of it, and you inspect it from the outside. Just checking the inscriptions. You've heard things about magical decks of cards. Sometimes they're used to see the future. Sometimes they're used for different types of augury and divination. You might've heard a myth or two about a card deck that can alter reality in good and bad ways. That's as much as you are able to glean from this.
Ashley: Can I tell which cards are good and which cards are bad?
Matt: No.
Ashley: I was just checking. (laughter)
Ashley: I figured the answer would be 'no'.
Matt: But you do know from looking at this, while the name doesn't come to you, you're able to ascertain this seems to be very, very in line with the fate-altering deck of cards, the one you've heard can do good and bad, and is as powerful and dangerous as it is interesting.
Ashley: I feel like I've heard of something like this before.
Travis: Really?
Ashley: But sometimes you can choose a card that will do very bad things.
Travis: Oh.
Ashley: So it's like a 50/50 chance that you could get something very good. Like, you have your fortune change, you become a king, all of this thing--
Travis: Or you make a bad person a king?
Ashley: Or you get a magical sword. Or if maybe someone-- you could just die instantly.
Travis: Really?
Ashley: I don't know, maybe. Something along those lines.
Travis: But we're good people, so good things would happen to us.
Ashley: (strained) Oh, it just sounds so fun though.
Travis: I know, right? And think about my previous experience. There is nothing bad that has happened in what I've seen so far.
Laura: (laughs) Oh god.
Ashley: (strained) Oh, I don't know what to do. Well, do you want to pull one or should I pull one? Or should we not?
Travis: I don't know. I mean, like, I kind of want to. I mean, so like. Like bad things.
Ashley: What could be that bad? I mean, if someone were to die, we could do a Resurrection spell.
Travis: How could it just outright kill you? Well if you die, I can't do a spell.
Ashley: (sighs) I don't know what to do. I don't know if we should. I don't know if we should test the fates.
Travis: We should flip a coin.
Ashley: Let's flip a coin.
Travis: Okay. Do you have a coin?
Ashley: Yeah, I have a coin.
Travis: Oh, you do? That was lucky.
Matt: All right. Did you--
Marisha: "We shouldn't test the fates, let's flip a coin." (laughter)
Matt: Do you want me to flip a coin for you?
Liam: You can roll a 20.
Laura: Oh yeah, no. We have coins.
Marisha: I've got one on hand right now, beotches.
Travis: Do you want to?
Matt: It's up to you guys. This is entirely your call.
Marisha: Here it is.
Laura: Oh, Melora.
Liam: Coming in.
Laura: There you go.
Ashley: Okay.
Travis: What if all the good ones are gone?
Ashley: Heads or tails. Okay, so one is heads.
Travis: Heads, because that's all bad in the heads. But the tail is the booty, so.
Ashley: Okay.
Laura: Wait, but what is what?
Ashley: So what's what? 20, we pick a card. One, we do not.
Liam: 20, we don't pick a card.
Ashley: 20, we don't pick a card.
Liam: 20 is sensible. One is ridiculous.
Ashley: You are not here.
Travis: Yeah, what do you feel like? What do you feel like? One, we pick a card. 20, we don't-- we do pick a card. (laughter)
Ashley: That's both of those. You said we'd pick a card both sides.
Travis: That was a Fraudidean slip. (laughter)
Ashley: Yeah. One, we pick a card. 20, we don't.
Travis: Okay.
Ashley: Who picks the card? Or should we--
Travis: We should flip for that too.
Ashley: Okay, okay, I'm going to check it. Oh, we don't pick a card.
Travis: But that was for you, you flipped. And now I flip.
Ashley: Okay. Oh. You don't pick a card either. You know what? It's safer this way.
Travis: It is?
Ashley: I think so. Because what if we would've gotten something bad? Did you want me to hold onto it? Or do you want to hold onto it? I'm just afraid you're going to pick it and be alone.
Travis: I might. (laughter)
Travis: No, I want it. I really want it. It's real important to me.
Ashley: Do not. Pick it. Alone.
Travis: I've made this promise before. (laughter)
Ashley: Who did you make the promise to?
Travis: Vex.
Ashley: Well, you live your life how you want to--
Travis: Oh. Ooh. No, your promise was different. You said 'alone' so if I was like really, (distressed noise) I need to, I come to you--
Ashley: Yeah.
Travis: And we pick it.
Ashley: Yeah.
Travis: Okay. Deal.
Ashley: Yeah, okay.
Travis: Thanks. You're sure you don't want to just, like, slide one out and just take a look at it?
Ashley: Just take a peek?
Travis: Yep. All right, fine. (laughter)
Ashley: (strained) I want to so bad.
Travis: All right.
Laura: That is fate. Helping us.
Ashley: I know.
Taliesin: That was like watching an eight-year-old juggle a gun. (laughter)
Laura: Was that another 20?
Travis: Yes. (laughter)
Liam: They both want to do it so bad.
Matt: I know.
Marisha: Moving on from that scene before they change their mind.
Matt: We'll say for the point of the narrative, a couple of weeks go by, relatively unimpactful.
Laura: Oh, I get my circle!
Matt: Yeah, the Teleportation Circle is complete.
Laura: Hey, guys. We can go to Syngorn whenever we want.
Marisha: Oh, rad.
Laura: Tight, right?
Liam: The question is, do we want to?
Laura: Probably not!
Marisha: Can I go check in with the Sun Tree while I'm here?
Matt: Yeah, sure. So you walk on down to the center of Whitestone, which is now far more full of life and bustling. A lot of the buildings that line the square have little flower boxes underneath the windows. Color has returned to it. Still keeps moody gray skies a large portion of the day, but overall the city itself seems to have sprung into life over the past year or so. The Sun Tree is beautiful. It's still a vastly bark-visible tree. It has that orange-brown color across it, smooth in most places, a little more textured toward the bottom, but you see the very lush green leaves up into the boughs. You can see little bits of white flowers that year-round reside up in the top. It stands there before you in all of its magnificence.
Marisha: I come up and say, hey, Sun Tree. Casting Speak With Plants, of course.
Matt: "Hey, Keyleth."
Marisha: Hey!
Matt: "It's been a while."
Marisha: It's been so long. You're looking so good. So healthy.
Matt: "Thanks. I've been eating right."
Marisha: Yeah? Have you been working out?
Matt: "As much as I can. You know, I'm a tree."
Marisha: Sure. Yeah. How's it been? Whitestone seems so much better. Seems happier. Has morale been up?
Matt: "I mean, yeah."
Marisha: Yeah?
Matt: "There's kids and stuff."
Marisha: Yeah? Do the kids sometimes climb in you?
Matt: "Yeah."
Marisha: Do you like that?
Matt: "No."
Marisha: No? Oh, right.
Matt: "No, it's uncomfortable."
Marisha: Really?
Matt: "Yeah."
Marisha: Should I put a Do Not Climb sign on you? Would you like that?
Matt: "Would you have to nail it into me?"
Marisha: No. I could stake it in the ground around you.
Matt: "It's fine."
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: "But thank you. I appreciate the offer."
Marisha: Anything to make you more comfortable, man.
Matt: "Appreciate it."
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: "You're great."
Marisha: Oh, thanks. Anyway, is there anything else that you need? Any new news? Anything going on?
Matt: "Nah. Glad the snowing stopped."
Marisha: Right? Thought that winter would last forever, right?
Matt: "It's hard to keep these blossoms up through the winter, let me tell you."
Marisha: Oh, yeah? But you're still good.
Matt: "Yeah. How are you doing, Kiki?"
Marisha: Oh, you know. Keeping busy, keeping on keeping on, you know? It's been good. You're like the coolest person I know, and you're a tree. It's weird. Even after a year, it's like talking to an old friend. It's good.
Matt: "If I could blush." (laughter)
Taliesin: Oh wow.
Marisha: Oh, look! Some of these flowers are getting a little pink, Sun Tree.
Matt: "Don't point it out. It's embarrassing. So. Hi."
Marisha: No, that's all. It's actually getting a little awkward now. It's gone on for a little long.
Matt: "I'm glad you brought that up. I didn't want to breach the subject."
Marisha: I just wanted to make sure you were cool.
Matt: "No, I'm cool."
Marisha: Yeah. Awesome. Okay, I'll see you around. Bye.
Matt: Hang up.
Laura: It's going to be a while before you guys call again.
Marisha: I'll wait for him to text me first. Yeah. It's the rule. Long time.
Taliesin: I don't know what they're looking at.
Matt: I don't know, either. Partway into the day, we'll say that you've been doing this. The bakery's been going fine. Which, actually, Pike and Vex, you've been in the process of-- have you guys hired employees to run the bakery?
Laura: Obviously.
Matt: Are you more playing as managers as opposed to actual workers?
Marisha: Owners.
Laura: Creative input.
Matt: Pike, on this day, you've been keeping tabs on this. A couple of the Pale Guard approach the bakery. One of them, without seeing you, walks in and goes, "We're looking for Pike. Is Miss Pike in?"
Ashley: Yes?
Matt: "Could you please come with us? There's somebody on the border requesting your presence."
Ashley: Where?
Matt: "On the outskirts of Whitestone."
Ashley: Okay. Yes.
Matt: "Someone who says they know you. You'd better come with us."
Ashley: Okay.
Matt: The two guards step back and-- do you walk with them?
Ashley: Yes.
Laura: Are any of us with you?
Matt: It's just her, at the moment.
Marisha: Does she walk past the Sun Tree when I'm having a random conversation with no one?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Marisha: Rolling really shitty tonight. Let's see what happens. Oh, that's good! That's much better. Straight perception? 30.
Matt: Okay. As you're walking away from the Sun Tree and begin heading back to the northern side of Whitestone, glancing back at him. "Oh, it's good to talk to him again." And you see Pike walking with two guards just on the southwestern side of the square. She looks a little nervous.
Marisha: It's about that time I'm like, okay, bye, Sun Tree. And then I'm going to Beast Shape into a crow and start circling her.
Matt: There are two kids off to the side that were just playing who look over and go, "Whoa."
Laura: That was amazing!
Ashley: That was awesome!
Matt: "I want to do that!"
Marisha: Poop on the way up.
Laura: That was even cooler!
Matt: They did not see that. So, as you're brought to the western road, it leads you alongside the shops and one of the guard who's talking to you is like, "Yeah, sorry. A group of folks have been here for a couple of days asking-- a few hours, I should say. Not a couple of days. Asking about you. We've kept an eye on them. They don't seem to be aggressive, but they asked for you recently, and we managed to find you by the bakery. Here they are." They lead you to the outside of the town, and there you see a small carriage with two horses that are currently hitched up front. You see about three other Pale Guard in full armor. One of them is in the middle of conversation with a couple of figures. You see four figures. You see three, and then a fourth one emerges from inside the carriage. It's a topped carriage with what looks to be some sort of curtains that are closed-- reds and dark purples. It doesn't look like an elaborate carriage, but it's functional. You see a male gnome with short dark hair, slicked to one side, and a well-groomed mustache that curls at the end. He's in the middle of talking when he glances over and sees you and goes, "Aha! She's here!" He leaps off the top and the guards get defensive as he goes, "Astra! Ogden! JB? She's here!" Then he goes rushing off in your direction as the guards are like, "Sir! Sir!" He ignores them for a second, and the two guards with you say, "Miss Pike, should we?" And they go for their blades.
Ashley: It's okay.
Matt: He approaches real fast and goes, (laughs) and gives a big old hug and lifts you off the ground, and it takes you a minute to realize, this is Johann Trickfoot, your cousin who you haven't seen in quite a long time. He's dressed in a fine vest that is a dark maroon color with a gold trim. A little ragged at the edges, but fine. Big, swishy pants and boots, and he lifts you up for a second and then sets you back down and is like, "It's been quite a while."
Ashley: It's been so long. How did you know where to find me?
Matt: "Well, we got your letter! And we've been hearing all about you-- at least, JB's been telling us all about you, hasn't she?" And he looks around and you see the other figures as they approach. There's a female gnome, older than you, who you haven't met before, who has curly strawberry-blonde hair that goes just past her shoulders. She's wearing this very revealing shirt and seems to walk with a confidence and smile and she goes, "Pike, my dear! I've heard all about you!" And she rushes up and gives you a big hug as well. You look back, and stepping off the carriage, you see a very old gnome who is just a wreath of black and salt-and-pepper hair, crazy, around him like a lion's mane, and a giant beard. You wouldn't see a face if not for these small spectacles and a little button nose poking out as he's being helped off the wagon by another female gnome that you recognize as she turns around towards you. She has long, straight black hair that goes right past her shoulders. She has a Wednesday Addams vibe to her. She looks back at you and smiles, and you can see this gap in her front teeth. She's about your age. This is JB Trickfoot. She is the--
Marisha: JB?
Matt: JB. She's another one of your cousins. One that you grew up with, actually, when you were very young, but you haven't seen her in a very long time. As they all begin to approach, this small cluster of Trickfoots have approached. As JB walks up to answer Johann, says, "Yes, indeed. We've heard all about you. I've been so proud to hear that you've done such great good in the world, cousin."
Ashley: I give her a hug. It's good to see you. It's been a very long time.
Matt: "Far too long."
Ashley: Did you guys just come here to see me?
Matt: "Yes." Johann claps his arm on the side of your shoulder. "Yes, of course! It's been-- I can't even remember. Look at how big you are! Last I saw you, you were waist-high to a knuckle-punch. It's been far too long. And so strong!" He's slapping the side of your arm, and they're all doing the whole family gathering, pulling and tugging, and you're starting to feel uncomfortable from all the attention, and the guards are all confused but also mildly amused by this family gathering. The old one now catches up, and you recognize that this is your uncle Ogden Trickfoot, who is the father to both Johann and JB. As he approaches, he has this small walking cane and he's walking at an angle because he doesn't quite see you. He's like, "Are you sure that she's around?"
Ashley: I'm right here!
Matt: "Huh?"
Ashley: Hi.
Matt: "Ah. Yes."
Ashley: How are you?
Matt: "I'm all right. It's so good to see you."
Ashley: It's so wonderful to see you.
Matt: "There you are."
Ashley: I'm here.
Matt: He adjusts his head a little. "They tell me that you slay dragons!"
Ashley: Yes, I did. With my friends.
Matt: "What?"
Ashley: Who I would love to introduce you guys to. My friends?
Matt: "What did she say?"
Ashley: My friends!
Matt: JB's like, "She said yes. She's slayed dragons."
Ashley: I also--
Matt: "What?"
Ashley: I also have a bakery!
Matt: "She says a bakery?"
Ashley: It's called the Slayer's Cake!
Matt: "Cake?" Suddenly you see his face brighten. Between the bursts of facial and head hair, you see a little bit of rosy cheeks poke through with a smile. JB goes, "We'll get you cake. We'll get you a cake, uncle."
Ashley: Come this way. I didn't realize you guys would be coming, but I'm glad that you got my letter and everything else.
Matt: At which point, the blonde one goes, "Yes, of course we did. You are as beautiful as everything they told me. I'm Astra, by the way. I'm Johann's wife. We haven't met, but you are a sight to see." She takes your hands and pulls your hands and goes, "Oh my, and aren't you the strapping young lady. Who's the lucky man?"
Ashley: Oh. Well, no one right now.
Matt: "Oh. Shouldn't be a problem. Or woman. Whatever, I don't know. You can tell me later."
Ashley: We'll discuss later, maybe, but do come in. I would love to introduce you to some friends of mine. Come into town.
Matt: JB's smile creeps, and you see the gap in her teeth once more. "Are these friends Vox Machina?"
Ashley: Yes.
Matt: At which point, they all look at her, and she goes, "I'm so excited. Please?" And they all gather around you, and the guard comes up real fast. "Miss, do you require assistance?"
Ashley: Just walk us into town. That would be great. Just in case there's anything that might jump out and get us.
Matt: "Very well." And the three guards that were at the front shout out, "The carriage?" And Johann goes, "Oh, yes! Well, it's now under the watch of one Pike Trickfoot, so just put it wherever the royal horses go." (chuckles)
Travis: Oh god.
Laura: Oh, I don't like them at all.
Liam: A cart of the Sackville-Bagginses just rolled up.
Ashley: Let me-- you know what? Guards, can you take them to the Slayer's Cake? And I will be right there.
Matt: "Of course! You're a busy woman. Don't worry about it." Astra fluffs her hair a bit. "Besides, I can have a guard escort me any day." The guard just grabs her arm and starts walking along with her. You can already tell she's a bubbly flirt.
Marisha: Keyleth flies down and lands on Pike's shoulder.
Ashley: Hey. Okay, so you just saw that. My family's here, the family I haven't really seen since I was a kid, and they're-- we have the last name Trickfoot for a reason. I'm going to get on the earring and say, whoever is available, I would love to maybe have you come to the Slayer's Cake. Some of my family is here.
Travis: (gasps, running noises)
Ashley: Hold on! Watch your pockets, watch your stuff. Just keep an eye on your things. Yeah, just please come?
Laura: We've got you, darling.
Marisha: I bamf out of my Beast Shape. Whoa! What?
Ashley: Okay, I sent money. I didn't tell them where I was.
Marisha: You sent money?
Ashley: I did. I don't know, maybe I shouldn't have done it. I just wanted to make sure that they were okay. Maybe that wasn't a good idea.
Marisha: You've told us very vague amounts about your family.
Ashley: Because they're--
Marisha: It was surprising. You haven't talked about them too much, just that they're shady.
Ashley: I left when I was very young, so a lot of them I don't really know. Okay.
Marisha: You know, we love you, and family or not, if anyone tries to fucking use you, we will--
Ashley: Thank you. Okay. I don't think it'll come to that.
Marisha: All right. I just don't want anyone taking advantage of you.
Ashley: Right.
Matt: As you're having this conversation, (thudding sounds)
Travis: (shouting) Gnomes! (pants)
Ashley: Okay. Just get ready. Let's go to the Slayer's Cake.
Taliesin: I'm walking from the cemetery. However far that is.
Ashley: They alluded to the fact that they know who Vox Machina is, which I guess in this day and age, people know who we are. Which is weird. Okay, just be prepared, because it's not like I'm embarrassed of my family or anything, I just-- they're great! I just don't really know them.
Travis: You don't know them?
Ashley: Okay, Wilhand took me out of there when I was six, so it's been a while.
Marisha: Have you kept in contact with any of them until recently?
Ashley: Not really? JB, my cousin who you'll meet in a little bit, but not really. Not really at all.
Travis: Yeah, they never came by Wilhand's.
Ashley: No, they have so many things to do.
Travis: Busy. Important.
Ashley: Busy. But just hold onto your butts. Hold onto your things. They are sneaky. Sneaky-sneaky. They like to take things, and they're fast and small and that little sleight-of-hand didn't get passed down to me, but-- oh, I'm so uncomfortable right now!
Travis: Yeah, you're sweating a lot.
Marisha: Here. And I dab her brow off a little.
Ashley: Thanks.
Marisha: Do you need anything? Do you need anything to look cool?
Travis: Do you want some deodorant? You kind of smell.
Ashley: Yeah.
Marisha: Okay. I pull out my oils that I use on Vax. Here you go. You're good. Much better.
Laura: Have we caught up with them yet?
Matt: Yeah, they've been having this conversation with them just standing in the square not far from the Slayer's Cake.
Taliesin: That's never going to get old.
Matt: It'll never get old. Yeah, so you've caught up at this point. Percy, you've just started to see them in the distance.
Taliesin: Yeah. I'm excited.
Matt: Taryon, I don't know if you're--
Sam: I'm at the Slayer's Cake. I am making blondies.
Matt: Okay. So, while you guys are having this conversation, Taryon, you hear what sounds like ruckus, laughter, conversation, voices overlapping, getting louder and louder and then suddenly the front door to the Slayer's Cake, which has been quiet this afternoon, (thud). And then, (laughs) "Oh! This place is amazing! Do you smell that? You smell that, Uncle?" And you watch as the uncle comes in. (sniffs) "Smells like rocks."
Sam: Rocks?
Matt: "He lost his smell when he was very-- it was a terrible accident. Horse hoof in the face. Anyway, hi! We're family of Pike Trickfoot, and we were told to come here and try your wares! So this is a bakery?"
Sam: In Gnomish, welcome to the store. Any family of Pike Trickfoot is family of mine. I am one of her closest friends, Taryon Darrington. Here you go. Blondies on the house for everyone to celebrate your blondie, Pike Trickfoot.
Matt: "She wasn't always blonde, you know."
Sam: Oh, I don't know that at all. What?
Matt: Yeah. I guess she wanted a change of pace. She had dark hair when she was younger.
Sam: Really?
Matt: "Astra, free treats!" And they start grabbing and filling their pockets with blondies and eating them in between.
Sam: I've got more. Sure. You can take all you want. Everything in the store is yours.
Matt: You watch as JB walks up with long, dark hair, and goes, "Do you happen to have any water?"
Sam: Of course! Doty, go fetch some water for these fine gnomes.
Matt: "Tary." Grabs and gets a small bucket of water and sets it down. You watch as JB begins breaking up the pastry and dipping it in the water and then feeding it to the uncle.
Sam: Ugh.
Matt: Occasionally has to right his face, and it's getting caught in the beard a little bit.
Sam: You know, family is everything, and I'm so pleased to meet you. Can you tell me what she was like as a child?
Matt: "Well, (chuckles) she--" At that point, the door bursts open and the rest of you arrive there at the Slayer's Cake.
Travis: Yes!
Ashley: Oh, I see you got some blondies.
Matt: "We did. Your friend here--"
Sam: Taryon Darrington.
Matt: "Taryon Darrington, who apparently speaks Gnomish-- look at you, keeping your culture. Was nice enough to give us the run of the house!"
Sam: I told them they could have anything they wanted in the place, free of charge.
Ashley: I mean, just don't get sick by having too many pastries.
Matt: (chuckles) "Oh, my dear. That's not possible."
Ashley: This is-- guys? Everybody? This is my family. This is part of my family.
Matt: "Johann Trickfoot, random tasker, at your service." He bows. The woman with the curls says, "Astra Trickfoot. This here's my lumpy husband." Elbows him in the side. "And also at your service." And glances over and does a quick scan of everybody and falls on you and gives you a wink. JB, who is currently feeding the older uncle Ogden Trickfoot, goes, "I'm JB. I'm the cousin who grew up with her the most. She's my favorite." At which point, she's been so concentrated on this, she doesn't realize she's been mashing the food into the side of Ogden's cheek. (babbling) "I'm sorry." She wipes him down.
Liam: I'm sorry. What brings you fine folk into town? Are you just visiting Pike here?
Matt: Astra goes, "Well, we travel a lot and we've heard of exploits in various towns all around. I just have not had the chance to meet Pike after all the stories I've heard, and Johann speaks of her often, and JB is pretty much obsessed with your exploits." JB's over there. "I've been keeping tabs." "So we were surprised that we were located by a courier who gave us your letter and your absolutely unnecessary but very appreciated donation to the family, and we thought it would be nice and right of us to come and thank you in person."
Ashley: Well, I'm so glad you did. How in the world did you find out that I was here?
Matt: Johann and Astra turn their heads to JB, and JB goes, "Well, I'm keeping tabs on what you've been doing. There had been word that you not only helped with the reconstruction of Emon, but you've also been traveling to and from Whitestone since the Conclave attacked the continent, so we narrowed it down between a few possibilities, and based on the fact that you, Percival-- this is your city, is that correct? We figured that given that basis, we had a good chance. We passed through Westruun and could not find you. Wilhand, however, did say that you're doing well, and we eventually made our way east, and here we are. It's good to see you."
Ashley: It's good to see you.
Travis: Do me next. What have I done?
Matt: "You're Grog Strongjaw. Yes. You're the one that apparently replaced me."
Ashley: Well--
Travis: Huh?
Matt: "You grew up together once we were not, and you're a strong half-giant of a man. The beard confuses me, but you've done many great things, I suppose. The rest of you, it is an honor to meet you. I've heard so much, and it's rare you get to meet heroes in your lifetime." (shouting) "What? I'm still hungry!"
Travis: They're so nice. I feel terrible.
Ashley: Are you guys just passing through? Where's your next destination?
Matt: Johann pops up and goes, "We're always passing through, my dear, but we figured we'd just stay for a few days. However long it takes to get to know you a little better, and then we'll be on our way."
Marisha: Did he say weeks? Did he slip that in?
Matt: "We could stay weeks, if you'd like!"
Laura: Well, you know, days might be more--
Travis: As long as you need.
Matt: "We've been traveling. We're very tired."
Travis: Pike's family is our family, really.
Sam: Agreed.
Liam: I just want to get a vibe on them. I want to do an insight check and see what I think of them.
Marisha: Can I assist him on that?
Matt: Insight you can't-- you have to make an individual insight check.
Marisha: Individuals?
Liam: Oh, jeebus. Crap. 13.
Marisha: 26.
Matt: Okay. They're hard to read, in general. They're strange. They're interesting. They're unique. But they seem to be jovial and full of personality. You get a very familiar vibe as you did with Dr. Dranzel's troupe.
Travis: Could I request one thing? Could I have a hug?
Matt: From?
Travis: Yeah, all of you at once!
Sam: A bunch of kittens on a man.
Matt: They look at each other. Johann, and then Astra rushes in. They both give you a hug, and then Astra goes, "Uncle Ogden!" She grabs Ogden and (yelps) comes over and, "I'm confused." He's being held against you, really, and you watch as JB approaches and pats you.
Travis: It's okay.
Ashley: JB? Can I talk to you for just a minute?
Matt: "Of course."
Ashley: Just step outside on the outdoor bench.
Matt: She follows you out there. "You look so pretty."
Ashley: Oh, thank you.
Matt: "You've done so many good things. I've heard so many good things. It's so good to see you."
Ashley: It's very good to see you. How have you been?
Matt: "Well, I've been watching Ogden. Traveling and seeing the sights of the countrysides of Tal'Dorei. It's life on the road."
Ashley: I know. I understand that. How are my parents?
Matt: She looks around and goes, "Well, we haven't heard from your immediate side of the family since your bastard father left for Wynandia across the sea. Good riddance. No offense."
Ashley: No. None taken.
Matt: "That was a long time ago. I was young. But no, seriously. You're not missing much with them."
Ashley: Can I insight check her?
Matt: Go for it.
Ashley: Oh no. 13?
Matt: 13? She seems guarded and hard to read, but legit.
Ashley: Okay. Well. Have you guys, in your travels-- you know who Scanlan Shorthalt is, I'm sure?
Matt: She lights up and goes, "Yes, I've heard of him. Is he around?"
Ashley: He's not around.
Matt: "Oh. Okay, but I've heard of him. I've heard of his exploits. (chuckles) As I've asked around, he's left quite a trail of ladies through the years."
Ashley: He definitely has.
Matt: "They have a lot to say about him."
Ashley: Yes.
Matt: "Bit of a scoundrel, that one."
Ashley: Such a scoundrel.
Laura: God, she's so weird. (laughter)
Laura: It makes me so uncomfortable.
Ashley: All right, well, let's go back inside.
Matt: "Of course. I'm glad we had this bonding time."
Ashley: Me, too.
Matt: "You want to come, right?" She grabs your arms and tugs a little bit. You get a very faint sense of mild arrested development that makes you a little uncomfortable.
Ashley: Yeah.
Matt: She walks inside with you with her arm on your shoulder, and as you come back inside, the hug seems to have pulled away from Grog for a second, but the laughter is billowing from the room, and Johann, at this point, is mid-story to Grog. "And that's the craziest thing! She was so small, but could yet poop so much."
Travis: I love it!
Matt: "It's incredible!"
Travis: That's my favorite kind of people. Big pooper!
Matt: "If we could have painted a picture, you wouldn't know where she put it away! But that's another story."
Ashley: Oh, well, we don't need to keep saying these things. You know, if you guys would like to stay just for a few days, because we're going to be leaving.
Travis: No, we're not. We're here for a long time.
Ashley: We have a lot of stuff to do.
Laura: Trip coming up.
Matt: "Of course! Days. Weeks was invited here, of course, but--"
Laura: She doesn't actually live here.
Marisha: I'm a guest, foreigner, just like you. Passing through. Traveling on.
Ashley: I think we have a thing that we have to go fight, and we have so many things that we have to do.
Travis: We just got done fighting all the things. We're settling here.
Laura: (groans)
Ashley: We have some things planned.
Matt: Astra steps forward and takes your hand and she goes, "It's all right, dear. We're not going to stay longer to make it uncomfortable. I'm sorry about these folks."
Ashley: No, no.
Matt: "I married into the Trickfoots. I'm not bound to the same ridiculousness as these guys, so don't worry."
Ashley: Okay.
Marisha: Can I insight check that?
Matt: Sure.
Marisha: I don't trust your "married in this bullshit" shit. 20, total.
Matt: 20 total?
Taliesin: Yeah!
Laura: I bet she's at the helm!
Taliesin: Happy new year, everybody.
Laura: I don't like her winking at Percy!
Taliesin: While we're whispering about things--
Sam: We have a great new shirt in the store. It says Vox Machina.
Laura: (silly accent) If you could get a close-up, you would see all of the Vox Machina's made of a different weapon that Vox Machina uses.
Taliesin: That was amazing.
Ashley: Well, why don't you guys stay in my place, and I'll take care of you guys while you're here? Just explore the town, and when we're getting ready to go, I'll let you know, and you guys can go on your merry way.
Matt: "That sounds fantastic."
Ashley: Okay.
Matt: "It's so happy to have the Trickfoots together again."
Ashley: It's just so great.
Matt: "So where are we all staying?"
Ashley: Well, you can stay at my place.
Matt: "Fantastic! Wondrous. Show us along! We have things to unload."
Ashley: Okay.
Laura: Do you want to grab any of the last bit of pastries for the day? Obviously, free treats today.
Sam: Oh, but don't fill up, because I assume we're all going to have dinner tonight together, right?
All: Yeah.
Ashley: Yeah, let's have dinner.
Matt: "Wonderful. I love it. I love it!"
Laura: Free treats today! Just today. Just today, free treats for the family. After that, no free treats.
Matt: As you're saying this, Uncle Ogden has stepped forward again and JB is like, "Uncle Ogden?" He (grunts) and reaches out and finds the edge of your cheek and chin and he drops his cane, pulls his glasses off, and you see these tiny, dark beady eyes between the wrinkles and he goes, "Pike."
Ashley: Hi.
Matt: "It's so good to see you."
Ashley: It's so good to see you.
Matt: "Thank you. You're a good one." He puts his glasses back on and reaches out, and JB picks up a stick and hands it to him. He's like, "Thank you."
Ashley: Thank you, Uncle Ogden.
Laura: Does it look like he really needs that cane?
Matt: You want to make an insight check? (laughter)
Matt: Sure, go for it.
Travis: Kick the cane out, see what happens. Do you need this? Boom!
Laura: I think it looks like he really needs it.
Matt: You genuinely feel bad for even having that second thought. (laughter)
Laura: I do. I feel really terrible.
Sam: In my broken Gnome, I tell him  it's an honor to mate you. (laughter)
Matt: His head spins for a second. He smiles, and in Gnomish back to you, he says, "Oh. It's been a while."
Sam: I love him.
Ashley: Well, should we get some dinner? Are you guys hungry, or have you filled up on pastries?
Matt: "Oh!" You watch as Johann spits out the pastry. "Always hungry!"
Ashley: Okay, great. Well, let's have a delicious dinner.
Marisha: We could always go hunting for our dinner. Classic way.
Laura: That's how we do it in Whitestone. You have to hunt if you want to eat. That's how we do it here.
Matt: "Is that how you got your pastries?"
Laura: Well, hunting for any kind of meat. Pastries you pay for.
Ashley: For the meat pies.
Matt: "Well, we're not hunters, so I guess we'll stay here until you finish hunting. You know we're not hunters. We've never been hunters. Trickfoots don't hunt."
Ashley: We can-- (sighs).
Sam: Let's go freshen up for dinner.
Ashley: We'll go freshen up for dinner.
Matt: "Not a bad idea. I could use a bath, actually. How about you, Astra?" Astra's like, "Oh, I'd love a bath right now. I've been on the road for so long." And JB goes, "Uncle could really use a bath."
Ashley: Uncle could use a bath, I know.
Travis: He could. He smells like cheese.
Ashley: All right. I'll walk you guys. Let's walk to my place.
Matt: "Very well. Show us along!"
Laura: I want to whisper to you as we walk back to the house: don't give them any more free things, all right?
Sam: What? I thought they were Pike's people.
Laura: Yeah, they're great. They're wonderful, but no more free stuff. Just today, but no more after that.
Sam: Okay. Of course. I'm sorry if I was out of line.
Laura: Of course not. You're so generous.
Sam: I love you.
Laura: I love you so much.
Liam: I'm hooking Kiki by the arm. Hey, you've got that look in your eye.
Marisha: I just don't like it when people try to take advantage of my friends, but they're family, and if anyone is in need, I don't want to potentially put them out.
Liam: But you think they're a little bit hinky? That's a yes.
Marisha: We can just keep an eye out. I'm protective.
Taliesin: Pike, if you need anything, just let me know. And I completely understand the awkward position you're currently being put in.
Ashley: Oh god, it's so awkward! I just don't know. Thank you, Percy. I'll let you know if there's anything that I need.
Taliesin: Keep an eye on the odd one.
Ashley: Which one? Because they're all odd.
Taliesin: JB. She reminds me of me at that age. That's not a good thing.
Marisha: I say to Vax  Just keep an eye on the odd one, all right?
Taliesin: See if you notice an interest.
Travis: Pike, are there any more coming?
Taliesin: If you notice an interest in that one, please let me know. Maybe I could figure out what she's interested in and show her around, maybe.
Ashley: Okay. That's a great idea. So this is all of you, then, that came? You guys have been traveling around, just yourselves?
Travis: Got any more of you coming?
Matt: "Not coming with us. The Trickfoots tend to scatter on their own."
Travis: Like bunnies.
Matt: "Yeah, sure. We'll go with that one. Yeah, not everyone can be trusted in the family."
Ashley: Yeah.
Matt: "It's frustrating. The people that you care for and spend your life hitting behind betray that trust, and good riddance to them."
Ashley: Oh. Well, is there anything you would like to see while you're here?
Matt: They all look back at JB, who lights up again and goes, "Everything."
Ashley: Okay. Well, is there anyone in particular you would like to give you a tour?
Matt: JB is like, "Well, I--" And Johann goes, "I feel like if we don't choose him, we're going to get squashed." (laughter)
Matt: You can see a moment of heartbreak and JB goes, "Very well."
Travis: Yes!
Matt: "Mr. Strongjaw, you may show us around."
Travis: Yeah. You won't regret that choice.
Ashley: All right, come with me. You can come to my place, freshen up before dinner, and we'll have a great time.
Matt: "Great! Great. Now, to the baths. How big are your baths? Are they huge? Are they human-sized baths? Are they bigger than human-sized baths?"
Liam: Not quite big enough. (laughter)
Laura: You don't know.
Matt: "You!" All right, so you show them up to the castle, which I assume is where you're letting them stay.
Laura: They're staying in the castle?
Taliesin: The guards have generally been alerted to be wary, kind, polite, and less important that they stop them from doing anything too terrible, more to the point that they just write it down and report it immediately. (laughter)
Taliesin: Unless anyone's doing something terrible, or going somewhere they really shouldn't.
Matt: Right. Okay. That information is easily distributed throughout the Pale Guard, without issue.
Liam: "I guess that silverware wasn't so important."
Taliesin: Oh, we're bringing out the moderate silverware.
Ashley: That's a good idea. That's a great idea.
Laura: All the good silver is hidden. Hidden up high.
Matt: Because there are only within the castle at any given time, four baths. Four rooms that contain full baths. Occasionally, you have to wait for a person, but they immediately scatter. Three of them are taken.
Ashley: Okay. We might have to wait a little bit.
Matt: You wait a while. Eventually, they one by one start making their way down to the main banquet hall of the castle. Cleaned up. You watch as Johann comes down, wearing his same clothing that appears to have been cleaned. "Wow! I'm appreciative that you have servants here that can do such a nice job with such fine family threads." His mustache is done perfectly. His hair is still slick and wet from the bath, combed over. "Well, thank you. It's in the blood."
Ashley: (chuckles) It sure is.
Matt: He turns around. "Astra? What's taking her so long?" Walks back out to the stairway and rushes past the guards, his little gnomish head dodging by their knees, almost. He goes, (shouting) "Astra!" You hear a voice go, (shouting) "I'm almost done! Wait and be patient!" He goes back. "She'll be down in a moment. Don't worry. In the meantime, is there an appetizer course?"
Ashley: Sure. Why don't you take a seat, and order whatever you want, on me.
Matt: "You're so generous!" He pinches your cheek. He waltzes over to the table, sits down and grabs the fork and knife. "Two bottles of red, and... ooh, what vintage have you?" He begins talking with the servants about what various wines are available.
Laura: I'm just going to pop into the kitchen.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: And tell the staff in the kitchen obviously, you can make whatever you want. I'm just hoping maybe you don't make it too tasty tonight. Nothing too extravagant. You know, nice, but average. Right?
Matt: The servants that are there, the whole waitstaff and kitchen staff go, "Of course, milady."
Laura: Nothing great.
Matt: "A curious request, but one we will fulfill to our greatest ability."
Laura: Thank you so much. Lots of salad, lots of very dry, hard meat. Turnips. Lots of turnips.
Taliesin: Heavy food.
Laura: Yeah.
Sam: I'm going to pop into the kitchen after she's done. (laughter)
Sam: All right, family's here tonight, so everything has to be on its best, all right? The best stuff we have in this kitchen. These are Trickfoots. We have to treat them right, and we have to treat them well.
Matt: The staff stops and goes, "Friend Taryon, I'm sorry, but the lady requested specifically that the meal not be--"
Sam: What lady?
Matt: "Lady Vex'ahlia."
Sam: She was being polite. These are good people. They need to be treated--
Matt: Make a persuasion check. You're asking them to override the word of the lady of the house. SAM One. (laughter)
Matt: He goes, "I am sorry, but--"
Sam: Who's your manager?
Matt: "The lady you're speaking about."
Sam: Oh, you're right. She is your manager.
Liam: Tary, you have Luck!
Taliesin: Back to the pool house with you.
Sam: I do have Luck.
Laura: (groans) No!
Sam: What am I doing?
Matt: Persuasion.
Laura: No.
Sam: That's 24.
Taliesin: Oh!
Matt: He goes, "But if you say it's the word of Lady Vex'ahlia--"
Sam: These are Trickfoots, man. Trickfoots! Treat them as you would your own mother.
Matt: "I'm so confused. We'll do our best. Holy shit." You see this internal struggle. "Everyone! Fine meat's back on the menu. Sorry." And the staff goes, (groans) and starts throwing shit out that they were halfway working on and starting from scratch.
Sam: I go out and grab Vex. Little EG, what are you doing? You told them to give them bad food tonight? These are Trickfoots! We have to treat them with honor and respect.
Laura: Tary! Ugh.
Taliesin: You said what?
Laura: Okay, look. All right. If your father came, and you dislike him very much, right?
Sam: I would give him the best.
Laura: Oh shit. Okay, bad comparison. These people suck. They're mean--
Sam: What are you talking about? They've been nothing but nice. They've showered her with kisses and affection. It's affection that I've never even seen in a family before!
Laura: Tary, dear. Darling. They don't treat her very well, and they'll use her, and they'll stay here and keep taking advantage of her, and we don't want that.
Sam: But I get to practice my Gnome.
Laura: Well, that's true. You can practice as much as you want over the next couple of days, but we don't want to impress them. The more they like it, the longer they'll stay.
Taliesin: They'll figure out that the poor food-- I feel like they're clever enough for that one. Best to feed them well, at least.
Laura: Really?
Taliesin: I know.
Sam: I'll back off.
Laura: Thank you.
Taliesin: Continue to be charming.
Sam: Always.
Travis: I walk into the kitchen. I go, okay. Listen up! I need peanut butter, I need turkey legs, eggs, cheese. (laughter)
Sam: "Those are all the foods I know."
Travis: Chop chop!
Matt: The servants all stop and go, (sighs). "Yes, Grand Poobah." (laughter)
Matt: Throw out what they were finishing and begin to make eggs, getting the cheese ready, and all the hearty pork meats. And the peanut butter.
Marisha: It's a Charlie Brown Thanksgiving.
Laura: Spaghetti-Os.
Marisha: Popcorn.
Ashley: Just great. I run over to Percy really quickly. (whispering) Percy?
Taliesin: Yes?
Ashley: I just wanted to... apologize in advance for whatever may happen in the next few days.
Taliesin: I'm so excited for the calamity that's about to be brought down upon my house.
Ashley: Okay.
Taliesin: There is nothing, short of full dragon apocalypse at this point, that could faze us. We can live through this. We'll be fine.
Ashley: Okay.
Laura: I come up and I give her a hug from behind and say: We will never judge you for your blood, dear.
Ashley: Okay. Again, I'm not embarrassed.
Laura: Of course not. They're great. They seem wonderful.
Ashley: Yeah. Yeah, they do.
Taliesin: To be fair, I've also already started drinking.
Ashley: Oh great. Okay, I'll join you.
Taliesin: I pull out the flask of Courage that I've brought.
Sam: Flask of Courage?
Laura: You got more Courage?
Taliesin: Oh, there's a lot of Courage. We make it every year.
Ashley: I take a big gulp. All the gulps.
Matt: It burns. It burns so good.
Ashley: (grunts)
Taliesin: It burns a lot.
Ashley: It does.
Taliesin: You're going to get drunk, but you're not going to get sleepy.
Laura: Oh, that's going to feel good in this area.
Travis: You won't get sleepy.
Taliesin: Let's do this.
Ashley: Let's go eat.
Matt: As you guys all find yourselves ready, the Trickfoots also begin to fill in to the banquet hall. The servants provide a fantastic spread of heartily cooked pork meats, peanut butter fresh from the jar, piles of cheeses.
Laura: I thought you asked--
Sam: This is not what I asked for.
Ashley: This is comfort food in Whitestone.
Taliesin: We thought we would give you the cornucopia of our experience.
Laura: I take a big spoon of peanut butter.
Matt: Johann gives a curious eye and goes, "Well, who are we to scoff at the cultures of others? Let's dig in, everyone!" And immediately he goes in. Astra begins eating, as well. JB takes a bite and then prepares a bite for Uncle Ogden, who is in the process of staring at the table strangely. Eventually the spoon finds its way there.
Taliesin: Well, that's the next 30 minutes.
Matt: As this is happening, Johann begins asking questions. "So! This is your castle?"
Ashley: Is this my castle?
Matt: JB is like, "No, it's not her castle. It's his castle. She's just staying here, for now."
Taliesin: Technically, it's my sister's castle, but certainly.
Matt: At which point, Cassandra comes in from the back, arms crossed. She wanders in. "Brother?"
Taliesin: That's code. Yes?
Matt: "Everything all right, brother?"
Taliesin: Yes, fine.
Matt: "Very well, I'll be in my chambers if you require anything."
Laura: You're sure you don't want to join us, Cass?
Matt: "I'm fine. I'm a bit tired. It's been a long night. But whoever you are, welcome to Whitestone." She looks back to Percival.
Taliesin: The Trickfoot clan.
Matt: "Ah."
Marisha: And Keyleth goes-- ASHLEY If she looks over at me, I'm going--
Matt: "I would love to welcome you all to Whitestone. You are guests of ours if you are guests of hers. We'll talk later."
Taliesin: Absolutely.
Matt: She makes her way back up the stairs. You watch as Trish, who's her bodyguard on this shift, follows her up.
Laura: She's still here? Trish.
Ashley: Trish the Dish.
Travis: Trish the Dish.
Matt: She's one of two shift personal guards of Cassandra.
Ashley: I'm going to sit next to Ogden.
Matt: Okay.
Ashley: JB, I can feed him for a little bit if you'd like to look around or something, or talk to anybody here? Who do you really want to talk to?
Matt: "You. We have so much to catch up on. It's been a long time."
Ashley: Is there someone in Vox Machina that you really love?
Matt: She looks around. There's this long, awkward pause as she keeps looking over Vox Machina again and again, but not making any eye contact with Grog, and eventually goes, "I suppose Lady Vex'ahlia." Hands the spoon over to you.
Ashley: Okay. Well, I'm sure she would love to talk to you. She's very inviting, very friendly.
Matt: "Should I just go sit?"
Ashley: Sure.
Matt: "Okay." She gets up from the table. Johann's still talking. He's telling stories. "We Trickfoots. For generations, we've been problem-solvers. We rove from place to place, solving problems across the countrysides. If you have a squeaky wheel, we fix the wheel. If you have a squeaky door, we fix the door."
Travis: Amazing.
Matt: "If you have a squeaky tax man, we fix the tax man. That's a joke! That's a joke. You can laugh. See, there you are."
Travis: They kill the tax man.
Sam: Everybody hates taxes.
Matt: As this conversation's happening, there's a small bowl of what looks to be some of the pork, but it's been soaked in some water or wine, and it's been mashed or pre-chewed. You're not quite sure. But you have the spoon there, and you have Uncle Ogden sitting there going--
Ashley: I start speaking to him in Underdark because I haven't spoken that in a while. Ogden? How are you liking traveling with everybody? With Johann and Astra and JB?
Matt: His ear perks up a little bit and he goes, "I haven't heard that talk in a long time." His head turns slightly towards you, but he's still looking off a little bit from under the glasses.
Sam: Is this Undercommon?
Ashley: Underdark.
Sam: Underdark?
Matt: It would be considered Undercommon.
Ashley: It's Undercommon? Okay.
Sam: I'm listening.
Laura: I'm reading their lips.
Matt: Do you understand Undercommon? Okay, then yeah. He looks back and goes, "It's been travel. They take care of me. We're here now." His hand reaches over and grabs your hand and holds it for a second. He goes, "We're here now to protect you."
Ashley: Protect me from what?
Matt: "From the curse."
Ashley: What do you mean?
Matt: "I've been having visions of you. An angel of light swallowed by dark."
Ashley: Okay. Are these just dreams?
Matt: "They come often, and the dreams that come often generally come to pass. There is a curse in our blood, and we wish to save you from that curse." His fingers tighten a little bit on your hand. Not in a painful way, but an emphatic hold. "I'm worried for you. You're the only good one." His hand releases your hand. He drools a little bit and wipes it with his hand. (laughter)
Ashley: I take a spoon of peanut butter. It's a little bit easier. Here you go.
Sam: Like Mr. Ed.
Ashley: Yep.
Matt: It dribbles out a little bit. "Unexpected."
Ashley: Sorry, the mix between the pork and peanut butter. It's an interesting mix, but it's Grog's favorite.
Matt: "It's good."
Ashley: It's a good mix!
Matt: You see him smiling now.
Ashley: Can you tell me about Astra? How did she come into the picture?
Matt: "Astra met Johann about ten years ago. He needed someone to nail him down. Spry, wily, prone to terrible choices. He's a stupid boy. Stupid, stupid boy." At which point, Johann, who's been talking, stops and goes, in Undercommon, "I can hear you, Dad. Anyway!" "She's good to him. If she breaks his heart, I'll kill her."
Ashley: There you go. And any word from my family? My mother, anything? It's been a long time since I talked to them.
Matt: "They absconded east and got in a little trouble."
Ashley: That makes sense.
Matt: "It's just like my brother to do that. He's the one who held the stupid gene on our generation."
Ashley: Yep.
Matt: "I'm tired now."
Ashley: Okay.
Matt: At which point, JB, who's been over there talking with you and asking questions about the castle and what accommodations there are, sees Uncle Ogden get up. "Oh, Uncle, I'll help you. I'm so sorry, Lady Vex'ahlia." She stands up and walks around and grabs the elbow. "Uncle Ogden, are you tired?"
Ashley: I can have someone take him, if you'd like to stay?
Matt: "He's very fragile. If you'd trust anyone to take him?"
Laura: I can do it, dear.
Ashley: Well. Yeah. You would like to stay with him?
Matt: "It's what I'm used to, but if Lady Vex'ahlia--"
Laura: I would love to. I think your cousin wants to speak with you.
Ashley: Great.
Matt: At which point, as soon as you say that, she smiles brightly and goes, "Actually, yes."
Laura: Yes.
Ashley: Okay.
Laura: Be on your guard, dear.
Ashley: Okay, I will. Check your pockets.
Laura: Always.
Matt: She sits down next to you and begins asking about, "I can't believe that you stepped into the same ridiculousness that Wilhand did and it's brought you all this. We just thought he was an old coot."
Ashley: Well, he's all I've known and he's wonderful. He's my family, since I left, and I'm sorry I haven't really contacted you guys.
Matt: "It's all right. We make ourselves scarce on purpose."
Ashley: Yeah. Well, so you've been taking care of Ogden?
Matt: "We've been helping out, but mostly me, yeah."
Ashley: Has he told you anything that he dreams about?
Matt: You can see that she stiffens up a little bit. "So he's already told you."
Ashley: Yes.
Matt: "I don't want to ruin an evening that's going so well, but he's had visions. I'm worried about you. When we got your letter that-- we didn't know how to find you. We didn't think that you were in the area. When your letter found us, we thought maybe you weren't that far away, so we began to search our way along the Silver Cut."
Ashley: Okay. Can I insight check her again?
Matt: Yeah, go for it.
Ashley: I can't figure out what's going on. Ugh, balls. Oh, wait. 16?
Matt: She's hard to read, in general. Even when she was a kid, she was an odd duck. She seems genuine.
Ashley: Okay. Well, how's everybody feeling? Are you tired? Are you full? Is it bedtime? What's going on?
Sam: I could talk to these people all night long.
Ashley: Well.
Sam: But if we should turn in?
Matt: You see Astra, who's been drinking deep of one of the two fine bottles of red wine, is drunkenly leaning with her arm around Johann's arm. He's a little tipsy, but he's still in conversation, talking to Grog. He's telling embarrassing story after embarrassing story, and since you're so eager and no one else really wants to pay him as much mind. He's talking to the table, but he's mainly focusing on you.
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: As you begin helping Ogden, who, as you grab his arm, he's shaking, and he has his cane as he moves along. His skin is very loose.
Laura: Ogden, would you like me to help carry you, or are you all right to walk?
Matt: "I can walk under my own power."
Laura: Of course you can. Feel free to lean on me, though.
Matt: "At the stairs."
Laura: All right.
Matt: He's still looking off. As soon as you get to the stairs, he gets about two steps and has to stop and breathe, and another two stairs.
Laura: I put my arm down so he can put as much weight as he wants.
Matt: He leans into it and you eventually help him up the staircase that spirals up to the second floor and eventually lead him to his chambers.
Laura: All right, and I start talking to him on the way to his room in Undercommon. And ask him: How long have you guys been on the road?
Matt: "Always."
Laura: Always?
Matt: "By nature, we don't really put down roots." Big old smile as he says roots, darkened, some broken teeth. Heinous smell.
Laura: Peanut butter and pork.
Matt: Yep.
Laura: I couldn't help but overhear you talking to Pike about dreams you've been having.
Matt: "Yes. Dreams."
Laura: What kind of dreams?
Matt: "Terrible premonitions."
Laura: Like what?
Matt: At this point, he stops and looks up towards you as you're holding his arm, and he reaches up and pulls the glasses shakily from the front of his face and through his small dark brown beady eyes, you see the whites at the sides are bloodshot. He glances up and goes, "The kinds of dreams that end a bloodline."
Laura: Well, that sounds terrible.
Matt: "We're trying to find a way to stop it."
Laura: Well, that's good. I would like to stop it, as well. We all love Pike very much.
Matt: "Good. Then we came at the right time."
Laura: Can I insight check him?
Matt: Go for it.
Laura: That was almost. 21? 21.
Sam: Whispers!
Laura: Yes!
Sam: So, Taliesin, what's the V? What's the V on this shirt?
Taliesin: The V on this shirt?
Liam: It's a book.
Taliesin: That looks to be a tome of some sort.
Sam: Who is represented by a book?
Liam: The whole top row is reserved for Matthew.
Sam: Oh, okay. And what's the M in Machina?
Taliesin: It appears to be some sort of very naturalistic bow and arrow.
Sam: Who would that correspond to?
Taliesin: Scanlan, I imagine.
Sam: Oh, yeah. That makes sense. And the A?
Taliesin: The A appears to be a bird's mask and a pistol.
Sam: Also Scanlan.
Taliesin: Also Scanlan.
Sam: Yeah, sure. And the C?
Taliesin: The C is some sort of natural wooden crest of some kind.
Liam: That's Grog taint.
Sam: Oh.
Taliesin: In fact, this is entirely Grog and Scanlan, which I think, it's about time.
Laura: Well, Ogden. Are you all right getting into your bed? Do you need any help with that?
Matt: "If you can get me to the edge of it, I can manage."
Laura: Well, of course. I hope you know that we're here for you, with whatever you need, as long as we're all here to help Pike. We love her like family, as well.
Matt: "Good. She can use some family."
Laura: Yes. Dark tidings.
Matt: "Dark tidings, indeed."
Laura: Are we talking like falling into a pit or are we talking like-- I'm going to walk him to the bed and maybe like--
Matt: (raspy grunt) He gets up and leans the stick off to the side, and it (thudding noise) onto the ground.
Laura: I'll crouch down and start untying his little boots.
Matt: "That's all right. I can get that."
Laura: I don't mind.
Matt: He leans back and lets you do it.
Laura: What kind of dark things are we talking?
Matt: "There's a legend in the Trickfoots. Every generation, one is born with the blood curse. One that carries with it the anger of someone slighted when we first became Trickfoots. Maybe it's superstition, but every one of these individuals died a horrible, painful death, screaming of a shadow that came for them. It's a myth, I know, but these dreams are real, and I'd rather be careful and wrong than careless and right."
Laura: Do you see the shadow in your dreams?
Matt: "Shapeless. Dark. Eyes like burning coals."
Laura: Does that sound like the smoke demon that we saw come out of Percy? Anything like that?
Matt: Shapeless, black shadow with red eyes sounds similar, but Orthax was generally black smoke. Had form, and the eyes were more of a yellow.
Taliesin: The John Doe of demons, really.
Laura: All right. How long have you been having these dreams?
Matt: "Months."
Laura: Have you ever witnessed it happen before? Have you had the dreams about anyone else?
Matt: "Only once. I was very young."
Laura: And they died.
Matt: "My brother."
Laura: Really?
Matt: Theobold.
Laura: And do you know who it is the Trickfoots slighted in this myth?
Matt: "I don't know. This whole family is paranoid and guards their secrets from each other. Anyway."
Laura: I wish you a dreamless sleep. And he's out. (laughter)
Liam: Random question. Do we see an obvious family resemblance with Pike and any of them?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Sam: They all have a giant birthmark on their face. (laughter)
Liam: 24.
Matt: As you've been paying attention to them most of dinner. Mannerisms, everything. There are some similarities.
Liam: Facial features, I mean.
Matt: Yeah. They're not direct family. They're cousins, uncle-- they're once removed from her central nuclear family. But you do see similarities in cheekbone structure, at least with Johann, Ogden, and JB. Moreso with JB. It's hard with the mustache with Johann. But there are some similarities between JB and Pike, and you can't help but envision these two cute little gnome children playing together. These two dark-haired female gnomes running around, and there may have been an age when they could have been hard to tell apart from each other.
Laura: Ooh.
Sam: Swapped at birth?
Laura: I know, right?
Marisha: Freaky Friday!
Ashley: Oh man. Okay.
Matt: As Johann picks up Astra. "Anyway, it's been a fantastic meal. I appreciate your hospitality, and I look forward to this grand tour you promised tomorrow."
Travis: Oh, yeah. Anything you want to see, as long as you've got more of those stories.
Matt: "Oh, I've got loads."
Taliesin: I'm going to sneak next to JB really quickly.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: If you want a more proper and private tour of the city, consider the offer open. Just think about where you'd want to start. The offer does stand, though. Have a good evening.
Matt: As you say this to her, she glances back and says, "Very well. Under the needs of being upfront, as well, I want you to know that I'm not interested." (laughter)
Travis: Thank you. That's what it totally sounded like.
Laura: It did sound like you were fucking flirting.
Travis: You want a proper tour of deez nuts? (laughter)
Taliesin: I don't think he's figured out what she's talking about.
Matt: I don't think he has, either, no.
Taliesin: Oh. I'm sorry, I thought that maybe you'd want to see the-- and the-- oh. Very well, then.
Matt: She looks over at Grog and goes, "Perhaps a tour is in order, but just no. I'm not interested."
Taliesin: In the tour?
Matt: "In the tour, yes."
Taliesin: Oh! Yeah. I mean, no. Yes. No. (laughter)
Liam: Smooth as butter.
Matt: She gets up and walks away. "Good night, everyone. Good night, Pike."
Taliesin: How did she do that?
Matt: Eventually, all the gnomes have left and you're all there, dumbfounded, at the dinner table.
Laura: I come back down.
Ashley: Check your pockets! Check your pockets.
Laura: I had no valuables on me at all.
Sam: I have everything that I own on me. Am I missing anything?
Laura: I check my hair to make sure my brooch is still in it.
Marisha: I check my pouch and make sure my antlers are still there.
Matt: You guys scan through, pat yourselves down. Everything's in place.
Sam: I think they're lovely.
Marisha: And I liked seeing you being bested. Regardless of the people, it's still fun seeing you being bested.
Taliesin: Cheap shot, at best.
Liam: You are very different from them.
Ashley: Yes.
Liam: They are quirky.
Laura: I mean, you're quirky.
Ashley: Yeah, but I mean, I haven't seen them in a very long time. Since I was but a kid.
Liam: Why did Pom-Pom take you out of there?
Ashley: Well, because he was different and had a different life plan and because he became a cleric and was the first of-- I don't know how far back. I don't even know.
Liam: And older than all of them.
Ashley: Yeah. And he saw that I was and decided-- we left. He took me when I was little, and we left. There was a lot that happened, but I didn't know where they were because they travel.
Liam: They just got here, but what's your feel on this?
Ashley: I don't know. I heard some things with some discussions I had tonight, and I need to figure out if they're true or not. We'll figure out in the next few days, just to see what's going on.
Sam: This dream that the old one talked about, does that worry you?
Ashley: How do you know about that?
Liam: You don't know that.
Laura: He does. He was listening in.
Liam: Oh, that's right.
Laura: I actually talked to him a little bit about that, as well.
Ashley: You did?
Laura: Yeah.
Taliesin: A dream? What dream?
Ashley: What did he say?
Laura: He said that there was a thing in your family. A blood curse. He seemed honest enough when he was saying it. Said that people paid the price for a slight someone made a long time ago, and certain members of your family are cursed, and he's had these premonitions, these dreams, before. It was his brother who passed away a long time ago.
Ashley: Yes, this is a thing.
Laura: Have you heard about this?
Matt: You haven't because you haven't been with most of the Trickfoots for most of your life.
Ashley: Okay.
Matt: You've been with Wilhand since you were very young. You said six. He's not been eager to talk about the family. You can see he resents the Trickfoot clan, so you haven't heard of this, but you also know very little about them.
Laura: Wilhand never discussed it with you?
Marisha: No premonitions of a curse from Wilhand?
Ashley: He didn't talk about the family. He wanted to be separate from them and he didn't want me to be influenced by them at all.
Marisha: Hang on. I don't mean to question everything, but Wilhand defected from the whole family and became a cleric, but he never mentioned anything of a curse? Why did he become a cleric?
Taliesin: I see your reasoning.
Marisha: That seems like a dichotomy there.
Taliesin: It actually makes perfect sense to me.
Travis: He likes helping people.
Marisha: Or he's terrified of some superstitious curse. Maybe both?
Ashley: Maybe both.
Liam: We trust you, and Wilhand raised you, so Wilhand must have his head screwed on straight.
Taliesin: I'm going to say you're in a room of people who were raised by-- at least 60 percent of the time, ridiculous people who have their head screwed on straight.
Marisha: That's accurate.
Laura: Maybe we should ask him about it?
Liam: That's where I was going. Is there any merit in trying to get a hold of Wilhand right now, while they're here?
Ashley: Can we, from here?
Matt: He's in Westruun right now. It is also late in the evening.
Marisha: I can get us anywhere very quickly.
Sam: Tomorrow we should go visit him?
Laura: Yeah.
Liam: Yeah. I don't think they're going to burn down the castle.
Laura: Maybe while they're taking a tour, we bamf to Westruun for just a minute.
Taliesin: I don't necessarily know if-- do you want to bamf, or do you just want to talk? We can probably just talk to him, or maybe we could have him sent for.
Liam: Do you remember our conversations with Wilhand when we were in Westruun?
Taliesin: Yeah.
Liam: They were a little squirrely.
Taliesin: I'm a little worried about leaving them here unattended.
Laura: Some of us can stay.
Marisha: I think it would be a half-and-half situation.
Laura: Split the party!
All: Split the party!
Ashley: We could. As you guys know, Wilhand is a little-- he's in his older years.
Laura: We'll try to keep it quick.
Ashley: But we could try to keep it quick.
Laura: In and out, ask him a few questions.
Marisha: And Wilhand is the brother of Ogden?
Laura: No.
Liam: No, he's older than that.
Matt: Yeah, Wilhand is older than Ogden.
Marisha: Wilhand's older than Ogden?!
Ashley: Wilhand's older than Ogden.
Marisha: I thought Ogden was as old as life itself!
Travis: No, Ogden did a lot of drugs when he was younger.
Laura: Ogden's had a hard life.
Sam: He's got to be at least 150 or 200 years old.
Matt: Ogden looks like he's older, but his physicality is not based on age as much as it's based on--
Marisha: He had a Mick Jagger lifestyle.
Matt: Something akin to that, I guess you'd say.
Marisha: All right.
Taliesin: Or at least a Tom Waits one.
Matt: Yeah.
Ashley: Let's circle back tomorrow.
Marisha: All right.
Ashley: And while they're doing the tour, maybe we can pop over real quick and I think that would be better than him seeing them here.
Liam: Even as an outsider, that seems a little ugh.
Ashley: Yeah.
Taliesin: Grog, you'll take the loud ones tomorrow and I'll take the quiet ones?
Travis: Wait, what? I thought I get them all.
Taliesin: Do you want to get them all?
Travis: Yeah, don't they want all to be on my tour?
Laura: Maybe you could do the tour together?
Marisha: Maybe you could do a Grog tour and then a Percy tour.
Liam: Or you could assist Grog.
Taliesin: Because you asked so nicely. Also, I was thinking the carpet might be a fine way of moving them around the city.
Laura: Oh! That is actually a wonderful idea.
Ashley: They would be pretty fascinated by that.
Laura: Quite distracted.
Liam: You know, the Grand Poobah needs an assistant.
Travis: Oh. Perhaps.
Liam: It's only befitting of your station that Percival aid you in such a fashion.
Travis: Yes. Quite.
Marisha: The two masters of the city. Of course.
Travis: My history of the city is unrivaled.
Taliesin: I will definitely agree that there are sections of this city I would absolutely agree that you are the master of, at this point.
Travis: Thank you. (laughter)
Taliesin: (sighs) It's going to be a lot of brothels and bars.
Marisha: "And this was my first hook-up, and this was the scene of my second hook-up."
Travis: Yeah. This is a big tree.
Matt: I'm excited for this.
Taliesin: I am so excited for this.
Matt: So, as you all eventually find yourselves resting for the evening, contemplating the plans to take first thing in the morning, we'll go ahead and close tonight's episode there. We'll pick this up next week.
Laura: Wait, you're not going to be here next week?
Ashley: I will. I'll just be a little late.
Marisha: Sprinting from the airport.
Ashley: Yeah.
Laura: Cool.
Taliesin: We'll do the tour first, while you guys are off freaking out with the--
Marisha: Bamfing?
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: We'll stall if we need to. We'll make it happen. All righty, guys. Well, thank you so much for watching tonight. I hope you enjoyed it as much as we did.
Marisha: We're all a year older now!
Laura: Oh my gosh.
Marisha: We're older!
Travis: Grog is 14.
Matt: We'll be back here next Thursday, 7PM Pacific, as usual. Until then, have a wonderful weekend and is it Thursday yet? Good night, guys.
Marisha: Go buy t-shirts! [music]

Sam: Hey, that's good news!
Laura: That's good news. Also good news is that some stuff is out of stock in the store, but all of it is going to the manufacturers right now, so things are getting made! So things'll be back in stock very soon.
Sam: Laura, is something wrong with your head?
Laura: And! Actually, I think that's about it. There's still like, the shirts. Some sizes are available but some of them are out of stock, and that's all being reprinted. So you guys, it'll be back in the store very soon. Go check out the store!
Travis: That was the bubbliest she's ever been over a three-month span.
Taliesin: I'm blaming the shirt, man.
Laura: It's the strawberries.

Marisha: You guys can send in Chris to adjust it. It's okay! They know we're a show with a sound guy. There's no real illusion. Sound guy Chris!
Travis: Chris is a Libra. His interests include underwater basket weaving.
Laura: Yes, long walks on the beach.
Sam: He has more than one nipple, but less than five. (laughter)
Liam: It's an interesting tech night. Ash and I are Skyping in from the USCSS Nostromo, which is a Weyland-Yutani vessel and if we fart out it's because we've been eaten by xenomorphs. Sorry.
Sam: Can't hear Ashley at all. Liam is totally overpowering. I love it
Liam: (creepy voice) Samuel.
Matt: All right guys! Well, that being the case, let's dive into tonight's episode of Critical Role! [dramatic music]
Matt: Hello, everyone, and welcome back. Hopefully with a fixed microphone?
Sam: We'll find out!
Chris willmott: We're good!
Matt: Ah, perfect, awesome! Yeah, I love it! All right, so to get you guys get caught up to speed with what we did in recent episodes. (muffled dramatic music)
Sam: Is that you, Liam?
Matt: Anyway. Last we left off, Vox Machina had confronted the Whispered One, the Undying King Vecna, in the Shadowfell. The battle did not go in your favor, with the death and very faint recovery of Vex, and the disintegration of Vax during this confrontation. Realizing that it was not going in your favor, you Plane Shifted to the Feywild, where you began to come up with some sort of plot or plan to try and bring your friend, Vax, back without a body. During this time Vax had a conversation with his patron, the Raven Queen, and was given an offer where he could return along with powers that would aid in this coming final confrontation. However, the deal came with some drawbacks, and upon his friends awakening the next morning in the Feywild, they found Vax returned to them, whole. Seemingly alive, returned, though missing his equipment. Equipment returned, and a brief period of figuring out what possibly delivered their friend back to this space. It was decided that based on his experience with his patron that the powers beyond the Divine Gate-- the Prime Gods that lay claim to the divine beyond the Prime Material plane will probably be the next best bet in gaining some sort of power, information about how to better prepare for the coming struggle with Vecna, the Whispered One. You then made your way to Vasselheim, where Pike went to her temple of Sarenrae which she had helped raise and reconstruct, and had a vision from her patron deity asking her to come visit her at the Island of Renewal, and was granted, through this vision, an object that would link, via your spell, a way to traverse past the Divine Gate and directly to her location on the plane of Elysium. Also, Grog and Scanlan had a little excursion in the city of Vasselheim and a minor altercation with the guards, which led to a larger altercation with the guards, which led to a much larger altercation with the guards, which led to them barely escaping and deciding it's time to go.
Travis: We can't go back.
Marisha: Vasselheim's most wanted?
Matt: Yeah. You guys then clasped hands, and using the Plane Shift spell found yourselves stepping down on the crunching sand-like shores of the Island of Renewal. There looking past the clusters of stone and trees that mark the perimeter of this interesting, beautiful, strange distant landscape. You can see beyond the tree line and the hills that jut up from the floor the crystalline structure that seems to mark the center of the Island, and that is where we left off. What would you guys like to do?
Laura: Did you say the sand is made of pearls?
Matt: It appears to be, yeah. The granules of the sand are too big to be tiny sand granules, they're about pearl-size, maybe a little bit smaller. And they're smooth, and they seem to reflect the light in a very beautiful way.
Laura: I just want to take a handful and look at them.
Ashley: Oh, can we make a body scrub?
Laura: Good idea, Pike. I'm going to take a good handful and put it in a pouch and save them.
Sam: Microdermabrasion.
Laura: They're micro-plastic beads that have washed up on the shore.
Ashley: I'm going to take a little bit, too.
Matt: Okay, so you gather up some of these pearlescent beads of some kind and fill a small pouch of them and put it amongst the rest of your belongings. All righty, anything else you guys wish to do to prepare? What do you want to do?
Sam: Oh god. We're going to go see Sarenrae, right?
Travis: Yeah, you know, like one does. Fucking jauntily walk up.
Liam: (distorted) And you said that that tower was full of some sort of flame, right?
Sam: Sorry, robot Liam!
Marisha: No, I wanted two cheeseburgers. What did you say?
Liam: (in speak-and-spell voice) I am richer for having known you.
Travis: Thank you!  Much better!
Matt: What did you say?
Liam: I said (robot noises). You said that that tower had, was full of some sort of flame, right?
Matt: Yes, and the, what little you can see, it seems to form this torso of a feminine structure, the body of which gives out these wings that curl upward. Held amongst the center of these wings is a large, gem-like flame. And you see within the actual crystalline-- we'll call it like a palace, if you will-- it looks like there's a light source within that flickers and dances like an eternal bonfire or flame, and it seems to have a pulse to it.
Liam: I'm sure this is unnecessary, but I'm going to start thinking about setting the Death Walker's Ward to fire damage.
Matt: Okay, so you guys want to take a short rest to do so?
Laura: Oh.
Sam: Oh.
Marisha: Do we need a short rest?
Liam: It's a 20-minute thing. Well, I don't have to, if everyone else wants to start.
Sam: We're not in a rush, right? 20 minutes won't kill us.
Laura: I guess. Sure.
Matt: Okay. So you take the better part of an hour, half an hour or so, 40 minutes or so, for a short rest to reset your armor to fire resist. Any other preparations?
Sam: Yeah, well hey. I'm no expert on the religious arts, but we have this eye of doom with us. Should we really be bringing this into a holy place of goodness?
Laura: I don't know.
Taliesin: I think, if anything, it might be even less effective here.
Sam: But what if it knows where we are and can somehow get an advantage and kill Sarenrae or something? I don't know.
Laura: I feel like we should definitely ask Sarenrae about it. But it's a little late to get rid of it now.
Taliesin: Other than your pocket dimension.
Marisha: It's in the Bag of Holding, right?
Travis: Nope.
Ashley: I have it. I have the eyeball in the box.
Sam: Is it still in the box? Can you shake the box and make sure there's something still in there?
Laura: Don't open the box!
Sam: Don't open the box! Just shake it.
Laura: Does it feel like there's an eyeball if you shake it? Just shake it and feel. Does it shake around?
Matt: (rattling noise) It does rattle a little bit. Like a peeled wet grape, you hear it sloshing around inside.
Ashley: (laughs) Ew.
Taliesin: Best Halloween trick ever.
Travis: Can you crush the tiny granules on the ground in between your fingers, if you try really hard?
Matt: Do you try?
Travis: Yeah, I try real hard.
Matt: Okay, you pick one up, and you (grunts) push. Make a strength check.
Travis: 23.
Matt: (grunts and strains) No.
Laura: Whoa! They're titanium pearls!
Marisha: It would be good for microdermabrasion!
Laura: It really would. Wow.
Ashley: Could I put my hand in the water? Just a (doot).
Matt: You step back a bit to where the shore is. The water is gently brushing against the shore and then pulls back. There's no heavy waves. The current is this steady, almost relaxing, undulating sound. This (steady whoosh). You reach over and place your hand within, and you feel the water soak into the inside of the plates of your gauntlet. It's warm. It's probably the equivalent of a good 75, 80 degrees. It would be wonderful beach water.
Ashley: Okay. Guys, it feels so nice. Should we go for just a little bit of a swim while he attunes to his--
Sam: Probably, yes.
Marisha: I walk over to Pike and put my feet in the water with her, stand on the edge.
Travis: Me, too.
Taliesin: Oh, also.
Liam: I put my cold feet in, since I have no shoes.
Taliesin: Wow!
Laura: Shameful.
Travis: Is there a sun? A point of light in the sky?
Matt: The sky is gently dappled with faint wisps of cloud and is blue and beautiful, but you do not see a particular sun in the sky. Though the light seems to be ever-present, what faint shadows you see seem to be almost from multi-directional light. There is no actual sun in the sky that you can see.
Travis: The light appears ever-present. Strange.
Laura: Wow, Grog.
Travis: Ow.
Laura: I'm going to keep an eye out, see if there's any movement in the fields while he's attuning his armor.
Matt: Perception check, please.
Laura: 24.
Matt: All right. As you guys sit there waiting on the edge of the shoreline, keeping a watch across the waters and the edges of where the beach begins to slowly form into the rolling hills and the sparse bits of trees that you see marking the interior of the island, there's no change. It's almost like whatever pattern is here is a set pattern, or at least, any alterations or changes would be over a very prolonged period of time. You see no signs of any other life. You see no signs of any other beings walking within your immediate eyesight.
Laura: Does it feel nice?
Matt: It feels nice. It feels comfortable. It's welcoming, if a little quiet.
Travis: When this rest is over, do we know what direction we're going in?
Laura: Towards the tower.
Marisha: Towards the tower.
Taliesin: Towards the tower.
Travis: Jeez, not everybody at fucking once. All right. Shit.
Marisha: Well, you had such good observation skills with the whole ever-present light thing.
Travis: What does that mean?
Marisha: Man. You're always a surprise. And after so many years.
Travis: Thank you.
Marisha: I look at Pike. I say, Pike, this place is beautiful. It's incredible, and I don't think we would be here if it wasn't for you and your connection to Sarenrae. And I'm honored to be here with all of you all. And to see this place with Vax. This makes me happy. Just this moment. This is nice. (sighs) I love you all.
Sam: We love you, too.
Laura: We love you too, Keyleth.
Ashley: I love you, Kiki.
Sam: Just to be clear--
Marisha: And I use my inspiring leader feat. (laughter)
Sam: I was just about to ask, was that well-thought-out speech inspirational?
Matt: All right, so level 18 that you are, with no charisma modifier, correct? Everyone gains 18 temporary hit points.
Travis: Damn!
Laura: Are we all healed up and healthy now?
Matt: You did take a long rest. Yeah.
Taliesin: Oh, we did take a long rest.
Matt: There were some healing spells spent on Pike's end and dealing with the eye that was recovered, I think. And then you with the Plane Shift.
Sam: Me and Grog got shot a few times.
Matt: Yeah, you got to heal a little bit.
Sam: But I can use some hit dice.
Matt: Yes, you can, during the short rest.
Laura: These Boots of Haste, I don't have to attune to them? They're not attunable, right? Or do I have to attune to them?
Liam: Yes, darling, they are. They're attunable.
Laura: Okay, that's fine. Then I'm just going to unattune my bracers and attune my Boots of Haste that I have on. I'm going to spend the next ten minutes cleaning them up and making them look really pretty.
Taliesin: You know you're going to get them back next long rest.
Matt: All right. So you've attuned to the Boots of Haste.
Sam: Yes.
Laura: I'm going to get so much shit online.
Matt: Broomgate 2.0. (laughs)
Liam: No. It's exactly what you would do when you almost lose somebody.
Travis: (laughs) Keep it coming.
Marisha: I'm so proud. He's as cold as his skin is right now.
Laura: Don't die anymore.
Liam: It's in character. I mean, don't give her a hard time.
Matt: All right, so you guys finish resting. It is comfortable. It is nice here and especially, in the rush of the current state of things, this brief moment of respite feels so removed from that race, that chaos, that ever-present fear and doubt. And later you know, whether it's the surroundings or the general nature of the plane that you're in, but it's soothing. It's comforting. As you finish your attunement to the item, you finish your new attunement to your resistance, you guys gather your things, step out of the water, put your footwear back on, and what would you like to do?
Sam: Walk towards the busty lady.
Matt: What's the marching order?
Taliesin: Oh, really?
Laura: We're going to have to fight things in this beautiful place?
Ashley: I'll go first.
Taliesin: Ash in front.
Matt: Okay, Ashley's in front. Who's next?
Travis: I'm with Pike.
Matt: All right, Grog's right up there with Pike.
Laura: I'll be behind Grog.
Taliesin: I'll be with you.
Laura: Lovely.
Liam: I'm going to trail sheepishly behind Keyleth.
Marisha: I was about to say, I don't leave Vax's side.
Laura: Trinket is out.
Matt: Trinket is out?
Laura: And he is walking between-- behind me and Percy. Yeah.
Sam: And as always, I'll enjoy the rear.
Travis: Yeah, you will.
Matt: Okay, then. All righty, so with Pike leading on and approaching the pathways that lead towards the center of the island, the rolling hills ascend higher and higher, the further towards where the distant crystal monolith resides. Up from the soft, pearl-like sand to reveal large obelisks of carved rectangular stone at off-kilter angles, jutting out of the ground in places. You had seen some of these at a distance when you arrived and you as well in your vision, Pike, earlier. The trees you walk past begin to slowly thin out to replace some of these stone structures. You can see what's almost this outer ring of nature that encloses the inner portion of this island. The wind is now warm against your skin as it begins to whip through this area and you can hear it tear through some of the openings between these ever densely growing clusters of stonework. Occasionally, these stone structures resemble figures of old ancient figureheads from the Age of Arcanum, who bore the embrace of the Everlight with them before her following fell from grace. You can see the ravages of time and the diminishing of her influence following the Divergence are shown on some of these figures as they appear to be sheared or cracked or broken in places. But still, no sign of anything else moving on the island.
Taliesin: Does it look like people are avoiding us or does it look like this is not a place of--
Matt: Make a perception check.
Taliesin: All right. I had a funny feeling you would say that. 12.
Matt: You see no signs of any movement, any foot tracks. No signs of anything in the vicinity that would lead you to believe that you're being avoided or being watched.
Liam: Does it look like anyone has been here for a very long time?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Liam: Oh, I'm not going to waste Luck on that. That's a one. I have no idea what's going in this fucking place.
Matt: Pike, you lead on. You make your way through these tangled paths and they shift and curve and turn and the light never seems to change overhead and as you hike along and chat amongst yourselves and keep open to the vicinity around you and you're breathing in the clean air with hints of seaspray and saltiness that eventually makes its way through the breeze. You can feel parts of you sweat beneath your armor, from the general warmth of the atmosphere, and you travel for about an hour. Pike, and Vex and Vax and Keyleth, you pick up on this, too. The crystalline structure in the center of the island doesn't appear to be any closer.
Travis: Shit.
Marisha: Didn't we go through something like this before?
Taliesin: We literally went through this before.
Laura: We had really think about being there, is that what we had to do?
Liam: Yes. Pike, do you think you need to talk to her somehow? Or call to her somehow?
Ashley: Yeah. Okay, I'm going to pull out the key again.
Matt: Okay. The metallic loop. The curved piece of metal. Okay.
Ashley: Yeah.
Travis: (quietly) There is no spoon.
Ashley: Sarenrae, we have travelled very far and we are here and if you could give us any guidance to get closer to you I would be forever grateful.
Matt: You say this out loud?
Ashley: Yeah.
Matt: Okay. You look out before you, still staring at the crystal structure. No response.
Ashley: Okay, I repeat that again in my head.
Matt: Okay, so you say it back to yourself in your head?
Ashley: Yeah.
Travis: Ticking them off, one at a time. Here we go.
Matt: Okay. So you look forward at the crystalline structure, looking at its form, and focus on those words on the inside of your head. No response.
Laura: Maybe we have to let her know we're here.
Sam: Pikey-poo. Pikey-pants. You had a religious thing and talked to your god, right?
Ashley: Say again?
Sam: You talked to Sarenrae briefly, right?
Ashley: Yeah.
Sam: Did she invite you or all of us?
Laura: Oh shit. Is this a thing where you think you're invited to a party, so you bring your whole crew and then maybe realize they weren't invited?
Sam: Do you want to walk solo for ten minutes and see if you are, solo, getting any closer?
Taliesin: We'll keep you in ear contact.
Liam: Is this like party hopping at Comic Con?
Laura: Yeah. Get us on the list. Once you're in there, then we'll join you in line.
Taliesin: See how many wristbands you can get.
Ashley: Okay. I'll keep walking and I'll keep looking back, thumbs up, and I'll see what I can find.
Matt: Okay. You walk forward and you can look back at your friends and you continue to walk forward towards the structure. You eventually begin to weave between these stone obelisks, which get dense and overlap to the point where maybe about a hundred feet ahead, you lose sight of Pike.
Laura: I want to get on my broom and fly up in the air and see if I can see her from the air.
Matt: Okay. You fly up in the air and you look down and you see her. She's right beyond where you lost sight of her originally, and she's walking forward.
Laura: Okay, okay. How you doing, Pike?
Ashley: Good, good. Just traveling over these stone structures.
Matt: All right, you watch. Pike, you walk for another ten minutes or so on your own, and you watch her travel, and as you focus, she's travelling, but she's still the same distance from everyone else she was when she left. She went just beyond eyeline and then it's weird. Like it doesn't make sense. You watched her maneuver and change and shift around things, yet she hasn't gotten any further or any closer.
Marisha: So is it like a side-scrolling background?
Matt: In a way, I guess.
Laura: What? And I turn around and the ocean is still where it was, behind us? Pike.
Ashley: Does it look like I've gotten far? I feel like I've gone real far.
Laura: I don't think you've gone far at all, dear. I think you're in the same place.
Taliesin: I've got a weird theory.
Marisha: Is the terrain repeating itself? What was your theory?
Taliesin: Maybe this is vision-based. Maybe we have to close our eyes.
Laura: How did we do this before?
Travis: I like this. Let's walk with our eyes closed.
Laura: Maybe we just have to think really hard about being at the tower.
Travis: I close my eyes and I start walking straight ahead.
Matt: (laughs) As Grog closes his eyes and starts walking.
Laura: I close my eyes and think really hard about being directly in front of the tower.
Matt: Okay. Anybody else want to do anything?
Marisha: I start walking the opposite direction.
Travis: Eyes closed or open?
Marisha: Away from the tower, with my eyes open.
Liam: I stand confused and watch Kiki leave us.
Matt: Okay. Keyleth turns away.
Taliesin: I spin three times in a circle.
Matt: What are you doing, Pike?
Ashley: I'm going to stand there and think about being closer to the tower with my eyes closed.
Matt: Okay. You all begin to close your eyes and begin walking and start wandering in different directions and bumping into pieces of stonework.
Sam: Bunch of cockroaches when you turn on the light.
Matt: Pike, you close your eyes for a moment and concentrate, and your vision is dark. You don't see the world around you, but within a few seconds of embracing this darkness, a sudden burst of light appears ahead of you, and you see a burning beacon visible in the direction where the crystal palace was before you.
Sam: Just Pike?
Matt: Just Pike.
Ashley: So I'll try keeping my eyes closed and start walking towards it.
Matt: Okay. As you guys are figuring yourself out, and you are concentrating so hard on being there--
Marisha: I turn around. Is the tower any closer?
Matt: Nope.
Marisha: Is it further?
Matt: Yep.
Marisha: Shit. I walk back.
Matt: Okay. You join the rest of the group and you watch half your party still stumbling into pieces of stone. Pike, you with your eyes closed, still seeing this burning beacon, this circular sphere wreathed in flame that just licks up as the flames slowly burn out of the bottom of this structure and flicker off into nothing. You step for about two minutes or so in its direction, and the heat gets warmer and warmer and warmer, and then you open your eyes for a moment and you're right in front of it.
Ashley: Hey, guys, can you see me?
Laura: Can we hear her?
Sam: Can we hear her?
Matt: You guys can hear her, yeah.
Laura: Oh shit. I open my eyes.
Matt: You look down and she's right in front of the crystal structure.
Laura: She got all the fucking way there? What did you do, Pike?
Ashley: I just thought about it. I closed my eyes and I started walking.
Laura: That's what I fucking did.
Travis: Yeah, I did, too. Ow.
Laura: Open your eyes, Grog.
Marisha: I walked the other way, and it definitely didn't work.
Sam: What is she doing that we're not doing? Her hair is partially blue. Maybe we should dye our hair blue, as well.
Ashley: Maybe you can only get here if you're a believer of Sarenrae.
Sam: Oh. I'm a believer. Can I try?
Ashley: (singing) I'm a believer.
Sam: All right.
Matt: You close your eyes?
Sam: Yeah. I'm going to clutch my symbol of Sarenrae and I'm going to close my eyes and I'm going to see if anything happens.
Matt: You sit there in silence for about a minute and a half as the darkness is there before you, pitch black. And you're clutching the symbol as hard as you can with your fingers, to the point where it's almost hurting your hand, and you see the faintest distant flicker.
Sam: I'm going to go towards it.
Matt: You guys watch Scanlan, eyes closed, begin walking towards the crystalline structure.
Laura: It's working for him.
Taliesin: I'm going to follow him.
Laura: I'm going to try to follow him. I'm not going to aim for the tower, I'm going to try to get to Pike.
Matt: Okay. So you're going straight for Pike?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Okay. And you're following Scanlan?
Taliesin: Yeah. Just nonchalantly.
Matt: Okay. Vax? Keyleth? Grog?
Marisha: What do we do?
Travis: I'm not going anywhere.
Ashley: Come on, Grog.
Travis: I'm confused. I want to see what happens to those two when they follow.
Matt: So what are you guys doing?
Liam: How is it working? What are you guys doing?
Marisha: They're believers.
Sam: Maybe you guys have to believe.
Liam: Well, I think that the existence of a pantheon of gods is a well-established fact in our world, so I believe.
Sam: So poetic.
Marisha: Do I have to believe deeper than that?
Taliesin: I think, perhaps, you need reverence.
Matt: Scanlan and Percival disappear into the brush ahead of you guys as you're having this conversation. You, rushing towards Pike, as you're going towards her, you're not getting any closer. You can see things rushing past you, but there's some disconnect, that as soon as you begin to change focus, you're right where you were. Grog and Scanlan. Scanlan, you step forward, and that beacon becomes brighter and warmer, and you feel the warmth and you open your eyes, and you're there next to Pike, in front of the palace. And Grog, you walked alongside Scanlan, and you walked as he watched and you went past the brush and suddenly, you're at the palace.
Travis: I'm there?!
Matt: Yeah. Sorry, not Grog. Percy was. You stayed back. I misremembered.
Liam: I grab Keyleth's hands.
Matt: Percival. That's my fault. So Percival, you made it past the boundary with Scanlan.
Laura: How did you-- how did-- Shit. We should have followed Pike.
Marisha: But Percy, you don't believe in anything. This is bullshit!
Taliesin: I believe in plenty of things. But, yeah, no, I agree. This is bullshit.
Laura: I'm going to close my eyes and be like, Sarenrae, I really believe in you. You're so holy, and very divine and beautiful, and I think you do really good things for Pike, and I'm very happy about that.
Matt: You concentrate. A minute. Two minutes. Five minutes.
Laura: Fuck. This is not working!
Taliesin: Pike. Pike, do you want to collect the rest of them and lead them back here?
Liam: I scoop up Keyleth's hands and I say, you trust me, right?
Marisha: Yeah.
Liam: Yeah, yeah, you know that good feeling that you have when you hang out with Pike? You know that warm feeling you have. Toasting marshmallows with her around the fire, that kind of feeling?
Marisha: Yeah.
Liam: You know that comes from Sarenrae, so focus on that with me. And we'll go to Pike. Focus on Sarenrae and that marshmallow feeling.
Marisha: But that comes from Pike, not from Sarenrae.
Liam: You know that's partially true, but not all true. Come on, give it a shot.
Marisha: Okay. I try really hard.
Matt: To?
Marisha: Think about the marshmallowy goodness that is Sarenrae.
Matt: Okay. Vax and Keyleth do this. And then what do you do?
Liam: Close our eyes and show reverence to her.
Matt: Okay. Another five, six minutes of darkness passes. Your eyes are closed. No beacon. Nothing.
Ashley: Okay. How long will it take me to walk back to them?
Matt: Do you walk back to them?
Ashley: I want to walk back to them.
Matt: Okay. A minute. You emerge from the brush, and you walk and see Keyleth and Vax, eyes closed, clutching hands, just hoping. And Grog, looking bored as hell.
Ashley: Okay. Where's Vex?
Laura: I'm up here, dear.
Ashley: Okay. Come here. I have an idea. Okay? So everybody, hold onto me somehow.
Travis: Hold hands? Like preschool?
Ashley: Yeah.
Laura: Like a train?
Ashley: Yeah. Just don't let go. And I'm going to think real hard, and maybe we'll all be there together.
Laura: Okay.
Travis: Okay.
Marisha: Okay. We have to walk, though, right?
Travis: Eyes closed.
Laura: All right. I'm not closing my eyes. I'm just holding onto Pike's hand.
Marisha: I'm still thinking about marshmallows, though.
Travis: Thinking about bacon.
Liam: I grab Pike by the earlobe.
Ashley: That tickles.
Matt: And Pike, do you close your eyes and follow that beacon once more?
Ashley: Yes.
Matt: Okay. As you guys walk alongside, focusing on Pike and her leading this small pack of friends along through the heavily rolling hills and the pieces of stone obstruction that force you to make your way around. You help guide her around these various obstructions that get in the way. Pike, you're concentrating on this burning beacon of warmth ahead of you. And within three minutes of travel, it seemed almost closer than when you saw her disappear before. You guys look at her, and glance up and you've just come across the threshold of the stones, and you're now in this open sandy patch at the base of this large crystal structure.
Laura: Nice! Good job, Pike.
Travis: Pikey-poo.
Ashley: Look at this.
Matt: So now standing-- (laughs)
Laura: (laughing) It's beautiful.
Ashley: It's so much more beautiful up close.
Matt: Standing before this magnificent glass-like structure, you can see the winding shapes and edges clearly ascending in the form of a female torso, rising from beneath the sands to a staggering height. Two wings of glittering crystal curving upward to frame a massive round red gem that shines above the head of the woman, with flames curling from the inside of the facets. This red gem would probably be about twice the size of Grog. It's hard to see the actual height of it here, but it's probably close to a hundred feet tall, the entire structure. Now, you see the shifting flicker of the intense fire that burns within the palace, now, it's causing the shadows cast by all nearby things to dance behind you, and in the inside you can see what appears to be a heavy bonfire almost that is visible beyond a 20-foot domed doorway right at the base of the torso. As you begin to approach the entrance to this crystalline palace-like statue, the heat of those flames that you see inside, roaring and burning quickly, get hotter and hotter on your skin. And as you begin to enter the interior of this structure, the heat feels like it should be getting close to unbearable, but it never hurts. You acknowledge the temperature change, and you're used to knowing this much heat should hurt, but it never does. It's just hot and welcoming. You now stand within the hollow interior of this incredible wonder, looking at a spiraling red tower of orange-red flame that reaches up about 60 feet or so, in this spiral. It's all flame. This large bonfire in the center of this structure. It flares rhythmically, like a very intentional heartbeat. (roaring flames) Giving these whipping sounds of the heat, and the wind and the air that it's tossing upward and out into the rest of the island around you and you now begin to acknowledge the warm winds that were blowing through the island, all seem to be centering and spiraling out from the center of the island. And it's at that point that you see something in the flame begin to take shape. You watch as this dark outline begins to open up as two large wings unfurl from within, revealing feathers of ivory and pearl, like the beach you arrived on, as this 15-foot-tall feminine vision of Sarenrae emerges from the roaring pyre, long curling flames burn as her hair from her beautiful dark skin framing a warm and motherly smile, her eyes gold and brown like the most polished brass. Her robes of light blue unfurl in endless strands that almost seem to tether her to the inferno behind her, and as she emerges from the flame, you can't help but find yourself stunned and awed at the presence. Her standing there unsinged from the flames, slowly descends, still floating above you, her arms out, her wings and hair unfurled, almost like a canopy above the group as you look up at her. Her face turns and smiles onto small Pike on the ground, and you hear her voice for the first time for all of you, but not the first for Pike, who has heard her voice for a very long time. "My Pike, you come to me after all this time. Such a beacon in a very dark world. Welcome."
Ashley: I take a knee. Thank you for letting us come here. It's just such an honor to be in your presence and to meet you in person. I've been a believer of yours for my whole life, and to actually be here in front of you is very humbling.
Matt: She descends faintly. Her massive form slowly seems to-- not shrink, but shift perspective a bit, where once she was this massive entity before you, seems almost human in size as the hand comes down and reaches and touches the top of Pike's forehead and just runs down the nose, onto her chin. And you see the brow furrow a bit as she says, "You vanished from my sight. You walk paths cast in shadow. My sands whisper thoughts of sorrow and foreboding. I must know from you all, what dark tidings bring you before me harboring such emotion?"
Ashley: Well, I think last time we spoke, we took on a battle that we were not able to complete and we need your help.
Matt: "What type of foe do you face?"
Laura: You know Vecna?
Matt: She looks to you a bit. There's a faint bit of recognition. "This entity, this Vecna, is clouded, even in history. I know little myself, and with my sands, they know little of this undying king. I imagine by his own design."
Laura: He deals in secrets. It's kind of his thing.
Matt: "What can you tell me?"
Taliesin: We have a piece of him.
Laura: We do.
Sam: Yes. Maybe. Well, we can tell you that he is awful, evil, pure evil incarnate, and he wants to be a god.
Liam: He has eyes on your territory.
Marisha: He is something of a demigod now, you could say, and well on his path to ascension.
Matt: "Ascension?"
Marisha: He wants to be like you.
Matt: "How?"
Marisha: Or I guess he wants to be like the Raven Queen.
Matt: You watch the flames grow a little more cool, a little more of a deeper red in color, and the brow furrows more and she pulls back a little bit from Pike. Not in a retraction, but a worried sense that seems to fill the room. The brightness of the outside sky seems to dim ever so slightly. "Ascension? The Raven Queen, you say?"
Marisha: He could tell you more, but I know she was a mortal who rose to her godhood, and I know he's looking for a similar path.
Matt: "Impossible."
Marisha: We've seen it.
Laura: He's been working on it for a very long time.
Liam: And obviously hungry for power.
Matt: The wings, still unfurled, the tips seem to almost curl in a bit as she, as opposed to floating above you out and about, is now standing tall floating above the ground about five or six feet. Her vision, her eyes seem to drift from you and look out past the glass and crystal to the distant shores beyond as she speaks out, exclaiming the thoughts as they come across her mind. Sarenrae says, "The Ritual of Seeding is one of the Matron of Raven's design. It is the secret rite that rebirthed her from her mortal trials and granted her the powers to take her place among the Prime Gods and become custodian to the realms between life and death, fate and the cold of winter. But this ritual was summarily cast from all knowledge and sealed, intent for eternity, by all who walk the paths of divinity. None should know this. None should know this."
Laura: What about the goddess Ioun? The goddess of knowledge? Would she have known?
Matt: "She was the one who spearheaded its destruction."
Laura: Vecna's been taking over her chapels? Temples?
Matt: "I know not where Ioun is. She is hidden away. The Dawnfather would know more than I. They were together when she was wounded. If this ritual has come into the hands of another mortal, where is this mortal now?"
Taliesin: We have his eye in a box. It's powerful and intelligent.
Ashley: I take out the box.
Marisha: He's slowly staked out on the Prime Material plane. Just north of Vasselheim, about 350 miles.
Laura: Recently completed a ritual in the Shadowfell.
Matt: "If he's finished the seed, he's already on his way."
Laura: Oh no.
Marisha: What does that mean? How can we stop him?
Matt: "The ritual takes some time, from what I recall. I don't know how long. I was not its architect. I was not the one who sealed it. Ioun would be the one to ask. However, if this is completed, then the Accord of the Divergence is in danger. If we will have one god on one side of the Divine Gate and the others on the other, we could not stop him. Understand, in order for any of us to directly interfere to seal a god like we did once long ago, we would have to tear down the Divine Gate and that would release an entirely new armageddon upon your world. So either you stop him and seal him, or you live amongst the only god we cannot stop."
Laura: How do we seal away a god?
Matt: "I don't know. I was betrayed during the Calamity. I was not present when they began to seal the Betrayer Gods. You'd do best to speak with maybe some of the others who were more prominent in that time. You walk in Elysium. This is the realm also of Pelor."
Laura: The Dawnfather?
Matt: "Yes."
Travis: Might I ask, does Kord reside in Elysium?
Matt: "No, but you could perhaps speak with him, too. I don't know much about Kord. We don't see eye to eye." And if you could see a goddess glance sidelong with embarrassment, this is the closest you'd ever see. "I've fallen from import over recent years, until recently."
Sam: You?
Travis: No.
Matt: She looks down at Pike for a minute. "Until recently." And turns back to Scanlan and says, "And don't think your prayers have gone unheard, as well."
Sam: You heard? I'm new at praying. I'm sorry for all the cursing at first. I had a lot of emotions, and I didn't know if anyone was listening. Apologies, but you heard me at night?
Matt: "When your heart was true to it, yes."
Sam: Wow. You won't tell anybody, will you? Because some of that is personal stuff.
Matt: She smiles and averts her gaze from you. "Do you know if this mortal, this man, this Vecna, do you know in your heart of hearts, Pike, that this man is beyond redemption? Is there any spark of hope in his heart to turn him back to the light?"
Ashley: Well, I would always hope that in somebody, but at least the time spent with him that we have, it doesn't seem that that's his path.
Matt: "Well, I trust in your insight, and this is your judgment to make. The greatest judgment you may ever make. As you walk this path, closer to conflict with this entity, search yourself for any glimmer, and if there is no redemption to be had, then smite him with all the might I have granted you."
Ashley: Okay.
Laura: He's not doing a lot of talking to us.
Travis: A lot of killing, disintegrating.
Sam: How will we know if he's a god or not?
Matt: "You'll know. We all will know."
Laura: So it hasn't happened yet?
Matt: "Not yet."
Laura: Okay.
Marisha: How long do these seeding rituals usually take? How much time do we have?
Matt: "I don't know. You would have to ask those who were responsible for sealing it."
Travis: Dawnfather.
Marisha: I'm so confused. That's it? We didn't walk away from him unscathed the first time, and we're just supposed to try again?
Matt: "Even in the dark days of the Calamity, the might of our weapons could only diminish the betrayers who rose against creation. The two that orchestrated our victory and designed the means of sealing away such terrible evil, I've already mentioned. They would be of more aid than I. The Knowing Mistress Ioun, as wounded and hidden away as she is, and the Dawnfather, warden to the Chained Oblivion. His fortress across the fields of Elysium. I could send you there."
Taliesin: That would be quite helpful.
Travis: It was hard getting here.
Laura: Will he be as accepting as you?
Matt: "I don't know. I haven't spoken much with the others in some time."
Laura: You should throw a party. Invite them all. Get to know them again.
Matt: She looks down at Pike once more. "My Pike, you've done more than you know. You've been a guiding light for these wonderful champions and so many more." She reaches down and lifts you off the ground a bit, looking at your face, the bit of sadness that creeps across it as she lifts you up and you guys watch as she glides, passing through the crystal, Pike being brought below the archway as she just lifts her out beyond this crystal structure. She ascends upward about 25, 30 feet or so, holding Pike in her hands out in front of her. And just chucks her. (laughter)
Matt: No. Holding her close-- and by this point, Sarenrae's form has expanded to almost the size of the crystal structure you came to. You can now see a parallel between her wings and her form and her torso as to the actual incredible presence of this god before you. And leans in, as she shows the island to Pike below and whispers close to your ear, "I'm not lonely here, Pike, for my sands remain with me, speak with me, and we learn from each other. Look." As she extends her arm, Pike, you look out, and all of the light of the sky seems to shine at once through every pearl, every grain of the beach sand that you've walked across. And where once you saw what was just a barren landscape, you now see thousands and thousands and thousands of people. Opaque. Translucent. Souls of those that have come to Sarenrae since the dawn of creation. Those who swore themselves to good under her banner and at the end of their lives came to become part of the Island of Renewal and forever live with her and amongst the rest of the community of people that are warmed under her light. They all seem to look up at once at you, and you sense them smiling, as the vision fades and the island goes back untouched. She drifts back down and places you on the ground. "You see, one day, you will join us, too. And we will all have so many stories to share." You now see her hovering over all of you as you step out of this to join Pike on the exterior of this tower. "While I am diminished, my powers limited, you do possibly face something terrible, unseen since the Calamity. And for this journey, Pike, I grant you my blessing." And as she reaches her hands out and they expand, her head lifts up, her eyes close, and her wings flare into a phoenix-like flame that just emblazons the sky with light and fire. The heat is more intense than anything you've felt, yet still there's no pain. It's just all-consuming. It's like the rebirth of a phoenix and you're all surrounded by it. For a moment, it's all there is in existence, just this incredible entity. And then the flames slowly die away, except for the flames that currently engulf Pike's gnome form. And as the flames burn away, you can see on Pike the familiar set of wings you've seen her spiritual form hold, which fold in and then dissipate. You now have the Blessing of the Everlight. (cheering)
Ashley: Oh my goodness! What is that?
Matt: You get a plus-two bonus to your constitution.
Ashley: Okay.
Travis: We'll take a picture and text it to you.
Ashley: Okay.
Matt: As a bonus action, you can summon the wings of the Everlight, granting you a flying speed of 40 feet for up to ten minutes. And while you have these wings, any spells you cast that cause creatures to regain hit points heal an additional ten hit points. (cheering)
Matt: But once this ability is used, you can't use it for another seven days.
All: Oh.
Ashley: Man, I love her so much.
Matt: So if you want to take a picture and send that to her. Here we go. Hold onto that and give it to her.
Marisha: Is Sarenrae gone?
Matt: No. Sarenrae is still there, just the flames have burned away.
Laura: I'm going to send this to you, Ashley.
Taliesin: I'm right here, guys. It's really not cool.
Ashley: Oh man!
Laura: Since Sarenrae is still standing there, I want to say to her-- shit.
Travis: Good start.
Laura: Shit, sorry. I want to apologize. This feels so stupid. I want to apologize for never realizing what you are and what this could be and for not showing you the reverence that you deserve. And I hope to change that in the future, and I will certainly think differently from here on out.
Matt: As you look down and look up, where once she was this large entity above you, you look down and look up, and she's right before you. "No apologies necessary. The creation of Exandria, the peoples that populate it and develop and design, innovate and worship, was with free will to make your own path. Faith is important to some, but the intent was to instill you with the means of doing and choosing whatever and however you like. We do not wish reverence of all. Just those who find us. At least, I speak for myself."
Laura: Well, I think you're pretty wonderful.
Matt: "There is balance to everything."
Laura: And I took these from your beach. It doesn't seem right.
Matt: She takes the pouch from you and pours it out, and as the pearls are about to land, they drift off and dart off back to the location where you originally found them.
Ashley: Same. I just thought I wanted to take a little piece with me, but I already have that. I didn't know what it was.
Matt: As you empty the pearls, they also dart off towards the beach where you first landed.
Laura: I just thought they were really pretty.
Ashley: I would have told you before we left, you know.
Matt: "It's all right. But for everything great that we may have created, you continue to create far better. Our existence brings threat. We've brought two calamities before. We try and avoid a third. Whether we diminish in time or just maintain this balance, it's you, and your children, and your children's children, that hold the keys to the future of your lives, your people, your culture, and us. So don't apologize."
Travis: Would you say Sarenrae's attractive?
Matt: Are you asking her, or is this a question to me as the DM?
Travis: Yeah, that one.
Matt: She's beautiful. I wouldn't put it in terms of any sort of a sexual object.
Travis: She's just beautiful.
Matt: She's just an incredibly beautiful, powerful, feminine form. And, to the extent where Grog, who usually being a man who's driven by base needs, not a single thought comes across you in any base or defacing way, it is too powerful. It overwhelms it.
Travis: Yeah, no, she's beautiful.
Marisha: What are titties?
Laura: What even are titties?
Marisha: What do titties?
Travis: I'm keeping my little pearl from the beach.
Marisha: (laughs) That you've been trying to crush?
Travis: Yeah.
Laura: Terrible. Matt's like, shady shit.
Travis: We're going to need one, y'all gave yours back.
Taliesin: It's going to be like the Wonka factory, it's just it's going to turn on you.
Matt: You stole fizzy lifting drinks. You now have to be watched.
Taliesin: Pearls from the beach, you get nothing, sir! Good day!
Matt: (laughing) Good day, sir!
Travis: It's just one!
Matt: I know. "You have my blessing, Pike. Do this for me, do this for them, do this for you. Do this for all of creation. And do it soon. The longer you wait, well, the longer you wait. Do you wish to be off to the Dawnfather?"
Sam: Yes, time is of the essence. We should go right away.
Marisha: Is he as warm and welcoming and nice as you are?
Matt: (laughs)
Marisha: Okay, that's a good answer.
Matt: With a bright white flash emanating from her torso and arms, your vision just goes white and you all blink for a moment as your head spins for but a brief instant. Your feet touch hard ground and you all immediately reach up and rub your eyes, and as your vision slowly coalesces once more, you find yourself standing in the deep center of some vast orchard, surrounded by an endless sea of fruit-bearing trees of all sizes, shapes and colors, intertwined, the canopy broken and sparse in places where you can see above a clear, blue, cloudless sky. You're no longer on the Island of Renewal, that's for sure.
Laura: Oh, I thought, but isn't that where the Dawnfather is?
Matt: Island of Renewal is where Sarenrae is. The blessed fields of Elysium is the plane. He existed elsewhere in there.
Laura: I understand now.
Marisha: Is there the same ever-light sky?
Matt: Make a nature check.
Marisha: Ever-present, sorry. Ever-presence in light. I use my druidic die. 29. Sorry, 31.
Matt: It's hard to see from down low, because the canopy does choke it a bit, you can see bits of the sky that appear blue, cloudless, whereas you saw wisps of cloud over the island, this appears clear, you can climb up a bit and try to get a better look if you want.
Marisha: Sure.
Matt: Okay, so you begin to leap up through the branches, and a lot of the trees here have winding and knotted branches, so it's pretty easy to find your way up the canopy after maybe a five minute climb. You get up and peek over and you can see now this orchard goes on for miles and miles, and miles, filling this vast valley that you can barely see mountains that crest the edge of it in the distance near the horizon. You also see there is no cloud in the sky, and there is no sun, but there is a single pillar of light that streaks down from way way up, the zenith striking down in the center of this orchard, where there you see before you this awe-inspiring sight of the Dawnfather's home: a gold-plated citadel of many humongous towers and spires that both resembles a military fortress and the largest-steepled church you've ever seen. It's hard to gauge distance with so many trees between you and it, you don't know if it's miles off from you, if it's maybe a thousand feet or so, but even at this distance, it's incredible in its scale.
Marisha: Oh. Hey, guys, Pelor's not messing around.
Travis: They make really tall things here.
Laura: I fly up next to Keyleth so I can see. Wow. Do you think this is like Sarenrae, where we can't get to him unless we have him in our heart?
Marisha: You know, I feel a little bit more connected here. This I can-- it's trees. I'm surrounded by trees. This I can relate to.
Laura: I mean, I've tried to talk to Pelor before.
Marisha: I've talked to the Sun Tree. (gasps) I wonder if the Sun Tree is here? Maybe he's got a twin here like you have a twin!
Laura: Maybe.
Taliesin: Do I recognize any of the fruit that's growing on the trees?
Matt: Make a nature check.
Taliesin: Yeah. 15.
Marisha: Decent for a city boy.
Matt: It's interesting. This orchard-- various fruits thrive in various climates. As you begin to walk a little bit through, it is a peppering of all sorts of trees and fruits. You see apples of all shades, you see oranges, you see rare passion fruits, you see floral-based growing fruit. It's a perpetual harvest here.
Laura: I rush down and say, don't eat the fruit!
Sam: Might be souls?
Laura: I think it might be souls!
Travis: No, it's fruit! Souls don't grow on trees.
Marisha: Souls also don't wash up on beaches, but apparently they do.
Taliesin: That may be the most interesting thing I think you've ever said, is souls don't grow on trees.
Marisha: Souls don't grow on trees!
Taliesin: Souls don't grow on trees!
Marisha: At least he knows the dangers of monocultures. This is very impressive.
Taliesin: Yeah, this is, there's a lot of variety.
Travis: What?
Matt: What're you guys doing?
Liam: Vax is off on his own, by the way, sitting on his ass having a moment, because it wasn't too long ago when he had a thing for Sarenrae, and that was pretty bittersweet so he's staring off into space.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: One piece of fruit? One piece, just one little piece. An apple.
Sam: No.
Travis: We're in Elysium! Oh my god, please.
Taliesin: If you do eat anything, and you shouldn't, but if you do eat anything, eat something you don't recognize, it'll be funnier that way.
Travis: Is there any fruit that I don't recognize?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Taliesin: (deadpan) No, don't, stop.
Travis: Something I don't recognize. 12.
Matt: Yeah, actually, you guys walk for about three or four minutes in the direction of where you saw the fortress, and you come across what looks to be a small bush that's clustered near this dark wooden tree with a thick, gnarled exterior, and this bush has these small ripe plum-like fruits that come to a point at the bottom that you've never seen before.
Laura: Grog, do not. Do not.
Travis: What? Pick this?
Laura: Don't! (gasps)
Marisha: (gasps) Grog!
Taliesin: I dare you not to eat it.
Marisha: Don't say that. He'll do it! You know that's what happens!
Travis: No, why don't we say, are you a person?
Taliesin: (whispers) Grog.
Travis: Nothing? Nothing. You want to check it for magic?
Laura: Yeah, I'm going to check it. Hello, are you a soul?
Marisha: Yes, I'm a soul.
Laura: (gasps) Oh my god, it is a soul! It just spoke to me. Oh my god. What's your favourite color?
Marisha: Blue, like your feather.
Laura: It said blue, like my feather! Did you hear it? It was talking, Grog. It was talking.
Travis: Hey, Pike?
Ashley: Don't eat it.
Travis: What?! (laughter)
Ashley: Just in case!
Travis: What do I do with it? I already picked it!
Ashley: I have an idea! Why don't you hold onto it. Keep it in your pouch.
Laura: Not in the Bag of Holding, keep it in your shirt pocket.
Travis: When have I ever worn a shirt?
Ashley: You can ask him if the fruit is edible, and make sure it's not people.
Travis: That's fair. All right. I will hold onto the pointy plum.
Matt: (laughs) Okay.
Laura: Are we getting any closer to the citadel?
Matt: You guys keep walking towards it?
Laura: Yeah.
Marisha: Yeah.
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: All right, you walk on.
Laura: Are there any people? Does it look like there's tracks in this orchard?
Matt: Actually, Vax, Vex, and Keyleth, you notice fairly quickly in that you begin to see movement ahead. The air itself, which by the way, the wind here is carrying a very sweet and fragrant, almost like honey flower whiffs that come through in waves that hit you, the whole atmosphere here makes you hungry, it makes you comfortable, it reminds you of childhood in a strange way. It's a very good, positive atmosphere. You begin to see as you approach, figures, moving. Pike, you recognize this because these are similar to the vision you just had from Sarenrae. They are entities. They are souls. They are people that walk the fields of Elysium, and you see them walk with small satchels, and you see them picking the fruit. And gathering, and harvesting. They don't seem to pay you too much mind, and as you begin to get close to some of them, they just stop and watch you. It's very Spirited Away, in a strange way. You see these somewhat translucent entities that barely acknowledge your existence and then as you pass by, they go on to whatever work they were doing. No speech, you don't even see eyes or faces, you just see the outline of the human-like shape, various heights and sizes.
Laura: But they're picking the solid fruit?
Matt: They're picking the solid fruit, and gathering them.
Taliesin: Are they eating the solid fruit?
Matt: You don't see any of them immediately eating it.
Taliesin: None of them are eating the fruit.
Marisha: I have a feeling it's an offering.
Travis: I have a feeling it's fucking fruit.
Marisha: Are we getting closer?
Matt: You continue to walk and make sure to avoid some of the larger clusters of these various harvesting entities, these harvest souls. You, who's leading the charge this time, who's leading you through the orchards?
Taliesin: One of you two. Is this technically favored terrain for you?
Matt: It would count as a forest for you.
Laura: Yeah? I guess I'll be in the front. Percy, have you done a lot of talking to Pelor?
Taliesin: Not really, no.
Marisha: Percy, how do you feel about gods these days? Last time we talked we were both not optimistic, I feel like.
Taliesin: I know how to be polite. I'm very reasonable at that.
Marisha: Reverence.
Taliesin: Reverence.
Liam: You can certainly acknowledge when someone can squash you like a bug.
Taliesin: Yes.
Marisha: But a lot of things can squish us like bugs. I don't know, this is complicated. Let's just keep going. I'm going to keep an eye out while we're walking, for anything that resembles the Sun Tree.
Matt: Okay. All right. Are you leading the way?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Because you have no sun to keep tabs on, you're just going to have to fly up above the canopy and keep an eye on it, so you're cresting and descending through the orchard as you progress. You travel for about an hour and a half to two hours, and you notice you are getting closer, but it is a long way away, you probably have another three, four hours of travel before you get there on foot.
Laura: It's a long trek. We've got a while.
Marisha: I wonder if we believe harder if we'll get there quicker.
Taliesin: I don't believe that'll work.
Sam: Well, let's just go.
Laura: Just keep on pushing on?
Sam: Yeah.
Laura: Right? We don't have anything that'll make us move faster?
Taliesin: Well, we have misty, but that seems--
Laura: That seems stupid.
Taliesin: It's a nice walk.
Laura: Yeah, it's beautiful.
Matt: You guys continue your trek, and as you get closer and closer to the fortress of the sun, you do notice the trees of the orchard grow taller and thicker. And it's like whatever fertility enchantment that runs this section of the plane, the closer to the central portion of this fortress you get, the more the rampant wild growth seems to gather and expand to the point where it, in some places, almost resembles the Feywild, though nowhere near as mysterious and threatening in some cases. But you've never seen apple trees that grow four stories tall. But here you see them. And the scale is immense but the branches are as dense with apples and leaves as they would be elsewhere. It continues to go. It's an impossible size to some of these trees and plants and bushes. It dwarfs your size by comparison to where you really get a sense of scale of how small you may be in this realm versus some of the creatures that call it home.
Marisha: See, this tree can squash me like a bug. If it fell on me, yeah.
Laura: I wonder if its apple grew as big as the actual tree. If it fell, you'd be doomed.
Matt: As you progress, a few more hours into this trek, eventually, Vex, you begin to notice the light ahead begins to grow brighter.
Laura: Hey, I think we're getting closer.
Sam: Awesome.
Marisha: Does this feel like sunlight? Does it register like sunlight or is it a whiter light?
Laura: Like should we put some sunblock on as we walk towards it?
Marisha: Yeah? Is it sunlight temperature?
Matt: It registers as a sunlight. It is a pure light.
Taliesin: Like kitchen light white or like reading room light?
Matt: Like noon daylight light.
Travis: Arizona or California?
Matt: And as you push closer and closer to where this brightness continues to expand, and it's brighter than you anticipated. You're getting to the edge of a clearing where the tree line comes to a halt, but as you do, it hurts your eyes a little bit. You have to adjust from the dark interior of the forest to the outside. And as you finally breach the edge of the tree line and look out, you can see this open clearing, and immediately you can see the column of light that's cracking down from the center of the sky is what is lining this clearing; where the light touches, the trees stop. And it hurts a little bit to look at it because the light is reflecting off of this bright gold brass-colored citadel before you. You thought the crystal structure that Sarenrae was in was, you know, impressive. This is four times larger than the largest structures in Vasselheim or Emon you've ever encountered. And you watch as this massive citadel-- It has maybe two dozen separate towers of different heights that stagger and shift and they all come to these steeple-like points. And there in the center of the structure is one thick, massive tower that crawls upward and upward and upward and upward for, even at this point, surmising 15, 20 stories before the tip vanishes into the bright light that is descending from the sky above. You see the outline of a few sparse trees that catch your attention. You do see some trees that litter this open space within this bright light that are of the same type of tree as the Sun Tree that resides in the center of Whitestone.
Marisha: He does have a twin.
Laura: Do you think this tower is compensating for something, or maybe it's a representation. Hard to tell.
Travis: Basically we'll know Vecna's a god if another skyscraper forms in Elysium somewhere.
Marisha: How close are we to the column of light?
Matt: You're stepping beyond the treeline and into the light, so you're just at the edge of the tree line.
Marisha: I Druidcraft a little twig and hold it into the light column.
Matt: Okay. Doesn't seem to affect it at all.
Marisha: Nothing? I'm going to touch it.
Matt: It's warm. It's like warm daylight.
Marisha: Okay, we're not going to die.
Laura: That's good.
Travis: Are you sure?
Marisha: No.
Laura: (laughs) I'm going to look at the citadel with my eyes wide open for five seconds, and then close my eyes really fast to see if I can see better details of it like when you look at the sun.
Matt: (laughs) You do, actually!
Liam: I swat my sister in the forehead.
Laura: Hey, I'm doing stuff here; it's science.
Matt: In closing your eyes, yeah, you can see the shape and the outline of the spires that go off, and you can see the plating and the large, heavy structures. And you can see the various windows that dot the outside on multiple levels. It looks like there's at least seven or eight different levels of the actual fortress. You see lines of windows and looks to be balconies that adorn it at these different stages. And at the top of that, the towers go higher and higher. It's almost like a city of a fortress in its own right in its scale. It's impressive. It's like if you took part of the City of Brass and jammed it into one structure and made it pure gold.
Travis: Pure gold?
Matt: It's gorgeous.
Laura: This is beautiful!
Matt: (laughs) But it does burn the shit out of your eyes if you stare at it that long.
Laura: Worth it! Worth every second! I like Pelor. I like him a lot.
Travis: Someone should go in and test out the light.
Sam: Yeah, let's just go in. It's just light.
Marisha: Maybe the light will take us there, straight to him.
Travis: I push Vax in.
Marisha: I jump in.
Matt: You push Vax in? All right.
Liam: Oh, warm again! (laughter)
Matt: It's very warm. And with your dark leather it's like the goth kid in summer. Little sweaty.
Liam: I was never the goth kid.
Matt: You guys begin to make your way on foot, trekking towards the center of this clearing, towards the fortress of the sun. As you begin to make your way beyond the various trees with their blossoming, beautiful white, pink, and purple blossoms that mark the Sun Tree during the spring and summer, you can now see along the perimeter of this what appear to be hundreds of figures. Hundreds of figures that just dot the outside of the fortress. And as you get a better look at some of the spires you can see that on the upper levels, including the one central tower, you can see these beautiful medallion-like circles of stained glass, mosaics of color on a scale that is impressive. You can only surmise maybe the smallest one being 20 feet in diameter and going up from there on the scale on the central portions of it. And what's interesting is, usually with stained glass the bright exterior, the color is darkened and shaded because the light is once you're inside the structure, but the color is so vibrant in the stained glass, you get the sense that there is a light source within the actual fortress that is as bright if not brighter than the column of light that is descending from the sky.
Laura: Should've worn sunglasses here.
Matt: As you begin to get closer and closer to the citadel, once again the scale seems to build and build. What should seem to be a shorter walk gets longer and longer as you begin to see how massive and far away this is, compared to where you thought it was. And about 30 minutes since you left the treeline, you begin to just get past the final bit of Sun Trees that are planted around the exterior.
Marisha: I touch a few as I walk by. See if I feel anything.
Matt: They're alive, they're vibrant and similar in texture as to the one you've spoken with in Whitestone.
Laura: You going to try talking to them?
Marisha: Should I?
Laura: I don't know.
Taliesin: I don't know.
Travis: Do you know this tree?
Marisha: I don't know. Maybe he's like a distant relative of the Sun Tree. Maybe I know him by proxy.
Laura: Maybe they're like, oh yeah, Sun Tree I remember him, he got taken away as a seedling, but he was really great. How's he doing?
Liam: I mean, you know you want to.
Travis: It's an Elysium tree, just saying.
Laura: Maybe they don't even speak our language. It's possible.
Liam: This is a once in a lifetime opportunity, Kiki.
Marisha: I'll try and speak to one of the Sun Trees that looks the most friendly.
Travis: (laughing) Amicable tree.
Matt: Make a nature check. See which one seems the most approachable of all the other trees.
Travis: Weigh the nuts.
Marisha: That's a natural one. I don't know.
Matt: You see one tree that looks definitely the most amiable of the ones in the field and you approach it.
Marisha: Amiable?
Matt: Amicable. Pick your term.
Marisha: Amicable, amiable. All right, I'll talk to a tree. That's what I'm going to do.
Matt: As you finish your spell and reach out, your finger touching the warm exterior of the tree. The light's still a little blinding, but you've adjusted to it now, where you can make out shapes and color, as opposed to the blaring white. What do you say?
Marisha: Hey, Sun Tree bro. Are you a Sun Tree bro? Are you a Sun Tree brother? What's your name?
Matt: "I'm a tree of the sun. And I'm not your bro."
Marisha: No, I didn't know if you knew the Sun Tree that grew in Whitestone on the Prime Material Plane. I didn't know if you knew him.
Matt: "So because I'm a tree of the sun, you assume that I know all other trees of the sun. Is that what this is? It's one of those things? We all look alike, don't we? Just all of us trees of the sun, right?"
Marisha: Can you tell me a little about this plane? How do we talk to Pelor? How do we see him?
Matt: "I recommend probably going towards the giant golden fortress that is right behind you. It's probably a good place to look, where all the light's coming from."
Marisha: Okay. Yeah. Wow. I have a friend who wants to know about the fruit. He's wondering if the fruit is souls? If he can eat the fruit.
Matt: "The fruit is not souls! It's fruit."
Travis: Vindication!
Matt: "The Dawnfather is the god of the harvest. Good luck. Sorry if I came off a bit brusque. It's been a long time since anyone's talked to me."
Marisha: No, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you.
Matt: "Apology accepted."
Marisha: Would you like a hug?
Matt: "No. I would most definitely not like a hug."
Marisha: Okay. Well, it was wonderful meeting you. Absolutely. Thank you. All right, bye. Okay, bye.
Matt: "Good day."
Taliesin: What a beautiful tree you've found. It casts so much shade. (laughter)
Travis: Yes! Oh my god.
Marisha: You were waiting the whole time to use that, weren't you? The whole conversation.
Taliesin: I was just sitting, like knitting, crochet?
Matt: As soon as you rolled that one, I was like okay, then.
Sam: New NPC  Dick Tree. (laughter)
Matt: It's more ornery than anything. (laughs) All right, as Keyleth returns from her conversation with the tree.
Liam: You don't seem as blissed out as you normally do. Did it go okay?
Marisha: Yeah, it was fine. Just can't talk to everybody, I guess. It's fine.
Travis: What did you ask him?
Marisha: Nothing. Just asked if he knew the Sun Tree, and he got super offended. You know what? Let's just go.
Taliesin: You've never been rejected by a tree before, have you?
Marisha: No, I have never been rejected by a tree. Most trees like me. People don't like me, but at least trees do, except for this asshole.
Liam: I start to smooth out her mantle, which is wiring up like a cat's.
Marisha: My leaves are prickly.
Laura: Maybe he was just pretending he didn't like you because he felt uncomfortable because he likes you so much. Like Kash!
Marisha: That's nice, Vex. Thanks. You didn't talk to this guy, okay? You don't know.
Travis: Did you ask about the fruit?
Marisha: Yeah, he said it's fruit. It's fine. You can eat it, too. You're right, Grog. You were right! Eat the fruit! Let's go! Come on.
Sam: Yikes.
Laura: Breathe in, breathe out.
Matt: All right, you guys begin making your trek back towards the Fortress of the Sun. As you're walking--
Marisha: I rip off an apple as I go, and I start aggressively eating it.
Matt: The Sun Trees here don't bear fruit.
Marisha: I fucking spike an apple that I had earlier!
Matt: Okay. If you have an apple with you, you're welcome to eat it if you wanted to.
Marisha: No! I just want to go in the tower.
Liam: I lean over to Percival and say, this is one of those times when it's best just to keep quiet.
Taliesin: I'm so quietly delighted by this.
Matt: All right. As you guys begin to approach the fortress, you watch as those hundreds of figures you saw at the base are beginning to collect towards the front of what appears to be the large doors that lead to this side's entrance to the actual structure. As they gather, they begin to push in your direction. You also see other figures up on the higher floors, balconies, almost. (wingbeat, whoosh) Glide and then flying in your direction rather rapidly.
Laura: I hope they're friendly. He's definitely not as solitary as Sarenrae, is he?
Matt: At this point, you watch as these winged entities, three of them, approach faster than the rest of the horde that seems to be pushing in your direction. You can see long, golden-white wings. You see very intense-looking breastplates made of gold and brass, with rubies marked into it. Similar, but not as well adorned as the armor that Pike wears. Holding spears, various other weapons or shields, but as they fly in and land, (impact noise) landing. They all stand about five or six feet taller than all of you. Humanoid, muscular, almost Roman in physique, but their skin is a very faint light blue. Their eyes are white.
Laura: Hunin and Kyor!
Marisha: Are they devas? Celestials? Angels!
Liam: Celestials.
Matt: They have similar traits, though apparently purer and much stronger than the half-blood celestials that you had met previously in the City of Brass.
Laura: That we rescued. Didn't just meet them. We saved them.
Matt: You did, and you gave them a new life under the remaining family of--
Laura: Hunin and Kyor. I even got their fucking names right!
Matt: You did, which is awesome.
Liam: The third time, yeah.
Matt: So as the three of them land (impacts) around you, spears not aggressive, but at their side, and powerful entities. They triangulate around you, all standing so much taller than you do, their wings still unfurled in a very prominent display of power. Their helmets covering everything-- the helmet comes down over the nose and reveals the eyes. It's very Roman in structure. One of them yells out, "You who approaches the fortress. What is your business here?"
Travis: Guards. Best to let Scanlan and I take this. (laughter)
Liam: Percy, do you want to flash a little Whitestone bling, at the moment?
Taliesin: You're pretty Whitestone blinged.
Laura: We're Vox Machina. We were sent here to speak to Pelor by the goddess Sarenrae.
Matt: "Sarenrae sent you?"
Laura: Yes, she did.
Matt: "With what business?"
Laura: To speak about a very big evil growing on the Material Plane.
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Laura: Oh no. Okay. 22?
Matt: Okay. The one guard that you were talking to looks over to the guard that's to the left of all of you, and he gives him this slight head nudge. That one, who's a little bit smaller than the other two, walks past and his pupil-less white eyes, which emanate this faint white glow, seem to look past each of you. I say past each of you. It almost is a piercing gaze. As it looks at Scanlan, it gives a little bit of an upturn of the nose. A neutral disapproval of Percival. Keyleth, less so. Grog, almost a sneer for a moment. And then to Vax and Vex. And then to Pike, a nod.
Sam: Oh, a nod.
Laura: She's good.
Matt: He looks back to the first guard, and says, "There is no evil among them."
Laura: Hear that, Grog? You're not evil.
Travis: Yeah, I knew that. Why didn't you just ask?
Taliesin: We do, it should be noted, carry a dangerous artifact that we should warn you of.
Sam: Check in our weapons. Yeah.
Matt: The one soldier that you were first speaking to steps forward, his heavy footfalls from his armored boots. He puts his hand out. "We will take this artifact."
Laura: (hesitant noises) Will we get it back?
Sam: (hesitant noises) Will we get it back?
Matt: "What need do you have with a dangerous artifact?"
Laura: Well, it belongs to the great evil, and so it's possible that we can use it to defeat him, so if we don't have it, we might not be able to do that.
Travis: It may give us an advantage.
Laura: Could be really great.
Matt: "The Dawnfather will be the judge of that."
Laura: Okay.
Taliesin: I'm all right with that.
Sam: Don't look at it, though. It'll turn you super evil, and you'll rip out your eye.
Matt: "Noted." Such a big thing, and yet you shook it a little, strangely. "Very well. Follow us, please."
Sam: How's that fruit?
Matt: Their wings fold behind them, and they walk alongside you, matching their gait to yours. As you move forward, even with your brisk pace, their gait is so long that they're having to make long, slow strides to keep up with your slow pace.
Laura: I hold Percy's hand as we're going in.
Taliesin: Yeah, we'll do this together. I'm all right.
Matt: At this point, the mass army that's been approaching you, you can see now, are hundreds of armored spirits, similar to those that you saw in the orchard. As they approach, the three planar entities that are walking alongside you put their hand up in a dismissive motion, and the army parts, leaving a singular path that leads you right to the front of the fortress. And the path, because there's so many, goes on. It's like walking through a parade of silence. As you all look around, you can't make out any faces. You see hundreds of sets of glittering golden armor with the somewhat-visible form of these translucent spiritual entities that take up the space. You don't sense any hostility, animosity. You don't sense any welcoming. You don't sense anything from them. They're present and letting you pass.
Laura: Is the armor solid?
Matt: Yes, the armor is solid, and the spirits that inhabit them are pseudo-material. It's hard for you to gauge; you haven't encountered this type of creature outside of your spectral encounters with ghosts and other spirits. As you step forward, being flanked and escorted by these winged guards, you are brought to the base of the 50 or so steps that ascend to the front 40-foot-tall double doors that now (loud creaking) creak open to reveal the interior of the palace, which is as bright, if not brighter from the inside as the outside pillar of light you're leaving. As you prepare yourselves to adjust your gaze, you ascend step by step to eventually take in whatever the interior of the Fortress of the Sun has to offer. And that's where we're going to take our break! We're going to return back here in a few minutes. We're going to use the restroom and get snacks and stuff. You guys can rest here for a minute. We have a giveaway.
Travis: Fruit.
Marisha: Fruit.
Taliesin: Don't eat the spiky bit.
Matt: That's right. Make a wisdom saving throw real fast.
Travis: Really?
Marisha: Wait, really?
Matt: Yeah.
Liam: Everybody?
Laura: No, just Grog, because he's an idiot.
Travis: 13.
Matt: 13. Okay, good to know. All right.
Marisha: Maybe you would have gotten smarter. Maybe it's super fruit. Maybe it's acai berries.
Matt: All right, so our friends at Wyrmwood have this awesome black walnut personal dice tray with a leather interior. It's pretty badass. We'll only have one lucky winner over in the Twitch chat. The key word for tonight is latency. L-A-T-E-N-C-Y. Like the kind that you get when you have two people on Skype guesting in. So to win this, find your way over to Twitch chat, follow the instructions, and when it's time, put the word 'latency' in, and one lucky winner at the end of the break we'll be able to give this away to and announce. Enjoy, rest. We'll see you guys back here in a few minutes. [break]
Matt: Hello, everyone, and welcome back to Critical Role. First and foremost, the winner of the chatroom contest-- and I hope I'm reading this right-- is n-nailhammer. (laughter)
Travis: Wait, one more time.
Matt: Nnailhammer.
Taliesin: Is it Nine Inch Nail hammer?
Matt: It's two N's, ailhammer. So nnailhammer. Congratulations, nnailhammer. You won the giveaway. Denobo will contact you and get you the info. Congratulations! All right, so back in to where we left off. As you ascend the remainder of the stairs and step into the entryway to the Fortress of the Sun, you're led through a series of gorgeous silver and gold archways, dozens of feet above you. The intricacies of the interior, scrolling trim and inlay across every wall, pillar, and bannister is incredible. Not gaudy, just magnificent in purpose and history. Glancing across the marble floor, you can see the construction here is immaculate. There isn't any sort of smudge or damage dealt anywhere. These arches themselves, even as you glance over and look, the detail seems to fractal smaller and smaller, in places, where you can't imagine a craftsman's hand could have built this. Only through the will of a god could such a thing come into creation on such a vast and minor scale. You also notice as you walk in, there's no shadow or shade. The walls seem to almost emanate light on their own.
Marisha: I beg to differ.
Matt: The outside's a different story.
Marisha: Go to the courtyard.
Liam: Just you wait!
Laura: No shadow underneath us?
Matt: No shadow underneath you. Looking around you, and looking at your hands, you can see very faint shadows can be cast between your fingers and things that are very close, but it's like there's a diffused light throughout the entirety of the interior of the fortress that casts away any darkness or shadow. There's no umbra; there's no place where light is absent. It is just light everywhere. You hear this soft music played, the deeper into the fortress you get.
Marisha: Club's over here, guys.
Matt: Rocks fall; everybody dies. (laughter)
Matt: It's okay.
Liam: Benny Hill music commences.
Matt: Soft music you hear playing throughout the interior of the fortress, like this distant sound of a thousand soft choir voices accompanying the inspirational sight of the building that you now walk through. You see other entities adorned in armor, still opaque and pearlescent in their spirit form. Some of them have flowing robes of gold and white that trail behind them and drift across the floor silently. The further in you walk, you begin to see where some of these spires and spiral staircases twist upward. The rooms have purpose in construction, but the scale of those that walk through the halls is so varied that you see staircases on large scales and small scales. They almost seem to wrap around each other in places. It's surreal, almost Escher-esque in some of the interior construction. You see archways and doorways on different levels: some that appear to be reached only by those that can fly versus those that can just walk and climb. Occasionally, you look up and you can see skylights across the top: some open glass and crystal, some appearing to be a small window of stained glass that glitters down in bright blues, purples, reds, oranges. There's definitely a stained glass motif in a lot of the interior of the fortress, which you've seen in some of Pelor's imagery, and the symbol around him is like a circular stained glass structure that spirals in with the actual star and the sun in the center. The music continues to grow louder and louder the further in you walk, and you feel like you're being led along for a good 15 minutes straight. This structure, this hallway, just goes on and on, the arches passing one after the other after the other. Your eyes have adjusted to the brightness of the interior now. Eventually, you come to another set of large doors. These doors themselves: no wood, no stone, just pure, vibrant platinum and gold. The symbol upon them seems to be the same circular motif as the symbol of the Dawnfather, with the star in the center, but the detail and intricacies. You get close, and your eyes-- especially you, Vex and Vax-- you glance and you can see, on every small scale, even just a simple bar of the star and the sun has writing, and has artwork, and then as you look closer, even on a smaller scale, that writing is comprised of smaller artwork and smaller writing. You're thrown off by the level of detail and intricacy of this place's construction. You're in awe. Your jaw drops as these reveals seem to barrage you with each step into the structure. At that point, the doors (scraping noise) open, and you wince once again, as the light that fills the room from the inside is near-blinding. You close your eyes a bit, and all you hear is this deep, resonant voice say, "Come."
Laura: This has to be Heaven. The doors just keep opening.
Marisha: This must be the bright light that everyone sees when they die.
Travis: Don't steal his doors, or anything.
Sam: You want to steal the doors?
Travis: What a terrible thing to say in the presence of the Dawnfather.
Liam: (muffled) All right, one foot in front of the other. Here we go.
Sam: Oh, we can't hear Liam.
Liam: "One foot in front of the other. Here we go," I said.
Taliesin: Let's go.
Matt: You shield your eyes, upon stepping into the actual chamber, because otherwise, even closing your eyes isn't enough; the light is so intense. It still hurts through your eyelids. As you step inside and look off, you can now glance around the interior of this chamber. The same level of fractal-like scrolling detail you saw in the doors lines every inch of the wall on the inside of this large, square chamber, hundreds of feet across on each side. It's incredible. The floor is almost mirrored in its polish. Glancing down, while there is no immediate shadow, behind you, the bright light does cast a bit behind you. You can see your reflection almost perfectly in the polished floor below. You glance up, and you see the interior of that giant steeple-like tower that's sat at the center of the fortress in the distance, and you look up almost endlessly. You can see floor after floor with an endless spiral of various stained glass structures and reliefs and small statues that protrude from the edges, and this tower is seemingly hollow, just leading up, and you can't even make out the top of it from this distance. It looks like a tower that is infinite, almost, from this perspective, it's so big.
Laura: Is the light coming from the tower?
Matt: No, the light's coming from the center of the room. As your eyes slowly adjust and you glance past your fingers and your hands, you see there in the center of the chamber is a 25-foot throne of gold, brass, silver, and ruby. Sitting upon that throne sits a mighty being, wearing the most intricate and beautiful golden plate armor you've ever seen. Similar in detail and design as the interior of the chamber around you, it almost blends in if you didn't see it shift. A white cloak encases the shoulders of this entity and sways gently at their side like it's been brushed off and dangles over one of the arm rests. And where a head would be, instead there is a burning star, so bright that you can only look but a second before you have to avert your gaze and shut your lids out of the pain. Just enough time to barely make out the outline of what appears to be a male head, almost featureless, burning within the corona. This, you can only imagine, is the Dawnfather himself, Pelor. As you step into the chamber, the door (boom) closes behind you, and the winged planar entities that pushed you in are not in the chamber. It's just you... and the Dawnfather.
Sam: Look how far we've come, guys. (laughter)
Sam: From throwing shit at people...
Laura: Didn't you do that just last week?
Sam: I did. I do that most weeks.
Laura: Grog--
Travis: Yes?
Laura: Next time we visit the Dawnfather, wear some underwear. This floor is like a mirror.
Travis: But I don't ever-- oh, okay.
Taliesin: What are you-- oh god.
Sam: Ooh! You mean I can-- oh, sorry. (laughter)
Matt: "Vox Machina."
Travis: Oh shit. (laughter)
Travis: Little bit of pee comes out. A little bit.
Marisha: You guys, he knows our name.
Matt: "You come with purpose. I can sense your determination. What would you tell me of your purpose?"
Taliesin: Vecna walks the earth.
Marisha: We are here to prevent the coming of a third Calamity.
Travis: We seek the means to destroy him and all he stands for.
Marisha: He seeks ascension into godhood.
Liam: And all your children are in danger, and we have begun communing with the gods. I extend slowly the wings and bow my head in deference to him.
Taliesin: The Divergence is threatened. Your guards, your creatures, have some of our proof in their care, at the moment.
Matt: "Another seeks the path of the Matron of Ravens. A flaw in our annihilation of her hubris. That it still exists is dire news. That it exists in the hands of such a slippery, vile mortal as Vecna, even more so. I thank you for your haste in sharing your findings. I shall ponder a strategy." He leans back in his chair, brushes his hand like this, and the doors behind you (boom) open.
Laura: It was you that I was speaking to, in Whitestone. I had no idea. We have the eye of Vecna.
Matt: His form shifts a bit, seems to lean forward on the throne, resting the bright, burning, star-like head on the edge of his gauntleted fist, leaning forward in your direction. You try and glance up, but it hurts in the presence. "Present the artifact."
Sam: Well, we gave it to--
Laura: No, we still have it.
Sam: Oh, we do?
Laura: Yeah, he kept it with us.
Ashley: Oh, I have it, actually.
Sam: Could you guys turn them up? We can't hear them at all.
Laura: Please.
Matt: So as you place the box on the ground--
Ashley: I'll try to take it over-- I'm going to leave it on the ground; it's a little hot over there.
Matt: Okay. As you leave it on the ground, you can't see his eyes, you can't see where he's facing necessarily, but you can sense his attention; it's like a beacon across the room. It's ever-present, but there is definitely a focal point that you can sense when it comes to you, it's like having a spotlight on you amongst a theater of thousands of people. It's intimidating, but also exhilarating. The beacon shifts in the direction of the small box you placed on the ground. Immediately the box flips open, and you watch as the eye levitates out on its own, twitching and looking around in all directions. It has no lid to close, and the tiny slit-like iris of it seems to retract best it can, in the presence of such bright light. You hear this low, ruminating (hums). "Do you have purpose with this?"
Sam: Only if it can help us destroy Vecna.
Matt: "Do you know how this would help you destroy Vecna?"
Marisha: We don't know how to destroy Vecna.
Taliesin: We seek knowledge and power.
Marisha: And assistance.
Matt: "I could destroy this right now, only if you do not need it. Its existence is a threat. But the choice is yours, since you brought it before me."
Laura: Do you know what help it would be to us on the Material Plane?
Matt: He stares through you. The beacon finds you.
Marisha: It's not the only one in existence. There are others.
Taliesin: I think it might be, yes.
Marisha: Right?
Liam: That's his eye.
Matt: There are other people missing eyes, but this is the only one--
Liam: It's his. And it should be destroyed.
Sam: Right now?
Laura: Maybe it'll make him weaker, if it is destroyed. He obviously put it in his scion. We destroy it, we keep someone else like Delilah Briarwood from coming into power. Right?
Taliesin: Yes, I think...
Laura: I say destroy it.
Liam: Delilah was obviously his pawn and she was using it. Fuck it. Destroy it.
Taliesin: We stand with... a master of the Grey Hunt. She is the one who can speak for Whitestone on that level. If you say destroy it, we destroy it.
Matt: The beacon comes back to you again. The stage beneath you, everyone around you, seems to vanish in the light that's the attention of this entity, this god, ancient beyond all thought and reason that you would contemplate, awaiting your answer.
Laura: You know so much more than we do. If you believe it is unsafe, then we trust your wisdom in destroying it.
Matt: "The wisdom of the creators is to instill their creations with the choice of their own destiny."
Laura: Then I say destroy it.
Marisha: What if we can--
Matt: "The choice is made." And with that point you watch as, without leaving attention from you, the eye begins to lift up out of the box once more. The hand that was under the chin unfurls into a clasping set of fingers, and as they clench together, you hear the metal clink and grind, and you watch as this light begins to flare around the eye. And if you could hear a squeaking scream from a powerful artifact, you watch as it just burns in a flash. And (shattering noise) the shattering sound echoes throughout the room. You see a burst of greenish dark energy, and for a moment, the light in the room seems to dim, like a very faint, almost brown-out.
Travis: (quietly) Shit.
Liam: Good.
Laura: I think that's a good thing.
Ashley: I do, too.
Liam: It is a good thing.
Laura: Yes.
Liam: Vecna's a puppeteer. He used that to move Delilah. It's gone.
Matt: "Now, if you have no further business..."
Laura: We seek out the goddess Ioun, the goddess of knowledge. The ritual of seeding was lost to time, and we know that the goddess Ioun is one of the only keepers of that knowledge.
Matt: There's a moment of contemplation on his end. "She is safe. She recovers, hidden away. I know elements of where she resides, but this information only belongs to those trusted."
Marisha: We know you and her helped seal away the chaos of these secrets before. We may need your help doing it again.
Matt: He leans forward towards you, and you feel the beacon of attention shift towards you this time. And you, Keyleth, who have spent most of your life trying to dodge and dive from the attention of the masses, trying to buck the destiny that has been thrust upon you since childhood, here in this moment, you have the attention of one of the prime creator gods of Exandria, and you feel yourself weaken and strengthen at the same time. You're not sure whether to run or stand, and the voice comes out once more. "I have champions across all of Exandria who have lived longer and proven themselves worthy, capable. My consecrations are taxing, and I will not have it wasted on those set to fail."
Laura: How can we prove ourselves to you?
Matt: "You have not one faithful among you, yet you beseech my blessing."
Marisha: I could be your champion. You could teach me to believe. I, arguably, am faithless. I know you all know that. I believe, and I have respect, and I am awe-inspired by all of this. But faith, I still don't know if I have, but I... I believe you could teach me.
Matt: "Is there anyone else who would challenge this proclamation?"
Laura: I don't want to challenge you, Keyleth.
Marisha: What? We already have one champion of the Raven Queen. Why not?
Taliesin: Once, you blessed Whitestone.
Matt: "Whitestone is under my watch and keep. It was created through the battlefield in which I sealed Tharizdun himself. It was the grounds in which Ioun was wounded in the Calamity. There was much sorrow in those lands. Yes, it is under my watch."
Marisha: I'm friends with the Sun Tree. We talk occasionally.
Matt: "A faithless stands to try and accept the champion's mantle. I ask once more, is there any to challenge this claim?"
Laura: Keyleth... let me? I've never felt this before.
Marisha: You are the lady of Whitestone. It suits you.
Matt: "Very well. You step forth with the growing bud of faith. That befits the growth of a champion. I will see you show me your quality. You, as the vessel, kneel before me."
Laura: I kneel.
Matt: He leans forward at the edge of the throne, you hear the metal clinking as the plates shift and move. And you can hear now, at the proximity as he leans down towards you, the faint flicker of the surface of the sun-like head that is the beacon of the Dawnfather's face. "You would accept my trial, brave soul? Then you and your allies must ascend the Tower of the Zenith. The chosen among you, Lady Vex'ahlia, you must reach the top of the tower before this time runs thin." As he lifts his hand you watch, as apparating in the air, a container of glass with sand across the top. He lifts his other hand. Another one appears. And these two hourglasses now held aloft, gliding slowly above the space where you stand. "Ascend to the zenith. Embrace your faith and throw yourself in the Fires of Dawn. Should you be strong of heart and your faith be true, the flames will grant you my blessing."
Laura: Just me, or the group of us?
Matt: "You must jump into the flames. They can help you ascend. However, your trial begins now." And you watch as one of the glasses suddenly shifts, and three of the winged planars appear in the room, armored around you, arms crossed, and they look to be trying to block the passage into the tower as they fly up. You look up to the seemingly endless beacon above you, to the top of the tower that you cannot see at this distance, and you know immediately, somehow, quickly, you have to get there. So. What are you doing?
Travis: Oh god!
Marisha: I. Hate. Timed. Challenges.
Laura: Well, I've got the boots, but I-- okay, I'm going, I take off.
Sam: Wait!
Liam: Click your Boots of Haste.
Sam: I'm going to to turn her into a red dragon.
Travis: Do you want that?
Laura: Sure. I click my Boots of Haste before he does it.
Matt: Okay, so you click your Boots of Haste. They come into you, you feel the surge of energy, the rush, the burst of adrenaline through your body, as you begin casting?
Sam: True Polymorph.
Laura: Oh my god. Does that ever end? Do you have to cancel it?
Sam: Yes.
Matt: All right, so as you begin to ascend, you watch as the three planar begin to rush towards you, their arms out to grasp. Anyone else going to do anything?
Travis: Yeah, I would like to smash my gauntlets together and cast Enlarge.
Matt: All right, so you go into your larger form now.
Travis: And rage. I'll charge one of them.
Matt: They're up in the air. She's flying up.
Taliesin: You've got the carpet.
Travis: And I pull the carpet out.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: I click my Boots of Spider Climbing and spend an action surge to draw and start taking shots at the wings. I want to drop them out of the air.
Matt: Okay, go for it, make three shots. Very quickly. As you're ascending on the broom as quickly as possible, and they begin to converge on you, you feel this tickle of energy in the back of your mind and you watch as your hands begin to suddenly grow claws and scales, a red color.
Travis: Vax! Do something!
Liam: I cast Shield of Faith on my own ass.
Matt: Okay. Shield of Faith cast on Vax.
Laura: Can everybody fly?
Taliesin: I'm running up the wall.
Laura: Before I Polymorph, I toss you my broom.
Sam: Are you going to allow that?
Matt: Sure. So you throw the broom off the side, and you begin to plummet immediately through the air. As you're concentrating on the spell to cast it, you finish it off, and you plummet back about half the distance, and then (whoosh) these giant leathery red dragon wings whip out of your form, and you catch yourself. The broom clatters to the ground, and Scanlan marches over and grabs it, manages to get it under his grasp.
Laura: You know that word!
Matt: All righty. So you begin to ascend upward, right as they begin to descend on your dragon form.
Taliesin: 20, 24, and 36.
Matt: 20, 24, and 36, they all hit!
Taliesin: That's a strength saving throw, or they fall a little bit.
Matt: Strength saving throw, all right, that is an 18?
Taliesin: Nope. They fall.
Matt: 21?
Taliesin: That's okay.
Matt: And a 12. So two of them. You shoot two of the wings out of the way and they plummet down, and you manage to coast past two of them in your dragon form. One of them does manage to grab onto you and get its hands, big strong hands on the back of your head and try and steer you to the side.
Laura: Can I cast Frightful Presence?
Matt: We'll get to that in just a moment. It's going to attempt to-- no. It tries to pull against you, but even with its extremely strong planar strength it cannot guide you away from the path, and you push past. You are now outside of the chamber in the base of the tower, just flying upward. You can go ahead and use your Frightful Presence. All right, so that's your action.
Laura: All of the creatures-- no, of my choosing, so all the bad-- not bad guys, but you know, people we're fighting.
Matt: As you roar loudly and it echoes, filling the entirety of the chamber, the music of the surroundings now merging and shifting with this horrible dragon roar. None of these angelic entities seem even remotely affected by it.
Laura: Oh, really? They don't even have to make a wisdom saving throw?
Matt: They are immune to fear. Or being frightened, sorry.
Laura: That makes sense.
Matt: But do you continue flying upward? Okay! So you finish your spell, you take your shots, Keyleth, Pike, anything?
Ashley: Am I close enough to Grog to hop onto the carpet, as well?
Matt: Okay, so Pike and Grog get onto the carpet. Keyleth, what are you doing?
Marisha: Are people clustered up together by now?
Laura: Do I take the alignment of the animal that I'm polymorphed into?
Matt: Not the alignment, just your mental scores.
Marisha: Are people super clustered, or is she now clustered with them?
Matt: No, she's above everybody. She's way past all you guys; she shot straight up.
Marisha: So the angel dudes are all clustered together?
Matt: Two of them fell a little bit, one of them's on her back. She's making her way up, guys. The first stained glass is starting to run out.
Marisha: Throw up a big level five Flaming Sphere. Ah, wait can I do a, with my spear can I do a higher-level Fireball? And just do more charges out of it? Or no?
Matt: I'll say no because you can't spend more charges to increase the level of the spell.
Marisha: Then I will do a 5th-level Flaming Sphere.
Matt: Okay, so the Flaming Sphere slams upward against the side there. Saving throw. Rolls a one on saving throw. So it takes damage. Flaming spear hits it, however--
Marisha: It doesn't hit both of them?
Matt: No, you can slam it into one creature per turn. The one that's on her back, you mean? What's the range on the flaming sphere?
Laura: Come on, the time is running out!
Matt: No time for a book. Never mind; it doesn't matter. The flaming sphere slams into one of the ones that's not on her back. It's too far out of your range.  All right, so. Who's doing what next?
Travis: We're rocketing up on the rug.
Matt: Okay, the rug, not very fast, and her speed is much faster as a dragon, so you guys are coming up behind and you're just watching the dragon (flapping).
Travis: Are we close to any of the other two that are at the bottom?
Matt: No, but as soon as that timer went out, the chamber's roof above you slams shut. You're all cut off from Vex.
Taliesin: I was running up the wall. I didn't make it in time?
Matt: Not at your speed, no. It's a big chamber.
Laura: Okay, I'm going to haste, as fast as I can. When I clicked my boots, do I still get a hasted action?
Matt: Yes, you do.
Laura: Okay, cool, then I can go 160 feet.
Matt: Yes, you can. The planar is still holding on to the back of your head, it's going to make another strength check.
Laura: I'm going to try to tail whip him. Is that a thing I can do?
Matt: Make an athletics check.
Laura: Okay. Oh, I have a red dice, it's so perfect and I never choose this one.
Matt: What did you roll?
Laura: Oh, okay, well. What am I adding to it?
Matt: Add your strength modifier. If there isn't an athletics score, then whatever your strength modifier is.
Laura: That would be plus five?
Sam: Are you talking about hers or the dragon's?
Laura: Oh, a plus seven. So 13.
Matt: 13. The planar grabs one side of your horn and causes you to slam into the side of the tower, and you skid across and smash into one of the stained glass windows which (smash) fires out the side and you end up slowing down a bit and it actually takes you a moment, it halves your speed for this round. You try and get your wings back up. Are you going to do anything about the guy on your back or are you going to keep plugging as fast as you can upwards?
Laura: He's on my back, or he's like hanging onto me?
Matt: He's on your neck and head. He's holding on and trying to steer you off to the side by controlling your movement.
Laura: I'm going to spin and try to slam into the wall and knock him into the stone.
Sam: Can she do like a wing thing?
Laura: Yeah, I'm going to use my wings to thrust me faster into the wall.
Matt: Okay, go ahead and make an athletics check.
Laura: No, no. Okay. Athletics check, was a plus seven, so 19.
Matt: 19? 17. so you slam into the wall and you hear (groans) behind you. The stained glass that shattered, reforms right where you left it, and you continue to ascend upwards. Still holding onto you, but it's now disadvantaged on its next roll because you slammed it into the wall. So (flapping) making your ascent upward as fast as you can, you watch as the tower slowly pincers closer and closer. You watch as another layer begins to close above. All right. He's going to attempt to try and slam you into the wall again. Go ahead and make another athletics check. Roll a d20 and add your strength modifier. Go for it.
Laura: Okay. That one didn't count.
Matt: You didn't intend to roll it.
Laura: Okay. Ooh, okay, 21.
Matt: Yeah, you beat him. He tries to pull you off to the side and you begin to skid into it. Your wing hits the side of the tower (scraping noise), but you keep pushing forward. The pain hits you, you end up taking about 25 points of damage, just grinding into this divine golden side but you keep flying up (flapping) the tower gets tighter and tighter and tighter. You now can see as the planar is going to attempt to--
Laura: Wait, can I--
Matt: What are you going to do?
Laura: Is he hanging onto me with one arm now? What is he doing, because I knocked him into the wall, right?
Matt: Yeah. What are you doing?
Laura: I'm going to just dash. I'm going to fuck him and just dash.
Matt: You're going to go double speed, all right.
Laura: Double speed!
Matt: You shoot up. That gives him a full round to go ahead and try and scare you off. Roll again with your strength.
Laura: 15.
Matt: (crash) Slams you into the wall. You skid and slow down a little bit. You can see it's closing. But you are dashing so you get a second speed run, which does get you up towards where the wall's closing now. You can see now the bright light is getting brighter and brighter. Your eyes are hurting in its presence, you can see a large brazier at the top of the tower that is now in flames, before you. You're not quite there; you have one more round. He's going to go ahead and now turn around, and now the angel turns around on your face. He is going to attempt to punch in your eyes.
Sam: Do you have legendary--
Laura: I'm going to use my legendary resistance.
Matt: Well, it's a physical attack on you. What's your AC?
Laura: 19. Natural.
Matt: Yeah, it hits you, you take disadvantage on your next strike. Go ahead and roll an athletics check to try and buck him off. One last time, this is the only one you have time for. Disadvantage because he punched you in the face.
Laura: Okay, 14.
Matt: 14, all right, you're slowing down, you're slowing down, you're not quite getting there, he's bashing you in the face--
Laura: I'm going to take my claws up and rake him!
Matt: Okay, make another strength check.
Laura: What is it, 18!
Matt: 11! You thrust him off your face! As he falls off down below, (flapping) you make it up to the top, and you now see the brazier is about the size of your dragon form. It's physically your size and you can see now the tower's beginning to close around you, what are you going to do?
Laura: I'm going to reach the tower thing and push myself up through.
Matt: Okay, you pull your way up to the top, and now you're right above the brazier and the flames. You look down into the brazier, the fire there burning is ever-present light--
Laura: I rush into the fire!
Matt: You dive into the fire. Your dragon form. which resists it at that point, it immerses your entire form, at which point you hear the tower, guys, above you crack and you hear this echoing (smash) sound, of what sounds like shattering of a thousand windows at once. You, as you dive into the flames, feel this moment of searing bright pain in your eyes, in your mind. Your dragon form is immune to flames, but your form suddenly shrinks, the spell dispelled, the dragonoid form cast away. You sense this kind of lost nothing; your whole body is numb at this point, and you are just surrounded by a white light. Much like where Vax, in the plane in his communion with the Raven Queen is shrouded in darkness, this is endless, every color. You have no sense of personal form. You have no sense of time, place, and for the first time in a long time, you don't remember your name. For a brief instant, you think, what bit of conscious thought you can make, is this is what oblivion feels like? Did you make the right choice? Were you led astray? Were you strong of heart enough? The flames were intended to cleanse away sin, darkness, possibly those who are unworthy. Is this it now? Did you fail? You guys down below watch as the chamber doors that closed off above you (scraping noise) open up again to reveal the tower. And you can see there, suspended in the middle of the air, thousands of shards of stained glass that had shattered inwards from the impact but frozen, held in place. As they all slowly retract back, reforming the windows that were once there. Whatever impact or shock wave had scattered them below reversed and repaired. And you watch as they do so, ascending, until the tower's back untouched as it was. The one planar that had ridden the dragon form of Vex towards the top of the tower slowly descends (flapping) and lands next to the three others. And they all give a nod towards the Dawnfather, who's still there, not looking upward, just looking at the rest of the remaining members of Vox Machina, his beacon of attention just shifting from one to the other. The three planars leave the still-open doors. "What does she mean to you?"
Sam: To us? Oh god.
Matt: "To you, all of you."
Marisha: I told you that I was faithless, which might be true when it comes to the gods, but not with Vex'ahlia, not with Vox Machina. She gives me my power.
Sam: Her name is Vex, and she is greedy and mean sometimes, and she can steal a lot. She's a little bit not the greatest person, but her flaws highlight everything that is right about her, which is she does all these things to protect her friends and her family. She would give her life for any of us and for anyone who was truly in need. And she's not perfect, but she's the most perfect of all of us.
Travis: She believes in me. She tries to teach me to use my brain, which I don't do very often. She tries to teach me to learn from the world. And she always cheers me on, which not a lot of people do. I believe in her.
Matt: The beacon shifts to you, Pike.
Ashley: I don't have a real sister, but I consider her more of my sister than I've ever had. She's family, and if you take her from me, there will be hell to pay.
Matt: The beacon shifts to Percival.
Taliesin: She is Mistress of the Grey Hunt of Whitestone, Baroness of the First House of Whitestone. She is my heart and my judgment and the future that I have chosen, and she is the one that I have betrothed to.
Sam: What? Betrothed?
Matt: The beacon shifts back to Vax.
Liam: She is every hope I have. When I am gone, she will make the world right. She has the intelligence and the savviness and the heart to make real-world decisions. She is me, but better. She is your champion.
Matt: "Then there is hope." And you watch as in the center of the chamber, a second star seems to be birthed before you, this bright point of light that begins to swell in equal intensity as the head of the Dawnfather himself, as a flash consumes the chamber, and there before you, you see, now reborn, hair scattered back, intact, slowly descending, eyes closed, consciousness not yet drawn from within: Vex'ahlia. As her feet touch the ground and she falls to her knees, she breathes in. Your eyes open. You look around and see the faces of your friends, your family. And you're immediately aware of the presence of the entity behind you. As you spin and look, whereas there once was a burning star-- and to the rest of you, you see the painful, endless light that averts your gaze-- it doesn't hurt your eyes as much, and you can see the faint features, the soft cheeks, the hairless head, and the bright warm eyes of he who brings the dawn. And you can see the smile there, behind the light. "There is hope." Get your blessing of the Dawnfather. (gasping and cheering)
Travis: Holy shit, Super Saiyan.
Laura: What did I get? What is it?
Matt: You naturally have resistance to necrotic damage.
Laura: That's good for me. That fucking Finger of Death.
Matt: And if you want to read the rest of that, you can.
Laura: As a bonus action, you channel the light of day into your being. For one hour you admit, emit-- fuck me running, you emit bright light in a 120-foot radius, and any evil creature within that 120-foot radius that hits you with an attack or spell immediately suffers 4d6 radiant damage and is knocked prone.
Marisha: Wow! You're a walking nuke!
Liam: Shine bright like a diamond.
Laura: (laughs) Once this blessing ability is used, it can't be used again for seven days.
Ashley: Yeah!
Laura: Holy moly.
Ashley: Blessings of the gods!
Taliesin: We'll have to add a sixth star to the de Rolo crest. Fucking excited.
Laura: Thank you. Thank you for allowing me to represent you.
Matt: "If what you say is true, then we are too late to prevent his ascension. Know that killing a god is beyond even most deities. To destroy is to diminish one low enough to seal them away for eternity, as I have done once before. Such a technique I used to banish the Chained Oblivion once, after it nearly slew the Knowing Mistress. Having brought it low in battle, Ioun had devised something she called the Prime Trammel."
Sam: The Prime Trammel.
Matt: "Guided by a sizable sliver of a god's power, one such device could be formed, and when enough are affixed to a wounded god, seal them away in a plane beyond the Astral Sea. Such a method could perhaps force a new god back through the Divine Gate and beyond the reach of your world. Ioun, however, the one who has the design for such an artifact-- she has been in hiding since her wounding. She heals still, the wounded god, and has feared for the past eight centuries that her enemies seek to finish the job. We communicate on occasion through missives and emissaries. All that I know is the key to her hidden realm is within someone. The last word from the mistress from nearly a century before granted me this." The gauntleted hand extends and opens, and there you see, apparating in the space above, what appears to be a three-dimensional topographical map of some kind. It slowly rotates, made of pure sunlight and flame. It's a mountain range with a glowing light within a small, hidden house or hovel within a forest. Make an investigation check. I would say Keyleth, Vex'ahlia, Vax'ildan, and Scanlan.
Sam: Natural 20.
Laura: Oh, good, thank god. Because mine sucked.
Marisha: Also a natural 20.
Sam: It's a real good map.
Matt: Yeah. What did you get, Vax?
Liam: Not a natural 20.
Matt: Okay. Glancing at it, both of you recognize, as it pulls back and shifts inward, this is deep within the Cliffkeep. This is far north of Kraghammer. This is in a forested region outside the Pools of Wittebak.
Marisha: Pools of Wittebak?
Matt: Wittebak. Once a gnomish home, it befell to a terrible natural occurrence sparked by unnatural means, and since has become a series of acidic and toxic natural liquids and waters that burble up from beneath the earth, and many wandering giants and larger ogrish folk use to their heart's content. But it's not in the Pools of Wittebak, just near it, this strange hovel. The voice of the Dawnfather burns forth once more, the heavy resonance shaking the room. "If you seek to devise these Prime Trammels, then take this stone, my champion. It should be enough essence for one of them." You watch as he reaches up into the halo, the corona of light around the head, and plucks from behind an ear a small bead of extremely bright light. As he pulls it from his head, you watch the strength and intensity of his glow ever so faintly diminish, and places it in your hand. As soon as it releases from the gauntleted fingers-- so massive, each finger is as thick as your torso, it plops into your palm, and the glow fades, and there before you, you see what looks to be some sort of an oval-like opal.
Laura: I love opals.
Matt: "Now, I have invested what I can safely do within you. Go. Be swift. Find this key. Strike soon. Destroy or seal this great evil and prove my faith in you is not misplaced, Vex'ahlia."
Laura: It won't be.
Matt: The doors behind you that are already partially ajar (rumble) open up all the way.
Laura: I guess I'll put this in a really safe pocket, then. There's one that's got an extra snap. Triple snap and then a zipper over it.
Marisha: Just don't let it fall in the toilet when you go over to flush.
Travis: I take out the little pebble and I drop it on the floor.
Matt: You reach for the pebble. It's not there.
Travis: Shit. Is there a hole in it? No?
Matt: No hole. Sarenrae was not going to teleport you across the realm, letting you take away one of the prized souls of her people.
Travis: Oh, those were the souls!
Liam: That was the pope, Travis. That was the pope.
Travis: Should've swallowed the rock.
Matt: As you exit the chamber, you can see the various souls and planar that wander the halls on their own business have all now joined shoulder to shoulder as a procession, showing you a respectful exit from the compound. As you walk, they all seem to give a nod of respect towards Vex'ahlia, the now freshly chosen champion of Pelor for this endeavor. As you step beyond the staircase that leads you down beyond the Fortress of the Sun, into the center of the clearing that is watched and protected by the various trees of the Dawnfather, looking out amongst the endless progression of the orchards, you consider what your next path is to discover who and what this key is to Ioun, and hopefully there's enough time., because time, right now, and the decisions you make, will greatly affect what can and cannot be done. And that's where we're going to end tonight's session.
Travis: Oh my god. What the fuck!
Marisha: Champions over here.
Laura: Oh shit.
Sam: (singing) We are the champions.
Matt: This is so fun. I haven't been able to do epic-level content! That's so fun!
Marisha: Is every episode going to be this emotional for the rest of the game? I can't keep doing this.
Travis: Liam, what did you say?
Liam: I said the twins are officially salt and pepper shakers.
Matt: You totally are.
Laura: Oh my god, and I have the white--
Matt: You have the white dragon scale armor.
Liam: That's right.
Laura: Tight.
Matt: That's actually pretty great.
Taliesin: I think this actually changes the crest of Whitestone now, because now there's a sixth champion of Pelor who's of Whitestone. Six stars, not five now. Holy cow.
Matt: Oh man. You should really not change that crest, because it's in the campaign guide that's being published in two months.
Taliesin: It would only be hers.
Matt: Okay, there we go. I feel better about that now.
Taliesin: It would only be her house crest.
Matt: You know, it's okay, because the book technically takes place before all of this. There you go.
Liam: Matt, I also have to throw out. We on Skype now get the full Twitch view, so I'm seeing you guys with all your icons, with everything, and it is the weirdest amalgamation of Baldur's Gate and Sega's full-motion video game from 1995 Night Trap starring Different Strokes.
Matt: That's all I've wanted. All I've ever wanted as a creative was to develop, design, and produce what I would consider to be today's Night Trap for you all. If we could achieve that, I've done my job.
Travis: Liam, we miss you! Ashley, we miss you!
Ashley: I know, I miss you guys!
Matt: Thank you for staying up late with us. We really appreciate it, guys.
Ashley: I love you, guys.
Marisha: We're god hunting without you guys. It's weird.
Taliesin: We need our east coasters.
Ashley: Man, to think I almost didn't Skype in tonight.
Matt: I know! I'm glad you could.
Liam: I'll give all my cows a hug for you.
Matt: All right, guys. Our tickets for the live show at Gen Con go up tomorrow morning. Look for that. Hopefully see you guys there.
Travis: It's in an even bigger theater. We had an amazing time last time, and this theater is even larger, and will be mad, mad crazy.
Sam: Live, in person. Find out how tall Travis really is.
Liam: Four foot three.
Laura: We're all teeny.
Matt: Well, thank you guys so much. Rest well, especially you east coasters, and you east coasters, and you other country-ers. Have a wonderful night. Sleep well.
Laura: Thank you Marvel Puzzle Quest!
Matt: Thank you Marvel Puzzle Quest for being our awesome sponsor!
Marisha: And check out the podcast!
Matt: Check out the podcast, which is awesome. And is it Thursday yet? Good night, guys! [music]

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello everyone, and welcome to Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons and Dragons. Before we get into tonight's episode, we've got to get through a few announcements. First off, we have our wonderful Darin De Paul joining us again. (cheering)
Matt: Thank you, Darin.
Darin: Thank you!
Matt: Excited to have you back. We've all recovered from a crazy Comic-Con, mostly.
Laura: Have we recovered?
Matt: I'm being optimistic here. We're recovering from a Comic-Con. Got a chance to meet a bunch of you guys out there. It was a lot of fun, but we're here to get our announcements started, so let me do that. First off, Laura, I believe there's a merch update.
Laura: Yes, there is, and I just realized I had it on and I hadn't announced it yet. So we got these back in the store! But they're red now. We've got them on this chain and on this chain rope-thing. Cord. And we've got them a keychain. And now, I don't know if you saw them before, but they took a long time to get, and now we just have them in the store.
Sam: Are they going to run out again?
Laura: I don't know. It depends on how many people buy them, I guess, but we're going to try to keep them in stock. That's the statement that like, okay, that happened, but this is what I'm really excited about.
Marisha: Tell them!
Laura: (sings victory song) Is the camera on? I can't tell. It's a pencil pack. I asked them to make this, because this is so great. So we all have our own pencils. Everybody has a pencil. We've got the "How do you want to do this?" pencil. We've got the "I would like to rage" pencil. We've got a Scanlan pencil-- oh no, this is a Tary pencil. This is a "Doty, take this down" pencil. I don't want to say all the things because they're so great, but check them out. It's in the store now. Does everybody want their pencil?
Sam: Are these #2 pencils? Could someone take the SAT with my "Doty, take this down" pencil?
Laura: It's a #2 pencil!
Sam: Whoa, that's so amazing!
Travis: Percy, what's yours?
Taliesin: I don't want to say.
Laura: Do you want the Trinket pencil, Darin?
Darin: Yeah!
Laura: Such a good one. Oh, this is the Pike one. And here's yours, Matt. It's pretty dope, so check them out. I'm in love.
Matt: What's great is if you use it a lot, eventually "How do you want to do this?" becomes "do you want to do this?" to "you want to do this?" to "want to do this?" to "do this?" to "this?" (laughs) It's existential the entire time you're using the pencil. I'm really excited about that.
Laura: I hadn't even thought about that.
Taliesin: I'm so excited now to see what it spells out.
Matt: It just keeps on giving. Thank you, Laura.
Laura: You're welcome. I'm excited.
Matt: All right. Next up, for Gen Con, we have our live show. We only have about 400 tickets left.
Sam: Is that true?
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: For us? We're just a bunch of nerdy-ass voice actors.
Travis: We already surpassed the number of seats we had last year, because we have an extra thousand seats in this larger theater. It's going to be a madhouse. We only have 400 left.
Laura: And there may or may not be-- I don't know if I should announce this.
Liam: One of us is going to die that night, and I don't mean a character.
Laura: We may or may not have special merchandise that you can only get at the live show.
Sam: Whoa. But surely it will be in the store afterwards?
Laura: Nope, it's just a live show thing.
Sam: Just exclusive to the live show?
Travis: Well, see, you'd have to be there to find out, so if there is a car, a plane, or a train, or a telephone booth around you, get to Indianapolis on August 18th!
Laura: August 18th! How was that?
Travis: Shit. It was terrible. It was really bad.
Laura: Damn it.
Matt: I'll be excited if anyone got my Wonder Showzen reference.
Liam: Not even anyone at the table.
Matt: No. That means you means need to be enlightened by the wonder that is Wonder Showzen. No, you should not. It's disturbing as shit. Just stacking you up today, boy!
Darin: (child-like voice) This is the best place ever! Thank you so much for this! It makes me very happy.
Matt: Give him anything he wants if he keeps making that sound. All right! Campaign guide info. Update on the campaign guide stuff I would like to give you. However, I think it's probably easier to get it from the mama bird's mouth, so we actually have in the studio today joining us, Chris Pramas from Green Ronin. (cheering)
Matt: Come in and join me down here for a second and talk into the camera. Hey, buddy! CHRIS PARAMS: Too low? Is this all right?
Matt: I think we're all right.
Laura: They might just see your forehead.
Matt: Just the forehead.
Laura: There it is! I know, this is great.
Matt: So what's the update? CHRIS PARAMS: So last week we put the campaign guide up for sale and it exceeded all of our expectations, yes. So thank you to everyone who pre-ordered. This is by far the most successful pre-order that we've ever had for a book, so you're rocking it. It has led to an unexpected complication, though, in that our initial print run is of a size that cannot be changed right now. We had to stop taking pre-orders so we would have some to send to stores, because obviously, we value game stores and we want them to have some, so I just wanted to reassure everybody that this book is not a limited edition book. We're printing more, so if you were not able to pre-order it, you will be able to get it later. We're basically going to immediate reprint. In the interim, the PDF is still available, so you can get that if you like electronic books, or if you have a local store, they can take part in what's called our Pre-Order Plus program. It allows people to pre-order through the store and then get the $5 PDF deal that we were offering as part of the pre-order. So ask your local stores, do you take part in Pre-Order Plus? If you need a link for that, you can check our Twitter. Otherwise, second print run will be along as soon as we can get it.
Matt: Fantastic. Thank you so much, Chris! Appreciate it, buddy. Enjoy the show! CHRIS PARAMS: Oh, and we'll have copies at Gen Con.
Matt: Yes, we'll have copies at Gen Con!
Travis: Even more reason!
Liam: Boy, is that book fucking beautiful!
Marisha: It is!
Laura: Good job, you guys.
Matt: I'm so nervous about its release.
Sam: I have some notes on the cover.
Travis: I have some notes on the book. Could it have less words?
Matt: No, it just has less gnome bard.
Sam: Oh shit.
Liam: The whole race died off in a Calamity. They don't know what happened. Pike was the only one who was spared.
Matt: It's so weird. (laughs) Don't worry, we have a fix on the way. It'll be fine. Next up: Critical Role podcast on iTunes and such.
Marisha: More is coming very soon. Very, very soon. Next batch is coming.
Matt: Cool. So we'll have that announcement as soon as we have the specific dates for the next batch. Should be coming up very soon. Once again, we have Talks Machina on Tuesdays. We'll be next Tuesday at 7:00pm Pacific to discuss this episode tonight with our fantastic host, Brian Foster. Looking forward to that. The Sagas of Sundry: Dread show that me and Taliesin are part of. Fifth episode is up is today on Alpha.
Taliesin: It's almost over.
Matt: I know. We have one more episode of this, right?
Marisha: And check out these awesome Dread shirts, you guys! They're in the store. Aren't they awesome?
Matt: If you haven't seen it yet, it's a fantastic pseudo-theater improv RPG horror show with me and Taliesin as part of the cast. Marisha's one of the executive producers, and Darin De Paul is our fantastic Rod Serling intro personality. So check it out if you haven't yet.
Marisha: Mr. Wren!
Matt: Mr. Wren. It's a fun one. I think that's it.
Liam: Wait, there's a couple more things.
Matt: They're not on the list!
Liam: Well, you got a little boxy back there that you should pull out.
Matt: Oh, right! Yes!
Laura: What is it?
Travis: Does it have a small creature in it?
Laura: Does it have air holes?
Matt: This question has come up a lot. The combat tiers, the plastic platforms that I use for height in the game, have been out of stock, out of production for a while now. They're finally available again. Our friends at Emerald Knights got us these boxes. These are available off Paizo.com. You can go ahead and pick up the combat tiers. They are now available again if you've been wondering where the heck to get some.
Travis: And they're out of stock.
Matt: Shit.
Liam: I think Jay at Emerald Knights told me that they're going to be in stores soonish as well, but you can go to Paizo right now-- tweet! And go find them.
Matt: These have saved my ass many times in games, as you've seen. Highly recommended for anyone who's DMing or running a game. It's awesome.
Liam: Been in our game since day one.
Marisha: I remember when I got those for you when they were still prototypes in a little white box.
Matt: Yeah, they were in a little standard cardboard box. You were like, this looks like it should work. Saved my ass.
Liam: And Laura and I are in this really cool game called Lone Echo by Ready at Dawn.
Laura: That's the guys that did The Order.
Liam: We both play AI.
Laura: We're computers.
Liam: Yes. Very calm the whole time.
Laura: That's right. We'll help you out.
Travis: (snoring)
Laura: Which is cool. It's VR. It's really badass, so check it out.
Matt: That's great. Well cool, thank you guys for the update. What you got, Sam?
Sam: No, I got nothing.
Matt: Well then, without further ado--
Laura: Aw, my little Trinket dice bag isn't here.
Travis: Nobody cares but you.
Laura: I think it's still in the thing.
Matt: So to announce that her bag isn't here, we're going to take a moment--
Laura: Sorry. I'll go and get it during the credits.
Matt: There you go. And that being said, guys, let's go ahead and bring this down into tonight's episode of Critical Role. [dramatic music]
Matt: And welcome back, everybody. Last we left off, Vox Machina had been finding their way through the realms to talk with various deities in hopes of getting information, and perhaps a blessing or two, to aid them in their coming battle against Vecna, the intent-to-ascend entity, the long-missing and recently returned archlich that plagued the end of the Age of Arcanum. You have since discovered the location of his rebirth, followed into the Shadowfell, through the city of Thar Amphala, took down his tower of Entropis, did battle, and nearly fell. You escaped in time, and in this recovery period have been seeking out information on how to stop him before this ascension occurs, and by what tools necessary. You've traveled to the Blessed Fields of Elysium, where you met Pike's deity, the Everlight, Sarenrae, where she received her blessing. You made your way to the Fortress of the Sun, where you met with the Dawnfather Pelor, took his challenge, and received his blessing. You were then given information about the whereabouts of Ioun, the Knowing Goddess, and the domain of knowledge, who had been hidden away since her wounding during the Calamity. The key to her realm was apparently hidden within not an object, but an individual. Given loose information about the whereabouts of this individual, you tracked down a small home in the forested regions outside the Pools of Wittebak in the Cliffkeep Mountains. There, you spoke with this individual, this Sprigg the Obnoxious, and then were immediately assailed by a number of assassins sent by the Whispered One, Vecna, apparently keeping watch on your current location and able to send such groups of assassins with vast haste. You did battle, managed to save the life of Sprigg the Obnoxious, and through conversation, unveiled that he was indeed a key to this realm. Keyleth, by entwining your hands with the rest of the party and focusing on this strange magical essence hidden within Sprigg's form, you completed your Plane Shift spell. You found yourself suddenly within a dimension of an endless library, shelves of winding books and tomes that spiral beyond sight. In the midst of this amazing atmosphere, a voice called you to a central portion of the chamber. There, it seems, you've come across the Knowing Mistress, Ioun herself, there awaiting your arrival.
Laura: Did we see her?
Matt: You did.
Laura: Okay. Is she old or young? I can't remember.
Matt: I'm going to go over this. Going to get you in a space. Something to bring us back into the moment. So you glance around, your vision darting from shelf to stack, the dark-lit areas empty of anything but empty vessels carrying books, until you see it. The shelves have stopped ahead to reveal a circular common area within the library where the ground domes downward, an 80-foot concave pit of cushions and tables all standing at odd angles without sliding, holding tea cups and writing implements against gravity as you know it. Long spiralling streams of silver, blue and grey silk descend from the supposed ceiling that is beyond your sight, the material resting in gentle piles amongst the cushions-- sorry, microphone-- against the cushions. Sitting within the center of the dome, no larger than a normal person, is an older woman of long, wavy silver hair. Her olive skin is somewhat weathered with wrinkles but the warmth of her smile and her vibrant purple eyes put you at ease. Her blue and white robes tumble out from her form in tendrils of parchment that snake through the pillows like roots of a giant tree. This is the Mistress, and she beckons you forward.
Sam: We step forward. Are we on the edge of the bowl? Is she in the bowl and we're on the edge of the bowl?
Matt: Yeah. You guys are on the edge of it. She's in the very center of it.
Sam: Are we going to go into the bowl?
Laura: Are we allowed?
Matt: Nothing seems to be holding you back.
Darin: O Ioun, O goddess of knowledge, O lord who knows all. You know. But I don't. Let me ask you a question. And you'll see I didn't phrase that as a question because I know how gods work, and that probably would have been my question and then I might as well have just talked to a turnip. Which I've done. Found it pleasant. That being said, this is my question. The next thing out of my mouth is going to be my question. Why did you choose me to be your key? I'm nothing. I'm a coward. Why would you ever choose me?
Matt: She opens her arms as you stand at the edge of this domed precipice, and you watch as the tendrils unfurl, pulling back a bit, revealing small pathways to walk down toward her. Her arms open in a welcoming motion.
Laura: I'll walk forward.
Taliesin: I'm walking in there.
Sam: Take a tumble.
Matt: "The purpose in choosing you, Sprigg, was, as with all the other keys I've chosen before you, an unlikely choice. You were at odds with many of my outlooks, but I saw within you, still, the seed of the seeker of knowledge. So in that balance, I found a proper vessel. Someone who at once would not be the choice that I would make to hide my key, but a person not beyond the realm of redemption within the domain that I look over."
Darin: Thank you.
Matt: "Now, come. Please, sit. You've come a long way. I'm curious as to what your reasons are for coming to me at this hour and I wish to see if my assumptions are correct. Sit."
Laura: You don't know already?
Darin: Well, the goddess of knowledge is implied in the title. Not insulting anyone. Knock knock.
Matt: "Who's there?"
Darin: You would know.
Matt: You watch as her stoic expression curls into a smile and her head falls back a bit to a small chuckle. (chuckles) "Humor is perhaps a bit thin in these walls as of late. It's nice to have a laugh. Thank you."
Liam: Who was it, though?
Darin: It was me the whole time.
Matt: "It was Larkin, my friend."
Laura: Oh shit.
Liam: She knows everything.
Travis: Larkin!
Darin: I don't know who that is.
Travis: Many don't.
Darin: Well said.
Sam: O mighty Ioun, we are here to ask you for help, for a great danger. You might already know this, but a great danger has befallen the world. There is one who has come from another plane to become a god himself, Vecna. For all we know, he may already have achieved godhood, but he's well on his path.
Matt: "I know much about this individual you speak and I had assumed this was the reason for your arrival."
Laura: Do you know if he's been successful?
Matt: "I do not. I've not sensed any change in the cosmetology of the world. Cosmology, even." Cosmetology.
Travis: I thought that was hair and makeup--
Matt: That's a different word. Her domains expand beyond just knowledge, guys. Hence the unfurling.
Travis: I've been thinking about getting some highlights for this beard.
Liam: It's Frenchie. (laughter)
Travis: (singing) Beauty school dropout.
Matt: "But no. You see, this Vecna is in direct opposition to what I represent, and I believe has taken some precautions to keep from my distant sight, so while I have assumptions and what information makes its way to me, there is a bit of relying on you to fill in the gaps."
Taliesin: What do you wish to know?
Matt: "Well. Do you intend to return to face this entity, or have you chosen or found champions in Exandria who would rise up against this individual?"
Laura: We didn't even realize that was an option.
Taliesin: Hadn't occurred to us.
Marisha: Wow. Maybe that's very self-centered of us, now that I think about it.
Laura: We intend to face him down ourselves.
Travis: We want to fight.
Marisha: We're heading his direction no matter what.
Matt: "Do you think you have the strength required to do this?"
Sam: We're gathering the strength right now. Some among us have already-- the one who's making weird faces has already sworn allegiance to another god.
Travis: Hashtag blessed.
Matt: Her eyes close for a minute and she nods. "The coming fight does indeed warrant the aid that these journeys would muster and I can see the touch of my brethren on you already." And she motions towards Vax and Vex and Pike.
Taliesin: Even with these gods, there is still much doubt as to our success. We are not certain. We are not sure.
Travis: We fought once, and if this is a broom motion, we were just getting swooped. Swept. What is it? Swiffered.
Laura: Pelor mentioned something about the Prime Trammels?
Matt: "I was wondering if that would surface. Well, if you are indeed here seeking my gift, know that I do not grant it lightly. For those who are not already claimed--" She glances around the rest of the group. "Grog Strongjaw. Just being within my realm is of near-painful discomfort to you. For that I apologize and can see you are not to be my vessel."
Laura: It's okay, Grog.
Travis: Oh. What a roller coaster. I was going up and then going back down. Thank you for your gaze, my lady.
Liam: Grog just invented amusement park rides.
Matt: "Keyleth of Zephrah, you have been carved from empathy and acceptance. While you do indeed pursue understanding, my gifts find little purchase on your path of responsibility. Percival Fredrickstein Von Musel Klossowski de Rolo III--"
Sam: (whispering) She knows everything.
Matt: "You have always been a student of knowledge and a seeker of truths. I am fond of your hunger for understanding, but you do keep your secrets and are selfish with your discoveries, still. You have much growing to do. Scanlan Shorthalt, you are a buffoon. At least, that is the facade you craft and display to the world while you weave tales of the experiences around you and share your stories with any who'd listen. You wrestle the mysteries of Exandria from their hidden places and shout them to any who would listen and inspire the lost to find purpose. You hold the blade of the White Duke and walk a parallel path. You are a storyteller, and I am the keeper of all stories. I shall task you with my challenge."
Sam: Not to question your infinite knowledge and judgment, but my stories are more of little bar room tales and silly poems to pass the time. I would hardly call them epic histories of civilization.
Matt: "For now, perhaps."
Darin: We're all stories in the end. Just make sure yours is a good one.
Matt: "Do you think that your compatriots would have the strength now to rise against such a scourge had you not been there to lift their spirits with these tales?"
Laura: It's true, Scanlan.
Sam: I'm really powerful.
Laura: You are.
Liam: And humble.
Sam: It's my best asset.
Liam: And deeper than you let on.
Travis: And the cube.
Laura: (laughing) And a cube.
Matt: She glances over at you with a knowing look.
Sam: If you have faith in me, I will have faith in you and trust you and your knowledge. And I will try to complete any task you ask of me.
Matt: "Then let the challenge be placed before you. Scanlan Shorthalt! Somewhere within this library lies the book that contains the Incantation of Isolation, the arcane rite that banished the Chained Oblivion. You have one hour to retrieve it. Your friends can help you, but you can only present one tome to me. And should it be incorrect, then I shall await another warrior of keen mind to find me and accept my gift, for I can only guide one strong enough to face the foe before you. Return to me when you are certain you've found it. Your challenge begins now." And with that, her entire body vanishes in a gust of wind. All the little tendrils of paper flutter out and come to rest within the dome, and you look up and see the immensity of this library.
Travis: Incantation of Isolation?
Laura: Incantation of Isolation.
Marisha: I speak Primordial.
Travis: We don't know the name of the book, right? So we can't Locate Object.
Sam: There's a tome that contains the incantation of what?
Travis: Isolation.
Laura: Isolation.
Marisha: Isolation.
Sam: Isolation.
Marisha: Which was what they used--
Laura: What is with this pencil? It was dipped in ketchup or something.
Matt: Don't use that pencil. Use one of your own.
Laura: But it needs to be sharpened.
Matt: Just push really hard.
Travis: How do we do that? Sprigg!
Darin: Yes?
Travis: Do you have a tome at your place that has the Incantation of Isolation?
Darin: Not anymore. Burny-burny, ashy-ashy. Bye-bye.
Laura: Do you remember the name of it?
Darin: No.
Laura: I'm going to try casting Locate Object and cast it on the tome that contains the Incantation of Isolation. Try it. Why not.
Travis: Can it work like that?
Laura: I don't know.
Liam: An object known to you as long as you have seen it up close within 30 feet at least once.
Laura: Oh. Really?
Liam: Yeah. It's a spell I have now.
Matt: Describe or name an object that is familiar to you. You sense the direction of the object's location, so as long as the object is within a thousand feet of you.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: So you cast the spell. And you think about it and you concentrate. Nothing.
Laura: I'm going to kneel down and pray to the Dawnfather, since he was one of the ones that helped fight the Chained Oblivion, to see if he could guide us at all.
Matt: Okay. You close your eyes and focus and you begin to beseech the knowledge and wisdom of the Dawnfather. Two minutes pass with no answer.
Liam: During that two minutes, I'm going to scan the room. Is there any design or purpose to the layout of the room? Anything that stands out besides books.
Matt: As you glance around the room quickly, you see there are probably two dozen bookshelf aisle openings all around this central dome area. You begin to look around. You don't see any specific signs. Go ahead and roll a perception check.
Liam: Going to use my last Luck for this sleep cycle. Natural 20.
Matt: Glancing about, you don't see any signs on the books. You do notice, however, there are hundreds of those somewhat spectral keepers of the library that are moving tomes through and organizing and relocating things, just like you saw when you first entered.
Sam: They're spectral?
Matt: They're spectral, yeah.
Sam: I'm going to go try to talk to one of them.
Matt: Okay. One of them's currently pulling books out. You can see the basic shimmering outline of a humanoid form, and they're taking a book off and stacking it and finding another.
Sam: Hello, sir. Do you have language? Can you speak?
Matt: He turns and looks to you for a second.
Sam: Can you help us find a book? It contains an Incantation of Isolation.
Travis: Or about the Chained Oblivion.
Sam: Or about the Chained Oblivion.
Laura: Or about the Calamity or something.
Taliesin: Where are the lives of those who witnessed it?
Matt: It doesn't seem to be at this moment--
Sam: No chance.
Laura: I'm going to hop on my broom to see if I get a ping on my Locate Object.
Sam: Wait. Before we start flying around, what do we know? When was this last used, this book? 886 years ago or whatever, right? 812 years ago.
Laura: Wow, you know that?
Sam: Well, it's 812 P-whatever. PD, right? So 812 years ago. So we're looking for a very old book that was used by Ioun? Who was it used by?
Travis: Potentially. Or the Dawnfather helped seal with Ioun.
Marisha: Correct.
Sam: So it's some sort of a wizard's or sorcerer's tome?
Marisha: I have a question. Didn't one of us have a potion or scroll of language-speaking? Didn't we have that?
Laura: Do any of the tomes have titles on them, though?
Matt: Glancing about, and some of them do. They're all in Celestial.
Taliesin: I'm going to read off some titles.
Marisha: Yeah. Primordial.
Matt: None visibly currently in Primordial.
Sam: Is that the language they used before the--
Laura: I feel like Celestial would be what the Dawnfather would speak, though.
Marisha: Celestial would be close. I would think more close than Primordial.
Matt: So make an investigation check. Who else is looking through books?
Laura: I don't speak Celestial, so it doesn't really matter.
Matt: Well, make separate investigation checks.
Taliesin: 12.
Marisha: We're making investigation checks?
Matt: Anybody who's searching currently, or doing something that involves searching through books.
Liam: 26.
Laura: 21.
Marisha: 20.
Taliesin: 12.
Matt: Okay.
Darin: 22.
Matt: All right. You guys begin fanning out. And it's so overwhelming. It's so immense. There's thousands and thousands and tens of thousands of books within your immediate visual vicinity. And like I said, about 150 feet beyond you, it seems to fade into shadow and the more you walk towards that shadow, it reveals more books. They curve and spiral and almost seem to intertwine into that Escher painting-like advance towards the ceiling you don't see.
Laura: Does it seem like some are older than others?
Matt: Yeah. They seem scattered. As you're going around you find some are Celestial. The further away from the center you get you do find some sections that are other languages. You see some that are in Abyssal. You don't find any that are Primordial yet.
Travis: Scattered amongst or categorized by language?
Matt: The ones that are nearest to the center here are all names. They are all names of people.
Laura: Okay.
Sam: So we need to find one that's not a name of a person.
Darin: Who used the Incantation of Isolation? Perhaps if we find the book of the user, we will find their spells.
Laura: Was it Pelor? Does Pelor have a book?
Sam: Are they dead?
Travis: No, it continues writing, right? Potentially, there's a book.
Sam: So there's a book that says Pelor on it? Or Ioun. Or Dawnfather.
Liam: Or if Vecna is a dead man. Maybe a book with Vecna's name on it?
Laura: I don't know why the Incantation of Isolation would be--
Sam: Hey, Percy, are these books arranged in any order? Chronological, name, anything? Oh, you didn't see anything when you looked?
Matt: You're having a hard time really finding any pattern to the books.
Taliesin: Fuck. There's no pattern.
Laura: Can I look at the bookbinding, though? Do some books seem like they fall apart more?
Matt: Yeah, there's a wide variety of ages and types. The sense of the pattern of the sections of books: some of them seem to be clustered together and some of them seem to have similar colorations the further into the side. The further out you get from this the more scattered they get. It's almost like the organization begins from the center and either they're reorganized for reasons that are beyond your comprehension. You get the sense as you begin to hear this slight grinding-- you got the natural 20?
Liam: Earlier, yeah.
Matt: Yep. So you've been glancing about and looking about. You pick up the slight sound (grinding). And you look up and you can see some of these shelves coming down from the ceiling that are stopping about 30 feet above you are sliding and moving. The actual library seems to have some sort of slow rearranging movement to it.
Liam: Pop out the wings. Go up.
Marisha: I start looking at the ceiling. Is there any type of-- what are those? The observatory. What are those called, Percy? The celestial, tell you the stars thing?
Taliesin: Oh, like some sort of astrolabe or something like that?
Marisha: Yeah. Astrolabe? You know those big rotating things you can put in the year and the month in the calendar.
Matt: Oh, right. Nothing you've seen so far. Make a perception check.
Marisha: What am I looking for? Perception check? That's good. 17. 30 total.
Matt: Looking around your current vicinity, you see nothing like that.
Taliesin: Are there any books in the bowl?
Matt: There are a handful on one of the tables that are around.
Taliesin: I'm going to take a look at what's in the bowl.
Travis: I jump in and start throwing pillows around. Did she leave anything cool behind?
Matt: As you're throwing the pillows, some of them fling off to the side, and you uncover a couple of empty cups of tea.
Travis: I drink them.
Matt: All right. You get some stale library-temperature tea. You do find a couple of large books on one of the nearby tables.
Travis: Ooh! I found a large book on one of the nearby tables.
Taliesin: I'm going to read the names of these books.
Matt: Okay. One of them, the name is Jaina Kumor. Doesn't ring a bell. And another one appears to be a book that pertains to the attempts of creating alchemical transitions from one base element to another. Essentially, what was the attempt at a philosopher's stone-like object long ago and the various trials and tribulations and unfortunate deaths that occurred because of it.
Sam: Interesting.
Liam: Do I see anything different 100, 150 feet up? Does the change in perspective on the room below reveal anything?
Matt: The change in perspective shows you one, you do finally see a ceiling and it's like two mirrored libraries in the ceiling and the floor. There are bookshelves that come up and stop and there are bookshelves that come down and stop, and you look up and you can see there are other spirits hanging upside down walking along the pathways above, as well.
Sam: Wait, so it's like a mirror image, the top and bottom?
Matt: Yeah, but they're not exact mirror images. There's just a bottom and a top part of the library.
Sam: What if that line is the demarcation between pre-Divergence and post-Divergence or something like that?
Laura: That's cool. Go up and in.
Sam: I can't.
Laura: Here, get on the broom, Scanlan. We'll fly up.
Matt: All right. So Scanlan, you jump on her broom. (whooshing) You fly up. Who's taking a look? Make an investigation check if you do.
Sam: I'm going to take a look, but I'm going to pull out my Ioun stone and clutch it in my hand and close my eyes and pray on it for a second. Hope that guides me in some way.
Matt: Roll a religion check.
Sam: Religion check. Okay, well, that's terrible.
Travis: Luck!
Sam: I don't have Luck. I can inspire myself. I will inspire myself with a little song. (singing) Scanlancito, he's got tiny feet-oh, but he likes to cast spells, he does it with his beat-oh. When you go to sleep-oh, better check your sheet-ohs, because after he eats-ohs, he likes to take a shit-oh! (laughter)
Travis: Oh my god. Are you fucking kidding me? What the hell, man?
Liam: Get that book.
Matt: Yeah, You earned that d12.
Sam: That's a 12. So that brings it up to 21.
Matt: Okay. This is your investigation check to search about. Oh no, that's your religion check. All right. Clutching the Ioun stone, as you sing this song, the stone glows ever so faintly in your hand and you glance up and you can see about ten of the various spectral librarians that are wandering have stopped and they're all looking at you. Seemingly temporarily distracted or entranced by the song.
Laura: Let's go try to talk to one.
Sam: Okay. Whoa!
Matt: You land next to all the librarians and as soon as you land, there's like a moment of quiet and they all go about their business again.
Sam: On behalf of the Mistress Ioun, I speak in her name. And I'll hold up the stone.
Laura: It's always good to lie.
Sam: Well she tasked me; it's not a lie! She tasked me with this. We seek a book. We would love some help, and it contains the Incantation of Isolation. Maybe about 812 years old-ish. Maybe 813?
Matt: No one seems to be paying attention to your words.
Laura: Maybe sing it.
Taliesin: Maybe sing it.
Sam: I have to sing it?
Liam: Pull out Mythcarver.
Laura: Pull out Mythcarver and sing.
Sam: Oh, okay. I pull out a sword. (sword unsheathing)
Laura: Just sing like it's a microphone.
Sam: Okay. (singing) Just take a look, it's in a book, the Scanlan rainbow. I can read anything.
Matt: You watch as the same librarians all of a sudden stop what they're doing and turn back towards you. The sword is vibrating and ringing; it's expanding the notes of your song, as is the nature of Mythcarver. You seem to have their attention.
Laura: Now ask. Now sing and question.
Matt: It's been about 20 minutes, by the way.
Laura: Oh Jesus. I mean, Ioun.
Sam: (singing) I sing to you in desperation. I'm looking for a Tome of Isolation. We need to find a tome, so we can go home and kill a guy named Vecna. It would really make us... Nothing rhymes with Vecna.
Matt: Roll a performance check.
Sam: 29.
Matt: You watch as the librarians gather. They're up above you and they gather closely to you as you're singing this song and as you finish your final verse they all look a little confused, and they all begin to shift as one unit around the edge of one of the bookcases.
Marisha: Scanlan! (yells) Scanlan!
Sam: (yells) What?
Laura: We have an earring.
Marisha: Oh, right. Sorry.
Sam: It's a library; keep quiet.
Marisha: Your stories. It's your storytelling. Keep telling the story about the Calamity. Maybe if you talk about Vecna some more and what happened.
Sam: I don't know my history.
Matt: Roll a history check.
Darin: Tell him "heck, nah" rhymes with Vecna, if it helps at all.
Sam: 23.
Matt: Vecna didn't have too much involvement in the Calamity directly. The Calamity mainly involved the gods battling. It involved the Chained Oblivion. It involved the sealing of that deity during one of the major battles of the Calamity. Those are elements of the history that pertain to the Calamity that you recall.
Laura: We're following the little surge of spectrals.
Sam: Okay. I'm just going to keep talking, I guess. (rapping) The book we're looking for is fraught with insanity, It dates back to the time of Calamity. It's about a guy with oblivion chains. You know his name. (laughter)
Sam: (rapping) What's his name, yo? (speaking) I got nothing.
Laura: (singing) He's the Chained Oblivion. His name is the Chained Oblivion.
Travis: (singing) And there's a million things he hasn't done.
Matt: (singing) Because he's sealed.
Matt: (singing) Because he's sealed.
Laura: (singing) Because he's sealed.
Taliesin: (singing) Because he's sealed.
Marisha: (singing) Because he's sealed.
Travis: Oh fuck. Lin-Manuel just turned it off.
Matt: Okay. Sorry. All right, so as you continue to sing, with each beat, each name that's mentioned that deals with the Calamity and the Chained Oblivion, you watch as their pace seems to quicken a bit, and then as the singing slows they begin to slow down again. There's a specific correlation and drive between your storytelling and your singing, and apparently the drive in which they're pushing towards their--
Laura: Keep telling the story.
Darin: Tell them the song about Vecna just might wreck ya. It's close; it doesn't work.
Sam: Okay, Sprigg, I got it.
Matt: You hear Sprigg yelling from down below, as he doesn't have an earring.
Sam: (singing) If we don't act soon Vecna might just wreck ya. (speaking) I got it in there for you.
Darin: Thanks. Tell them about your neck, ma.
Sam: Oh yeah. Wait, what?
Darin: If you're discussing your neck to your mother, you would-- what? Oh, right. People get paid for that.
Sam: (whispers) Oh my god.
Darin: Call back to earlier discussion. And nobody knows.
Liam: (singing) God I hope I get it.
Sam: (singing) The book is eight centuries old, or so I'm told. It's fraught with mystery. It's teeming with history. So please listen to me and don't kiss me because I really need this book right now.
Matt: Roll another performance check.
Marisha: Yes. Come on.
Sam: No. 22.
Matt: 22. Okay. They continue to push at a brisk pace and you watch as other of the spectral librarians begin to gather into this group and is now a cluster of about 25 of them that are snaking around these bookcases and traveling at a pretty fair pace. Which once was walking pace, and then went to a jogging pace, they're now darting through. And they're leading you quickly away from the center of the library where everyone else seems to be clustered. So the two of you are following and swooshing behind them, you're going over and around bookcases. Some of the bookcases you see have giant holes in the center and you can dart through and dive past. The speed is increasing to the point where the wind is starting to kick up in your hair and you're amazed at the speed of these librarians and the fact that they're being driven by your very song, and also the fact that you have no idea how far away the rest of your friends are in this library, and this library seems to just go on and on and on. You continue forward for another ten minutes or so, so you've hit just over the 30-minute mark at this point, and you feel this little pulse from the stone. Do you continue to inspire?
Sam: I will do one more. I hope it works. I'll recite a poem. This little gnomey went to the heavens. This little gnomey wants to go home. This little gnomey is looking for a book. This little gnomey is trusting Ioun. This little gnomey wants to go wee-wee-wee-wee all the way to this tome. (cheering)
Matt: Roll a performance check with advantage.
Sam: Natural 20. (cheering)
Matt: Didn't even need it.
Marisha: Hashtag blessed.
Matt: So the speed is dangerous to the point where as trying to follow them you almost lose sight of them a couple of times. You being the driver of this, I need you to go ahead and make a perception check to make sure you can keep them in your vision.
Travis: Damn, Scanlan got bars, y'all.
Laura: 22.
Matt: 22. Okay. That's enough. You nearly lose them a few times and you're like (grunts). You have to take a second and listen out there and you see a faint glow of their spectral form in the distance. There! And so you continue to give chase. Then eventually, at about the 40-minute mark or so, you come to the outside. What's interesting, too, is a lot of these bookcases are made of different materials. Some of them are dark wood, light wood, some of them are metal and various substances. You come to, on the ceiling, jammed in, a bookcase, but it's made of a very dark slate gray metal. And it has chains across it and a series of locks on it.
Laura: (whispers) I had a feeling it would be a locked bookcase.
Matt: And you see them, all the librarians are clustered and circled around it right now.
Laura: (singing) Can they open it up?
Sam: Oh. (singing) Can you open it up?
Travis: Find somebody that can pick them locks.
Matt: There's no response from them.
Sam: Wait, they can pick books.
Matt: They can pick up books.
Laura: Vax, can you hear me?
Liam: I don't know. 500 feet.
Matt: You've been traveling for a while. He doesn't hear you.
Laura: I can try to pick it. I can try.
Marisha: Come on, multiclassing into that rogue now.
Matt: All right, so you fumble around and quickly pull out your thieves' tools. All right, go ahead and roll a d20, add your dexterity modifier and your proficiency bonus.
Laura: My proficiency bonus.
Sam: I'm going to inspire her.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: (singing) I'm so vain. I probably think this song is about me. I'm so vain.
Laura: Yeah, I got a one on your inspiration. Thanks for that. But I rolled well so it doesn't matter. Hopefully. 19 plus my dexterity modifier plus my proficiency bonus? 30.
Sam: Wow!
Liam: She rolled a 19.
Matt: The DC was 30.
Sam: It was the inspiration!
Laura: No, plus inspiration was 31!
Matt: Yeah, the DC on that was 30.
Laura: Oh, jeebies.
Sam: There are DCs up to 30?!
Matt: Yeah. 30's considered nearly impossible.
Marisha: We're badasses now.
Travis: What happens when you say that shit?!
Marisha: No, I'm just saying the difficulties are going to get harder.
Laura: Oh, in god realm it will be harder.
Matt: So as you work your way down the chain, you get through a few of them, and there's one big lock in the center that's bolted into a big double doorway, or hinged opening to this bookcase. This one takes you a few moments to get into. (clicking) It snaps your lockpick. As soon as you hear the (tink), your heart sinks, but you still have a little bit of leverage and you push forward on the broken pick, and it's just enough to get the tumbler to click in. Your lockpick is busted; you're going to have to get a new one. However, it does open on one side.
Laura: That's the hardest lock I've ever picked, I swear!
Matt: You open, and you can see about 25 different books of different shapes, sizes, colors, all ancient that are all in this small locked section.
Laura: Are any of the spectrals looking at one, specifically?
Matt: No, they are all just at the side.
Laura: Can you do your Ioun Stone?
Sam: Sure, I'll blacklight it.
Laura: Does it glow for anything in particular?
Matt: You take your Ioun Stone, and as you go across, it doesn't seem to have an effect.
Sam: I'm going to quickly scan the books to see if any of them look particularly old.
Laura: Can I read any of them?
Matt: What languages do you know?
Laura: Elvish, Common, Undercommon, Abyssal, and Draconic.
Matt: And you?
Sam: Not much! Gnome, Marquesian, and Common.
Matt: There are about ten of them you cannot read. There is one book that has nothing on the spine; it's blank. About five of them appear to be in Abyssal. You, reading through them, a lot of them talk about-- they are history books that talk about the Lord of the Hells. There's one that speaks on rites and rituals of sacrifice. There is one that talks about the annihilation of a race that no longers exists in the world during the Age of Arcanum. There's one that talks about the birth of the Rune Children. There's all these books that all talk about different things, but nothing seems to stand out to you as the tome you might be looking for.
Laura: Well, I could potentially grab all of them and shove them in the Bag of Colding.
Sam: And then what? How many minutes are left, and how far are we from our friends?
Matt: You have about 15 minutes left and it's about ten minutes of travel.
Sam: We could take them all back and see if anyone can read.
Laura: It seems pretty shitty, dumping them out in a pile, but I don't know what else to do.
Travis: Yeah. The spirits'll put them back.
Sam: The one that has nothing on the binding. Can I open that and flip through real quick?
Laura: I start grabbing other ones and putting them in the bag.
Matt: You pull out the one with nothing on it. It's a very thin book; it's only about that wide or so, it's a dark gray leather. It looks damaged. Part of it's burnt and scarred on the outside. There's no words on the cover. You open it up and it's about four pages that are blank.
Sam: This is the thing.
Laura: What can you do? Do you have a spell that lets you see things? Reveals things?
Sam: I do not.
Travis: Talk to it.
Sam: Okay, sure.
Laura: Yeah! Sing to it or something!
Sam: Sure. I'll sing to a book, Matt. (singing) Read to me of times gone by. Can it be you're here when a bunch of gods died? (speaking) Okay. That's all I got.
Matt: Doesn't seem to have any effect. Doesn't seem to respond to the singing.
Sam: Don't tell anyone I sang to a book.
Laura: You just keep singing, I'll keep taking books. We've got not enough time.
Matt: It takes you about a minute to throw them all in there haphazardly.
Travis: 25 books.
Laura: 25 books.
Sam: Let's get back.
Matt: You guys dart back. You get low enough to the point where you're in between the two bookcaess. The heights vary and in some case you're having to suddenly shift up and over to avoid slamming into the side of the large bookcase. You're shooting through this-- almost like an up and down version of the Star Wars entry to the... Death Star. Thank you, my brain's not working.
Laura: My Locate Object never pinged? My Incantation of Isolation Locate Object?
Matt: Interestingly enough, thank you for reminding me of that. As soon as he pulled the book out, the one that he's holding, the one with no text on it, it pinged.
Laura: Oh shit, I just grabbed a bunch of books, but that's the one!
Sam: Are you sure?
Laura: It's got to be! Keep looking at it while we're flying, see if you can figure it out!
Sam: Hold it upside down.
Laura: Hold onto me, though, because we're going fast.
Sam: I'm going to listen to it.
Matt: Okay. Make an arcana check.
Sam: 13 plus five, 18.
Matt: 18. As you're darting by, you're clutching your side with your hand around her waist, reading it. You almost lose it a couple times.
Sam: Plus Jack of All Trades.
Matt: So what's the total?
Sam: 21.
Matt: 21. You get the sense that there is something magical about it. I would say, you can't put your finger on it, but what faint arcane essence that you can sense from your usage of spells, and the feeling of releasing spells, the charging and release of arcane energy. You get the sense of that release from the book. It's almost wanting something. It's pulling something very faintly.
Sam: What spell? I don't want to hurt it!
Laura: Place Mythcarver on it! Place Mythcarver in it!
Sam: Okay. I'll place Mythcarver on it. I don't know what to cast on a book!
Matt: Make a dexterity saving throw.
Sam: I'll cast Friends on it.
Laura: That was almost so bad.
Matt: You cast Friends on it?
Sam: Sure.
Matt: Okay, as you release the cantrip, the book seems to absorb the magic, but no reaction.
Laura: 28.
Matt: 28. As you dart around the corner, one of the shifting bookcases comes right in front of you, and you just dart out of the way in time. Scanlan, you barely hold on. I need you to roll a strength check.
Laura: Oh god, can I hold onto his wrist to help out?
Sam: Not good. Strength?
Matt: This would be a strength saving throw, yeah.
Sam: Ten.
Matt: Ten? The book's like (bouncing) and you catch it right as it falls and you hold it in your hand.
Travis: What if you write in it?
Laura: Yeah, what if you write in it and say, "Hey, I need the Incantation of Isolation!"
Sam: Write in the book?
Travis: Didn't you ever watch Harry Potter? He wrote in the book and it wrote back!
Sam: No! I've never watched Harry Potter!
Taliesin: Who are you?!
Travis: Do you have a quill? Can you write it in? Can you write something in the book?
Sam: I must have a quill, right? I'm a storyteller.
Matt: You'd have to pull it out of your pouch, yeah.
Sam: Okay, I'll pull out my quill.
Matt: And your inkwell?
Sam: Jesus. While we're flying? This seems like a bad idea. This is a bad idea.
Matt: Do you want to try it?
Sam: No! How about when we land?
Laura: Did you cast Friends on it? Did it work?
Sam: No. It absorbed the spell and seemed to like it, but nothing happened.
Travis: What else can you do to imbue it with magic?
Sam: I have the Ioun Stone, but it doesn't do anything.
Matt: As you're rushing, make another dexterity saving throw.
Laura: Jesus. Oh god. Okay. 27.
Matt: (whoosh) You yank out of the way of another one that shifts. It's one that goes from ceiling to floor, it's one solid bookcase that comes right in the way. You manage to dart around the side. Make another strength saving throw to hold onto the book.
Sam: Oh, that's 17.
Matt: 17, okay. The book you hold onto with one hand, and you pull it back--
Sam: I'll try to cast a more powerful spell into it without hurting it, though, that's the thing. If I do Lightning, what if it burns the fucking book? I'll do Thunderwave on it, right?
Matt: Thunderwave, the 1st-level spell?
Laura: Don't you have Suggestion?
Sam: Yeah. I'll Dominate Monster, that's a super high-level spell.
Matt: What level spell is that?
Sam: Eight.
Matt: 8th-level spell, Dominate Monster on the book? Okay! As you're flying through, you cast the spell into the book and the book takes the entirety of the spell into it, and you watch as suddenly text emboldens across all the pages on the inside. The book is now filled with scribblings and writing.
Laura: What language is it?!
Sam: I don't know, what language is it?!
Matt: It appears to be Common to you. (yelling)
Sam: It's a notebook! It's somebody who was figuring this out as they were writing it!
Matt: You glance over your shoulder, and it's empty.
Laura: Are you sure something's there?
Sam: Yes, I have a beautiful mind! (laughter)
Matt: With that, you arc down into the center of the library where you see the large dome where you first met Ioun. You're not sure how much time you have left, but it's down to the wire.
Sam: Do I see any words that say isolation or incantation or anything?
Laura: It's a small book.
Sam: I like to read things and really understand.
Matt: The script on the cover seems, in a weird way, the best I could say is a Google Translate version, but it loosely translates to the Tome of Isolation, yes.
Laura: It's the whole thing!
Sam: It's a cookbook.
Travis: She just asked for the tome, right? You got it.
Laura: Yeah!
Sam: Yeah!
Marisha: Alone  I am Tome.
Travis: She disappeared. Where is she?
Laura: She's going to reappear, obviously. She knows we're here.
Sam: Let's go down to her bowl.
Laura: Yeah, we're at the bowl.
Sam: All right, so let's go down into the bowl and wait for her to arrive.
Matt: You guys land in the center there. What's everybody else doing right now?
Liam: I barrel rolled out of the way as they rushed by.
Taliesin: I was sitting on the couch.
Travis: I've been digging through the pillows.
Laura: Looking for change in the couch?
Darin: Did you know that "Heck, nah" could rhyme with Vecna? Did you hear what I said?
Sam: I heard when you yelled it. It was the "Neck, Ma," that I couldn't come up with a way--
Darin: If you're speaking to your mother, let's say, and pointing at your neck.
Laura: You're such a pain in the neck, Ma!
Darin: Exactly! Pain in the neck, Ma! Looking for Vecna, he's a pain in the neck, Ma! Find him? I say heck nah!
Sam: I wish you would have been chosen by Ioun.
Matt: As soon as that happens, the wind picks up, and for a moment you close your eyes from the sudden burst of air into your face. As you reopen and adjust, there in the center of the dome where she was before, you see the Knowing Mistress. There, resting her arms crossed in front of her robes. She looks out. "Are you to present your findings?"
Sam: I casually blow the hair out of my face and walk over to her and say, O mighty goddess, it was a challenging challenge, but I think you'll be pretty happy with the results. As I hold up the book, I'll cast Wrist Pocket and make it disappear. Oh god, oh it's gone! Just kidding. And it's back.
Matt: She doesn't flinch.
Sam: This is what we've found for you. I hope it pleases you.
Matt: "And this is your final choice?"
Sam: You know, we didn't actually look at the other ten books.
Travis: Regis Philbin.
Liam: Is that your final answer?
Sam: Yes. With conviction, I firmly believe that this is the correct book.
Matt: "Very well." She takes it and looks at it. "It has been a while since I thumbed through these pages myself. This will do you well in the coming fray." And she hands it out to you.
Sam: Can I still see the writing?
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: I'll cherish it always.
Matt: "You, who have wandered the vast library that surrounds you through your knowledge, through your magnetic telling and spinning of yarns, through your knowledge of history, perseverance, and apparently decent grip, have managed to return to me and complete the challenge I set before you. And for that, I grant my grace unto you for the coming fray, Scanlan Shorthalt." And it's a little off-putting at first, but in her forehead, where you saw her two purple eyes, a third eye opens up in the center of the forehead. It seems to glow for a second. You watch as on Scanlan, this warmth fills your body; you stand up straight instinctually. You guys watch as this strange purple glow appears in the center of his forehead in the same place where her eye was.
Laura: Ugh, you have a third eye!
Sam: Is it cool or is it gross?
Travis: It's cool.
Liam: It's cool.
Sam: Chicks will dig?
Travis: Yep! Third nip, third eye. You're good.
Matt: It gently fades away. The warmth vanishes and you're restored to yourself. That given the case, you have the Tome of Isolation and the Blessing of the Knowing Mistress.
Liam: You chose wisely.
Sam: Okay, I gain plus two to my intelligence! Whoa!
Marisha: All the timesies?!
Sam: As a bonus action, I can channel the omniscience of Ioun. For one hour, whenever you successfully hit a creature with a spell or attack, you can learn one of the creature's stats of your choice from the following list: AC, senses, saving throw bonuses, damage resistances, damage immunities, damage vulnerabilities. During this hour, you also have advantage on initiative rolls and on saving throws. Once this ability is used, it cannot be used again for a week. Okay!
Marisha: How many things can you learn about?
Sam: Just one.
Laura: We can learn what its vulnerabilities are.
Liam: That's like a game mod for a character.
Travis: It's the gold thing that came with the original Nintendo Entertainment System. The Game Genie.
Liam: I certainly remembered my Charlemagne! Let my armies be the--
Liam: -- rocks and the trees and birds in the sky.
Taliesin: -- rocks and the trees and birds in the sky.
Sam: The tome  As an action, I can expend a spell slot of any level higher than three, thank you Travis. The cover and the pages glow of secret text of the Rites of Prime Banishment. While legible, you can spend an action to invoke the Rites of Banishment against the target. The target must make a wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target is banished and sealed and this book is immediately teleported to the Endless Atheneeum. On a success, the text becomes blurred until the end of your next turn.
Laura: On a success?
Sam: On a success. On a failure of their saving throw. Right, yeah?
Matt: If they succeed on their saving throw, they resist the ability and you cannot read the book for another turn.
Sam: Got it. Then, after that turn, I can read it again?
Laura: What does it say the DC is?
Sam: DC ten. A wisdom saving throw-- oh! That's key info. Plus five to DC for each Divine Trammel fused to the target. We've got to be matadors and attach a bunch of pegs to the thing before we deliver the killing blow.
Laura: We literally stick the trammels onto Vecna?
Sam: We'll be picadors, right? They put the darts on the back of the bull to soften it up and (whoosh) killing blow!
Marisha: And do we have any of these yet?
Laura: I have one! No, I have a stone.
Matt: You have a stone that supposedly has something to do with their construction.
Marisha: But we were supposed to ask Ioun.
Laura: Yeah, I'm going to.
Sam: No, I think we're done here, guys.
Liam: We'll just go to Home Depot and get some trammels.
Laura: Can I pull out the little pearl of power?
Matt: All right. You pull it out and there it glows before you. It's bright like a tiny star for a second and you have to avert your gaze. But there it is, still warm to the touch. The small pearl of bright, divine light. "With this blessing, I hope to be of some aid in the coming battle. Also, any questions you may have, I'm here to answer."
Sam: Yes, so many!
Laura: How do we make a trammel? We have a stone, and we want more, I assume.
Matt: "The Prime Trammel you speak of, the companion to this rite of which you've sought out and recovered, the construct is small, but complex. The design is unknowable for most mortal eyes. Each trammel requires a fragment of divinity. You have one there. That fragment is lost until the seal is broken, so it is a very exhausting process for a deity to give this fragment. Now, the original trammels that we had utilized were forged by the hand of the Allhammer atop the fiery Core Anvil deep beneath the Ozmit Sea."
Marisha: Wait, the core?
Matt: "The Core Anvil."
Laura: In the Ozmit Sea.
Matt: "To seal a god, the number of trammels you will require depends on how marred the god may be. You have an easier chance of applying the trammels the more wounded the entity is. It is imperfect, and it's only been given use the once against the Chained Oblivion. With the Luck Bringer's blessing, we succeeded against the entity. It took us four trammels and the full might of Pelor upon the beast to banish it beyond the veil. However, the Chained Oblivion's power was fully realized at this time. Now, the Core Anvil, this was part of the domain of the Allhammer's greatest creations. It was where the first dwarves were given form and breath, it's where the trammels were carved and made in the last great war. It lies beneath the undersea volcano now known as Scaldseat."
Laura: Scaldseat?
Matt: "Scaldseat. It sits at the bottom of the ocean off the eastern coast of Issylra, not far from the fishing village known as Shorecomb." At which point, the third eye flashes in the direction of Keyleth. Keyleth, a vision fills your mind suddenly of the shoreline over Issylra. The cold, cloud-covered sky, but you see below grass and recent rainfall-covered fields that lead to a somewhat marshy and mud-covered shoreline. There, you see a small fishing village leading out to a rocky beachfront and waves that crest and break against a drop-off into the ocean. You can see some low-built docks that lead all the fishermen in and out into the ocean. The vision pulls you back miles away from that. You get a sense, as you see this small column of black smoke that emerges from the ocean across endless open sea, that is the signal of where this volcano lies. The vision fades from you. She leans to you and says, "Find a way below, through the tunnels of toxic fume, unbreathable without proper preparation, to the Core Anvil and forge these trammels. Be warned: There may be protections that still remain within the forgotten halls of the Allhammer, or new denizens that occupy the subterranean depths. Now, to forge such a trammel, however, is an undertaking no mortal has attempted. To shape the materials would require the strength of a titan." She looks towards you and the eye flashes and suddenly your mind fills with hundreds of years of the knowledge of folding heated metals, of the clinks of lives past, shaping and building weapons and armor and for a second you pull back and you can see the large dwarf-like stone form of the Allhammer, slamming down onto the heated metals of the Core Anvil. As the vision fades, you know how to forge, so you are now proficient with blacksmithing tools.
Travis: Proficient with blacksmithing tools?
Laura: Awesome! Oh my god, you were a boot maker, and now you're a weapon maker!
Matt: Suddenly, you understand most of the tools in Percy's workshop.
Travis: That water's not so evil, after all! (laughter)
Travis: Wait a minute!
Matt: "But not just the strength of a titan. For to understand the intricacies of this design will also require the ingenuity of a madman." She turns towards you, Percy.
Travis: Don't look at somebody else, motherfucker. That's you!
Marisha: Trying to look away, kid at the back of the classroom.
Liam: Percy takes one step behind Keyleth.
Travis: It's like the kid that farts in class and then looks at the guy behind him.
Matt: The third eye opens once more and flashes. You see the purple glow in the center of Percival's forehead for a moment. In an instant, the intricate designs of the Prime Trammel flood into your mind, the celestial instructions racing through like a shock of electricity, the blueprints spinning like a clear dream, straight out of Flight of the Navigator, all of the star charts being crammed at once. With that, it drops from your mind and you fall to your knees with a pounding headache.
Taliesin: I'm not supposed to know that. (groans)
Matt: "And you will only know it for as long as it's required." She thinks for a second. "We, the creators, did breathe the beauty into this world, we planted the seeds that would blossom into this incredible weave of Exandria. However, what is the purpose of the parent but to teach what they can, then set the children free? Some gods rule through fear, others through love, and others still through perceived fate. Destiny has its place, but the real deception is that you have no choice. A path can be groomed before you, but it is you who must take those steps. Not every rosy walkway leads to a better day. For me, our greatest purpose has passed the moment we granted your forbearers the spark to seek their own purpose. We now stay to inspire, to guide, to guard the Gate, to keep the hate of ignorance we spawned in our hubris from burning away everything. The rest is up to you. We need you, perhaps, but you do not need us. That is our gift. You, Fate-Touched, you are the embodiment of this truth. All mortal life has potential with or without the gods. We offer some paths, but it's up to you to decide if they are the right ones for you. Anyway." And she clutches her stomach a moment. "What more do you ask of me? What more do you wish to know?"
Liam: I have questions.
Matt: "Yes, ask."
Liam: Vecna. You're familiar. You know not where he is. You know of him.
Matt: "I know as much of his history as I was allowed to see, yes. Vecna was a force of insurmountable intellect among mortals, and his creative bending of known arcane theory enabled many of the powerful artifacts of war that stoked the flames of the Calamity a century later. His contributions were appreciated, but overlooked by those around him. In his hubris, he sought to carve history in his image. He sought forgotten magics and slew those who shared this same knowledge to leave only him standing with it. He bypassed his own mortality through terrible necromantic rites to lichdom, amassing a force of like-minded followers and hordes of undead terrors, then vanished into the Shadowfell to overtake the dark city of Thar Amphala, where he erected the terrible tower Entropis. From this very seat of power, Vecna harnessed an event called the Celestial Solstice. He used this merging of ley energies and power to reforge manses of energy all across Exandria to suit his needs, opening the portals at his whim within his city to anywhere across the world, allowing his armies to lay siege to anything before him and extend his influence and rule. His horde assaulted a couple of prominent townships, slaughtering denizens and forcing old enemies to kneel, before slaying and raising them as his own. One such rival was named Kas, who, upon their defeat, was offered eternal life through vampirism in exchange for swearing fealty to Vecna as his chief lieutenant. This made Kas into Kas the Bloody-Handed. Vecna forged a relic blade for him with a fraction of his consciousness and gifted it to his new lieutenant, and with this, the lich lord had become a new terror among the rising tensions of the bickering nations. Months of turmoil followed as the shadow of Vecna's unstoppable forces struck with precision and those fled before retaliation. However, the use of the Solstice was discovered and reverse-engineered, allowing the holy army the Beacon of Arms to storm his city under the banner of the Dawnfather, led by the champion Yos Varder. Climbing Entropis to face the lich lord in combat, Yos Varder was struck down by the Undying King with a mortal blow. In the final moments of the hero's life, he witnessed the lieutenant Kas turn on his winded master and strike him with the very blade he was gifted, driven to usurp him, to become his own, new lord. The ensuing conflict left Kas nothing but ash, and utterly destroyed Vecna's body, leaving nothing but his left eye and hand. Yos passed on to the realm of Pelor, due to his wounds, and the survivors left the Shadowfell with tales of victory. The terrible artifacts: the eye, the hand, the sword, were never recovered. The sword is bent on vengeance, on hatred for the Whispered One. A powerful evil drives that sword, but for a just end. Should one be able to find and tame such a thing, it may be of great use. That is all I have to offer on the history of Vecna and I hope it can be of aid to you in your coming battle."
Taliesin: What was the name of the sword?
Matt: "The Sword of Kas."
Marisha: The Sword of Kas. Okay.
Laura: Did it have a name?
Taliesin: Where was it last seen?
Matt: In Thar Amphala, at the scene of the battle.
Marisha: Oh! Okay. The Sword of Kas.
Laura: You don't think?
Sam: I don't think. What are the odds, right?
Travis: It was 800 years ago.
Marisha: Different sword.
Sam: Different sword.
Travis: Not Craven Edge?
Liam: I have another question for you.
Matt: "Yes?"
Liam: You know who I serve.
Matt: "I do. I see the shadows that cling to you."
Liam: Vecna seeks godhood, and we understand that my lady achieved the same. Did you learn anything from her path that would help us here?
Matt: (sighs) You watch as suddenly her expression changes. Her mouth falls open ever so gently and her hair, wavy and calm, seems to curl in but a moment and lift. Her expression falls to one of trepidation and horror. "And then there was one more. The ritual is complete. I can sense his ascension. The cosmos expand to make room. Our timetable accelerates." You can see now, her eyes begin to race back and forth. "It will take him some time to understand and utilize his nature fully. If he expands beyond his avatar, it will be more difficult to seal him. The more trammels it may require and the loss maybe far greater."
Laura: Do you have a seed of power?
Matt: "Understand," and she leans forward to you. "I am not Ioun given full form, but a partial avatar of my essence given shape by the worship of my children, as was the Dawnfather that guided you here. Our realms are our bodies, and our true presence held in the hearts of those that grant us their faith. To hold purely as an avatar like this is dangerous, for while it focuses and grants us much present power, as we were forced to do in the Calamity, in the last great war, it may also leave us open to grievous injury." She opens her robe, and there you can see amongst the olive-gold skin, you see a large darkened gash that still festers, unhealed to this day, of black, curling void. As you look at this open wound, you feel yourself drawn toward it; your vision begins to be pulled towards this infinite nothing. She closes it. You can see a bit of sweat dripping from the brow. "The cost was great, but necessary. Vecna's ascended being is fresh. He will need to expand his worship vastly to learn how to disseminate his power and claim his domains. What he will need for this to happen is a display of unstoppable power, a miracle of terror, a wave of despair that would occupy the hearts of many in but a moment. I know not his method, but I know enough of his ways to assume there's already a plan in motion and has been for some time. If you can strike before he claims his full ascension, before he can seize his dominion on this plane, than you may still have a chance." She turns to you, Scanlan. "You are the teller of tales, one who enlivens the world through song and word. Take this fragment of my own story and help craft the passages of the world's future." She reaches into the center of her robe, and almost seems to be into her chest and plucks forth a small, gray gem about the size of a peanut. It glows faintly, and as she removes it, you hear a terrible creaking sound throughout the library. You watch as books plummet from the darkness above and slam into the ground around you. Distant cases crack and bow. The roar of the damaged space echoes to a halt, the danger seemingly in control. "There. I can spare no more. I must rest and concentrate."
Darin: I have something of you inside of me. Would it help you?
Matt: She smiles. "I could use a steward for a moment. Someone eager to learn and relearn some important lessons. Ethred Brokenbranch."
Darin: That's me!
Matt: "Would you be so kind as to help an old woman tend to her books a bit?"
Darin: It would be my pleasure. I didn't believe in you. I didn't think you were real, but I found out that things aren't what we seem. And things can change. It would be my honor. (stammers) Could I say goodbye?
Matt: "Of course."
Darin: Also, do you know where there's an imp by the name of Demistrik and if he's all right?
Matt: "He's fine for now."
Darin: I'm not asking for me. The nice lady with the antlers wanted to know.
Matt: "He's fine, but woe to those who live in the home in Kraghammer where he's currently rooted."
Darin: He's a very bad performer. I'll be right with you.
Matt: "Of course."
Darin: Well, then. This is different! I don't think I'm going to be alone anymore. I asked you for power, but it seems like you gave me strength.
Travis: Oh. I'm glad to hear that.
Darin: Thank you. And you. You called me darling. No one ever did that before. (growl)
Laura: (tongue click) I kiss him on the forehead.
Darin: Well! Oh dear me. Oh goodness gracious. Be happy. Life is loud and noisy, and it's a celebration. I didn't know that. So once in a while, with what little time we have, be happy. I was wrong about you, you know.
Sam: Me?
Darin: Oh, you're far greater than I will ever be. If only I could be a mirror of you.
Sam: Thank you, Sprigg, for everything. We've only known you a short time--
Darin: I'm only a short person. (laughs) You can have that one for free. Okay, good. Go on.
Sam: No, you've taught us much in a short time, and I'm sorry that we broke your house, but it seems like you've found a suitable replacement.
Darin: Well, a lot of books in here. That's going to keep me busy. And you (groans) secrets. Celebrate it with your friends. Remember that. And when I look at these books, I'm going to think of you.
Taliesin: That pleases me.
Darin: Oh, good.
Taliesin: Be happy here.
Darin: (laughs) I think you're going to be the hardest to say goodbye to, because you cared. No one ever cared before. That's why they called me Sprigg. I wasn't good enough to be a Brokenbranch. I was just a sprig. That's how I got my name.
Marisha: If only people knew that sprigs give foundation to the entire tree.
Darin: Thank you.
Matt: She extends her hand to you.
Darin: Well, this is new.
Matt: "And should your friends succeed, there is far much more to look forward to learning."
Darin: Excellent. But some of those little wispy things, I don't trust them, you know. If they get out of order, we should wispy thing grab. How will we remember that?
Matt: "This is going to be a very good conversation to have."
Darin: We need a mnemonic device. Come! We'll think of one.
Matt: "Very well. We shall. As for the rest of you, I feel my power is waned, and I don't have the means of sending you away myself. But if you are able to return under your own power?"
Marisha: (whispers) Of course.
Matt: "Then I wish you all the greatest of luck. And please, don't be a stranger."
Laura: Oh! I have your books.
Sam: Oh, yes. 24 of them.
Laura: I think they were really secret ones, so I would hate to take those out of here.
Matt: You watch as three spectral servants apparate behind you and pick up the books and begin to take them back to be organized. "Not to worry. Travel safe, my friends. And Scanlan, don't ever forget how important you are to them, to Kaylie, and to yourself. You owe yourself far more that you lend."
Sam: I will remember.
Darin: Goodbye.
Travis: Bye, Sprigg.
Laura: Take care, darling.
Marisha: Bye, Sprigg.
Sam: Until next time.
Darin: That's good. Off we go, then.
Matt: "Come, my friend." She takes his hand and stands up, and they both begin to walk away and as it does there's a slight increase of light in the room. There's a flash, and then as it slowly comes back to a normal sight, you find yourself back at the entrance almost bathhouse-like area of the domain where you arrived, the marble slightly more cracked that you left it before, but still standing.
Liam: Enjoy the other side, Sprigg.
Laura: I go up to Percy. Are you all right, dear?
Taliesin: Strangely, yes. Yes, quite. Didn't think I would be.
Marisha: Vax. Is that what's going to happen when you leave?
Liam: (whispers) I don't know.
Marisha: Okay. Shall we?
Laura: Where are we going?
Taliesin: Back to where we came from.
Travis: In the beginning? Or more recently?
Taliesin: Back to the cabin.
Sam: The cabin?
Taliesin: The little house.
Sam: You mean Sprigg's cabin? Why would we go there?
Taliesin: Because we still have a man tied up. He's been sitting there for probably about an hour or two.
Sam: Who?
Travis: Oh yeah, the guy that you put in the shackles.
Sam: I'm sure he's fine. Let's just go to Whitestone.
Travis: But we want to get the shackles back.
Sam: Oh, it's the shackles.
Taliesin: Well, I want to talk to him, too, but yes.
Sam: We're going for the shackles.
Laura: They're pretty cool.
Taliesin: They are pretty impressive.
Sam: But she said the timetable is shortened.
Taliesin: Why are we going to Whitestone, then?
Sam: We have to find this place in the middle of the ocean.
Taliesin: Well, now that we know where it is, you can probably bamf us there, can't you?
Liam: I need to go Whitestone or to Vasselheim.
Marisha: Before we go to Issylra? Wait. Is Vasselheim on Issylra? How close did I recognize the shore--
Matt: Shorecomb? Shorecomb is about 200, 250 miles away from Vasselheim, to the southwest.
Marisha: Southwest, going towards Pyrah. Okay.
Matt: Beyond Pyrah, along the coast.
Marisha: Start there. I should be able to Tree Stride us right there. Right?
Laura: From the cabin to Vasselheim?
Marisha: I think so.
Matt: None of the particular trees you got a close look at. You may have to scry to get a specific tree in mind for the spell, but you can do that.
Laura: Pike, you seem very quiet.
Matt: Pike goes, "I'm sorry, I'm just overwhelmed. There's a lot going on."
Travis: I know when I feel overwhelmed I like to punch things. You want to hit me?
Matt: "Okay." (punching noise) And she socks you in the gut.
Travis: (groans) Too strong. Oh, such a monster.
Matt: "Sorry." And she Cures Wounds on you.
Travis: Thank you.
Marisha: I burn my 8th-level spell to Plane Shift us back to Sprigg's house.
Matt: All right. As you all gather hands together, with the familiar flash and a pull through the Divine Gate, you all find yourselves thrust once more back to the Prime Material Plane. As your feet land squarely in the partially charred, wooded remains of Sprigg's house, deep in a ravine in the Cliffkeep Mountains of Tal'Dorei in Exandria. And that's where we're going to take a break.
Sam: Wow.
Travis: Fudge knuckles.
Matt: Darin. Thank you so much for joining us.
Travis: Darin De Paul! (applause)
Matt: Dude. Thank you for coming.
Darin: It had to happen. It's history. It's a journey.
Marisha: 35 years?
Darin: 37.
Matt: It's crazy. I love it.
Darin: And who knows? Maybe something will happen. Yeah, in another 37 years! We'll do this again!
Matt: There you go. Hopefully sooner, but yeah.
Darin: Thank you guys.
Sam: It was a pleasure. We know you just came on this show so you could get onto Talks. But we'll take it anyway.
Marisha: Yeah, you could have just asked if you wanted to meet Brian Foster.
Darin: His hair is so cool.
Laura: He's got a good beard.
Matt: All right, guys, so before we go, we'll have a giveaway during the break in which we're giving out this awesome-- oh god, this awesome pieces of pieces. This is the purpleheart dice tower from Wyrmwood. The same color that you use to assemble your awesome magnetic dice tower from Wyrmwood. What was the word we chose?
Offscreen: Knowledge.
Matt: Thank you. Knowledge. The word in the chat room is knowledge.
Marisha: I thought you said college.
Sam: I did, too.
Matt: Yeah. Go to college, kids. But yeah, so go over to the Twitch chat, and when prompted, go ahead and enter the word knowledge to enter the giveaway. And we'll have the announcement of who won that when we come back from the break. See you guys in a few minutes. [break]
Matt: And welcome back, everybody. Couple of things. First off, couple of mid-show announcements we forgot to mention. One, Laura did Signal Boost, which you just saw! (cheering)
Matt: It's a good one. Second, if you haven't seen it already, we announced at Comic-Con that we are doing a Critical Role comic book. (excited noises)
Matt: We're super excited. It's written by good friend of the show Matt Colville. If you're not familiar with his stuff, you should. He's written a couple of books, he's written a lot of video game stuff and he's very talented.
Liam: The dialogue is to die for.
Marisha: He is on this week's episode of GM Tips.
Taliesin: You can check him out, right there.
Matt: He has a great YouTube channel. He's a good friend of the show and his writing is amazing. And our artist, Olivia Samson, who is a Critter artist in the community for quite some time. We wanted to pull somebody from the community to bring the story to life of how Vox Machina came together, how they met. And then, if it goes well, continue to do the story of all the pre-stream adventures that you guys didn't get a chance to see. That's the goal, we'll see, long-term. We're happy to announce it. We'll have more information in the future about it as it comes out.
Liam: I've seen most of the art for issue one and it is fucking legit!
Laura: I haven't seen it!
Liam: Oh, well.
Sam: If I may, Matt? Music level, split the difference.
Travis: And to EmeraldStar in the chat, who named their puppy Grog, that's awesome.
Matt: That is awesome. Congrats on your puppy! There is a winner. Well, the puppy named Grog. And the winner of the giveaway is FluffyArsonist. FluffyArsonist, congratulations, Danoba will contact you to get your information and get that shipped out to you.
Travis: Hard to be mad at an arsonist when they're fluffy.
Matt: It's hard. All righty, so. Diving back in. You guys were returning to Whitestone? Where were you going?
Marisha: Sprigg's.
Matt: Oh, Sprigg's cabin, correct. As the surge of momentum comes to a halt and your feet once again touch the ground here within the somewhat-charred remains of Sprigg's cabin, you look about. The crickets have taken the surrounding forest. Night has fallen since your exit. What would you like to do?
Travis: Are there any threatening creatures in the vicinity?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Laura: Can I look, too, because we'd been fighting when we left, so I'm going to make sure--
Travis: Don't worry, it's a 14.
Matt: You glance about very quickly at the surrounding woods and trees, and aside from a squirrel that scatters upon the sound of your footfalls--
Laura: Careful of traps. They're still in place.
Travis: Yeah, the squirrel goes (running noise, explosion).
Laura: Bear trap.
Liam: Slams two feet above it, though.
Taliesin: I'm going to go into the room and find the nice creature that we left there.
Matt: As you walk amongst the rubble, you see there, trapped within the iron cage-like manacles and bindings of the small iron ball, you see the slathering tongue of the undead entity that you had entrapped. (slobbering noises)
Taliesin: Oh, I don't suppose we need you any more, do we? I'm going to take out my sword and very slowly end that.
Matt: (pained noises) You see it squeal out as you slowly saw your way into its body until it lies still once more, robbing it of its second death.
Taliesin: Manners!
Matt: The ball retracts.
Laura: While he was doing that, I want to stealth away with my brother for a moment and say, I'm sorry. About everything.
Liam: How far away did you just pull me?
Laura: Far enough that nobody can hear us.
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Laura: Jesus Christ. Ten. God damn it.
Matt: As you pull him off, you get three steps from the building before (crash) a heavy, iron bear trap snaps onto your leg.
Travis: Outstanding!
Laura: Thank you. Thank you, Matt.
Sam: We're basically gods. (laughter)
Travis: The words were uttered.
Matt: 11 points of piercing damage and you are currently grappled.
Laura: I deserved that. That's karma.
Liam: Let's get it off your foot. I'll help her pull it off.
Matt: Okay. Between the two of you, it takes you a moment, but you manage to peel it off. The wounds aren't too bad.
Liam: I cast Lay on Hands. You're back to normal. You're fine. Your boot's ripped up. All right, watch your step. Come on. Past it all.
Laura: Oh, okay.
Liam: Yeah.
Laura: I'm going to not move, though, because I don't want to step on another one of those fucking things.
Marisha: While Keyleth chuckles about that a little bit, I'm going to look around and find a little piece to remember Sprigg by from his house to take with me.
Taliesin: I'm going to check through the books to see if there's anything.
Marisha: And then I'll help him check the books once I've grabbed something.
Matt: Make an investigation check, each of you.
Taliesin: 22.
Marisha: Yours is much better than mine. Five.
Matt: Five. You find some elements of partially charred pipes, some small statues that were destroyed in the recent battle. You find some unkept plants that were plotted and then left to dry out. There are many things here that you could take if you wanted to have memory of him.
Marisha: Does this rusty bolt represent Sprigg?
Taliesin: No. I think that may have actually come with us, that might have been us.
Marisha: I'll regrow this plant later.
Matt: There you go.
Marisha: Sprigg.
Matt: While you search through books, you pull Vax off to the side.
Liam: Can I ask you a question?
Laura: Yes.
Liam: First, I'm very happy for you. Congratulations!
Laura: Thank you.
Liam: I've seen it coming for a long time.
Laura: I didn't.
Liam: Well, you're smart in a lot of other ways. I'm so happy; he makes you so happy, and when I go, you're in good hands. And he's in good hands. He's getting the better end of the bargain.
Laura: Yeah, I think so, too. I didn't plan it. If I had, I would have told you. And then when I saw you, it seemed like bad timing to say anything, and then things kept happening. (sighs)
Liam: Well, Stubby, I spent so many years standing at your side. I guess I thought on that day, I'd be standing at your side.
Laura: I know. It was very spur-of-the-moment. Nobody was standing at our side, except for each other.
Liam: Well, under ordinary circumstances, I would be giving you quite an earful, but there's nothing ordinary about any of this. I don't have time to be upset at my oldest friend. I just don't have time. So I love you. And I'm happy for you.
Laura: I don't want you to go. I love you.
Liam: You know I love you. Would you do me one favor? When I'm gone-- I don't know, we could be dead tomorrow.
Laura: We could. I could die before you.
Liam: She's probably going to outlast you, but while you're around, keep her company for me?
Laura: If she ever talks to me again, I swear I will.
Liam: Well, what you've got going for you is you look a lot like me. You can remind her of me once in a while.
Laura: Good call.
Liam: Hey. It's okay. Happy for you.
Laura: Thank you.
Liam: Watch out for bear traps.
Laura: Thank you.
Liam: And I make a perception check as I walk back by myself. (laughter)
Matt: Yeah, you've traced your path back, you manage to avoid the traps easily this time being far more aware of the surroundings. In the meantime, while you two are rummaging through the household.
Marisha: We're looking through the books, yeah.
Taliesin: Looking through books.
Marisha: Do you think we'll ever have gods in our lives?
Taliesin: You know...
Marisha: I don't think they fancy us much. I don't really fancy them, though, so I guess that's fair. They're allowed that.
Taliesin: I'm not angry.
Marisha: (sighs) Me neither.
Taliesin: My books are still lovely, the library is still lovely. It made a lot of things better.
Marisha: You know, I felt really guilty about it for a while, like something was wrong with me? I don't understand why I didn't feel it, why I didn't understand. I don't think it was until Sarenrae and even Ioun just now mentioned that we serve that balance and that non-believers are necessary. It made me feel like a little bit less of a fuck-up, I guess, in this whole situation.
Taliesin: I think you're just fine. (laughs) Mostly.
Marisha: Apparently, you're a madman.
Taliesin: Apparently.
Marisha: A god called you a madman.
Taliesin: I know. Honestly, I'm a little touched.
Marisha: It's kind of a compliment.
Taliesin: Yeah, if it weren't for the migraine. I'm sorry, by the way. You may be the only one who understands this, but I needed something that was mine for a little while. So little of who we are is ours, and I knew it would end, but it was nice.
Marisha: Wow.
Taliesin: Ioun is quite a goddess, and she does not respect secrets, though. I, on the other hand, feel that secrets can be precious.
Marisha: Apparently. I just don't understand why you were still enigmatic after you already told us in front of Pelor. It's kind of a slap in the face.
Taliesin: Well, I thought she may kill me at that point. I was honestly fearing for my life there a little bit, and at that point everything was so awkward.
Marisha: I hope you know my frustration is only out of-- well, what you just said, I guess. Wanting something to be mine that I won't have.
Taliesin: Well, we'll see. I don't know.
Marisha: Some things you don't get to keep.
Taliesin: Yes, one of the bonuses of not being one of the chosen of the gods is we don't have to believe in destiny. We just, I think, heard a big speech from a god about not believing in destiny.
Marisha: I followed destiny my whole life. It wasn't until I got to the end that I realized the whole thing was ironic.
Taliesin: Why do we have to listen to anything they say?
Marisha: Cheers.
Taliesin: Cheers.
Marisha: Cheers to the faithless. I kind of inhaled a little bit.
Taliesin: That was a plant. You've been holding a plant and I've been holding a book. That got weird.
Marisha: I don't even know where we got these glasses in the story.
Taliesin: I think that was legitimately you were still holding a potted plant.
Marisha: Oh god. (spluttering) This coffee's been there for a while.
Sam: Crudite? Crudite? (laughter)
Taliesin: How does it feel to be chosen by a goddess at this point?
Sam: Who, me?
Taliesin: Yes, you! I know you've been listening.
Travis: No, I pull Scanlan aside.
Taliesin: We all watch.
Sam: A moment alone, please.
Travis: I want to see it.
Sam: My cube?
Travis: No, the seed. The little bean.
Sam: You want to see it?
Travis: Yeah, I want to see it.
Sam: All right.
Travis: Is it squishy?
Sam: Didn't you do this before with the other one?
Travis: Did I?
Sam: Didn't you try to squish it or something?
Marisha: That was the grain of sand.
Travis: I don't know what any of you are talking about. Are you giving it to me? Yep. I've got it. Over here. (sniffs) What does it smell like? (deep inhale) What does it smell like?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Laura: It's a seed of power, Grog.
Travis: Don't fucking rob me of my discovery. 11.
Matt: Best you can make out, it smells like dusty tomes. It smells like old, forgotten papers and parchment.
Travis: Smells like old money. It's been tucked in that old boob crevice. I want you to swallow the bean.
Sam: Swallow the bean?
Travis: Think about Sprigg, right? His tummy was glowing like fucking Teddy Ruxpin. I want to see you swallow that shit.
Sam: Sure. All right, I will mime swallowing the bean while I Wrist Pocket it.
Travis: (gasps) Oh my god! What, are you crazy? I was only kidding!
Matt: Make a sleight of hand check.
Sam: Five.
Matt: Grog, make a perception check.
Travis: I lose these every time, no matter how low it is. Eight. Nope. That's a six minus one, which is five. (laughter)
Matt: You all watch as he takes the small essence stone and whispers under his breath a small incantation and flicks his fingers, then it vanishes, and he goes-- it's so overt, yet you are entranced. He swallowed that thing!
Travis: I hope you know what you're doing. Do we get time with you before you leave?
Sam: I trust you 100 percent, Grog.
Liam: Scanlan just did the trick I do with my kids all the time, which is watch! One, two, three. It's gone! (laughter)
Travis: Where did that pencil go?! I pick Scanlan up by the scruff of his neck, and I hold my ear to his tummy.
Matt: Make a perception check.
Travis: Nine!
Sam: My stomach exists.
Matt: Yeah. You hear the occasional (grumbling).
Travis: Oh my god. It's growing. Tell me your last rites before you burst, if it happens.
Sam: I leave all of my worldly possessions to you, Grog.
Travis: Oh shit. Write that down, somebody?
Laura: I've got it, Grog. I've got it.
Travis: I'm holding him up like a seashell.
Taliesin: Shake him a bit. It will stop the reaction.
Laura: Stop manhandling Scanlan!
Travis: Why?
Laura: Because he doesn't like it.
Travis: Do you not like it?
Sam: Ordinarily, yes, but not today. (laughter)
Sam: When I pass it, I'll retrieve the item.
Travis: Oh shit.
Sam: Exactly.
Taliesin: He's keeping it secret. Keeping it safe.
Travis: You lost me.
Taliesin: I know.
Laura: We probably need to hurry.
Taliesin: This is going to be an odd request. Let's not go to Whitestone.
Travis: Why not?
Taliesin: I feel like we're being watched.
Laura: Maybe Vasselheim?
Sam: How did they know we were here?
Laura: Why didn't we ask Ioun about that?
Sam: Why did you just kill the assassin guy that we were going to ask?
Taliesin: It was an undead thing. It was just going to make a tongue at us.
Matt: "He wasn't really going to offer information, anyway."
Sam: Who are you?
Marisha: Who the fuck are you?
Travis: That's Vecna.
Laura: Is that the imp?
Matt: No. Standing by the doorway, you see there, arms crossed, casually standing before you: Vecna. (shouting and screaming)
Matt: (laughs) "Welcome back. You must have traveled quite a distance to be far from my sight."
Laura: Is he see-through? I try to shoot an arrow at him.
Matt: Okay, roll for an attack.
Liam: Cocked.
Laura: No, that's not cocked. Cocked! 29.
Matt: 29. (whoosh) It passes through his body.
Laura: I fucking knew it.
Matt: He laughs for a second, and you see him smiling his terrible grin across curled, yellowed teeth. You see that flicker of green energy sparking in his left eye. It seems to pulse as his brow arches above it. "I admire your resolve. You did it. You solved the riddle. You found my home, ruined my tower, slew one of my greatest acolytes, and even then, you failed. Still, impressive. That is most definitely worthy of a fine round of applause."
Laura: Thank you.
Matt: The smug clapping comes to a halt. He nods. "You're the only ones to get away. Others found me before you did, and another group of supposed heroes came and assaulted me shortly after you vanished. No matter. They all failed. And rose again."
Taliesin: Perception check.
Laura: Insight, maybe?
Marisha: Insight. Is he fucking lying?
Matt: Insight check? Go for it, if you want to make one.
Laura: Who was it? Natural 20.
Marisha: Oh yes!
Laura: Thanks for double-checking. It is. Like I would lie about a natural fucking 20.
Liam: That's a six. She's lying.
Marisha: 22.
Sam: Whispers?
Laura: He's the god of secrets! What do you expect?
Liam: The pencils are adorable.
Marisha: They are so cute.
Sam: You know what, guys? I didn't know that this was ever a thing.
Liam: You didn't know we were making pencils? Don't you remember the holy Vox Machina text thread?
Marisha: We definitely sent them in the text thread.
Sam: We've thrown out so many cool ideas on that text thread.
Laura: When I say, hey, name your quote on the text thread, then you send in a quote, that means it's probably pretty solid.
Sam: I get asked for personal quotes all the time.
Matt: "Consider your path one of earned existence. I would recommend you not waste such a rare lease on your arrogant lives."
Liam: I'm going to walk right up to him while he's talking and inspect his ugly fucking face.
Matt: You see through his beautifully adorned crushed velvet robes with gold trim. You see the tattered edges where gems and baubles hang around his neck. You can see the tendons and muscle that are pulled taut against his skin, that is drawn against his nearly-skeletal frame. He smiles back at you, looking down from that one sickly, almost pale blue iris and that green glowing burst of energy where his other eye would be.
Liam: How's that eye socket doing, friend?
Matt: "Well, these are the concerns of a mortal. My vision sees far more than it once did."
Marisha: While he's rambling, can Keyleth be looking for the nearest big-ass tree?
Matt: Sure. There's plenty of big-ass trees in your area.
Travis: Booby traps.
Marisha: Any clear path of least resistance?
Matt: Look at all these big-ass trees.
Taliesin: Also, is there anybody in the forest?
Marisha: Natural 19.
Matt: There's plenty to see, and you don't see anybody else nearby in the forest.
Marisha: Path of least resistance without traps?
Matt: Yeah, you see a path you can take.
Liam: I'm not entirely certain I am mortal anymore.
Matt: "I know what you are, and I know you know where I am. Come to me whenever you like."
Liam: Oh, fuckstick, we are coming.
Matt: "Are you all too bloody daft to see? It's over. I'm no longer the Undying King. I am the King of all Kings. I am not the Scourge in Secret. I am the Tyrant Unmatched."
Liam: Yes, you're very grand. And I begin to fingerfuck his eyehole in the illusion. So majestic.
Matt: As soon as your finger goes forward, his image flickers out and appears in the same room, behind you, now right up against Percy and Scanlan.
Marisha: We need to go.
Matt: "I am Vecna the Unholy. I am god upon Exandria. I come to play with the toys left by insolent, forgotten ancients and make this world into a new epoch. What this means, however, is an end to all. An end to borders and nations. There will only be the will of Vecna. So. Ask yourselves. You want peace? There is no peace, the way things are. You all bicker and stab and murder in the names of your mothers, your fathers. But this one? Everyone will live, and when they die, that need not be the end, either, under my banner. I can see your every move. I know your plot. I know your destination. I know your plan, your capabilities, your allies, and your imminent demise, should you continue. I offer you the chance to stand down, discard your imprisoned gods, and pledge to me. Many you love will. Many you love already have."
Travis: (laughs) I love it when they come begging for a truce. That means he's scared.
Matt: "Is it more important to throw away your lives against an unstoppable god or to return to your families--"
Liam: Grog, I think you're right.
Matt: "If you persist, I will not only destroy you, I will erase the memory of you ever existing from the mind of anyone you've ever known or cared for."
Laura: I don't think you have that power.
Matt: "Then try me."
Taliesin: I think, as generous as this offer is, we just don't enjoy associating with new money. Let's get out of here now.
Matt: "Very well."
Laura: I only serve gods with big dicks.
Matt: "Enjoy the forge."
Marisha: I point out the path. That way! Go!
Matt: As the portal opens and you guys go darting off in that direction, you hear in the distance the (cackles). One after another, you all jump through the portal, emerging?
Marisha: In Vasselheim.
Matt: In Vasselheim. (poof noise) All of you dart out just as the dusk sun begins to hit on the distant mountains this far across the ocean.
Marisha: I look around. Is there Vecna anywhere to be seen?
Matt: Nowhere.
Taliesin: We need sanctuary. Can you make your mansion?
Sam: Right now?
Taliesin: We need to rest, eventually, and you need to commune. We'd better assume we're being seen and heard at all times.
Laura: I wonder if he can see us in your dimension?
Taliesin: Maybe not.
Sam: I don't think so.
Travis: He said, of Exandria.
Marisha: He said he couldn't see us when we were in the library.
Liam: Where do I feel him now? Same distance?
Matt: Same distance. Same place.
Taliesin: Let's do this quick. We need to rest. You need to talk. There's much to do, and this does not feel good.
Laura: Go to Raven Queen's temple right now?
Sam: Raven Queen or the mansion?
Laura: Maybe we can do the mansion outside of her temple?
Sam: Sure.
Taliesin: Or even inside.
Travis: Vasselheim doesn't take very kindly to magic stuff.
Laura: We'll be in her temple.
Marisha: Aren't you also wanted here, right now?
Taliesin: I will literally shoot anybody who attempts to deal with it. Give him your hat.
Matt: The first thing you guys notice as you take in your surroundings: even though dusk is happening, there seems to be a larger bustle than you're used to in Vasselheim. You begin to see there's a skyship at port, and a lot of the various Bastions-- the general Bastions, the volunteer army that run across much of the city-- you see them darting back and forth, carrying supplies. There's a buzzing energy to the air of the city that you haven't seen in a while.
Taliesin: I'm going to grab someone, at some point.
Marisha: I did tell the Ashari to start alerting the nearby towns.
Matt: You grab a gentleman who runs past you, he has a greying beard with patches of black still, his top of his head is shaved bald and you can see a bit of a tattoo across one half of his face that curls into his ear. He's rushing with a cluster of spears under one arm, and he's wearing hide armor on his chest.
Taliesin: You there! What is the commotion?
Matt: "Apparently, we're gearing up for some sort of assault."
Taliesin: How soon?
Matt: "We don't know. We've just been told to prepare."
Taliesin: Who told?
Sam: Probably us.
Taliesin: I just want to find out where it came from.
Matt: "The chain of command from the top of the Bastions, as well. Apparently, from some of the other temples here are speaking of some entity, some Vecna."
Taliesin: Good man. Carry on. Prepare.
Matt: "Very well."
Marisha: I bet whenever he ascended, all the clerics felt it.
Laura: We'll be fighting undead, more than likely.
Matt: "Very well." He goes to run off, two of his compatriots stop and turn and give a slow glance of recognition towards Grog.
Laura: Keep running. They've got bigger things happening right now, just keep running.
Matt: You guys continue. They stare for a second, then keep running, they look to be preoccupied. But you get the sense that at least word of someone matching your image has been disseminated throughout the town.
Travis: I am quite famous.
Sam: Do you want me to disguise you?
Travis: Sure, why not. What am I looking like?
Sam: Take this hat--
Travis: I have to attune to it; it takes forever.
Sam: Fuck! All right, I'll cast Seeming on you. On all of us. Because I can.
Travis: Will you make me look like Tary?
Laura: No, what? (laughter)
Laura: That's not smart!
Travis: Well, it's not like he was in the room where it happened.
Taliesin: The room where it happened?
Matt: The room where it happened.
Laura: Keep running toward the Raven Queen temple as that's happening.
Marisha: We should probably try and use our words as much as possible.
Sam: Blue and a foot smaller, like Blue Man Group. Black clothes, blue face, bald.
Matt: So you have a little more of an aasimar appearance, though a larger one than you've seen. (laughter)
Matt: All right, where are you guys charging off to?
Liam: Yeah, Raven Queen temple.
Matt: Okay, you're heading to the Raven's Crest. All right. You make your way to the--
Marisha: I'm going to keep looking around, make sure no one's tailing us.
Matt: Okay, make a perception check.
Marisha: 21.
Matt: 21? All right. Keeping an eye out, you don't see anybody following you at the moment. That does not appear to be an issue. So you head to the area of the Duskmeadow, to the southeast of the city. You come through the dry, cold, and dusty sector. A little bit of snow appears to have melted into slush at the corners, but most of it has been pushed off the main roads to the side. You see dirty snow matted at the edges. You follow Vax very quickly through the streets, and you see a few of the veiled maidens of the Raven's Crest aerie taking note of you. And as you approach, they just point over to the Raven's Crest silently as you walk past.
Laura: Quickly. Quickly walk past.
Liam: I'm going to walk up the steps and push open the door.
Matt: You're coming from the other side as opposed to the main entrance so you rush past the hall that goes, which is the Grand Library that's attached to the Raven's Crest.
Liam: Everybody's with me, right?
Matt: Yeah, And you come to the front doors, they are closed currently, but you have two of the maidens there at the front, and as you begin to turn from the side, they glance over and give notice, and then turn and push the doors open in preparation. With that, you all enter Raven's Crest itself, and looking within, you can see the beautiful interior of carved obsidians and gold trims and sigils that are marked and pushed throughout the interior of this structure. Are you leading them to the central chamber?
Liam: Yeah, I'm bringing everybody with me.
Matt: Okay. No one stops you, and as you head up these stairs into the second chamber and then finally to the large set of doorways that lead you into the central communion chamber of Raven's Crest, you guys enter to this beautiful room that is surrounded in stained glass imagery of varying colors, largely in dark purples and reds, blues, and in the center you see a large, circular pool where a deep crimson liquid sits perfectly still, familiar to both Percival and Vax'ildan.
Liam: I walk over to Keyleth. We need to talk. And I plant a big fucking kiss on her mouth, and then I turn to the rest of the group and say, nobody fucking touches me, do you understand?
Travis: Where are you going?
Laura: Understood.
Liam: I walk in, and I inhale as deeply as I can as I shove my face into the blood.
Laura: I hold Trinket back so that he doesn't go after him.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: I watch on the side and don't take my eyes off of him.
Matt: Okay. Pike instinctually walks up to the very edge but avoids touching any of the liquid. As you watch Vax just (bloop noise) disappear into this thick liquid, no bubbles rise, you see a bit of movement from thrashing beneath the surface and then stillness.
Marisha: Is this what he goes through every time?
Taliesin: This is normal.
Travis: Is he a vampire?
Taliesin: He is not a vampire.
Sam: I think he's dead. I think he died in there.
Taliesin: I don't think that's how it works.
Laura: But I do think he's dead.
Sam: He's undead, isn't he? He's a zombie.
Taliesin: He's not a zombie.
Marisha: His flesh is cold, but his heart still beats.
Matt: Vax'ildan. As the panic and pain subsides, much easier now than it was your previous ventures, into this communion, the darkness surrounds you, familiar, but you are intent, and you are driven. The very force of your conversation is pushed out from your personality into this ether, this surrounding, infinite void, and a familiar voice comes. "You burn with intent, my feathered boy."
Liam: We need to talk.
Matt: "Then talk we shall. Speak your mind." You still see nothing around you, it's just the voice from the darkness.
Liam: We were too late to stop him. Vecna.
Matt: "I sensed it, yes."
Liam: This dead man who wanted to be a god is now a fucking god. We have been speaking to your brothers and sisters, your found family, and they are arming us with what we need to fight your foe. You know who he is. He is upon us and I have come to you for aid. And as I have learned, he is somewhat akin to you. He was one of us and has ascended, like you.
Matt: "He is no kin to me. He is a trier. He is a copycat. He ascends for selfish reasons, whereas I was merely following my destiny. He will be destroyed. You have the tools. You have the means. The weave is tangled before us. The threads grow knotted, hard to follow. But yours still glows so bright into that terrible knot."
Liam: This thing. This man is your enemy, yes?
Matt: "As he is the enemy of all things."
Liam: Agreed. I have come here seeking power.
Matt: "You have my blessing already."
Liam: What of these trammels? These fragments of divinity. Have you that in you?
Matt: "I do not know much of these trammels but that they were used. But I fear that is beyond my knowledge. The Knowing Mistress would be the one to speak to."
Liam: We have.
Matt: "Then what do you need of me?"
Liam: We need to power trammels. The Dawnfather, the Knowing Mistress have contributed to our cause, to your cause, these seeds of power. I had hoped you could offer the same.
Matt: At this point, you feel a finger trace across your chin from behind. You feel an arm, the weight resting on your shoulder, and it pulls and turns you around, and as you spin, you come face to face with the porcelain mask you are so familiar with. As the hand still holds the edge of your cheek and your shoulder, "Am I to believe that this is not some ploy to diminish my power and leave me vulnerable to cast me from my seat?"
Liam: I thought you knew me inside and out.
Matt: "I know you, but do you know them? Do you think I've been welcome since I entered this pantheon? My existence is perpetually a threat to the creators. If anything, part of this burden that we all face lies on my shoulders, as well. Why would they not think to strike at two birds with one stone?" At which point, you watch the feathers of her dress furl out a bit, like a bird that's hit a chill.
Liam: Well, it depends on you, then, and how much you want this wretch taken down.
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Liam: 18.
Matt: There's a long, silent stare. "I put my faith in you, my fate-touched. Do not forget that. And all I ask is you put all your faith in me."
Liam: You have it.
Matt: "Then I shall watch your thread. Now wake up." In that instant, everything goes black once more, and you feel the pain, the heat in your lungs, but then it subsides quickly, and you stay there beneath the familiar, thick surface of the blood. No need for air.
Travis: You're just chilling like a villain under the blood?!
Sam: (whispering) He can breathe blood!
Matt: The instinct to breathe is still there, but you realize after a moment of panic that it's not necessary.
Liam: Do I have what I came for?
Matt: You can't see. Your body is clenched tight. Your muscles are still tense.
Liam: Okay, I'll move up.
Matt: You guys, after waiting for about 30 minutes, it feels like, of tense silence, you watch as the surface of the pool (splashing) splashes upwards as a crimson Vax comes to the surface. Not gasping for breath. Just stoic, as he comes to the edge of the pool, step after step, dripping the blood with each footprint on the ground. Your fist hurts a bit from the tightness, but as you unfurl your fingers you look down and see a small, onyx opal. It's a stone about the size of a gem that big on your hand.
Travis: That is a big bean.
Liam: I need a bath.
Taliesin: Do we want to try and make one more jump?
Travis: Just a minute. I have a question. How many times have you done that?
Liam: Six.
Travis: My gods.
Taliesin: Once.
Sam: This has been the craziest 48 hours of my life. (laughter)
Sam: I mean... wow, guys.
Liam: Campaign in 48 hours.
Sam: Wow. I could've just been chilling...
Taliesin: You've made some bad decisions, haven't you?
Liam: I just stand clutching a gem dripping blood, looking at the love of my life.
Marisha: I kiss him back through the blood. (groaning)
Marisha: Fuck you, you kiss your bear on the mouth!
Matt: It looks like Keyleth had some barbecue and wasn't paying attention.
Travis: We don't know where that blood's from!
Marisha: That's love, y'all.
Liam: I was not expecting that.
Marisha: You did it.
Liam: (whispering) I'm sorry.
Marisha: Okay, all right, let's clean you up.
Taliesin: Do we want to try and run one more time before we--
Sam: Run where?
Laura: Run where?
Taliesin: Well, into the forge, I suppose. Find the sword, head to the forge.
Sam: How do we get to the forge? There's no trees there.
Travis: I have a thought, right? Do we give a shit about Kord at all, or no?
Sam: It would be great to have a fourth bean, but we're on a ticking time clock.
Liam: Yeah, I like the idea of the Kord bean, but I really want to go to bed.
Taliesin: Let's set up camp, and if you feel like you want to make one last--
Travis: I'll ask. He might just say no.
Marisha: We don't even know where to find him, though. We're running out of time.
Travis: Yep. It's right here. It's like popping into Blockbuster when you go to the grocery store. Might as well see what's up.
Sam: Blockbuster?
Laura: Redbox, maybe.
Travis: No, Blockbuster. Where are you from?
Sam: Errol's Video.
Taliesin: 20/20. Do we want to set up shop here or do we want to set up shop in the temple of Kord?
Laura: I think here. I feel like we're safe here.
Travis: I mean, we got free reign. We got backstage passes. Everybody's like, "right through here!"
Taliesin: I think honestly here they'll have difficulty identifying which of our blood is going to be splattered on the ground.
Liam: And I'm good with management, I think we can... yeah.
Taliesin: Let's sleep here.
Travis: Yeah, you seem to be super tight with--
Laura: Do you want to head over to Kord's temple as well? I have a feeling if we find him, we'll have to go to another plane.
Travis: Yeah, that was my (stammers) assess, as well.
Laura: Yeah.
Marisha: If you want to go do a little bit of footwork and see what it might take to get there, I can rest and try and get us there. Remember, you have to find a tuning fork, though, that is attuned to the specific plane.
Taliesin: You're speaking words that he doesn't--
Marisha: You need a magical vibrating fork that is connected to the vibrating plane of Kord.
Taliesin: He doesn't know what that word means.
Travis: I was just going to go speak to Earthbreaker Groon. I don't know what's so hard about that. He gave me these gloves last time.
Marisha: Right. I'm just letting you know the prerequisites so you can ask the right questions. Just go.
Laura: I'll go. I'll go with him.
Travis: Am I still blue?
Sam: You're still blue, and you still look like Blue Man Group, so do you want me to go with you so that I can undo that when we get there?
Travis: Yeah, you tweedles want to come?
Laura: Yeah.
Sam: Or do you want to talk to him blue?
Travis: No, I want to be blue. Yeah. I want to stay blue.
Sam: But when you talk to Groon do you want to be blue?
Travis: Yeah you can dissipate, right?
Sam: So I'll come with you.
Travis: Yeah. That cool?
Laura: Yeah.
Travis: You guys rest. I'm going to go find us a bean of strength and might and sex appeal. Can I go to the temple of Kord?
Matt: Yeah. You guys make your way.
Sam: Am I making a mansion for the rest of you?
Laura: That would be smart. I feel like the mansion is the smartest thing because it's not--
Travis: They don't have Raven Queen cots or something?
Laura: We don't know; Vecna could still see in here.
Marisha: Oh, that's true. You're right.
Sam: All right. Mansion. Enjoy yourselves.
Matt: You create the shimmering doorway, and you guys come into the mansion without issue.
Marisha: To the spa!
Liam: To the spa!
Sam: I'll don the hat so I turn into the Meat Man so that no one can recognize me.
Matt: Okay. The three of you make your way to the Braving Grounds.
Laura: As we're walking, I want to whisper to Scanlan. I'm going to whisper to the Meat Man's crotch because that's about even, right?
Sam: I think he's a little bigger.
Laura: Then I'll whisper to his waistline. The sword that Ioun was talking about, right, the Sword of Kas?
Sam: (Meat Man voice) The Sword of Kas, yes.
Laura: Do you think it could possibly the sword that Grog had?
Sam: The thought did occur to me, yes, but there are big differences.
Laura: Do you know for sure?
Sam: Well, Ioun did not talk about a talking sword, for one.
Laura: Well, no, but she didn't say it wasn't a talking sword. She said it was a vengeful sword.
Sam: Do you think we should go get it to make sure? We should have asked for some sort of identifying feature.
Laura: We really should have. Maybe we could ask the sword.
Sam: She said, "Do you have any more questions?"
Laura: And we didn't. But maybe if we see that sword, we can be like, "Hey, do you know who Kas is?" and if he does, then we're like, "Oh fuck!"
Sam: You want to go visit Craven Edge?
Laura: I'm saying this quietly. I don't want Grog to realize we're doing this. He has a thing for Craven Edge.
Sam: I held the sword once.
Laura: You did?
Sam: I have a thing for Craven Edge, as well.
Laura: Oh fuck. Oh shit.
Matt: Make an intelligence roll, actually. Roll a d20, add your intelligence modifier plus one because you have a permanent plus two to your intelligence.
Sam: Intelligence check? 11.
Liam: Your intelligence is higher now, after Ioun. Don't forget your Ioun papers!
Sam: Eight plus two, plus one is 11.
Liam: Oh god!
Matt: Okay, continue.
Laura: Continue. You didn't pass the test.
Sam: I mean, do I get to add my Jack of All Trades?
Matt: Yeah. Plus three.
Sam: 14!
Laura: Anything?
Matt: Nothing. Continue.
Sam: It was a very powerful sword, but perhaps it's worth a check. How do we get there? We'll have to talk to Keyleth about it.
Marisha: I don't think the timelines match. But I could be wrong. I'm not there.
Laura: Delilah Briarwood, Lord Briarwood had the sword, they were seeking Vecna.
Liam: That's where they got that shit.
Laura: It could work out.
Marisha: But they were making out like Vecna had this sword while we had Craven Edge, right?
Laura: Vecna doesn't have the sword right now--
Matt: No one's seen the Sword of Kas since Vecna was destroyed along with Kas.
Laura: Exactly! Craven Edge could be the Sword of Kas.
Liam: It got lost and was refound.
Laura: By the Briarwoods. They were going to awaken him, but then he died.
Sam: Or it's just a sword.
Laura: Or it's just a sword that just likes blood.
Liam: We've got to do something.
Travis: Can we go?!
Laura: Sorry, Grog. Yes, of course. We're walking. We're doing this while we walk. We're not wasting time with this conversation. We're traveling with this conversation.
Travis: I didn't realize.
Sam: We'll ask Keyleth when we get back.
Laura: Okay. We sent it to the plane of the Dread Emperor.
Sam: She knows how to get there.
Matt: You guys make your way through the Proving Grounds. Where are you heading to specifically?
Travis: To the temple of Kord. Big man outside. The Trial Forge with the big doors.
Matt: You make your way to the Trial Forge. The doors are currently closed, it is mid-evening at this point. It's probably, at this point, with the communion and you guys making your way across the city? Yeah, it's close to midnight.
Travis: Nice. (loud knocking)
Matt: Your knocks are very loud and easily heard. About 20 seconds later (door opening) begin to open. You hear the cinching of chains as the doors are pulled open ever so slightly. One of the monks of Kord arrives at the front, sees you, recognizes you with a bit of glance.
Sam: He's blue.
Matt: Oh, that's right. Does not recognize you.
Travis: I apologize for the late flower. Don't be confused. It's me, Grog Strongjaw, wielder of the Titanstone Knuckles. (whispers) I'm in-cog-Cheeto.
Sam: I will drop the form of Grog.
Matt: Yeah. "Very well. Can I help you?"
Travis: Yeah, I seek an audience with Earthbreaker Groon. Very important. It pertains to the emergence of Vecna.
Matt: "All right. This may coordinate with his current effort. Very well. Please enter."
Sam: Can we come in?
Matt: You guys make your way in.
Sam: I am a legitimate businessman.
Matt: "I am very curious as to why you are here, then."
Sam: For business dealings.
Matt: "You walk with Vox Machina."
Sam: I shouldn't have said anything. (laughter)
Matt: You walk through the halls, your footfalls echoing across the stone floor. The large archways and the pillars. It is very quiet. As you approach the edge of the central sandpit, in the center you see Groon, currently sitting in meditation with something drawn in the sand with a finger. Some sort of a sketch.
Travis: May I approach?
Matt: The head, facing away from you, picks up a bit. "You may."
Travis: (jumping and landing) Three-point stance.
Matt: Slowly stands up and brushes sand from the hands. Not turning, but just looking over the shoulder ever so slightly at you. "What brings you to the temple at this hour?"
Travis: We have urgent business-- what are you drawing there?
Matt: "Finish your statement."
Travis: Right, sorry. We come with grim tidings. Vecna is at large, and we mean to take him down.
Matt: "I know only what I've been told. We are gathering the monks for defense of the city. Awaiting orders. I'm trying to meditate on where this danger is."
Travis: We have a theory. We think he might be originating in Wildemount? No.
Laura: We don't know where he is exactly-- (stammering) We've been speaking to the gods.
Travis: You might want to talk through me. I'm his most prized pupil.
Laura: I'm going to stand next to Grog while I say this.
Travis: In the sandpit?
Laura: Yeah! I'm going to fly down to the sandpit and land next to Grog.
Travis: Lady Vex'ahlia. Great fighter, very brave.
Laura: Hi.
Matt: Still hasn't turned around, but seems to be listening.
Laura: Champion of Pelor, the Dawnfather. We've been speaking to the gods. We're taking on Vecna. Hopefully not alone, but we need to speak with Kord. I know that sounds odd, but Grog was hoping--
Laura: I was hoping that you would know how to contact him directly, perhaps maybe have something that was tuned to his plane of existence, potentially.
Travis: I was hoping that you would know how to contact him directly, perhaps maybe have something that was tuned to his plane of existence, potentially.
Matt: "You have drawn Kord's attention once, directly. He is aware of you. Should you wish to speak, that I can teach. It is a long process. Piety, meditation, and learning of the history of the Storm Lord himself. But it can be done."
Laura: How long of a process is this, that we're talking?
Matt: "You cannot rush faith."
Laura: I'm not trying to rush faith. I'm just saying that Vecna has ascended to godhood. We have a limited amount of time to take him down. We need to speak with Kord.
Matt: "I cannot help you."
Laura: You can't speak to him directly?
Matt: "I can meditate and reach out, perhaps."
Laura: Maybe draw his attention to us? The need is dire.
Matt: "It doesn't work the way you ask. Kord isn't a giving god."
Laura: He's not?
Matt: Make a religion check.
Laura: Okay, yeah, this is going to go so well. Hold up. 20?
Matt: Okay. You know about Kord. Kord, from what you understand, is the god of competition and storms and chaotic nature and good-neutral territory, but emphasizes contest and--
Travis: Self-reliance.
Matt: Yeah, he's not the kind of god you can beseech with a word.
Laura: Maybe you can tell him there's a big fight coming. Call out to him! Get his attention.
Travis: See if he wants box seats or something?
Laura: Yeah! Say he can help take down the big bad guy.
Travis: Free food and drinks?
Laura: Definitely! Prime tickets to a UFC fight.
Travis: Do you happen to know, from all your years of meditation, what plane or where Kord might reside?
Matt: "Ysgard."
Travis: Ysgard?
Laura: East guard?
Matt: "Ysgard."
Travis: East guard. (laughter)
Laura: He is god. East guard.
Matt: Y-S-G-A-R-D. (laughter)
Travis: (clears throat) Ysgard. Hmm. Is that on another plane?
Laura: Is that near the Fields of Elysium, or a totally different place?
Matt: "I do not know."
Travis: Listen, he is very busy right now with his meditation garden.
Laura: Right, yeah. So you have nothing else that you can do? I know that you're going to fight his troops, but the fact of the matter is Vecna is a god. If we can't find some way to speak to Kord, we may not be able to save the world again.
Travis: Action now would prevent the spread of his power.
Matt: "If what you say is true, I'm certain Kord already knows. We will do what we can, but what you ask is not within our ability to grant."
Travis: Fair enough. You don't happen to have a bean on you, do you? Hard no?
Laura: Powerful beans. Super.
Matt: For the first time, you see Kord glance over his shoulder at you--
Laura: (laughs) He hasn't looked at us this whole fucking time?
Matt: No, he's been back to you and looking over the shoulder. He finally turns and gives a nudge to one of the monks up top, who darts off. (running noises) A few awkward quiet minutes pass. (running noises) Jumps down into the sand pit, runs up, and hands you a small satchel.
Travis: I look inside.
Matt: It is filled with beans. (laughter)
Laura: You have everything you've ever wanted, Grog. Congratulations.
Travis: Everybody else got one. I've got a satchel. Just fucking name the group after me. We are out. Thank you!
Laura: Can I see what he was drawing in the sand while we were over there?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Laura: 18.
Travis: I'll do it, too, because I was curious.
Matt: Go for it.
Travis: Don't worry about it. (laughter)
Matt: You glance over and you see one sketch that appears to be a general overview of the city, of all the different quarters that make up the mountain. And he's essentially trying to work out defense positions within the city and preparing for some sort of siege.
Travis: I thank you for seeing us at this late hour, and I wish you luck in the defense of this temple and this city.
Matt: "I wish I could be of more help."
Travis: You have been.
Laura: Groon, if Vecna attacks here, he'll bring undead.
Matt: "That's all right. We'll bring the storm."
Travis: Oh fuck! That was a noble answer! I'm sorry. I'm cool. We're out.
Sam: If you ever need any antique furniture or decor, ask for the Meat Man. He get you good deal. (clicks tongue)
Matt: (grunts) He turns back to facing away.
Laura: He's really creepy, isn't he?
Travis: Make sure as we leave, we back away. Back away.
Laura: Back away.
Taliesin: What was Kord painting?
Matt: He was drawing in the sand.
Taliesin: Please tell me it was a horse playing saxophone. That's all I want. (laughter)
Matt: He sits back down in the sand pit and goes back to his concentration, leaves you to your business.
Travis: That was a total win. I got a bag full of beans.
Laura: Good job, Grog.
Travis: Yep. And we know that Kord is on "he's-a-god."
Laura: Yeah. He's in Ysgard.
Travis: You're saying it weird.
Laura: "He's-god."
Travis: "He's-god." So should I change back?
Sam: I can't do it again.
Travis: What do you mean? You can't?
Sam: I guess I could do it one more time, sure.
Travis: We're going back to sleep, right? It's either that or I put a fancy robe over my whole face.
Sam: This time, I make us all blue.
Laura: Lovely. Can I have light blue hair?
Sam: Dark blue skin, light blue hair? Sure. I'll be opposite.
Liam: Not painted bald caps? Not blue-painted bald caps?
Laura: No, I want beautiful hair. I've always wanted blue hair.
Liam: That's not the Blue Man Group I know.
Travis: We make our way back to the temples. Is the bustle the same outside of the temple?
Matt: Well, as you step out of the temple and Scanlan blues you all, you make your way across--
Sam: Episode title  The Blue Job. (laughter)
Travis: The multiple blue jobs.
Matt: Yeah. Okay. As you exit the temple, it's late night, and the bustle has calmed down a little bit, as it is the evening, but you do see there are-- normally what are small patrol lights at the edges of the walls, you can see large fires are burning at the edges to extend eyesight. It's interesting. You see wyverns in the sky. You hear the familiar cries of wyverns, and at first, it catches you off-guard. But Vex'ahlia, glancing up, you can see they all have some sort of barding on them. Silver and blue barding.
Laura: Oh shit! It's the temple of Bahamut? Yes!
Matt: Platinum dragons. They have wyvern riders here that act as air patrol during times of intense possible warfare.
Travis: Air force got scrambled. (aircraft noises) Amazing!
Taliesin: Formation. Smoke.
Laura: I really hope Vasselheim stands.
Matt: You guys make your way back to Raven's Crest, to the entranceway to Scanlan's Magnificent Mansion and to the rest of your party, freshly washed.
Travis: So a question  what's on the menu?
Taliesin: Beans, apparently.
Travis: Now, look. How do you even know that?
Taliesin: I just assumed because I know you.
Travis: Why would you only serve beans? There's no meat or fish?
Sam: It's vegan here. We serve a lot of beans.
Travis: Because of your daughter?
Sam: Yes.
Travis: Well, she's not here. Can we make an exception?
Sam: She's always here in my heart.
Taliesin: Hopefully not in the kitchen, though, so we're going to cook anything we like.
Travis: I got what we needed. I got myself a bean.
Marisha: You got a shard?
Travis: I got several shards. I got a bag full of shards. Hold on, the power might bowl you all over.
Taliesin: That actually might, especially if not eaten with rice.
Travis: What are you doing? (gasping)
Liam: It's all right; I can eat anything.
Travis: How do you feel?
Matt: Tastes like ash.
Liam: Yeah, so does everything.
Marisha: (gasps) We used to eat these in the Fire Ashari all the time. These are a rare delicacy! Good find, Grog. (gasps) I could grow some more. Oh my god. We can have coal bean soup all the time at home, you guys. These are coal beans. They're great.
Travis: These are not the same thing?
Laura: There could be an actual seed of power within there.
Travis: Is there a table nearby?
Matt: Yeah, you're not too far from the--
Travis: I dump all the beans out on the table. Are there any beans that look different from the rest?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Laura: I'll look over his shoulder and help look. I'm going to help look.
Travis: (laughing) 16. Does that count?
Laura: That's not bad.
Matt: You actually find four beans that look a bit darker, but squishier. They look to maybe be a little on the the rotten side.
Travis: These are the beans. I mean, I should've thought-- Kord is a fist, and you put one of each four on the knuckles. I squish each one of the beans.
Matt: And they squish easy. (squishing noise)
Travis: I'm not a praying man. Bless my gauntlet. Anything happen?
Marisha: There's a little juice running down your gauntlet.
Travis: Are they glowing?
Laura: Well...
Marisha: Fermented? Fermented.
Matt: A little funky.
Travis: You know what? I bet if I pray hard enough, they will disappear. Look above you!
Laura: (noises of surprise)
Sam: (noises of surprise)
Matt: Make a sleight-of-hand check.
Travis: Hey! That's not terrible. (laughing) I got plus two! 18! (laughter)
Matt: Strangely, Scanlan and Pike are impressed.
Sam: I just rolled a two. Whoa. That was impressive.
Travis: Yeah. Well, the line between me and Kord. Super tight.
Marisha: Keyleth goes behind Grog and starts cleaning up the beans that he just threw.
Travis: Pike! Pretty good, right?
Matt: "Honestly? Kind of blown away."
Travis: I know. Maybe I should get a tattoo for Kord, like the symbols you have for Sarenrae.
Matt: "What're you thinking for the tattoo?"
Travis: I don't know. A fist?
Taliesin: Or a bean.
Travis: Hey, don't put ideas in my head. A bean?
Matt: "Actually, the symbol of the Storm Lord's cool. I'll get it up for you." And she pulls out a piece of paper and sketches it up for you. It's this cool disc, this dark metal disc with blue bolts of lightning that stick out of the center.
Travis: The Storm Lord symbol is the jam. That is a cartoon bean.
Laura: It's a bean with a dick.
Travis: The dick is smaller than the balls. It's like a parrot's beak. Listen. We're going to stick with the Storm Lord sigil.
Liam: We are going to save the world.
Travis: Well, listen, I found out where Kord is. He's in a place called--
Laura: Ysgard.
Sam: Ysgard.
Marisha: Sure.
Travis: Are you familiar?
Marisha: No.
Travis: Oh. Why'd you say sure?
Marisha: I was just seeming intelligent.
Travis: I do that all the time. Anybody have any idea where that is?
Sam: No. We can ask.
Travis: Okay. Who can we ask?
Taliesin: Asking the dungeon master.
Matt: (chuckles) Make a religion check, only if you're trained in it.
Liam: I'm making a religion check. Jeepers.
Matt: I just rolled for Pike.
Travis: 17, but I'm not trained in it.
Liam: Just a 12.
Taliesin: I'm not trained in religion.
Matt: (sighs) Not a whole lot of information gleaned on this.
Travis: (sighs) Okay. How did Pike roll?
Matt: Pike didn't roll that great.
Travis: Fuck!
Laura: Percy? With your migraine, do you know what else we need to make these trammels?
Taliesin: I've been thinking a lot. I've been trying to skirt around this information for a bunch of reasons, so I've been making a mental shopping list.
Matt: Yeah. And from what you recall, it seems that one, the tools that were used to build them are generally with the anvil forge. It's more the essence of the god that drives the trammel. The material required is pure platinum.
Laura: (gasps) Platinum mines!
Travis: Yeah, that we buried under a mountain.
Laura: So? We know where they are.
Marisha: Do we for sure need platinum?
Matt: The trammels are about that long. They're giant stakes of platinum.
Laura: We need more platinum.
Taliesin: I'm attempting to do the math of how much platinum...
Matt: I mean, if you were to melt down platinum pieces? Each trammel would probably be close to I'd say-- with the density and the thickness of it-- 500 platinum.
Marisha: Each trammel is 500 platinum?
Matt: Yeah. For the thickness of it, for the pure platinum structure.
Marisha: How much do we have?
Laura: Well, I didn't write exactly how much platinum we have. I transposed the platinum into gold in my notes.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: We can buy platinum. Go to a bank and exchange it.
Matt: You can exchange gold for platinum.
Marisha: Wait, Grog. You had it in your original Bag of Holding? How much was written down on our original Bag of Holding list?
Travis: I don't know. There were a bunch of digits.
Marisha: Do you not still have it written down?
Taliesin: If he actually has the phrase "a bunch of digits," that would make me so happy right now.
Travis: You know, we could always take Kima's greatsword. It's made out of solid platinum.
Matt: She has that sword right now.
Travis: Yeah, she does. I'm just saying.
Sam: Who was the other band of travelers who fought and lost?
Travis: 1,600 platinum.
Marisha: We had 1,600 platinum, originally.
Travis: 1,619.
Taliesin: There's part of me that doesn't want to know.
Marisha: We're going to find out.
Laura: We could go to the bank here in Vasselheim and switch out money for platinum. We have enough gold to do. It's 500 platinum each, you said?
Marisha: Is there a place where we could buy bars?
Laura: 5,000 gold would be 500 platinum? Okay.
Matt: You have to melt it down to get rid of the impurities to get the metal down to its purest form. There's a process to it that you are actually familiar with.
Travis: I'm familiar with it, all of a sudden. So because we have these shards, right, these magical beans, if we lose, do we effectively kill all the gods whose shards we have?
Taliesin: We depower them, so they'll be weak when they go against Vecna.
Travis: Yeah, that's a lot of responsibility I was not aware of.
Laura: Well, we need to not lose. They're still diminished if we do defeat Vecna. That part of them is forever chaining him.
Marisha: If we fail, he could be coming after them. They have no line of defense.
Travis: Worst scenario possible. Cool. Good to know.
Matt: Good news is, you do know that the Divine Gate works both ways. He could not travel into their realms. They could not travel into that. However, it prevents them from intervening directly on his dominion over the Prime Material Plane.
Liam: And as far as we know, this other group did not have the help of gods.
Laura: Right. As far as we know.
Liam: As far as we know, unless they went to all of the other gods we have not met.
Taliesin: It's not like we can't look in on anyone that we need to really quickly. I'm feeling the urge.
Laura: Do you know who it could be?
Liam: We might want to check and see if Allura, Gilmore, Kima, all our buddies are okay. Kash, Zahra.
Taliesin: My question is, does it matter, at the moment?
Laura: Of course it matters, dear.
Taliesin: Does it? Does it just make us panic?
Laura: At least we'd know if he raised them up like he said he did, if we'll be fighting undead Gilmore and undead Allura.
Taliesin: All right, point made. Point very well made. Let's start with--
Marisha: I have a few scrys that I want to do, anyway.
Laura: Can we scry through this dimension?
Marisha: Nope. I've got to pop out.
Travis: Shouldn't you rest first?
Taliesin: No, finish this first.
Liam: What do you need?
Marisha: I'm just wondering if I do any type of large magic, if it'll alert him. Hey, what happened to that skull that we got in Brimscythe's basement?
Taliesin: With the gem.
Marisha: The gem in the eye.
Laura: Funny you should ask.
Marisha: Remember, we thought it might be connected?
Taliesin: It had a gem in one eye, if I recall.
Travis: Yeah, a green emerald gem in one socket, you dicks.
Sam: Where is it?
Laura: Allura has it.
Marisha: We gave it to Allura.
Travis: What?
Laura: Allura has it.
Travis: No, it's in Percy's workshop.
Laura: Sure, and Allura came down and saw it-- no, I gave it to Allura.
Marisha: I wonder if it's spying on everything?
Laura: I'm sorry, Grog. I gave you your deck of cards back! The skull was very dangerous, and at the time it seemed like the right thing to do. I'm sorry. I'm sorry! Look, we just went and got a bunch of beans for you.
Travis: That's true.
Liam: And also, buddy, we might be dead in a week, you don't want to hold on to that kind of shit.
Taliesin: We may be going to get the skull back.
Marisha: Well, yeah, we could get the skull back because I was just going through my notes, my old diary, of everything that we've been through--
Taliesin: It literally has a leaf on it, oh my god.
Marisha: I have four diaries of everything we've been through.
Taliesin: I've read them.
Sam: Ugh. What kind of dumb character keeps a diary?
Marisha: It said evil skull in Brimscythe's-- 1/21. We found an evil skull in Brimscythe's house. It may be connected to Craven Edge. And I put stars next to it.
Taliesin: Did you put stars next to it because it was important or did you just put stars next to it?
Marisha: I don't know, that's just what I wrote down a year and a half ago.
Travis: I mean, do you need me to drop my scholastic knowledge on this shit? Because I will. It talked to me and it was like, "If you free me, I'll give you a wish."
Marisha: The skull?
Travis: Yeah. Why do you think I was trying to break that shit?
Laura: I don't believe if you'd freed it you would've gotten a wish, I think you would've fought something.
Travis: Do you know for sure?
Laura: No.
Travis: Then what are we talking about?
Taliesin: Let's find out what's going on with the skull.
Liam: Yeah, we are in final days, here.
Taliesin: Yeah, let's give ourselves--
Sam: What are we doing?
Taliesin: We're going to try and take 48 hours to get as much done as humanly possible.
Laura: We need to scry on the fucking friends, we need to check in on that skull, maybe. And you need to maybe open up the plane to the Dread Emperor and see about the Craven Edge.
Marisha: What now?
Liam: The gods must be crazy.
Taliesin: Part two?
Sam: That's low priority.
Laura: Is it?
Sam: I don't think that's the thing.
Laura: What if that weapon is super good against Vecna?
Sam: Just because it's a sword?
Marisha: Okay, wait, did she say we needed the sword? Also, I think the knight guy that you fought that was super awful was the bloody--
Liam: Kas.
Laura: No, Kas is destroyed. He turned to ash. He fought Vecna and was turned to ash.
Sam: Did the knight have a sword?
Travis: He did. A giant blade that emitted shadow.
Sam: Maybe that was the sword.
Marisha: But wasn't he brought back? Kas the Bloody-Handed, right? Oh wait, he fought--
Laura: He fought against Vecna! They destroyed each other. It's the reason Vecna was destroyed to begin with.
Marisha: But maybe he brought Kas back and that was the Death Knight we fought.
Sam: The world is full of mysteries.
Taliesin: One of which is whether or not our friends are alive.
Marisha: All right, I'm going to step outside and scry on Allura first!
Liam: And I'm going to-- nothing, I'm just going to stand and walk out front.
Matt: So. You're scrying first.
Marisha: Allura.
Matt: Okay. So you step out into the center of the structure--
Laura: (whispering) Please please please please please...
Marisha: Wait! Is anybody around? Nothing's weird and out of the ordinary?
Matt: You're in the Raven's Crest.
Marisha: Okay. Just want to make sure. People just punk'd us at Sprigg's cabin!
Sam: We're inside a church.
Marisha: Doesn't mean assassins can't get inside a church.
Laura: Just go, just scry!
Marisha: Okay, I'm going!
Matt: Okay. So. (laughs) As you sit and focus, concentrate, you draw out the various arcane glyphs on the ground and focus on Allura. Your vision expands into the sky, (whoosh) rushing through the night air and the spattering of clouds that have amassed over Vasselheim. It fires through the stratosphere, dives down into the center of Emon, into a bedroom. She is currently at a desk and is feverishly writing on parchment. Her hair is tousled a bit and she has a thick robe over her shoulders, and you can see she finishes writing something, rolls it up, seals it, sets it into a pile, thinks a second, casts a spell absentmindedly, it flickers off and vanishes. She goes back to writing. The door opens and you watch as Kima comes in, brings a little tray with some hot tea and sets it down beside her, rubs her shoulder a bit, and Allura looks back at her and nods. You guys are the worst. (laughter)
Matt: Allura puts her face in her hands for a second rubs her temples, She looks tired. Kima leaves the room, and Allura is left there to think for a second, looks out the window of her tower, then goes back to her writing.
Marisha: Okay.
Sam: Was she covered with blood?
Marisha: No, she's fine. She's safe in Emon. So is Kima. They're both safe.
Sam: Skull was next on the list?
Laura: Well, Allura has the skull. Do we have any way to talk to her?
Sam: No.
Marisha: Okay. Should I do Gilmore next? Is that necessary?
Laura: Can you scry on the object? No...
Marisha: I can scry on an object, right?
Matt: An object or a person.
Marisha: Should I do the skull?
Liam: Is it a safe assumption that skull is with her? She's pretty fucking badass.
Marisha: I mean it might just be a lich phylactery or something.
Sam: Who else would have gone into battle against Vecna?
Liam: Well, if it is a lich phylactery, that would be something we would smash to bits.
Sam: Could've been Kash.
Taliesin: Could've been Tary.
Sam: Who? Oh that fancy fellow.
Laura: Oh my god, can you scry on Tary? What if he came searching for us?
Marisha: But Tary was still in--
Taliesin: Just pick a city. Let's just keep looking at people in various cities.
Marisha: Tary... we would feel it.
Liam: Keyleth just spit out an idea. If that skull, which looked like his fucking head. We've dealt with a lich before. If it has even a chance of being a vessel for his life force, even a chance, wouldn't we want to not use it, but destroy it?
Matt: I will impart the information that you did discover that the skull was the skull of a githyanki.
Liam: Oh, that was from 300 hours ago! I misspoke.
Matt: They're a type of people, a race of people that traverse the Astral Sea.
Liam: But it has one eye.
Matt: Oh, it has two eyes.
Liam: Emerald in one eye.
Matt: Yeah, well, the skull shape was alien and was elongated, almost elven.
Liam: That was hundreds of hours ago.
Matt: I wanted to save you circularly arguing about something without some information.
Sam: Oh, we'll still circularly argue about something.
Matt: Oh, I'm sure you will!
Liam: Yeah, this clusterfuck's not over.
Sam: It's been a half-hour of fuckery right here.
Taliesin: A little bit of hemming, a little bit of hawing.
Travis: Wait a minute. Aren't we forgetting about one undead thing? Didn't we want to go back and talk to Delilah's body?
Taliesin: Oh yeah, we're going to have that conversation.
Liam: Is she in your bag?
Taliesin: That's right.
Marisha: She's in the Bag of Colding.
Laura: She might be in the Colding. Let's get into the mansion and talk to her.
Matt: She's in the Bag of Holding.
Laura: Let's go in the mansion first.
Travis: Are we not in the mansion right now?
Sam: We stepped out for a second.
Travis: I never left.
Laura: The door's open. We're talking through the door.
Marisha: Yeah, real quick, I still also want to scry on the Shorecomb.
Taliesin: We're going to set her up so that she's nice and--
Marisha: You guys get her set up.
Taliesin: In a chair and we're going to bind her.
Matt: (laughing) You guys pull the corpse of Delilah Briarwood out of the bag. It hasn't been that long. The body's stiff. A lot of the head is missing. Rigor mortis has definitely caused the body to tighten up a bit.
Travis: Undead gas.
Matt: I mean, limp. The muscles went lax. Okay, so as you guys were propping this up, you complete your scrying on Shorecomb, and what you do is you get a vision of the central area of the city, right near the cliffside. There's these sheer cliffs that drop off for maybe a couple hundred feet and lead down to the gravelly, rocky beach; dark rocks, pebbles, they go out about 30 feet until they hit the water, and that's where they have these wooden steps that wind down the side of the cliff that lead to the docks, and they have winches and cranes that lift heavy objects to and from the docks to get actually into the city. You do see a lot of the trees are very thin, but within the actual city proper, you see a handful of larger trees that at this time, because it's pushing into the end of winter, beginning of spring, a lot of them are leafless, but possible to use your Transport via Plants with. All right, you've propped up your corpse, you've bound it. Pike is, (uncomfortable noise) "Okay..."
Travis: We're right behind you; it's fine.
Liam: It's a good cause, Pickle.
Matt: "Do we have our questions? Do we know what we're going to ask?"
Travis: How many do we get, five?
Liam: Five questions.
Sam: Three? Five?
Liam: Five.
Taliesin: Five.
Matt: I'm going to double check.
Liam: 17.
Taliesin: Was Craven Edge the sword?
Laura: Oh, that's a good one.
Marisha: The sword of Kas.
Laura: Solid question.
Liam: We could ask about Vecna and her buddy that banished Grog.
Laura: The Shadow Knight.
Travis: I'm writing them down in my mind.
Taliesin: What he has done to prepare for the inevitable attempts to re-bind him.
Marisha: Does he have any weaknesses? Is that too broad?
Laura: Does she have to answer? Do they have to answer?
Matt: No.
Marisha: But she might not care, right?
Taliesin: I don't know, we've got a few things we can threaten her with. We can attempt to have her consecrated and buried in the Raven Queen's temple so that nothing will ever bring her back again.
Travis: One more question.
Taliesin: Also, in theory, I think it's possible that I could just send her to hell.
Travis: Do we want to ask where he is? Where he was going? What his plan is after ascending?
Liam: Percy, buddy. You are a married man.
Travis: Where he is or where he's planning to attack first or what his display of power is going to be?
Marisha: Oh sure, because he has to do a display to get followers.
Travis: So we have sword of Kas, bloody knight, what he's trying to do to prevent his binding, weakness/fears, and display of power.
Marisha: Unless the knight was Sylas. I don't know, I guess we'll find out.
Travis: You good with those five?
Taliesin: Yeah. I feel pretty good. I like this plan.
Matt: "Okay." And she gets her holy symbol, takes out her component pouch and begins setting up the ritual for the Speak with Dead spell. It takes her but a moment to invoke it, and her eyes glow, the symbol suddenly shines this column of light onto the corpse of Delilah Briarwood, there motionless against the chair that you've bound the body. The spell, now released, the glyphs on the ground faintly glowing with this energy. Pike reaches out and concentrates. "There's no spirit."
Laura: Oh shit. She's already been brought back.
Matt: "There's no soul to grasp. Either the soul is beyond reach or she's not dead."
Marisha: How many times are we going to have to fight this bitch?
Sam: How? We have her body.
Laura: She's a necromancer.
Sam: I don't know what that means. I'm a holy man. I'm a priest of Ioun. I don't know about the undead.
Travis: Does he got holes?
Sam: My brother, please.
Travis: My son.
Taliesin: Even as a source of information, a source of vengeance, she is a constant disappointment.
Marisha: Can I scry on her?
Matt: Do you have another spell slot to do that?
Marisha: I have three 5th-level spells plus my Scrying Eye that I haven't used yet.
Matt: So if you'd like to, yeah.
Marisha: Yep.
Matt: All right.
Laura: And be sneaky about it, okay?
Taliesin: Wait, do we have to do it outside?
Marisha: Yeah, this is another plane of existence. We have to be on the same plane.
Matt: What's your spell DC?
Marisha: 21.
Matt: You concentrate your vision and focus on the whereabouts, perhaps, of where Delilah Briarwood might be if she was on this plane. Your vision pulls out of your body, rockets once again through the stratosphere, the darkness. It's hard to place direction, but your essence is drawn back down through the clouds, over the center of a rocky mountain range covered in snow and ice. Another flash, and there you are amongst the city of Thar Amphala. There's another flash, and you see a hole in the ground, a large carved tunnel, you see hooded figures, blurry at the edges of this vision, emerging. And there you see, stepping out of the tunnel, Delilah Briarwood, with both eyes. Steps out. Her hood up, pulls it back. She glances off to a direction you can't see and goes, "It's almost ready." A voice comes in through your ear. "Like what you see?"
Laura: I hate him so much.
Matt: Immediately, you pull out of the scrying experience and you look around, your friends are staring at you. You guys didn't hear anything, but once again you hear in your ear once more, "Don't worry, all shall be revealed soon enough."
Marisha: Oh god!
Matt: "Sleep well, young Keyleth."
Laura: What's going on?
Liam: Where did you look? What did you see?
Marisha: There's no safe place to hide. He can see us everywhere. We should go.
Travis: Where?
Laura: You're outside of the mansion. Come in the mansion.
Marisha: What if he comes here? What if he comes here to try and find us and he kills all of these people? What if we led him here?
Laura: He knows. We'll lead him anywhere, darling.
Liam: And Delilah.
Marisha: She's alive. She's at Thar Amphala, both eyes this time.
Taliesin: I was going to ask.
Laura: She'll remove it soon enough.
Marisha: She said, "It's almost time; it's happening soon." Whatever he's doing it's happening soon and then he spoke to me in my vision. He said my name. He knows... She's alive.
Taliesin: I know.
Marisha: How many times?
Taliesin: As many as it takes.
Liam: One more.
Laura: Can you Plane Shift us from here, from the mansion?
Taliesin: No.
Marisha: No.
Matt: No, you can Plane Shift from the mansion.
Travis: Plus, we need to rest.
Taliesin: We have to rest.
Liam: We'll have to do it in the morning.
Marisha: I can burn my 9th-level spell and get us there right now, but we'll lose the mansion.
Taliesin: We need the mansion to sleep. We can't sleep anywhere without the mansion.
Marisha: I can sleep and I can Plane Shift us when we wake up from this mansion.
Laura: Is that a 9th-level spell?
Marisha: Seventh. We could Transport via Plants. And I found a tree to get us to--
Matt: Shorecomb.
Sam: Shorebottom.
Marisha: Shorebottom.
Laura: As awful as it is, we need to sleep, if we can't fight him in the morning or anytime.
Travis: We have to prepare. The tunnels have toxic fumes and all sorts of stuff.
Taliesin: We're going to have to breathe.
Marisha: Go underwater.
Taliesin: We're going to have to figure out a way to survive.
Matt: Deal with poisoned air and breathing underwater.
Sam: No problem.
Travis: You know, like you do.
Liam: Visit the Water Ashari for those--
Laura: Things. Yeah, that's smart.
Marisha: I could also cast Water Breathing on eight of us.
Taliesin: Will that save us from the poison?
Matt: Water Breathing gets you under the water, but you still have poison in the air once you get to the tubes.
Marisha: Yeah, but do the things from the Water Ashari, would those help with poison as well?
Matt: Those help you filter water into air. Poison is a different thing.
Laura: Heroes' Feast.
Sam: Heroes' Feast.
Laura: Immune to poison. We have two chalices.
Taliesin: From the palace.
Sam: Chalice from the palace?
Taliesin: It's the brew that's true.
Sam: Okay. That could work.
Liam: We have to go so many places.
Taliesin: It's going to be all right. We have one advantage that they do not.
Sam: Opposable thumbs.
Taliesin: That too. Only one of us is underestimating the other. We can do this.
Liam: That's a good point.
Sam: Them.
Taliesin: You're fine. We know we have to be careful.
Marisha: The plan then is sleep and then we go to Shorecomb. And then we go under this volcano to the anvil?
Liam: Are we borrowing some water breathing equipment before we go?
Marisha: I can do that to us. I can cast Water Breathing on all of us.
Taliesin: Heroes' Feast, Water Breathing, platinum, and then you're going to hit something with a hammer.
Marisha: Okay.
Sam: Bank in the morning?
Laura: Bank in the morning. Then off.
Marisha: And then through a tree, and then there.
Taliesin: At dawn we bank. (laughter)
Marisha: At dawn we bank. (laughter)
Laura: Fabulous. Shall we rest up?
Travis: Yes.
Sam: One more thing before we go to sleep. Not to draw this out any longer. I'm going to, right before bed, attempt to turn into, using my True Polymorph, one of those fun, winged, tall creatures we met at Pelor's place.
Laura: An angel?
Matt: Turn who into that? Yourself? Yeah, the planetar. You can definitely do that.
Marisha: With True Polymorph?
Laura: You've seen it.
Sam: I've seen it, but I don't know it.
Matt: Are you doing this privately or in front of everybody?
Sam: In my room.
Matt: In your room, you suddenly grow to the size of an 11- to 12-foot, muscular humanoid. Bald head, deep blue skin, with beautiful white angel wings that unfurl for 24 foot, tip to tip length, you feel holy power surge through your body.
Sam: Okay, just wanted to make sure that would work. Cool.
Travis: Do you do anything?
Sam: No, I just stand there naked looking at myself. Anything else that happens in that room, you don't want to know.
Matt: As the winged Dr. Manhattan stands there in his room, staring at his own Manhattan junk--
Liam: So this is what it sounds like when doves cry!
Matt: There's a slow rendition of Hallelujah as you touch yourself for the night. (singing) Hallelujah, hallelujah. (speaking) The wings curl in. All right.
Liam: That was the most home-game moment we've ever had.
Matt: And on that note, we're going to close tonight's episode. (laughs) All right, guys, thanks again for playing, thank you guys for watching. Thank you once again Darin De Paul for coming and guesting, closing Sprigg's story in an interesting way. I wasn't sure how he was going to do that. We'll see you guys next week. Be safe, love each other, and is it Thursday yet? Good night.
All: (singing) Hallelujah! [music]

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hi, everyone! Welcome to Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons and Dragons. Good job, Sam. Thank you for your patience. Sorry we were off last week. I'm doing much better, for those who are worried about it. Happy to be back. Missed you guys, and happy to be back at this table. So yeah! It's been a couple of weeks. Let's go ahead and get into some announcements real fast. First off, tonight we have our fantastic sponsor, Shadow of War!
Travis: Shadow of War! Oh shit!
Laura: Are we allowed to say what we did in it?
Matt: Yeah, a number of us actually worked in the game. It comes out October 10th, actually.
Sam: And the full name of the game is Middle Earth: Shadow of War, for all of those who are looking for it alphabetically.
Travis: The sequel to Middle Earth  Shadow of Mordor.
Sam: Yes, and many of us were in the game yelling our asses off. I played a little character known as Orc 4. It was so much! I did 20 recording sessions.
Travis: I remember talking to you! I was Commanding Orc 1.
Sam: Oh, nice.
Matt: I was Professional Orc 1, as well as the Witch King of Angmar, the head of the Nazgul. I'm pretty excited about that.
Laura: Oh, nice!
Liam: I was Troy Baker's fluffer. It's prestigious.
Sam: You were in it, right? No?
Liam: I'm in the first one.
Sam: Oh, what did you do in the first one?
Liam: The thing I killed two weeks ago? That was me.
Sam: Laura, were you in it?
Laura: I am in it. I play the Blade of Galadriel.
Liam: You play a sword?!
Laura: I know! Get this, so I'm an assassin elf, right? She's really cool. The DLC is going to be about my character.
Sam: Do you have a number after your character?
Laura: No, it's the only one. It's the coolest thing! I don't think I ever told you this. When I saw the character design? She's a combo of Vex and Vax.
Matt: That's pretty great.
Laura: No, seriously, though, she's an elf chick. So she's an assassin. She's got dual-wielding, and she wears feathery armor. It's so freaking cool! So basically, it's like if Vax was a girl, which is Vex.
Travis: But with the sex appeal of Grog.
Laura: Of course, baby.
Matt: I will never forget being at the Shadow of War panel at Comic Con, and you mentioning the DLC and then going, "Has that even been announced yet?" And there was five seconds where I watched Laura wither away into a shell of a human before they went, "Oh, yeah, it's announced." And you reverted.
Laura: Even at this very moment, as I said it, aftershocks. "Was I supposed to say that?"
Liam: They scare you so bad that, even when it's official, I'm like "I'm in the--"
Travis: It's such a dope game. The Nemesis system has been improved on from last time. We can testify.
Sam: We're supposed to mention that on the 18th of this month, Shadow of War will be debuting a brand new live-action trailer that will take you near the game? No! Right into the game. Soon we'll need to choose whether to save or slay. During the break tonight, they're going to be showing off some awesome videos from the game. It drops October 10th. Go buy it and try to pick out our voices in the game as you slay us.
Travis: And make us rise to the higher echelons of the orc order.
Matt: By the way, if you haven't played the previous game, the Nemesis system is one of the coolest things I've played in many games in a long time. I'm going to challenge you guys to try and pick out not only who you voice orc-wise, but then to try and make sure our orcs rise to the very top. So you have nothing but generals from Critical Role. I challenge you for this. Because that would be pretty cool.
Liam: I hope you like hearing the word ranger.
Liam: Ranger!
Travis: Ranger!
Laura: Ranger!
Matt: It's going to be fun. All right, thank you, Shadow of War for being our sponsor tonight. We're excited about the game, and hope you are, too. Also, there's been a lot of insane weather tragedies that have been in the news recently. I want to make sure that everyone knows that if you want to help support relief for both of the hurricanes that have come and torn through the U.S., we have a link to the Red Cross to donate and be part of that. It'll be available in the chat and throughout the rest of the game tonight, so if you have the opportunity to help out, I highly recommend it. Come help these people that have lost a lot in the past couple weeks or so. Give what you can. I've given, and we really appreciate that support.
Travis: They'll let you delineate between Harvey and Irma, too, in case you want to pick one over the other. Harvey had a lot of support from J.J. Watt's $30+ million dollars. Irma, the damage is still accruing.
Matt: I grew up in Florida. I know the area well, and I have family out there that endured it. It's very close to me. So if you can, greatly appreciate it. Let's see here. Merch! Laura.
Laura: This feels so weird to say after you mentioned that.
Travis: Nah, but we make happy stuff.
Laura: Happy stuff! Which, by the way, you're wearing your Dalen's Closet shirt, Matt, and it matches your eyeballs so beautifully.
Travis: Ooh!
Matt: I'll show it to you, and my back brace, to make it really better.
Sam: Are we selling those in the store?
Matt: The back brace?
Travis: Critical Role back brace! Do you DM 20 hours a week? We've got something for you!
Liam: We missed an opportunity to put Backblaze on that back brace. (groaning)
Laura: Next time.
Matt: Next time.
Liam: No next time!
Laura: There are Dalen's Closet shirts in the store. Go check them out. There's tank tops. They're really cool; they're cheaper because they are sleeveless. That's less material. Dagger, Dagger, Dagger; it's been re-released. We have the Scanlan tee; we have all the tees. And it's getting cooler now, so the hoodie is still in the store; the softest hoodie ever is there. Go check it out. We have hats and we have key chains and necklaces and pencils and aprons and tarot cards, and other stuff. And more stuff coming! So keep your eyes peeled.
Matt: Thank you, Laura. Also reminding you guys, we have up to episode 40 of Critical Role now released on iTunes, Google, and geekandsundry.com has all the information for it. So if you want to listen to the podcast, or your friends have been like, "I don't want to watch it, but I just want to hear it."
Laura: I want to watch it, but I don't want to watch it.
Matt: It's good for commutes.
Marisha: Also, clarification, speaking of saying things prematurely before I should have. I've gotten a lot of questions being like, "What happened to that plan of rolling out one a day once a week?" Yeah, that plan didn't turn out to be feasible. And I might have said that-- I said it, and then I looked down at the announcement sheet and it said in parenthesis afterward, "But do not announce this part." Which, why was it even on our announcement sheet? Still my fault.
Matt: To be fair, I remember looking down at the sheet as you were announcing it.
Marisha: Oh shit. Anyway, it's never going to happen because they're easier to do in batch. So ten at a time. That's what you get.
Taliesin: It's like one cookie at a time. You can't bake one cookie at a time.
Marisha: It's just better to do them in a block.
Matt: Thank you for the heads-up on that. We announced a while back the Critical Role six-issue mini-series comic book. We announced last week that it's going through Dark Horse, which I'm super excited about.
Travis: DM is very excited.
Matt: Oh, yeah. Dark Horse was my introduction. I was probably in fourth grade when I got into the Alien comics through Dark Horse. I didn't realize there was more to explore. Dude, I've been a fan of them ever since. Being able to take this into their realm is brilliant. I'm so excited. First issue drops on the 20th, guys.
Marisha: The digital issue. The first issue releases digitally this coming Wednesday.
Sam: Is it good? I haven't read it.
Laura: It's so good!
Sam: Why have you all read it and I haven't?
Marisha: Because you don't read your emails.
Sam: Yeah, that's fair.
Liam: You show up ten minutes after we start, you leave an hour before we end the game every week.
Sam: That's true.
Matt: So that's coming up. It will be on Comixology, iBooks, Dark Horse Digital, Kindle, Nook, Google Play, etc. It's written by our good friend, Matt Colville. It's drawn beautifully by our good friend, Olivia Samson from the Critter community, and the coloring and lettering by Chris Northrop. Super stoked, hope you guys enjoy it. So look out for that next week.
Liam: Looks fucking awesome! The writing is awesome! The art is awesome!
Matt: What he said.
Laura: Did you already say about the physical copies, too? When those will be released?
Matt: We'll have a trade available in spring 2018.
Liam: It's coming out with the DLC for Middle Earth.
Matt: Yeah, to tie in with it. Of course, we have Talks Machina coming up this Tuesday at 7:00pm Pacific, here with our fantastic host, Brian. We'll be talking about our episode tonight. So look for that next week. All the Critical Role episodes are now available on Alpha. They've gone back and added the bells and whistles, the information, the stats, everything, for all the episodes before Alpha even launched. So if you ever watched it there, it's all updated.
Sam: I really should check my email!
Taliesin: We would miss this sense of wonder that we get to share with the community. It's really nice.
Marisha: They get your unbridled reaction.
Taliesin: It's like watching Home Alone next to Macaulay Culkin. It's great. I'm getting so much out of it.
Matt: All righty. Last few things. One  this is Sub-tember, guys, by the way, for Twitch. Sub-tember means for the next few weeks, Twitch has a special promotion where subscriptions are half off for new subs for every Twitch channel, including this one. So if you've been watching and you've always wanted to subscribe, but you never really felt like you can give the full $5, it's half off this month. So if you want to subscribe to our Twitch, now's the month to do it. Just giving the heads-up. It's pretty rad, and thank you, Sub-tember. Last but not least, Laura and Travis, you are going to be at an event soon, aren't you?
Travis: Yeah! End of this month, we're going to be at Anime Weekend Atlanta. The last week of September. Hotlanta, Georgia. We're going to be there with other people like Jennifer Hale and people like that. But we're going to be there. Come out, say hi, smack our hands, not our faces.
Laura: Give a high-five.
Marisha: I love Atlanta.
Travis: It's pretty dope. I want to get in that aquarium with those whale sharks. That's what I want to do. We're not going to have time for that. And then, also, in the middle of November, we're going to be going to Australia. Laura and I are going for two weeks. We're going to be in Adelaide, Brisbane. So for all the Aussies-- what?
Laura: I've got to get my passport.
Travis: Oh shit!
Liam: Expedite!
Travis: So barring Laura's passport showing up--
Matt: You can hear the $400 burn away instantly. That's how much it costs to expedite.
Laura: Oh my god. I'm doing that tomorrow! I'm going to write a note in my calendar.
Travis: (sighs) Adelaide, Brisbane. If you're there, you want to see us, come see maybe just me. (laughter)
Sam: Everybody tweet Laura tomorrow at noon, saying--
Laura: No, but seriously! If you want to, feel free.
Travis: Will Friedle will be there, too. He's going to be my convention wife. Me and Friedle.
Laura: I'm writing an email to myself.
Marisha: Australia? Is that when we got caught with having to have those weird travel visas, as well?
Matt: Yeah. Make sure you get your travel visas.
Marisha: Yeah, we didn't know until we got to the airport. And then they're like, "You have to have one." And then we're like, "Oh, okay." Luckily, you can do it online.
Travis: Oh, I totally have that covered.
Matt: All right. Well, cool, guys! Thank you so much. Thank you for dealing with our long announcements. It's been a few weeks. However, I think, with that, it's time to dive into tonight's episode of Critical Role. [dramatic music]
Matt: Welcome back. I'll remember this. Why's everything targeting Scanlan in this battle? Welcome back, everyone. So last we left off, Vox Machina, preparing themselves for a final fray with the recently ascended god, Vecna, the Undying King, discovered that he had brought the city of Thar Amphala about 300 miles northwest, of Vasselheim on the continent of Issylra. Upon gathering allies to assail this region, you discovered that it was shifting, moving. And apparently the corpse of the long dead primordial earth titan had been risen and began marching its way towards Vasselheim with Thar Amphala embedded at the top of its torso, protected by some sort of magical barrier. With an advance army of wyvern riders at your back and J'mon Sa Ord giving you a ride between their wings, you made your way southward. Quickly depositing yourselves within a waterfall, expelling opening towards the hip of this large titan undead beast, you began to fight your way to the interior. Dealing with corrupted earth elemental shards, you began to make your way through the catacombs, the long ruined and abandoned dwarven city of Thomara, where you encountered the tomb of the dwarven king. Where you also managed to raid the tomb, found a magical item, and dealt with some fun traps in the process. Then, continuing to follow where this route led you upward, hopefully towards the underbelly of the city of Thar Amphala, you uncovered a mostly cleaned out vault and did battle with some undead trolls that immediately rushed in and attacked you. You managed to destroy them, and make your way out through a small cavern that had just momentarily collapsed, clearing out of the way. You all began to squeeze through the opening to find the next length of your journey. And that's where we left off. As you guys all crawl through this recently cleared opening, you come into a partially collapsed cavern about 20 or so feet wide in places with elements of the ceiling fallen in. You can see the rocks that are scattered amongst the ground rumbling with each impact of the feet of the titan you're currently riding within. It seems to be going at a steady incline beginning baseline and then about 20 feet ahead, begin to rise upward to about a 30 to 45-degree angle with the next 25, 30 or so feet.
Sam: How do you play Dungeons and Dragons?
Matt: Two weeks, Sam? It's too much for you?
Sam: I've forgotten entirely what we're supposed to do now. Insight check! I got nothing.
Liam: I'm going to do my due diligence and scoot a little ahead of everybody and start looking for traps or anything hinky.
Travis: Wait, Vax. You should consult that little scrawny NPC fellow that was supposed-- oh, wait. Oh, he's dead.
Liam: Did anybody see that guy?
Travis: Nope.
Laura: Yeah, we did. We saw him.
Matt: Well, you saw the corpse after it was there, yeah.
Liam: Nobody asked me about him.
Laura: No, because you did a good job of killing that.
Liam: That clearly undead cannibal dwarf eating flesh, as I saw it, so problem solved. We're on a time table, yeah?
Laura: We should keep moving upwards, I'm assuming?
Sam: Did we get any items recently?
Travis: No, I picked up that hammer that was hitting me in the face.
Laura: Well, yeah. But Percy, the belt?
Sam: Yeah, what does it do?
Taliesin: Stuff, things. I'm using it right now.
Marisha: Do we need to do a switchery-poo of our items?
Laura: I think we maybe should do that, actually.
Sam: We all have potions, right? Did we pass out potions?
Travis: We all have at least the one superior from the brass dragon.
Liam: Are we going to take a little 20-minute breather here?
Sam: This is just for us to remember what we're doing. I don't know. Should we stop? I think we're on a timetable. We should keep moving, right? Does anyone need to heal?
Marisha: We just stopped, right?
Matt: You'd taken a brief rest after the battle with the trolls where you guys began to look about the inside of the vault. And that's where the part of the exit collapsed.
Travis: I didn't roll any hit dice. Should we roll some hit dice?
Marisha: You dug things out?
Laura: But he was doing something? He was reading, or something.
Sam: Yeah, you were trying to read Dwarvish, or something. And it took an hour.
Travis: I clearly do not remember this. That's right, I remember. I don't remember what I read, but I remember.
Sam: It just said, "Do not enter."
Travis: Yep. There were things.
Liam: We're doing the Vox Machina thing and standing around like a bunch of dumb fucks trying to figure out what to do. I'm going to attune the Deathwalker's Ward to necrotic damage.
Matt: All righty. Necrotic it is.
Travis: We also need to be on the lookout for that sword, remember? In the story?
Sam: The sword of Kas?
Travis: Just saying. Keep your eyes peeled, high-perception people.
Laura: All right.
Taliesin: I literally can't see anything.
Laura: Wait, we have light.
Marisha: (whoosh)
Laura: Yeah, see?
Matt: Between her hand, his dagger, and Pike's mace, you have a few light sources that you guys maintain.
Laura: Pike's mace is lit up. We said that last time.
Matt: But do keep in mind that light sources also do make you a bright beacon in dark places.
Laura: Probably your hands are less noticeable than Pike's mace.
Liam: Oh, I don't know.
Taliesin: I think they would be less intimidated by a glowing mace than by glowing hands, at this point.
Matt: Glowing hands is like a small torch firelight. The Mace of Disruption--
Liam: Is like a headlamp.
Laura: So maybe we'll not have the mace on.
Liam: "Yeah, okay. I'll put this away."
Laura: That sounded just like her.
Sam: She's turning more and more Canadian as you go.
Liam: She's kind of Canadian already. Come on.
Matt: So if I could have a marching order, please?
Liam: Yo. Up front, looking for traps.
Laura: Did you want this acid-resistant armor? You'd at least be resistant to acid.
Travis: And Vex is probably with her brother. I'll be right behind the twins. It's the twins and then me. Who wants to be behind?
Taliesin: I'll be behind you.
Matt: Okay. Do you have Trinket out, Vex?
Laura: Yeah, Trinket is out.
Matt: Percy's after Grog.
Marisha: Me.
Matt: Keyleth, and then we have Pike and Scanlan holding up the rear. All righty, there you go. Have that marked down. How far ahead are you tracking?
Liam: 20 feet.
Matt: So 20 feet ahead, you begin to make your way up the incline, and it is loose rock in this tunnel. As you step, there are elements that skid and fall beneath the pressure of your feet, and you have to be careful as you progress up the incline based on how much it continues upward to keep your footing.
Laura: Brother.
Liam: Yeah?
Laura: Make sure you stay within 60 feet of me.
Liam: I turn around and look at her and go  all right.
Laura: You said you're 20 fucking feet in front of me, I'm using my fucking earring to whisper to you.
Liam: You're stage-whispering and that's very easy to hear.
Laura: Stay within fucking 60 feet of me, all right?
Liam: I love you. Perception check. Investigation for traps? Yeah. That is a 25.
Matt: Okay. No traps catch your attention. As you progress forward, you begin to notice the tunnel seems to be pincering a bit the further you go. The sides of the walls begin to close in and eventually, about 30 feet ahead, comes from the 15, 20-foot width that the initial entrance way into this carved tunnel was, pinches to about three feet wide.
Sam: How tall?
Matt: About five and half, six feet tall?
Taliesin: Is this pressure by design, or is this what's been done to the structure by the transformation?
Matt: You'll probably have to get closer to see. Where you are currently, it looks like part of the tunnel was carved outward and then shaken, and elements of it collapsed and loosened the earth that at one point was packed at the sides.
Laura: And the tunnel's rising steadily upwards?
Matt: Yeah. It's coming at an incline.
Travis: How's it look?
Liam: It's dark up there. I can only see about 60 feet up. Does it keep going beyond that?
Matt: The incline isn't increasing. It gets to about a 45-degree incline and then maintains that up until the outside of your visual range.
Liam: Okay. I'm a punching bag for this shit. Why don't you all wait here a minute. Wait.
All: Wait.
Laura: Do you want me to fly up there?
Liam: Well, will you go with me?
Laura: Of course. Can you not use your wings?
Liam: They're gone.
Laura: Well, then hop on.
Liam: This could be the last time we do this. Come on.
Sam: Oh god.
Liam: Well, there's only four games left, Sam.
Laura: You don't know that!
Liam: It's scripted! (laughter)
Marisha: That's going to be a Reddit thread later.
Laura: Do we have Pass Without a Trace on?
Liam: Yeah, I think that probably faded by now.
Matt: Not if you haven't recast it because after the short rest it would've been gone.
Laura: Should I cast that on us?
Liam: Yes.
Laura: No, wait! I shouldn't because I got a proficiency, so we're both stealthy stealth. We're fine. So we're just going to go. I'm not casting it. But here's the thing. Everybody stay right at the bottom. We're going to fly up, but we're not going to fly up more than 60 feet away from them.
Liam: Right. We'll go 60 feet up, see what we can see.
Laura: And then come back down.
Liam: Sure. Or you could stay there and I could go even further up 60 feet--
Laura: All right. As long as everybody's within 60 feet of me. Because we're getting really close and I don't want Vecna to see us. I've got this ring.
Taliesin: That's right. I forgot about the ring.
Liam: All right. Let's do that.
Matt: So as you guys glide up on the broom, stealthily, I want you guys both to roll a stealth check, please.
Travis: Pick from your fucking 300 dice.
Laura: Ooh, that's good.
Travis: Almost poked my eye out. You almost made me Vecna.
Laura: 30.
Liam: 29.
Laura: 30.
Matt: All right. That's impressive. So as you both quietly coast your way past this entrance way, squeezing into this two and a half, three-foot-wide location, you get just within the 60 foot range and look up and Vax, you step off the broom and make your way quietly up to the other side of the range. You get about 30 feet beyond the broom before your vision meets where this tunnel seems to end and it looks like there is a solid, rocky blockage.
Laura: What do you see?
Liam: It's corked up. It's all right. Yeah, it's blocked up with stone. I guess I'd have to get a closer look to see if we could get through.
Laura: Well, get a fucking closer look.
Taliesin: If we have to, we can just have Grog beat it down.
Laura: Yes, but quiet is the key word.
Taliesin: Is it? We can try and time it to a step.
Liam: Hand on the sides to get my way up closer to it. Looking for any traps.
Matt: Go ahead and make an athletics check as you're climbing up to maintain the strength, as the incline is now towards the end getting more and more steep.
Liam: Get ready to catch me.
Laura: I'm going to hover.
Liam: Yes! My athletics is a two, but I rolled a 19, so 21.
Matt: Deftly, you manage to find the proper handholds and pull your strength up as the final bit becomes a little bit of a upper body weight carrying situation, and you come to the edge of the rock and you see it. It does appear to be a rocky cave-in or larger boulder that has fallen or been placed to close. It looks to be one solid rock, yeah. At this point, the entrance is about four foot by two foot. And it's all blocked by one solid piece of rock.
Liam: Yeah. We're not getting through this. Hey. I'm not getting through this, you're not. Maybe Kiki can.
Laura: Do we see any other openings?
Matt: This would be a perception check.
Sam: Matt, my friends just told me to start paying attention to the cadence of the steps to see if they change in any discernible way.
Marisha: That's what we're doing. While they do that, we're timing the steps out.
Matt: Make a perception check.
Laura: 20.
Matt: 20? Okay.
Taliesin: Ugh.
Marisha: Ugh.
Sam: 15.
Marisha: 15.
Taliesin: 12.
Matt: It's not that difficult to discern the pattern of the steps. The entirety of this titan shifts and quakes with each footfall, so it's pretty easy to find the pattern. It rarely changes, and you imagine any slight shift that you feel as they're going about this is because it's stepping on or through terrain that is not flat. But it is a pretty discernible pattern.
Taliesin: We could go have Grog smash it down in tempo with the steps so that the sound will be covered.
Travis: Like Shawshank Redemption and the poop pipe.
Taliesin: I was thinking of the Tainted Love Levi's commercial.
Laura: Do I see any other--
Matt: Not really. It mostly looks like loose rock and the more you glance about with each impacting footfall, you see two or three errant rocks go. You guys watch as more rocks tumble down the incline.
Laura: Maybe we need to do this quickly. This doesn't seem like the most stable sort of tunnel. Hop on the broom, darling.
Taliesin: I like the idea of you punching this at the appropriate moment.
Marisha: It also saves me a 6th-level spell.
Travis: Well, that's what's most important. Are the Knuckles still doing that vibrating hum thing?
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: Can I go into a rage?
Matt: You may.
Travis: And I would like to try and bash the shit out of this--
Taliesin: In tempo.
Laura: In tempo.
Matt: This is a tight tunnel for you. You have to crouch down, round your shoulders as you're doing it.
Travis: I'm going to do the one-inch punch.
Matt: Make an athletics check. With advantage, because you are raging.
Travis: Yeah, because I'm an angry monster. 21.
Matt: Okay. Here's the scenario  Vex and Vax, as you guys are on the broom in the tunnel, you look down and you know in Labyrinth, when the cleaner comes through the tunnel that fills the entirety of the space? You watch as this angry goliath starts up the tunnel towards you, and there does not appear to be much of any space you could squeeze through.
Liam: Is there a bubble at the top, maybe?
Laura: Grog?
Travis: What? (angry panting)
Laura: Can we pass under his legs or something?
Liam: Dive, dive!
Laura: Rage quietly.
Matt: You can both attempt to. Make an acrobatics check to attempt to squeeze between his legs.
Laura: At the same time? Acrobatics. 22.
Liam: 30-something.
Matt: It's not comfortable, but you both (popping) out the back, between his monstrous goliath thighs. From a backward perspective, those of you who are still waiting a little further down the tunnel from Vex: it's a unique sight, as the back end of your goliath friend suddenly gives birth to two half-elves. It's very Ace Ventura 2. However, you eventually climb your way angrily up to the very edge and there is the boulder, there, and you're about to go right towards it, but then stop and remember what your friends had said, and you wait patiently for the pattern of the next footfall. (boom)
Travis: (punch impact)
Matt: Go ahead and roll an attack.
Travis: Can I make it reckless-- oh, I didn't say it.
Laura: But you do extra damage because you're--
Travis: Oh, yeah, siege. Oh, it's fine. 30.
Matt: Yeah, all right, so roll 1d4 damage.
Travis: Okay, 1d4. Four!
Matt: Plus your strength modifier and your rage damage.
Travis: Eight. 27.
Matt: Whoa, wait, did you double it already?
Travis: No.
Matt: Wait, so it's four plus eight, 12.
Travis: And my rage damage is 15. Well, that's with the axe.
Matt: That's with the axe, yeah. No, that's your overall. So your rage damage at this level is four, because you just went up a level. So it's 12 plus four, so it's 16. So you do 32 points of bludgeoning damage with a single punch to this rock. With one hit, the entire boulder shifts and cracks, and you watch as part of it breaks away, and you see a brief glimmer of a dull light from the opposite side, as it rests back into place, heavily damaged.
Taliesin: (singing) Wait for it to go again and bump, bump, bump.
Matt: You wait for the next footfall of the titan (impact). You feel the impact and the shake. Do you want to go for another punch?
Travis: Do I hit it now?
Sam: Yes!
Taliesin: Yes!
Laura: Yes!
Matt: Roll another attack.
Travis: Oh, that's even better. 33.
Matt: Easily enough. Go ahead and roll another d4.
Travis: Two plus eight. Ten plus--
Matt: Four for rage damage.
Travis: 14.
Matt: All right, and so with that, your fist slams into the boulder a second time. It explodes and shatters into hundreds of crumbled pieces of rock and stone goes firing across the distance of this tunnel, now revealing a little bit of flickering firelight. As you're sitting there seething with anger and your muscles and veins bulging with each breath--
Travis: I'm so swole right now.
Matt: Yeah. You can see above you, this entranceway opens up into a five-foot wide, ten-foot tall hallway that goes to the right and left. As you emerge, it goes a little bit to the right and front, and then to the back and behind you that direction.
Travis: Hey guys, it's a Z.
Laura: What do you see?
Travis: Let me find out. So I wiggle up a little more.
Marisha: So you know the first and last letter of the alphabet? Don't worry about it.
Matt: So you squeeze out of the small entrance way and step up into it. You can see now a well-constructed hallway. You can see there are stone slabs that are carved. The patterns and the angular architecture of this hall as it comes up into a trapezoid position. The hall comes in a bit, and the hallway rooftop is a flat, even surface. This is apparently a hall of dwarven make and seems to be a continuation of some sort of structure or pathway of Thomara.
Taliesin: Let the twins take a look. I think it would be safe.
Travis: It's a well-constructed hallway of dwarvish make. (groans)
Laura: We sneak under his legs again to like see what's going on.
Matt: You guys all eventually make your way up into this hallway. Now, it is still a five -foot-wide hallway, so you're still here in single-file progression one way or the other.
Liam: Twins are already at the top looking for problems.
Matt: Right, so you guys would be able to because it's a ten-foot-tall tunnel. You guys would be able to occupy a space above another party member if you were both on the broom.
Laura: Oh, should we be on the broom? No, you should be off the broom because you might check for traps. I'll check for traps along the wall and ceiling. And he's going to check for traps--
Liam: I'll take the lower half. That's called advantage.
Matt: So go ahead and make and investigation check.
Laura: Both of us or just him with advantage?
Matt: Both of you separately because you're investigating different elements of the hallway.
Liam: 18 for me.
Laura: Investigation? Natural fucking 20!
Matt: As you guys glance up and focus on the surrounding location. The hallway behind you goes for about 30 or so feet before it looks like a cave in. It looks like a mass of fully collapsed, broken stone. You can see bits of the hallway slabs that originally held up that part are collapsed inward and broken, left scattered across the ground. The other direction you go continues on and opens into a dark chamber about 60 feet ahead of you.
Laura: We should go toward the cave in, don't you think?
Matt: There are small built-in sconces that are magically, perpetually burning firelight.
Laura: Does this seem like there's any traps that could be set off as we walk towards the--?
Matt: You do not notice anything, as you were investigating specifically for that.
Taliesin: Check the sconces, see if they trigger something.
Laura: I'll look at the sconces.
Liam: I will look at the sconces.
Laura: I'll look at them better.
Matt: I included that as your perception for traps above. You did not notice anything that would be considered a trap.
Laura: You guys, there's no traps. We should head towards this darkened room.
Marisha: Save a life, check a sconce.
Liam: I'm going to creep about 40 feet down the hall and continue that search.
Matt: About 20 feet before this darkened chamber is there before you. As you get to the edge, you can see a little bit the very inside of this chamber. You can see a darkened brazier. It's your mind playing tricks on you. You thought you heard a raven.
Liam: Every day when I'm on the crapper, Matt. Everywhere.
Matt: A cold metallic brazier in the middle of the room. And that's as far as you can see into the chamber, before the edge of your visual range goes dark.
Taliesin: People don't install those unless there's something awful that needs to be done.
Marisha: Do we have any idea how far we've climbed?
Matt: You can make a nature check.
Liam: And do I need to make a extra roll to look for traps around this brazier?
Matt: If you want to enter the chamber, you can. You're too far away.
Marisha: Hey! Natural 20! That's a Gil 20!
Matt: As you take a moment, and think back to how far you've traveled path-wise and inclines and where you entered this titan and to where the city of Thar Amphala is placed upon its torso, you gather you're close to halfway through its torso, if not a little beyond it.
Marisha: If not a little beyond?
Sam: He's big.
Marisha: Okay, all right. Nipple level?
Matt: Sternum.
Marisha: The heartburn region? A little acid reflux?
Liam: We are the acid reflux.
Marisha: He has acid resistance against reflux.
Liam: Jesus Christ. Whoever that is.
Matt: You scoot up to the edge.
Liam: I don't want to go further than roughly 60 feet away from my sister.
Matt: Right. Which will put you right at the entryway to this chamber.
Liam: Yeah. So I will peep in from here.
Laura: I follow up and stand next to him. Did you want to go in?
Liam: I did.
Laura: Feel free.
Matt: So the marching order is the same? We got the twins up the front.
Taliesin: Yeah. I like this marching order.
Liam: Let this shit blow up in my face, so everybody hang back for a second. And I'm going to pitter patter in and look around the sconce, the room.
Laura: I think I was more stealthy than you a moment ago, so are you sure you want to be in front of me?
Liam: I love you anyway. Here I go.
Taliesin: He's better at blowing up than you are, dear.
Travis: Yeah. His heart beats once a century, so let him go.
Liam: Slower than this titan's footfalls.
Matt: All right. So as you enter the chamber, it's a small, about 20-foot radius square-shaped dark iron chamber with rounded corners. So it's about 40 feet wide from side to side, 20 feet from the center where the brazier is and the corners are slightly curved. It doesn't come to a straight, hard corner. There is no exit door currently visible; the chamber comes to an end. The room looks mostly bare, aside from an eight-foot-tall, five-foot-wide mirror coated in dust, framed in intricate gold and brass that sits across the chamber on the opposite side of where you entered.
Liam: Mirror in brass. So it's an iron room, right?
Matt: Iron room with a brass edge around this eight-foot tall, five-foot wide mirror. You can tell it's a mirror from this side. What little bit of light there is behind you, you can see your silhouette waving mirrored in the mirror.
Liam: So doorway, brazier, mirror.
Matt: Mirror. And then the rest of the chamber seems fairly empty.
Laura: And the brazier is complete dark?
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: It's cold.
Taliesin: Oh no.
Laura: This is not good.
Liam: Look at his fake innocent face.
Sam: I think it's just a vanity.
Liam: Going to check for traps from right here to start. All right. That's totally fine. That's a jellyfish. That is a 17.
Matt: You begin to glance around the chamber, best you can, to take in the scenery. You notice small gold piece-sized buttons or pressure knobs set in the rounded corners of the chamber on the mirror side. One's embedded within the upper left and right corners and within the lower left and right corners.
Sam: Pressure knobs?
Matt: They're like little buttons that are gold piece-sized that are embedded in the upper right and left corners and the lower left and right corners.
Travis: Push them!
Liam: Stubby, come up here. I have a real bad history with pushing buttons.
Matt: You also notice very thin light piles of black residue or ash scattered in places across the floor.
Marisha: Called it. This is a fucking incinerator. I knew it! This feels like an incinerator. No? What? He's looking at me-- (nervous laughter)
Liam: (sighs) So we've got buttons.
Marisha: Or lasers.
Travis: Incinerator or lasers.
Marisha: Laser incinerator! Duh!
Travis: That was a great jump for me and my character.
Liam: If something stupid is going to happen here, I don't want it to be on me alone for once. So we've got an unlit brazier, there's mirror over there, and buttons, yeah.
Laura: Maybe the mirror is a door.
Liam: I thought that, as well.
Laura: Should we try to walk through it?
Taliesin: Maybe a second interrogation room and there's another room behind it, maybe?
Liam: Can we get your hub up here, please?
Taliesin: I am up here. I'm right here.
Liam: Jesus!
Laura: Hi, darling. I don't know why he didn't hear you. You used to be so good at that. Is the mirror leaning or is it on the wall?
Matt: It's on the wall.
Marisha: Is it curved? No. The whole room isn't curved. It's a square room.
Matt: It's a square room but the corners curve ever so slightly so there's no direct corner and in those curved corners on the side that the mirror's on, so the far side from you, there's these little buttons in the upper right and left corner and the lower left and right.
Laura: Can I reach down and touch the iron on the ground? The floor? Does it feel warm?
Matt: Mm. It's cold.
Liam: I catch her wrist. Just a second. You two do the thinking, all right? And I take a step into the room.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: What do I do?
Laura: Go see if you can walk through the mirror.
Taliesin: Tap the mirror.
Travis: Light the brazier!
Laura: We've done that before and we all exploded.
Travis: Yeah, but it's Vax.
Marisha: Wait. Before we do that, can I reach some of the ashy stuff?
Matt: If you enter the chamber to, yeah.
Marisha: Hand me some ash. I'll test it.
Liam: I scoop some ash. Lady of the Grey Hunt, here. I scoop up some ash and I pour it into her hands.
Marisha: Okay. I do a nature check. What does this ash feel like it's made out of?
Sam: Human bones.
Marisha: Yeah, that's what I'm wondering. (groans)
Taliesin: Wow.
Laura: No. What is it? (groans)
Travis: Is it for real? You are lying!
Liam: Look at that face! You are not lying!
Marisha: Oh man. That's a one. Thanks, Gil. I blame Gil for his natural 20 in the balance of the universe.
Matt: It's light ash. You're not sure what the basis of what may have burned here. You see more of it gathered near where the brazier is.
Taliesin: Is it in piles that would be about human-amount of ash?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Taliesin: All right. I'll Gil this one. Yeah, natural 20. That'll do.
Sam: Only ones and 20s tonight.
Liam: That's it, yeah. Just quarters. Heads up, heads down.
Matt: More of it seems to be around the base of the brazier, but you do see there are thicker traces at different places throughout the chamber.
Taliesin: It's organic ash?
Matt: You've dealt with different types of ash. The carbon appears to have been organic-based at some point.
Liam: I pull off my belt and say  Hello, Simon. Wake him up.
Matt: Okay. (slithering)
Liam: Hi. Gosh, it's been a while.
Laura: Simon, go through the mirror.
Liam: That's right. Go check out the mirror, Simon, all right? Off you go.
Travis: Are we still in the room?
Laura: No, nobody's in the room. He's the only one in the room.
Matt: (slithering) Scoots over and heads up to the mirror and presses up against it.
Liam: I dart back one step out of the room as it happens.
Matt: The snake trying to push up against the wall but half of its body sliding against the mirror before it eventually scoots off and lands. It tries again, pushing against the mirror and then eventually (sliding).
Taliesin: I hate to say this, but tap the button?
Liam: That's on the list. Simon, buddy. Crawl up the brazier. Wrap around it. Go up to the top.
Matt: The snake slithers around and makes its way. It's a cross-metal cage. There are inch wide metal bars that all curl up like a basket and then there are bars that cross around it to hold the shape. It looks like there are some long-burned, blackened pieces of wood that have been left for a long time. So Simon curls up into the brazier and curls up around the metal, comes around the top of the outer rim of it, rests there.
Liam: There's two buttons low down. Oh man. The nostalgia here. All right, buddy. I take two steps back away from the door. Buddy buds. Will you go push those low buttons in the room?
Matt: Which one?
Liam: There's two, right?
Matt: There's four on the opposite side.
Liam: There's two high up. And I don't think he can reach the high, because he doesn't stick to walls. Get the one over here on the left first.
Laura: What if we all have to push every button at the same time?
Liam: That's true. That could be.
Matt: Simon (slithering) moves over.
Liam: I lean over to Percy, I say  science!
Matt: Hits the button. (click) Right on the entrance of where you are in the chamber, slams closed. Iron metal now closes off that entranceway.
Taliesin: I'm going to touch the door.
Sam: And say goodbye.
Taliesin: Simon, we barely knew him. Is it warm?
Matt: It is beginning to get warm.
Taliesin: It's an oven. I'm looking for some sort some sort of cancel mechanism somewhere on the outside of the door.
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Sam: Is Vax in the room?
Liam: No, I took two steps back from the door.
Laura: No, nobody's in the room.
Taliesin: Let's say that investigation was somewhere around a seven? (laughter)
Matt: It's pretty solid at this point. The walls that lean in towards the ceiling there-- it is a perfect solid iron slab that has closed off at the entrance.
Travis: No problem. I'll get it down.
Laura: No!
Liam: Wait. Simon is technically a magical item, so I don't think he would be harmed by anything going on in there, so why don't we give it five minutes?
Marisha: And maybe it'll open again.
Liam: Yeah.
Travis: Is there anything going on in the tunnel, on the outside of this door, where we are?
Laura: Coming up from behind us?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Travis: Temperature check, anything like that? Natural 20.
Taliesin: We have been gone so long!
Matt: Gone for two weeks and you guys can't find middle math. It's only extremes.
Liam: Yeah, we've had blue balls for two weeks, and it's all coming out now.
Matt: So as you guys glance back in the shadow of the tunnel behind you, nothing seems to be catching your eye. It's still dark. About two minutes in, what was once dark metal is now giving a slight orangish hue. You can feel the heat emanating from it.
Travis: There's no ash on the floor in the hallway that we are in right now, right?
Matt: I'd say, because of your perception check, as you glance around, there does not appear to be any ash.
Travis: I don't want that door to fucking open all of a sudden.
Matt: About five minutes go by as you guys are waiting. Eventually, the iron wall begins to descend. The dull orangish glow of it is still there. As it opens, a wave of heated air emerges from the chamber. You all have to immediately close your eyes. Some of you instinctually begin to step further back into the hallway. On the inside of the room, you can see the black iron interior of the chamber is also that same orangish glow. The mirror is unscathed. You all step back and watch and a few minutes pass as it slowly begins to cool off, the metal slowly darkening. You're too far away to look. You make a perception check to try and glance in?
Laura: Can't you call to him?
Liam: Simon? Come here, buddy.
Matt: There's no response.
Liam: (gasps) He's a magical item! Oh, but he could have turned back into a belt.
Taliesin: What's he going to say if you call to him? Was he going to say something?
Liam: He would come to me, Percy! Jeepers creepers! Perception check? 29!
Matt: You glance past where the button was that it hit. You see a limp belt left on the ground.
Liam: Okay, I'll get that in a minute.
Laura: When you go pick him up and put him back on your fucking waist.
Matt: Technically, since Simon's taken enough damage to revert to the belt form, Simon cannot turn back into a snake for the day.
Laura: How about that unseen servant?
Liam: I'm thinking, having no knowledge of magic, that we either want to somehow push all four of these buttons at once, as my sister said, or light this brazier, or both.
Laura: What about the brazier? Is it cold? Does it look like it's hot?
Sam: The brazier's the source of the furnace, I assume.
Travis: Are there still charred wooden pieces in the middle of it?
Matt: The pieces are still there, but it's black carbon. There's nothing in there that could burn. Whatever's been in there has been heated so much to the point--
Travis: It's not the source of the flame. Not for that much heat.
Marisha: If I was the person who designed this, why would I put a failsafe in here?
Liam: A way to get through that only the creator would know how to use?
Marisha: I feel like there's got to be another entrance because we can see another room, right?
Laura: There's no other room, it's a mirror. Oh, Keyleth, that's our reflection.
Marisha: No, I know that, but a lot of things have reflections.
Liam: Listen, all of you, or I, are going to be dead very soon. Are you sure you want to be that sarcastic right now?
Marisha: I go up to the mirror and check it out. It's cooled off enough, right?
Matt: Well, no. If you guys want to take a few minutes, you can wait until it cools off, if you want to.
Taliesin: Why don't we try pushing all four buttons at once?
Sam: Wait, before we do that, I'm going to enter the room and look around at the walls and the ceiling.
Matt: Okay, I take it you wait until it cools off. It takes about ten minutes or so for it to fully cool off, to the point where it's comfortable.
Sam: I'm looking for markings, indications of instructions, arrows, any hidden words--
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Travis: Look for Dwarvish. I'm aces with that.
Sam: Ooh, a lot. 29.
Taliesin: He's coming up with some bullshit.
Matt: Okay. Because the room is not fully cooled off, it's still warm in there, somewhat. You glance through. The ceiling and the walls all appear to be solid iron, and there's a layer of dust across a lot of it, a bit of ash from whatever previously may have been incinerated in here, long ago. As you look from the opposite side of the room into the reflection of the mirror, you see a very faint orangish glow in the reflection. It looks like, in the upper corner and the lower corner of the opposite side of the mirror as you're glancing off across to the other side. As you look over to the wall, of the room you're in, there's no glow.
Sam: Wait, so the wall that we came in through?
Matt: Let's say you enter the chamber and you move to the corner immediately to your right. You look in the mirror at an angle. You're now seeing the reflection of the corner opposite to you, right? Looking in that reflection, you can see this very faint orange glow in the upper and lower corner, but you glance over to the physical corner across from you, and it's not there.
Laura: What do your gnomish eyes see, Scanlan?
Sam: I think there's magical buttons in here and we need to find them? So I'm going to look in the mirror. I go to the opposite corner and do the same thing.
Matt: As you have this conversation and look back, those two glowing sigils are gone.
Sam: Even in the mirror?
Matt: Even in the mirror. What you saw earlier is now gone.
Travis: But they're revealed by heat.
Marisha: Where were they?
Sam: They were upper and lower corner, yeah.
Marisha: I walk over and I heat them with my heat hands.
Matt: Okay, so you take your hands and you put them up near there. As you put your hands on the wall, nothing seems to happen. As you glance through the reflection where she has her hands, that symbol seems to be appearing again.
Laura: What is the symbol of?
Sam: It's so far. I don't know. Can I see it?
Matt: It looks to be a simple triangular symbol, marked in a circle. Make an arcana check.
Sam: Oh yeah. 14 plus six, that's 20.
Matt: It's the most basic of arcane marks. It's a variation on a spell that basically is a mark that a certain enchanter or somebody places to mark as their own. However, this is meant to be a basic marker, a visual draw. There's no language behind it. It's just an indicator.
Sam: Keyleth, do that same thing to the lower one. Same marking?
Matt: As you head down there, the one above begins to slowly fade. As her hands go there, the symbol appears below.
Sam: Same symbol? Let's do that to the other walls and see if we can find other ones.
Matt: As you guys reverse, opposite sides, you go to the other corners, the ones that were immediately toward the entrance of where you walked in. Sure enough, two more symbols, mirroring where the buttons are on the far side corners.
Sam: So we push those? But there's a hidden button in there.
Travis: When you're a big fire, the walking thing--
Marisha: A fire elemental.
Travis: Sure. Do you take damage from fire? So you should be in here.
Laura: You should go in there, see if you can disengage the trap.
Liam: So you are impervious to being set on fire or burned?
Marisha: Well, when I'm a fire elemental.
Laura: Can you do that?
Marisha: Can I do it right now? Yeah. I just took a short rest, so yes, I can do that.
Travis: We also have an unseen servant.
Sam: So we're going to need four people.
Marisha: So what's the end goal? What am I doing?
Liam: Press all four buttons at once, although we've got at least three sharpshooters--
Sam: Not the buttons that we can see. What are these symbols here? I think they're buttons, as well.
Travis: It might be a depression on the wall or something.
Marisha: But what if the buttons are correlated with the symbols?
Taliesin: Let's try pushing all four buttons.
Travis: The regular buttons or the magic ones?
Liam: Please stand by.
Laura: I want to go look at where the symbol is and see if it's a fucking button.
Marisha: Yeah, if I touch the symbol, there's nothing there, right?
Sam: Was there anything there?
Matt: You put your hand on there. Nothing. The wall doesn't move.
Marisha: It's just a wall.
Travis: No depression, no toggle?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Travis: I've got this, you guys. Oh! Minus two. 17!
Matt: 17. Grog, as you step up and glare down at the place where Keyleth had placed her palm, you get frustrated and (sighs heavily). As you exhale, it looks like a bit of soot and ash that had been slowly drifting in and filling this space flutters away. You can see two lines, parallel to each other, about an inch tall.
Travis: Fifth Element, anyone? Oh look! Breath of Grog reveals all! Look, behold! Two. Lines.
Laura: What did you do?
Travis: I breathed on the wall.
Sam: What do they do? What do these lines do?
Marisha: I do a quick Gust cantrip.
Matt: Across the parallel lines? All right. As the wind blows across it, a lot more of the soot and the ash blows around the area. It creates an open space where it pushes out to the edges and darkens areas of the floor and the vicinity around Keyleth. That edge of that corner, where you blew the Gust cantrip that Grog had unfurled, is now clear, the iron revealed. Nothing beyond the two.
Laura: I fly up on my broom and do it to the symbol up on the corner and go (blowing).
Matt: Okay. So up there. You blow on that one and it looks like--
Marisha: Hang on, I've got a paper ready.
Liam: How many people at home do you think have figured this out already?
Laura: We already figured it out!
Sam: Wait, you guys are blowing on the arcane symbols?
Laura: Yeah, to clear them out!
Travis: If you're looking at the door we came in, Grog blew on the lower right?
Sam: And that's two lines. Boom.
Matt: That would be lower right.
Travis: Two vertical lines.
Matt: Correct.
Laura: I'm in the corner above Grog.
Matt: That would be upper right.
Taliesin: I'm going to do bottom left.
Matt: All right, you blow, and you watch as the dust reveals. It's two more lines.
Laura: Two lines? Shit. I thought it was going to be another--
Taliesin: Bottom left. Getting out a hanky and (blows).
Liam: Did you use your ascot?
Taliesin: Yes, of course. That's what it's there for. The back of it.
Laura: The one clean spot left on it.
Matt: That one has four parallel lines.
Laura: Ooh! I'll go into the corner above Percy. There was a reflection there, too, right?
Sam: Blow! Laura, blow!
Laura: (blows) I looked straight at the camera as I did it. It was really awkward.
Matt: All right, that one has a single line.
Sam: Wait, so we've got one, two, two, four?
Laura: Is there one with three lines, or are there any more areas we saw a reflection?
Travis: What about above the door? It is opposite of the mirror, right? If one's a door, and the other one's a door?
Laura: Okay, I'll blow above the door.
Liam: And I'm going to start blowing around the mirror.
Laura: We all walk around going (raspberries).
Travis: Constitution check to see who passes out first?
Matt: What was that?
Taliesin: Does the mirror have a fancy frame?
Matt: It's not extremely intricate, but it looks like there's a brass or bronze frame around it.
Taliesin: Are any of these symbols mirrored in the frame itself? Is there a mirror of any of these symbols in the frame?
Matt: As you look in the actual frame itself, you don't see anything that matches the symbols.
Laura: What if these are numbers and the order you have to push the buttons?
Sam: Except we have two twos, and no three?
Laura: I know. One, two, four!
Taliesin: No, because you have to hit one, and then you have to hit the two together--
Sam: And then why not three? Okay, all right. Can we do a sweep for more?
Travis: Can I clear off the door area that we walked through?
Matt: So Grog, you go through, (rapid blowing). Blowing around. Okay. Make an investigation check.
Marisha: I take my mantle and start doing a--
Matt: You clear that archway very well, around the door. You do reveal Dwarven runes on the upper right corner, upper left corner, lower right, and lower left corner of the doorframe.
Travis: I only know Dwarven writing. I don't know runes.
Matt: Well, the runes are part of the Dwarven language.
Travis: The runes are part of the Dwarven language, so I know them.
Laura: Pike goes over and she helps you.
Travis: Help me, Pike! Yeah, I would like to decipher what these symbols mean.
Laura: "If you lift me up, I could see the ones above the door!"
Liam: "Yeah, the last time I wanted you to do it on your own, but I think we're pressed for time."
Travis: I hold her up to the upper left corner of the doorway.
Matt: Okay, so turning around, upper left corner. Okay. That one is the Dwarven rune that represents the number three.
Travis: Three. All right. Now, to the upper right-hand corner.
Matt: That is the number one.
Travis: Okay. I put her on the ground and I say, okay, look at the lower right-hand corner.
Matt: So lower right-hand corner would be a two.
Travis: And now the lower left-hand corner.
Matt: A four.
Laura: Oh, yeah! We know! That's the amount of times you have to push the button!
Taliesin: So one-one, two-two-two-two, three, four-four.
Sam: Possibly.
Laura: Wait, I think we reversed it.
Liam: How long does your unseen servant last?
Sam: Not too long.
Liam: How long? An hour? Ten minutes?
Sam: I'll look in my memory. One hour, but I have to be close to it. How big is this room?
Matt: It's a 20-foot radius from the center of the brazier, so it's 40 feet on each side.
Taliesin: Is our physicality of this map correct? If we show you this?
Liam: Well, I have this jar. It's an oil of etherealness. You could potentially be standing in here, but not be in here. Lasts an hour, though. Same time gap as your friend. You could stand in here and not be in here.
Sam: From the doorway to the mirror, is it less than 60 feet?
Matt: Yes.
Sam: Oh, then I can be out of the door. Am I right with what I wrote down there?
Matt: All right, so this is the-- facing from the inside--
Sam: Yeah, from the brazier-- Frasier Crane. Looking at the door that we came in. Right?
Matt: I'm going to have to draw you one. I think you guys got confused on that one.
Laura: I think me and Travis got it right.
Sam: I think, Matt, you're wrong.
Travis: I have the same thing as Laura.
Liam: I'm pretty sure it's up up down down left right left right A B A B.
Laura: I hope we passed the test.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Did we get it right?
Matt: There, that's what you get! Sorry, I'm limited in my reach right now.
Marisha: I love that we all did something similar but all wrote something different. We're like, numbers, somewhere!
Matt: Yep, almost. Almost.
Marisha: Did you help us, or are you just saying "almost?"
Matt: I'm saying, looking back and seeing where the numbers lie and the runes in there, you have the correct configuration.
Laura: (victorious laughter)
Marisha: I think this is right. I think you have this. I think I have the right part of this and you have the right part of this.
Laura: We'll copy it and you can see what the fuck is correct.
Travis: Yes.
Laura: No, this is wrong. I'm just going to draw it. (counting)
Sam: Guys, Shadow of War! It's a great game by-- I don't know, who makes it? Warner Brothers!
Laura: Okay, so now we know the order to push the buttons and the amount of times to push the buttons.
Sam: Yes, so now we've just got to do it.
Travis: Should we check around the mirror frame to see if there's anything to dust off? The mirror frame?
Taliesin: I gave it a little bit of a rub.
Marisha: I'm going to go up and go tap-tap-tap on the mirror.
Matt: Okay. It taps.
Travis: Can I wipe off the edges around the frame and see if there's anything around the frame of the mirror, since I seem to be so good at this?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Travis: Three.
Matt: Three. You smear a bit of ash, but eventually get some semblance of shine through. Nothing catches your eye.
Travis: It's clear. We found everything there is to find.
Marisha: Grog draws boobs on himself in the reflection out of the ash.
Sam: All right, should we leave the room and have Mr. Invisible start tapping buttons? All right, we'll do that.
Laura: We step just outside the door again and let his invisible servant push buttons.
Liam: (singing) Scanlan Man, Scanlan Man. Does whatever a Scanlan can. Makes a guy, pushes buttons, Scanlan Man-- I'm out.
Taliesin: Look out!
Liam: (singing) Here comes the Scanlan Man.
Marisha: (singing) Here comes the Scanlan Man.
Taliesin: (singing) Here comes the Scanlan Man.
Sam: Would a person who cannot fly be able to touch the top buttons?
Matt: Nope.
Sam: Shit.
Travis: Well, there's no saying that it will activate if we do it correctly.
Liam: Also, what about shooting the button or firing an arrow at a button?
Laura: Yeah but the buttons are on this side.
Taliesin: How high up are the buttons?
Matt: The buttons? The top are about ten feet up.
Taliesin: So if he had something that was-- if he had a mop, basically, he could probably tap it.
Laura: The buttons are on the side of the mirror, so we could shoot arrows at them.
Taliesin: But only if we're in there and then we don't need an unseen servant to do it.
Sam: Want to give him a pole or something?
Taliesin: Let's give him a stick.
Sam: Do we have a stick in the bag?
Travis: I have a lance.
Taliesin: Yeah, he has a lance.
Travis: It's almost broken.
Taliesin: My god, it will finally be useful one last time.
Liam: We do have three trammels.
Taliesin: No! We are not disengaging a smoke alarm with a fucking trammel. There is a limit!
Travis: You have a slightly splintered lance.
Laura: Okay. Let's hit buttons. Let's do it! Let's get through this room.
Taliesin: Let's explain to the unseen servant what he's supposed to do.
Sam: Matt, can he hold a lance, or is that violating some-- he's not allowed to hold weapons.
Matt: He can hold them. He can't attack; he cannot be a combatant. It can hold things for you.
Liam: He's like a Kids in the Hall character.
Matt: Kind of, yeah. You're not wrong.
Sam: I conjure an unseen servant, whom I will name Simon Two.
Taliesin: Electric Boogaloo.
Liam: Not cool, man, not cool.
Matt: All right. There's this brief shimmer, and you watch as a bit of ash displaces on the ground where two footfalls (landing noises).
Sam: All right, Simon Two, take this lance. We're going to go tell you what buttons to press over there, good speed-- good speed? (laughter)
Sam: Godspell. You'll be fine. Hope you don't like burning alive. So you tell me what to tell him, because I don't have the paper. Upper left? Upper right? What do we start with?
Marisha: It's this. Tell him to do this.
Laura: The reflection of that.
Sam: Okay, so two upper right. Two pokes. Oh, wait.
Laura: So the upper left corner from where we're looking.
Sam: Yes, we're going to go mirror image of this, so project that across the room.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Oh, that was the mistake.
Matt: Okay, so pressing the upper left twice.
Sam: Yes, mirror image of this, so upper left. Let's try that.
Matt: Heads over, holding the lance. You watch the lance wobble, and it misses a couple times, (clicking) hits the button, and it clicks inward. The lance is pulled back and the button presses back out outward into its position.
Sam: Any door?
Matt: No door.
Laura: We'll know if we push it again then we did it the wrong order.
Matt: Second time, (clicking) pulls off, the button depresses.
Taliesin: All right, keep going.
Sam: So below it, two presses.
Laura: In the corner, bottom corner.
Sam: Just like your name, Simon  two.
Matt: (clicking)
Sam: Okay, opposite corner, up. One press.
Laura: Upper right-hand corner.
Matt: (clicking)
Sam: And then below that, bottom corner. Four presses.
Matt: (clicking) (laughter)
Matt: The fourth one hits. There's a moment of pause, and the mirror shimmers faintly. You watch as, almost like a stone thrown into the middle of a still pond, begins to ripple from the center, and as it ripples, each ripple seems to fade, until eventually the five-foot-wide mirror is now an oval portal that leads to darkness behind it.
Laura: Let's go in!
Marisha: I told you there was a room behind the mirror.
Travis: Yeah, let's go. Hurry! We don't know how long it will stay open for.
Sam: Simon Two is coming with us.
Matt: Okay. You hear the faint footfalls of sound behind, and Trinket takes a moment to try and squeeze through this small entranceway. Trinket had a hard enough time getting through the incline. (moans) Into the necklace. You make your way through the opposite side, and as you all step through, the portal remains open for at least a moment.
Laura: Hey, we did it, guys.
Sam: We beat a door.
Travis: We beat a door.
Marisha: Guys, it took 111 episodes, but we bested a door.
Liam: The last episode of the third campaign will be a door that we do not open.
Matt: So the darkness you step through leads into a ten-foot-wide hallway of similar dwarven stone. Same slightly angled hallways about ten feet tall or so, about five or six foot wide. You get a few steps in and about 20 or 30 seconds after you guys make your way in, the mirror portal behind closes up.
Liam: Can we see?
Marisha: Can you see through it?
Matt: Through the mirror?
Liam: I meant where we are. Are we in pitch black?
Matt: You're in pitch black, but you guys with darkvision can see there is a staircase not too far, maybe ten feet from where you stand into this next hallway.
Travis: Iron stairs? Stone stairs?
Matt: Stone stairs.
Liam: I've got a dagger out.
Matt: All right, lights up briefly and you get a little bit of a vision beyond that, and it's gradual stone steps. They're not too wide; they're made for dwarven gait, so there are many steps that are relatively shallow.
Travis: These are dwarven steps that are relatively shallow.
Sam: We can see it, Grog.
Liam: Pike says, "That's actually right".
Laura: Is there any traps?
Matt: You're welcome to search for traps.
Liam: And I'm going to scoot 40 feet up the stairs and look as I go for traps. One. I'm taking it, but I'm still going and looking for traps.
Matt: You do have reliable talent, don't forget.
Liam: Does that oversee ones? Because I've been counting ones as ones for a long time.
Matt: The reliable talent as a rogue specifically says any roll lower than a ten you take as a ten.
Sam: Any roll?
Matt: Well, not any roll. Any ability check he has to make.
Liam: Okay, well, we wrongly assumed that ones and 20s were king, but no.
Laura: So he rolled way better than me because I rolled a ten.
Liam: That's an 18. My one is an 18 now.
Matt: Yeah, because that's one of the cool things about rogues. You guys make your way up about 45, 50 or so feet up the stairway, you keeping an eye out, no traps, nothing catches your eye as iffy or strange, and the stairs now switch back into another set. It's a small landing and then it continues upward.
Liam: Okay, but I'm only going to go 40 feet in advance. That's like ten fucked rolls of mine from the past 30 games! Anyway, I love it.
Marisha: So it's a big 180, going right up?
Matt: Yeah, it's a switchback. The staircase ascends, then there's a landing, and it continues upward and around.
Laura: Do we hear anything?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Taliesin: I'll join in that perception.
Matt: So you're joining them up the staircase?
Taliesin: I'm behind. You know, the standard--
Matt: All right, so you guys are keeping up.
Marisha: Did you fuck the roll, too? Oh, what the fuck!
Taliesin: I got a 25.
Matt: Seriously, welcome back after two weeks and people just cannot-- wow.
Liam: But do you remember when we were at home and we'd go six weeks without playing and we'd spend 45 minutes trying to remember what we did, how the rules worked, what our names were, who you were.
Taliesin: Vex is right.
Travis: 25, you said?
Taliesin: 25.
Matt: 25. Okay. It's hard to discern what shifting in the distance is not the rumbling from the ever-occasional titan footfalls, but nothing seems to catch your attention. Occasionally, you hear dislodged rocks and stones clacking across the stone floor and the steps, and every now and then you catch a stone or two fall past and eventually come to rest either near or below you. You continue up the switchback stairs and lead into a third switchback that continues upward.
Liam: 40 feet in advance.
Marisha: We are following behind.
Laura: Are you looking for traps as you go, brother?
Liam: I am. That is an 18, anyway.
Marisha: I still have my hands guiding Percy, our blind human.
Matt: Leading the old man forward.
Taliesin: (old man voice) Where's Steven?
Marisha: (laughs) Where's Steven?
Matt: You do not find any other traps. There's no other issues that worry you upon this climb. You do eventually come to the top of the third switchback stairway and it leads you into a slight curved cavern. The stairs stop and it leads into a continuation of the dwarf-like hallway structure that you had below, but it is curving around now, in sections. I would say, as opposed to a gradual curve, the design in the structure here has a very rigid, geometric shape, so the curvature is in sections.
Liam: Yeah, I appreciate it as I go, and I look for traps.
Matt: All right, go for it.
Liam: Love it. That's an 18.
Matt: Okay. Coming around the edge  no traps, no plates. Nothing catches your attention. However, this tunnel comes to an end, and it opens up into a larger crevasse than the one that you previously saw that held a number of city buildings of the remains of Thomara. It looks to be about 100 to 120 feet tall, you assume, from the bits of the stalactites that you can see, barely reaching the edge of your visual range. Very faint bit of light here, bioluminescent fungus in a dull orangish color that dots the edges of this interior chamber.
Liam: And is it like where I killed that motherfucker? They were built into the cliff face, right?
Matt: Yes. This one is larger than the one you were in before, and you can see just beyond your visual range, a number of these buildings, partially crumbled in some places, some still standing obstinately against the ever-shifting interior of the titan's form, the chamber curling upward as the ceiling crawls higher and higher just beyond your visual range, and you can faintly see the images of dozens of thin bridges that weave over themselves across different levels, up into the higher portion.
Liam: I want to confirm an intuition and use my last Divine Sense and feel undead.
Matt: Okay, what's the range on that one?
Liam: 60 feet.
Matt: 60 feet? You do not sense any undead within the 60-foot range.
Marisha: I think we're in the lungs. I think we're in its chest cavity.
Liam: Speaking into the earrings; they're all behind me. I think we're in a more populous place with the undead cannibals, know what I mean? There's a very large cavern in here and a lot of room.
Taliesin: I'd be grateful if anyone got a sample of that bioluminescent fungus.
Marisha: I can get that. I'm interested.
Laura: Do you want me to fly up and get some?
Liam: We're on a schedule here.
Marisha: Well, if it's on the way. We have to go that way.
Laura: We have to go up, right? Does it look like there's openings in the ceiling?
Matt: Well currently you're the only one who's stepped into this entrance to look up, the rest of you are now exiting into the chamber.
Liam: I'll wait, obviously. Nothing's going to explode on my friends, so they catch up with me.
Matt: Okay, so they're all behind you now where this entrance is, and as you look past it, this hallway that you're entering, it looks like there was a doorway here. There was some sort of hinge on the edge that held a door that had since been broken or toppled forward. You can see pieces of the door that once held this entranceway, and a number of the buildings immediately to the right and left. That's where you stand, what do you want to do?
Laura: Does it look like there's any footprints coming in and out of the doorway that we came from?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Travis: Can I look for a doorknob or a keyhole?
Liam: Everything we were told is that this place is full of undead cannibals.
Laura: 23.
Matt: Not in a long time.
Travis: Is there shattered remnants of the door?
Matt: Yeah, you see a couple of shards here and there--
Travis: Any doorknob or a keyhole that's on the ground or anything?
Matt: Make an investigation check. Lot of investigation checks today.
Travis: Two.
Matt: You scramble about and find a couple of pieces that might be, but no, it's just more stone.
Marisha: Can I see any stairs carved in the side, in the walls, trying to head up to this-- is that what you just checked?
Laura: No, that's what I was about to look for, too.
Liam: Is there any movement, because there's bioluminescent shit on the walls in here, so there's a little bit of light, right? Yeah. 26.
Matt: 26. As you glance about-- once again, your vision, because there is very little light in here and the very, very faint bits of fungus in the distance that give you a sense of the shape of this entire chamber. There isn't enough light for you to make out any shape beyond the exterior of your visual range, so you can't really tell.
Liam: A second thing I want to look for is what other exits from this gigantic cavern. Ways through, up. Yeah, you looked, but I didn't look.
Matt: Let me finish what I was saying first.
Travis: Roll! Roll again.
Matt: But based on the size of this chamber and the bits of what small elements of structures that you can see of the architecture within, this definitely appears to be more of the heart of the city of Thomara when it was once at its ancient height. You can see at the very edge of your visual range a cracked central fountain that is empty and dry, and you see, just beyond your range, the exterior of a large temple-like building that rises out of the ability to see any more of its height and structure.
Taliesin: Temple.
Matt: But like I said, you guys are still standing at the entrance to this cavern.
Marisha: What about the temple? Why?
Sam: Want to fly through here? Can we fly?
Liam: I don't think we want to stay here--
Sam: I know, that's why we just fly through.
Liam: Find another exit, yeah, but where?
Travis: I'd like to see the temple, if I can.
Sam: What are you talking about?
Travis: Well look, all right, my gloves--
Laura: Keep your voice down.
Travis: (whispering) My gloves come from the heart of a ruined primordial titan. So if maybe they harvested pieces of my gloves, and it's in a temple, I don't know, you smart people could do something with that.
Liam: Right, what's your plan? You expect us to come up with a plan to explain why your gloves are connected to that temple, and you're going to get what? A Mighty Morphin Power Ranger bonus for doing so?
Travis: Yes.
Marisha: Are your Titanstone Knuckles exalted yet?
Travis: Yep. They're just buzzing.
Liam: Yeah, are they still dildoing on your fingers?
Marisha: Are they buzzing more?
Travis: Are they humming more?
Matt: Doesn't appear to have changed.
Travis: Nope, just humming.
Marisha: Step two steps closer.
Travis: Two steps closer to the temple.
Marisha: Do they appear to be buzzing more?
Travis: Are they appearing buzzing more?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Travis: Ooh! 19.
Matt: Not bad. Nope.
Taliesin: Is the temple on the way? Does it make sense to cross through the city, or does it make sense to fly up?
Liam: We're moving towards Vasselheim now. I'm negative on our chances of dealing with this before Vasselheim, but that's the goal, right?
Taliesin: We've got some time, and I feel like this city is an opportunity to find some more advantages.
Travis: We are also looking for the Sword of Kas. What's if it's in the temple?
Sam: Why would Vecna keep the thing that could kill Vecna near Vecna?
Liam: I'm pulling Percy aside. I hear you, but this is a city that has existed here for a long time. Vecna didn't create this city. Vecna doesn't own these people. This is a fucking mountain that existed and now they're going for a ride. What do these people have to do with Vecna?
Taliesin: It's not a city that just existed.
Liam: No?
Taliesin: This is a giant primordial beast that people inhabited. God only knows what existed in here.
Marisha: Yeah, but as we've already seen from the other tomb, it's already been heavily, heavily plundered.
Liam: And Vecna's just a user. This place was just sitting there. He lifted it up and took it away. These assholes don't have anything to do with--
Travis: Why did he choose this?
Marisha: How far away is the temple? Do we know? Can we football range guess it?
Matt: I'd say, because you guys have darkvision of 60 feet?
Taliesin: If gods really understood how this world worked, this would not be happening right now.
Matt: It's at about the 50, 55 foot areas where the wall begins, then it vanishes beyond that.
Liam: Percy, this shitbird has appeared like three times wherever we were.
Laura: Well, he's not going to be able to do that right now because I've got a fucking ring.
Taliesin: He doesn't necessarily know this place as well as--
Marisha: Hang on. How long have we been in here, versus how far have we been from Vasselheim? Because we are on a time crunch.
Travis: 200 miles away once we entered is how far away we are from Vasselheim. 200 miles. With steps of?
Taliesin: What was the average land speed of a laden undead?
Matt: You've been within the titan for, I'd say, roughly three and a half hours, maybe.
Liam: Yeah, he's 110 miles out from Vasselheim, at this point.
Travis: We have time to check the temple.
Sam: All right, let's swoop in and swoop out.
Marisha: Super fucking fast!
Taliesin: I'm not even saying look in it, let's take a look at what it--
Laura: Did I see any stairs?
Matt: You do not see any staircases within a 60-foot radius of where you're standing.
Taliesin: We might be harder to spot if we stay on the ground for now, anyway.
Marisha: I just want to say, we gave you guys the other temple, in which you found your stupid waistband, but we got really fucked up from it! Everything has a consequence and a price and shit. Nothing is free.
Laura: I'm going to cast Pass Without a fucking Trace. It's my last Pass Without a Trace, but I'm afraid--
Travis: No, don't do it.
Laura: What if we bring out an entire fucking city of undead dwarves upon us?
Marisha: Let me do it. I have Pass Without a Trace and one more 2nd-level spell left. I'll do it. Save yours.
Liam: I'm also going to put something on the table here: we're trying to save Vasselheim, but we're also trying to save the world. We might not be able to do this without recharging before Vasselheim.
Taliesin: I'm aware.
Sam: You want to go to sleep in this undead city?!
Liam: No, but we're trying to save the world, not just a city.
Sam: So sacrificing Vasselheim so that we can feel better about a fight?
Liam: What if we lose the fight Scanlan? Then who fucking cares? Vasselheim is gone. Westruun is gone. Kaylie is gone. Everything's fucking gone if we fuck this up!
Sam: Well, let's stay on the path and see how long it takes.
Marisha: How about this? Hold. Wait! We still don't know how to get up there, right?
Sam: Is that purple eyeliner?
Marisha: Yeah, do you like it? Thank you. It's a little metallic. Thank you, I bought it while I was waiting for--
Travis: Oh my god!
Laura: Oh my god!
Marisha: Okay. I hate to say split the party, but what if we split the party? What if a few of you check out your fucking temple, and then the rest of us try to figure out a way to get up.
Travis: I'm cool. I'll vote for a temple party.
Marisha: Temple party. Who else is on temple party?
Sam: They need somebody who can help them in there.
Liam: I hate the idea, but I'm the stealthiest motherfucker in this room.
Taliesin: And then you three on the carpet, you on the broom.
Travis: I need the carpet.
Marisha: So wait, just the two of you are going to go check out the carpet?
Laura: Vax is going in with you.
Sam: I feel like one person with magic should go with them. I'll go with them.
Taliesin: We're all ear-pieced.
Marisha: Okay, so Grog--
Liam: Everybody but Keyleth.
Sam: No, it's Keyleth, Vex, and Pike are going searching. The boys are going in the temple, and the girls are going searching.
Marisha: Okay, cool, I'm on board.
Taliesin: This is in no way, by the way, an amazing mirror of that one time underneath Kraghammer. They're just going to find another Clarota.
Liam: The boys all die. The girls go to glory.
Laura: I want to kiss Percy before he goes. Don't die in this stupid temple.
Taliesin: I will not die in this stupid temple.
Sam: I'm going, too.
Taliesin: I slap him in the face.
Laura: Right on, Scanlan. Sorry, Percy.
Matt: Who's traveling in what group?
Laura: Girls are going to look for stairs, the boys are going in the stupid temple.
Liam: I yank the druid in for a kiss.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Oh wait, shit. Your fucking ring.
Laura: Fuck! My fucking ring! We can't split the party.
Taliesin: Okay, can't split the party. We all go looking for the stairs. Oh, you asshole, stop it! (laughter)
Laura: He was really excited about it!
Matt: I was waiting on that.
Laura: Oh my god, he was so excited about it.
Sam: All right, into the temple. Come on, let's just fucking go to the fucking temple.
Matt: I was like, you guys literally had this conversation an hour ago, but okay.
Taliesin: Whatever we do, we can't split the party (fast-forward noise). Okay, we're going to split the party.
Travis: Sam saved our asses.
Taliesin: That was Cabin in the Woods shit.
Liam: 40 feet in advance, Vax walks ahead of the group, hating himself. Here we go.
Matt: Go for it. What are you doing, you're checking for traps?
Liam: I'm checking for enemies hiding.
Matt: So as you push forward--
Laura: We're stealthed, we're Pass Without a Traced.
Matt: Okay, then roll some stealth, guys.
Laura: She Pass Without a Traced us.
Matt: Right, then roll some stealth.
Sam: Oh, we're all rolling stealth?
Liam: 34.
Sam: 25.
Taliesin: 26.
Marisha: 26.
Laura: 39.
Travis: Natural one.
Marisha: Are you serious?
Sam: He's so excited about that temple.
Laura: Natural 20 for Pike! Oh wait, she gets disadvantage.
Matt: She has the boots that make it not at disadvantage.
Taliesin: First time ever.
Liam: But that's a lot of good.
Laura: So much good for one shitty--
Matt: You begin to push forward past the cracked fountain, heading ahead of everyone, keeping an eye out for what's ahead of you. The high walls of the temple-like structure begin to reveal themselves, standing ominous over the debris-strewn streets with shattered carts and bone fragments. The bone fragments faintly quaking beneath every footfall of the walking mountain that you currently are walking through. You see long-decomposed dwarvish bodies brutalized beyond reanimation lying scattered across the broken street paths ahead of you, deep grooves marking the splintered bone. A tangled network of partially ruined catwalks begin to reveal themselves above you, carved from the mountain, contains a ghostly image of a multi-level metropolis long fallen. You, make a perception check.
Liam: 29.
Matt: 29. You can see, as soon as you get to where the fountain is, the center of the street ahead of you. Dozens of slow shifting creatures moving throughout the streets and rubble of crumbling structures. You can see now, many of the undead citizens of the catacombs are now wandering, shaken awake by the lumbering titan that now carries them within. You also see a very faint blue pulsing glow emanating from one of the windows of the temple.
Liam: Can we put the goliath on the carpet so he doesn't kick something or be himself?
Laura: We don't know that he rolled shittily.
Liam: I know that, but he's a big, blundering mother fucking asshole when he wants to be--
Travis: On the chain. Literally on the text chain.
Matt: Which, as you're saying this, you hear a (clattering), and you glance over real fast and watch as Grog is walking by and the edge of his-- which weapon do you have attuned right now? You have the Blood Axe? The Blood Axe hits the edge of a large dwarven statue that had fallen off at a corner angle and is currently being held by a small barrel, and as the axe hits it, it shifts (crashing) and rolls and comes to a rest for a second with this clattering, grinding sound. Parts of it chip and break, but most of it remains strong and sturdy upon impact. At which point, you see at the edge of your visual range, about seven of the wandering creatures go (raspy groan) and begin slowly slinking their way in the direction of the noise.
Sam: So a rock just fell?
Travis: A big statue just fell.
Sam: And is in pieces?
Matt: Parts of it are broken. It's still pretty sturdy.
Taliesin: Let's try and serpentine around and see if we can trace back.
Liam: And they're to the right or the left or ahead of us?
Matt: They're ahead of you.
Laura: Do they look like they saw us?
Liam: Go left. Jenga, jenga, jenga. Can we put Grog on the carpet now?
Taliesin: Yep.
Marisha: We're trying to go up, right?
Sam: No, we're trying to go towards the temple.
Laura: Towards that pulsing light.
Liam: We've got a little bit of business, a little bit of activity ahead of us, so we want to curve to the left.
Travis: All right, we move accordingly.
Matt: All right. So you guys move along the left and curve around the side. As you begin to move along the edge, you watch as about eight of these mostly-skeletal dwarvish corpses begin to shamble in the direction of where the noise came from. You can see elements of their long-mummified skin pulled tight against elements of the rib cage and the skull. Bits of chipped teeth, now broken against whatever things it's attempted to chew on its long un-life. As they move past, two of them glance over in the direction of Grog, and then all of them shift over in the direction and begin rushing forward in your path.
Liam: What's the distance?
Matt: At this point, they're probably about 50 or so feet from where you are.
Liam: Oh shit!
Laura: We don't want to make too much noise. I'm going to shoot a couple.
Travis: We could just go straight up.
Laura: There's only eight of them. We can take eight undead.
Liam: Pickle walks forward and takes a knee and waits with her holy symbol of Sarenrae, waiting for them.
Laura: I take two of them by surprise. That's auto-crit.
Liam: Vax does the same, watching his badass sister, and Pike waits to turn whatever's left of them.
Laura: Yeah, they're super-silent arrows.
Liam: So what happens first?
Matt: All right. She's preparing for it, right?
Liam: Yeah. She's waiting until she sees them.
Matt: Oh, well she also has darkvision of 60 feet.
Liam: So she's waiting until they're within range of her holy abilities.
Matt: What's the radius on that one?
Liam: That's a good question, because I'm a rogue paladin. (sighs) Goddamn it.
Matt: That's all right.
Liam: What if I look in the sorceror rules?
Matt: Nope. 30 feet.
Liam: 30 feet. So she's waiting for the twins to do their work and anything that's left over she's going to scatter.
Matt: Okay. All right. So as she holds position--
Laura: So it's auto-crit?
Matt: They know you're there. It's not a surprise. There's as threat, and they're rushing. But you do have advantage on the hits because they don't see you.
Laura: Well great, that's great. 20?
Matt: That definitely hits.
Laura: Okay. Oh, the other one super-duper hits. It's a 19 plus 14.
Liam: 25, 31, natural 20.
Matt: Okay. All right. So go ahead and roll damage on those. Are you shooting two different skeletons or one each?
Liam: I'm after my sister. She talked before I did.
Laura: I'll see how the first arrow hits?
Matt: Okay.
Laura: 14. Oh, I didn't Hunter's Mark. Whatever. 14, 15, 16. Two lightning damage. Do I add anything? Sneak attack!
Taliesin: Been a while.
Laura: How do we D&D? Plus ten sneak attack.
Matt: Okay. So the first skeleton, the arrow hits it and the torso explodes behind with ribs shattering and scattering across the stonework, its body falling and collapsing to the ground.
Laura: I hit another one.
Matt: Yes, you do.
Liam: Oh, and we go first, so it's advantage.
Laura: 14 plus four lightning damage. And that is plus eight.
Travis: 26.
Matt: 26. This one right behind it, its jaw unhinged slightly. Its tongue made of this slick rotting material that dangles through the hole in the bottom of the jaw. Comes around the corner, and you watch as part of its head explodes off one side from the secondary arrow, taking out what remains of the center of its skull, and the body crumples to the ground. Two skeletons down.
Liam: Sneak attack hits the first time we connect, right?
Matt: Yeah. You don't have to roll damage for that one.
Laura: Oh. Sorry, I did sneak attack on the second arrow.
Matt: Well, you can do sneak attack once per round.
Laura: Okay. I did eight damage too much.
Matt: It was still enough.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: You don't have to roll damage for sneak attack.
Liam: So then that one's gone?
Matt: A third skeleton now is ruined. You hit it with the arrow in the middle of the spinal column, and it folds on itself.
Liam: Okay. So paladin action-action and my bonus action. So that's the first of three. The last one's the one that was a critical hit so the second one goes onto the next whole skeleton. It's just an eight.
Matt: Okay. This one the arrow slides into the side of the skull, and it keeps coming forward towards Grog.
Liam: Okay. And then the last critical hit, which is Whisper again, because it bamfed back, is two plus eight is ten. Two and three. It's not that much. It's 15 total.
Matt: Okay. And that one does finish it. So that's three skeletons down. Grog, I want to to individually roll an initiative check for me.
Travis: Natural 20. With Gil's dice.
Matt: So as you guys are watching this happen, the other five rush in to close the gap, but you are at the ready, and you get to strike before they do.
Travis: Nice. Am I hitting them? Yeah, Okay. Reckless, great weapon master. 31 for the first one.
Matt: That hits.
Travis: Okay, cool.
Matt: Your minimum damage will kill them. So as the first one comes up towards you, you swing up. As you slam into it, you watch as its bony body blows up against the side of the nearby stone building and then scrapes to the ground.
Travis: Can I use the other strike on another?
Matt: Yes, you can.
Travis: Reckless great weapon. That'll hit. That's like 30.
Taliesin: If there's anything left on Grog by the end of this, I'll try to swipe them off with my sword.
Travis: 32.
Matt: All righty. So two more detonate on this point. So there's three left. They're closing in on Grog. Does Pike want to take her turn?
Travis: We might want to save that Turnt Undead.
Laura: No, I think we should save.
Liam: I've already said it, but she's whispering to me to hold. She's half of Pike right now. You're half of Pike right now.
Taliesin: I'd like to pop in and see if I could take a couple--
Matt: Make an initiative roll.
Laura: Don't shoot, Percy.
Taliesin: I'm not; I'm going to use my sword.
Liam: Pike holds, breathing hard, looking at them coming on.
Taliesin: 16.
Matt: Yeah, that beats them by one. So yeah, as the three remaining ones start charging in towards Grog--
Taliesin: I'm going to run in, draw the silvered sword, and take some swipes.
Matt: Go for it.
Taliesin: Let's take three swipes right out of here.
Laura: Pike can use her mace on anything left in that area.
Taliesin: That's one natural 20, one natural 19. Do I crit on a 19 with the sword?
Matt: No.
Taliesin: Okay, never mind. And a two. But that might be enough, because I have a really high-- that's a 15 as my lowest to hit. Does a 15 hit?
Matt: 15 does hit. Yes.
Taliesin: So the 15 is-- That's 14 piercing damage to the first one with a silvered sword.
Matt: Okay. You rush up and you carve through the first skeleton, and it breaks on the ground in front of you.
Taliesin: Number two is 13 points of damage to the second one.
Matt: Okay. The second one, you bring the blade down into the skull and cleave it in half. You watch as part of its skull breaks off to the side and the jaw falls to the ground and the rest crumbles in place.
Taliesin: I twirl around and take my third wonderful pirouette attack, which is 20 points of damage.
Matt: Okay, and as the final one lunges forward, in a fervent-- strangely faster than you expect for a skeletal undead, it begins to accelerate towards Grog. And with that, you take the blade and take the head right off at the neck, and it falls and crumples to the ground.
Marisha: So it's like 28 Days Later zombies?
Travis: 28 Days Later, they run.
Marisha: He said that they were fast.
Matt: Well, the last one-- it was flavor.
Marisha: Just wanted to make sure they weren't special.
Matt: Okay. As you finish the fray and hold yourself, you wait and wait. You do not hear or notice any more advancing undead from that direction.
Travis: Okay, how about I don't move and somebody with flying ability go to check out that blue glowy window?
Taliesin: We have to stick together.
Laura: Is the glowy window within 60 feet?
Taliesin: No, it's far.
Travis: When we were at the opening, we were 50 to 60 feet away.
Matt: The temple where you guys were at, at the time was 50 feet away from you, but you would have crossed the other side of the hall. So now it's about 100 feet away from you. At this distance, you can see it's a round, almost cylindrical building, Colosseum-esque. And there's a small square window about every 25 to 30 feet. And it's big. It's large, but you can see that faint glow between multiple windows from this distance.
Travis: So should we fly up to that window?
Taliesin: I think it'd be safer to stay on the ground level and sneak. Because if we're the air, they are going to see us.
Travis: Let's do it.
Marisha: And we still have Pass Without a Trace, so let's go.
Laura: Yes, we do. She cast it.
Matt: All right, now that this brief combat has finished, those who took place in it, which would be you, Vax, Grog, and Percy have to remake your stealth checks.
Laura: You're like, "Gladly!"
Taliesin: Yes.
Laura: What about Pike? Because she just knelt down. She didn't really fight.
Matt: She stepped out of her stealth. She was making herself visible.
Laura: My natural 20 for Pike, wasted!
Taliesin: 23.
Liam: We still have Pass Without Trace?
Marisha: Yes. I didn't do anything.
Travis: 26.
Marisha: Keeping that concentration.
Taliesin: (singing) Concentration. Concentration.
Marisha: (singing) Concentration. Concentration.
Liam: You're the doctor! Keep your patients on the run!
Laura: 30 for Pike. 29 for me.
Matt: All right. You guys begin to slowly make your way along the left wall of this large cavern.
Liam: 37, by the way.
Matt: Good to know. As you slowly move through the shadows, dodging through open doorways and through windows, trying the best you can to stay out from the center thoroughfare of this opening, you see more and more of these undead. Dozens, maybe even a hundred have crossed your path at the perimeter of your visual range and you can see in the catwalks above too, with the faint bit of the orange glow, occasionally shapes breaking across the orange. This entire cavern is swarming.
Laura: (whispering) Do we still have the thing?
Sam: Oh, the filter? The censer?
Laura: Do we have it in the Bag of Holding?
Taliesin: We also have the herbs.
Laura: What if we use it? What if we use it and it just repels them?
Taliesin: When it's time. We don't have a lot of it.
Marisha: Yeah, it's a very small amount.
Liam: Is it ready to go, though?
Taliesin: Let's prepare it, and when it's time--
Liam: Is it ready to go, though?
Marisha: Yeah it's dried. I spent that time. I spent time during the break.
Taliesin: It's just burning the herbs, though. We don't need the censer. Just hold it in your hands.
Liam: Do we have any sense of where we started in this giant cavern? Or are we totally fucking turned around?
Matt: No. I mean you have a decent sense. You are maybe 100 to 150 feet from where you began. Because you've been moving slowly. Staying stealthily, you're moving very carefully and very slowly and judging by the shape of the cavern and where you are currently, you're about halfway through it, or close to halfway.
Taliesin: It's good that we didn't go on the catwalk.
Matt: The temple's on the opposite side of the chamber.
Liam: Oh! All the way on the other side. I thought it was central.
Matt: I'm sorry. When you entered the entrance, the temple was to the front and to the right of you. You guys curved around the left, on the other side of it, keeping a view on it so you could see it from across the way. Are you making your way across to the temple?
Liam: So it's pressed against the opposite wall of this big place?
Sam: Are the undead all around the temple?
Matt: Further in. Nothing directly around the outside of the temple. So you guys curve around the entrance where you came and slowly make your way towards where the temple emerges from the rock wall. About a third or so of its exterior wall is actually built into the side of this cavern, and the large cylindrical-like Colosseum temple structure curves outward. You can see as you get closer to it, there's maybe the three floors to it but edges of the top wall have crumbled inward and you can see areas where it looks like it's sustained some physical damage or eroded over time. You eventually make your way around the outside wall of the temple to one of the first doorways, and it is an archway, maybe six feet tall and about four feet wide. Very simple. This is an old temple.
Liam: Is that light you talked about coming from one specific source, or all over the place? Every window.
Travis: Is there a story?
Matt: It looks to be coming from the base.
Liam: From down below.
Laura: Can we see in one of the windows?
Matt: You can look inside. Make a perception check.
Sam: Are there any bone laying around?
Matt: Plenty.
Sam: I am going to pick up two bones, give them to Simon Two, and tell him to go across the street, 50 feet away from us, and wait there in some building. Hold these bones.
Matt: You watch as two bone shards slowly glide over, then stand there.
Laura: 34.
Matt: Okay. As you pull up to the window and glance down, you immediately look inside the temple, and you see about 30 or so silhouettes of shambling dwarven corpses all standing inside the base floor of this temple. You see the silhouettes and shapes because they are all faintly outlined from the source of this blue light. You see a small, baseball-sized, bluish crystal that is resting, not in the perfect center of the temple but somewhere in the open middle floor area, and it looks like these 30 undead are surrounding it, and standing.
Sam: Smash and grab. You could go in there and get that thing, be out before they even saw you in there.
Taliesin: Also, have your unseen servant make a bunch of noise and have them all--
Marisha: Be a distraction?
Laura: Yeah, but making any kind of noise would draw large crowds.
Taliesin: We can have the unseen servant pick it up.
Marisha: How far away can he be, though?
Sam: He's 50 feet away, right now, and he's waiting to make noise.
Taliesin: What if he were to go in and get it himself?
Sam: He could.
Travis: He is invisible, isn't he?
Sam: He could go and pick it up and come right back with it.
Laura: But first don't tell him to come right out, tell him to like walk a little bit to see if they follow the light.
Liam: But what are our options if that doesn't work?
Sam: If he picks up the crystal and it doesn't work, or it doesn't move?
Liam: I want to do that. If that doesn't work, I can click the boots, and I can be there in a heartbeat and run, but what do we do next?
Sam: We need an escape plan, right? How many can fit on the carpet?
Liam: This goes back to my conversation with you, which is: are we going to find a pocket and rest?
Taliesin: Yes, but not here.
Liam: Agreed, but we're talking about Vasselheim, and is damage to Vasselheim a sacrifice needed to be ready to do what's necessary?
Travis: If he destroys Vasselheim, he does his miracle, his display of power, and he will be even stronger. That is not an option.
Taliesin: If we were to be clever, if we're at the edge of Vasselheim, the Vasselheim forces will be distracting his forces, so we'll have less to deal with, so we want this fight to happen at the edge.
Liam: So we're talking about no rest. I'm not talking about a short rest.
Taliesin: There will not be a long rest, I don't think.
Laura: There might be.
Liam: Not without him spilling into Vasselheim.
Marisha: I've been very conservative with what I've been doing for a reason.
Travis: I don't think a long rest is in the cards.
Taliesin: I've only burned one thing that requires a long rest.
Marisha: I agree with Grog. We can't sacrifice having him gain all of those followers, because then the only option would be murder a lot of his followers, which I'm not really comfortable with.
Travis: And he may be too strong at that point.
Sam: We don't need to discuss this now. We need to get the crystal and get the fuck out of here!
Taliesin: If we can pull this off without burning anything important, then it doesn't matter.
Marisha: I want to go on record and say I think this is stupid. Okay, let's go.
Laura: That crystal looks really appetizing, and I want it.
Travis: How about we get ready to leave? I'll get on the carpet.
Laura: It looks really super magical.
Travis: Who's on the broom with Vex?
Laura: Me.
Travis: No, who is on the broom with you?
Taliesin: I'll be on the broom with her.
Travis: Do you want to get on the carpet with me?
Sam: Yeah, of course.
Marisha: I have to come with you because I have the Pass Without a Trace spell.
Taliesin: We all have to be together. We can't separate.
Travis: And he can fly.
Sam: No, he can't. He's done with his wings.
Liam: Yeah, that's right.
Sam: We have too many people for the carpet and the broom.
Liam: My wings are gone. There's no wings for Vecna unless we rest.
Travis: Well, kick Trinket out of the necklace, and I'll get in there.
Taliesin: I can also climb up the wall, if need be.
Sam: We can leave Trinket.
Liam: It's fine, I still have the boots. Just the wings. It was death or wings. I chose wings.
Travis: All right, so how do we fly? How do we do that?
Sam: I can burn a spell and be a giant eagle or something.
Taliesin: Just for shits and giggles, I'm going to take one last look around to see if there's any infrastructure for getting up. There must be infrastructure for getting up here. There wasn't layers of a city on top of each other.
Sam: We could just run.
Liam: But wait, where are we going though if we get this thing?
Sam: Up away.
Liam: We have no verification of an exit or a hole or anything!
Travis: Yeah, sometimes you just got to leap, okay?
Liam: That's my entire life, but this is the last moment.
Sam: Every organ in a body has an entrance and an exit, right? Wait, no, lungs don't; they just have the one.
Marisha: Wait up, we argued more this game more than anything else. Okay, we know we still have to fly upwards, including on flying up to the blue crystally thing right?
Laura: No, the blue crystal is right here.
Marisha: Well, then what the fuck?
Laura: I don't know!
Liam: We have a plan for getting the crystal, just not how to get the fuck out.
Marisha: We fucking fly!
Travis: Who burns a spell to become an animal?
Marisha: I can burn a spell.
Travis: You do that.
Marisha: We're probably going to take another short rest, right?
Travis: Probably.
Marisha: Okay.
Sam: I can recall Simon 2. I can send him across the room, make a bunch of noise, draw a bunch of people over there. You run, grab the crystal, and then we hustle out of there.
Travis: What if only half the room leaves, though?
Laura: No, you go get Simon 2 to go get the crystal.
Sam: And there's going to be a floating crystal that marches across?
Travis: They don't give a shit. Do it. I'm on the carpet. We're ready to go.
Marisha: You're on me? And you're on carpet, and you're on broom?
Travis: Percy and Vex are on the broom.
Matt: Gnomes on the carpet with Grog. You and Percy on the broom. You're transforming into what creature?
Marisha: Giant eagle.
Matt: Giant eagle.
Marisha: Not yet, though.
Laura: And then we all, within 60 feet of each other, fly up.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: Okay, who's doing what?
Laura: Simon 2.
Sam: Simon 2 is going to go get the thing. Let's say they all start watching the thing come towards us. Grog, are you here? Are you with us?
Travis: Yeah, I have to be.
Sam: Can you throw something across the room to make a noise?
Travis: Yep. I can absolutely do that.
Laura: I'll prime an arrow.
Travis: I have a hooded lantern that has fuel in it. It will even burn when it lands. It's been sitting in there for four years.
Sam: This is a terrible plan.
Taliesin: This is why we hoarded it in the first place.
Sam: Guys, I'm just going to say this one more time before we do this: he's way faster than Simon 2. Simon 2 could create a distraction. He could (snatching noise).
Liam: Scanlan, only with the boots.
Travis: If they chase the jewel, fuck the jewel, and we'll leave.
Taliesin: If they chase the jewel, we can grab it and run, anyway.
Sam: All right, Simon 2. Come back with your bones!
Matt: The bones shift over towards you ever-so-slowly.
Liam: (singing) Don't worry, be happy now.
Sam: All right. Simon 2, go to the middle of the room. Throw the bones away, far, then grab the crystal. You don't have pockets. Run back to us! Away, yeah. Should he cover it with a blanket or something? Do you have a hood?
Matt: The bones begin to drift.
Taliesin: Okay, I'm not saying no.
Laura: A handkerchief to put over the light.
Sam: So it blocks the light? All right, so go put this handkerchief on the thing, pick it up, and bring it back to us. Go, Simon 2. You're our only hope.
Matt: Is Simon holding bones or a blanket?
Sam: He's holding a blanket.
Taliesin: He's holding a hanky.
Laura: He's holding a hanky.
Travis: Put the bones down gently.
Sam: Give me the bones. I put the bones down. Here's a handkerchief. You'll put it over the crystal, pick up the crystal, and bring it back to us.
Matt: Simon begins to slowly walk, the handkerchief floating by.
Taliesin: This is like those little handkerchief ghosts you would make in kindergarten.
Matt: As you glance inside and watch as it happens, you can see all the undead that are in there are standing, unmoving, swaying a little bit in place. Simon's about 30 feet out from them. About 20 feet out. They don't notice his presence. You notice that all the undead are facing the crystal, by the way.
Laura: Why didn't you tell us that before?
Marisha: Why didn't you tell us that before?
Marisha: (laughing) That's crucial information.
Sam: Right before he picks it up, hock a rock as far as you can.
Travis: Not the lantern?
Taliesin: Not the rock, the lantern. Light the lantern and throw it.
Marisha: By the way, they're all staring right at you. They're 100 percent aware of what's going on.
Matt: They're not staring at you. They're staring at the crystal.
Laura: They will be staring at us. What if we destroy the crystal? I wonder if all the undead would die. Let's keep going.
Matt: The handkerchief makes its way forward. Simon walks between the undead, and they don't even notice.
Sam: That's a good guy, that Simon 2.
Marisha: What happens?
Matt: The handkerchief moves over onto the crystal, and all the undead look over to the crystal, and the crystal lifts, and they all begin to (groans).
Travis: I take the hooded lantern and I (laughs) I throw the fucking piss out of it.
Matt: Make an attack roll. Roll and add your strength modifier.
Travis: Oh, that's good! 19.
Matt: You're adding your strength modifier to that? Yeah. You're aiming at the opposite end?
Travis: If the entrance is here, I'm throwing it in the opposite direction of where we are.
Matt: With your strength? Easy enough. You lob it. It arcs over (flame noises) and explodes. The oil spreads across the ground. Flames ignite, and the bright light that emanates from it and the flames burst, and all the undead turn over (grunting) and begin to retract away. Two of them are following Simon. Only two of the undead are following Simon, currently. The others are distracted by the detonation of flame. They look confused.
Liam: How close are the pursuers?
Matt: They're making their way slowly. No, they're much faster than Simon.
Liam: I'm throwing.
Laura: I'm going to get down and shoot.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Just the ones following Simon!
Matt: Both of you guys roll an attack.
Travis: Are they far away from the other ones that aren't leaving yet?
Taliesin: It doesn't matter; they're not paying attention.
Laura: 25. No, 33.
Liam: 29.
Matt: Roll damage.
Taliesin: They drop out of nowhere. They faint. It's going to be good.
Marisha: So we hope.
Taliesin: I thought you were made of sterner stuff, Travis. Come on. Now is not the time to get squeamish.
Laura: 24.
Taliesin: We made a solemn oath.
Sam: They were innocent.
Taliesin: We agreed, weeks ago.
Liam: I rolled a 77 for mine.
Sam: 77?!
Matt: These two skeletons almost atomize. As they're walking, they're both gaining on Simon, and as they both start reaching towards where the dull bluish glow, mostly muted by the handkerchief, is floating in the air, they (growl) towards it. You watch as both their heads and torsos scatter across the ground, like a heavy wave of force blasted them across the stonework. The scraping sound hits as the detonation hits. The flames are dying down, and... no, no other undead see it. Slowly, the stone floats past, out of the doorway, and makes its way back to you.
Taliesin: Drop it in the Bag of Holding.
Matt: At this point, Simon's getting real close to the end of his hour-long casting time.
Sam: You've served us well.
Travis: Bag of Holding. It doesn't hurt my hand, or anything, does it?
Matt: No.
Travis: Cool! We've got that.
Matt: Whatever it is.
Laura: I guess we have it.
Marisha: Nothing happened to them when we put it in the Bag of Holding? They were like, (groaning) and kept going? All the undead?
Matt: All the undead inside that were distracted by the explosion of the lantern are riled up now, and they're starting to wander around, and some of them are starting to make their way towards the entrance to the temple. Some are making their way toward the staircase to head upward.
Marisha: Are we flying?
Travis: Yes, we fly up.
Matt: All right. You go into eagle form, grab Vax, and all of you guys make your way up into the cavern entrance.
Laura: Bubble. Tight bubble.
Matt: Currently, I believe the eagle form has darkvision. Right now, you have no light source.
Liam: I do. I can say things to her. I can see.
Matt: Right, so you guys are able to maneuver. So as you guys head up into the center part of the cavern, above the catwalks, you can see as you push through, about a third of them are still standing. A lot of them have collapsed in the center, and there's edges of bridges that come to a halt where they've collapsed and tumbled down into the cavern below. You can see straggling undead wandering the catwalks and these pathways along the edges of the cavern. As you pass forward through them-- I imagine you guys are cruising through as fast as you can?
Taliesin: Trying to avoid them.
Laura: We'll try to avoid the clusters.
Matt: A few of them seem to glance up and see you as you pass and reach, but they have nowhere to go. As you begin to cruise through the center of this cavern, following it to the opposite side, it widens further, and now as you look down, faintly, you can see bits of the orange bioluminescent fungus that are growing within this city below. You can see elements of these beautiful statues that are partially crumbled. You can see small homes that litter the center of this chamber. You can see some of the catwalks that meet in the center of this actually meet in a suspended platform that contains another dome-like structure that is partially caved in. With another shake and impact of the titan's footfall, you watch as one of its suspension pillars cracks, and the entire center finally gives way and falls and slams down, collapsing into the center of the chamber, it being there for the final moment of its tensile strength. As it slams down, you watch as it crushes about 40 or so various skeletons below, and from that blast, you can see something on the interior of it was apparently explosive or flammable, and it explodes, giving a brief flash of light into the center of this cavern. Where you had the brief outside of your visual range, you now look around and see the entirety of these dozens of catwalks and the city below you. Hundreds and hundreds of roving skeletons and mostly decomposed, mummified dwarven corpses that all glance towards this explosion. Some have been blasted away from it by the impact of the detonation. Others are making their way towards what the strange sound was, drawn towards it, but you're keeping this central safe space between, where none of them can grasp or assail you.
Laura: Were there other buildings like that, ready to fall from the ceiling?
Matt: Currently, what you see is just the one.
Liam: I'm looking for gaps or holes or anything in the ceiling of this cavern or anywhere to get out. MATT; You see entrances to homes that are built into the sides.
Sam: What about a tunnel or anything?
Matt: Make a perception check. Anyone who has darkvision can make a perception check.
Marisha: I have keen sight. Does that count?
Matt: You have advantage on your perception.
Marisha: Oh, shitty and shittier.
Liam: 27.
Travis: 18.
Laura: 18.
Sam: I didn't do one.
Marisha: 28.
Sam: I'm weeping over Simon 2.
Matt: Oh. Your keen eagle vision-- wait, you said you rolled shitty and shittier and still got 28?
Marisha: I have a plus 13, plus advantage.
Matt: Right. All right, cool. So glancing through your eagle vision, you can see the top of the chamber almost seems to come to a conical shape, and as you look up to the top of it, it emerges into a completely vertical chamber that rises up and out of the central opening of the city of Thomara.
Sam: Let's go.
Marisha: I take the lead, I guess. (caws)
Laura: (shushes) Caw quietly.
Liam: Vax is trying to appreciate his last ride.
Travis: Debbie Downer.
Liam: No way! I'm not going to stop. Fuck you all. Every game until the end, motherfuckers!
Matt: As the group of you make your way up into this vertical cavern, we're going to take a break. I need to take a break, myself.
Travis: Remember, we have the--
Travis: Sponsored announcement.
Matt: That's right. We have the Shadow of War video coming up at this break to give you a glance at this game coming up that we're all part of. If you haven't seen it, or if you have seen it, check it out, anyway. It's pretty awesome. Also, for this week's giveaway, Wyrmwood, we've got a little video for you here to show you what's up and what you can do and try to win it at the break, so pay attention, stick around, and we'll see you guys here in a few minutes.
Liam: This is what's up!
Travis: Yeah! [break]
Matt: Hello, everyone, and welcome back. All right, so last we left off, you guys were all traveling upward through various means of flight, through a peak in the central cavern chamber in the center of Thomara, the long-dead dwarven city. As you begin to climb upward through this 15-foot-wide or so upward hallway, this cylindrical cavern, you continue upward for about 50 or so feet since passing through the ceiling of this chamber, and then it opens up into a domed room. Immediately, as you fly up, you see a ceiling come up, and you have to coast off to the side. You catch yourself, hovering there as the rest of you guys make your way in there. This domed, mushroom-shaped chamber with a very thin, circular floor around the outside with the hole that you entered at the bottom. Whoever would stand on the edge there would have the opportunity to either leap into or toss something down into this hole that would then drop them right into the center of the city.
Taliesin: Weird question  if I were holding the blue gem and had dropped it down this hole, what would be the likelihood it would have ended vaguely where it ended up?
Matt: Not at all. It was a ways off.
Taliesin: Just checking.
Laura: Are there any undead around us right now?
Matt: Currently? Glancing around, you do not see any undead.
Marisha: You said things or people? Is this a body-sized hole?
Matt: No, it's about 15 feet wide. The full chamber is maybe 50 or so feet across. About a 20-foot walkway, circular, before the hole in the center.
Liam: Did you say the hole is a natural gap in the cave, or does it look made?
Matt: If you glance down and look about the interior of this chamber, it is not natural. It is all carved.
Laura: Can we look at the gem for a second, since there's no undead around?
Matt: If you want to. Grog has it.
Travis: Do you want me to pull it out?
Laura: Yeah. Can you do an arcana check on it?
Sam: Sure. I can look at it.
Laura: How big is it? Is it baseball-sized?
Matt: It's about that big.
Travis: No undead, right? No creatures, nobody that's going to (whoop) to the shiny blue light?
Laura: We can't see anything around us?
Matt: Not at the moment, no.
Sam: I remove the handkerchief. I look at it. I inspect it like a jeweler inspecting a jewel. 18 arcana check.
Matt: Okay. It's definitely magical. The blue light from it grows stronger, then weaker. Stronger, then weaker. It has this rhythmic flash to it, like a heart or something that has a pulse to it.
Marisha: How is it lining up towards the steps of the giant?
Matt: Not at all. It's much quicker.
Marisha: Much quicker.
Matt: It's cold to the touch.
Taliesin: Does it do anything to the Titanstone Knuckles?
Liam: Is it faster than my heartbeat?
Matt: It's slower.
Liam: Slower.
Travis: That's slow.
Marisha: So it's very slow, but not as slow as the rate he's walking.
Travis: Is it a cut jewel, or is it rough?
Matt: It's rough. No jeweler's hand has touched it. There are some edges that have flat surfaces; it looks like there have been things that have chipped off the stone.
Taliesin: Does it have the vibe of something petrified?
Matt: No, it has almost a quartz-like look to it. Elements of it appear to be cloudier or imperfect, and some areas appear to be clearer, and light shines through a little brighter.
Liam: It's like a hunk at the natural history museum of minerals.
Matt: Yeah, but there is an enchantment.
Sam: What about Pikey-pants? Can she detect if it's evil or good or something? Does she do that?
Laura: You should do that.
Liam: I'm going to do that.
Matt: Okay. You don't get a sense of any evil from the stone.
Sam: You said no sense of evil?
Matt: No evil coming from the stone.
Laura: Okay, I'm going to gaze into it super hard.
Matt: You look really hard into the stone as you hold it to your face, and your eyes almost cross as you glance into the very core source of this pulsating arcane energy. It's bright.
Laura: So bright, y'all.
Matt: It hurts a little bit, and you wince after a while.
Laura: I saw so many things.
Liam: She looked at the eclipse, too.
Travis: We don't have Identify or anything like that, do we?
Marisha: No.
Sam: No.
Laura: You know who had that?
Sam: No, who?
Laura: Our good friend, Tary. He was wonderful.
Sam: Who is it? Oh, the fancy fellow? He's probably dead somewhere.
Travis: I think we should try and smash it.
Sam: Don't you think that about everyone and everything?
Marisha: I'm not against this idea.
Travis: What else are we going to do to it before we face El Vecna?
Taliesin: My only other thought of how it could be useful, at this point, with what we know about it--
Sam: Is "El Vecna" Spanish for Vecna?
Travis: Sí.
Taliesin: It seemed like the undead were crowding towards it, which means that if we do get attacked by a group of undead, we might be able to shiny-object them, unless, of course, it's dangerous in their hands.
Travis: Or we spike it down the hole, and it causes a hydrogen bomb, and we shatter this titan in half.
Taliesin: That literally made the dungeon master laugh, so I don't know if that's necessarily--
Travis: It's blue, right? That is the color of hydrogen.
Taliesin: That's the color of Dr. Manhattan. I don't necessarily know if it's the same thing.
Travis: It is known.
Sam: Why don't we hang onto it for now? In a moment of peril, we can throw it or smash it.
Taliesin: Not crazy, trying to crack it.
Liam: What if it stops this thing where it stands? We're all thinking that this thing could be its heart.
Sam: Its heart?
Travis: It's palm-sized, right?
Taliesin: It could be a chunk of heart.
Laura: Is it the same color as his Knuckles?
Travis: No, these are stone-gray. This is blue crystal.
Matt: There's nothing about it that gives you the sense, based on what you've seen both outside and within the titan, that it is of similar essence to the titan, from what you understand.
Travis: It could be a soul or something.
Sam: Soul glow?
Travis: Does Pike have anything that detects a soul?
Liam: It's not evil. It's not good. It could be the thing that's keeping these undead moving.
Travis: Well, then I don't know what else to do. I think we keep moving.
Liam: I like the spiking idea.
Laura: I'm okay squishing it with the hammer.
Liam: I think that you should let me squish it, because if that blows up--
Laura: I think it's funny that we spent so much time getting it, and then we're going to destroy it.
Liam: We spent ten minutes getting this thing.
Travis: We'll think about smashing it when we take our rest. Maybe a cause will reveal itself.
Taliesin: Hold onto it for now. It could come in handy.
Marisha: It's like that dress you bought four years ago you still haven't worn. It might find a purpose.
Sam: All right, focus!
Laura: Let's get out of this dome.
Travis: Is there any writing or engraving or runes on the edge of the circle that's been engineered?
Matt: On the edge of the circle? No. It's smooth stone, intently designed to be a drop or opening of some kind.
Taliesin: Are there exits?
Matt: Make an investigation check. You don't see any doorways or passageways.
Marisha: Wait, there's not a hole that we can go up?
Matt: There's a hole that you came through to come into this chamber. Imagine a dome. You're in the chamber.
Taliesin: I literally rolled a one. I'm aware that there's a hole.
Matt: You get vertigo as you stand in the chamber.
Laura: Is this investigation or perception?
Matt: You look about, and you don't see any exit. Investigation to see if there's any hidden or not-immediately-noticeable exits or entryways.
Laura: 23.
Matt: 23. As you do a pass around, looking closely along the wall, you see two small domed doors that have metal rods jammed through, almost like a small barricade that's been placed down on one side of a doorway. However, they are closed from this side.
Laura: So you could open them up?
Matt: You could.
Laura: Are they trapped? I'll look to see if they're trapped.
Liam: On it.
Travis: Also fair to assume that whatever's on the other side of that door--
Liam: 27.
Matt: 27?
Laura: I rolled an 18.
Matt: You're both looking at the same one?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: Neither of you notice any traps.
Laura: All right, then I'm going to try to jimmy open that lock.
Travis: Whoa.
Laura: I already said it.
Matt: Make a strength check.
Liam: Not locked.
Laura: Two! Wait. Yeah, that's straight-up strength, not a saving throw? Two!
Sam: Two?
Laura: I'm really fucking weak. You'd think I'd be stronger pulling the bowstring, but no.
Travis: Use your legs. Really, use your legs.
Laura: Okay. I put my legs up on the wall and (grunts).
Matt: It is not budging.
Liam: Can I use my finger skills to see if it's locked? Just my finger skills. I made a perception check to see if it's trapped. Wouldn't I know if it's locked?
Matt: The lock is the barricading mechanism on it. There is no handle.
Liam: I'm going to try to sidestep this lock with my lock-picking skills.
Travis: It's a barricade.
Marisha: It's a barricade.
Liam: There's nothing to do?
Marisha: It's like steel rebar in front of the door.
Travis: Is there any decorating or writing or scratching around the door frame or wall around the door? Anything other than a portal to go through?
Matt: Not from what you can see, no. The room's pretty simple. The construction of it may be older than most of the things that you've seen in the city below and previous chambers. It seems to be built almost for function rather than ceremony.
Laura: It's a trash chute.
Marisha: That's what I was going to say. Is it a water chute? Drainage? Is this a drain pipe?
Laura: We could fill the city with water. Drown all the zombies.
Matt: One thing you do notice, which is interesting as you're glancing around at the side, looking at the ground at the bottom of it, there's a very faint groove in the ground that leads toward the central hole at the base of each of these doorways.
Marisha: Does there appear to be any other type of chutes coming into this room?
Matt: No, just the two doors on the opposite sides.
Travis: How far apart are the doors?
Matt: Opposite sides of the chamber, yeah.
Taliesin: So there's a bar. The door is barred, then?
Matt: Correct.
Taliesin: So break it. Let's get out of the way and pop the bar. See if we can pop the bar right off the door.
Travis: Do we want to have Keyleth there in case 900 undead zombies start pouring through, and she can Wall of Stone the door?
Marisha: I'll be with you. Yeah. I'm right behind you, man.
Travis: I will try and remove one of the doors. I don't know how to delineate between them.
Taliesin: The left one.
Travis: Sure. Yeah. It's a circle. That one. 25.
Matt: 25. It immediately comes off to the side, and when you lift it, you realize that it's bolted to the wall to the side, and it curves upward and holds it in place. This is meant to stay in place.
Laura: Wow. Really? It was meant to move? I think I loosened it for you, Grog.
Travis: I didn't get that sense at all.
Matt: As you lift it up, the door is now unbarred.
Travis: Shall I?
Laura: Yeah, open the door!
Travis: Are the hinges on this side so it looks like it opens towards me?
Matt: It looks like it opens towards you, yes.
Travis: I'll pull open the door.
Marisha: I'm at the ready for whatever.
Matt: Okay. We'll say as you entered and landed, the door on the left. Okay, so as you pull that one open, immediately preparing yourself, a couple of rocks tumble out, and it reveals a packed-tight mass of earth and stone.
Laura: Shit! Let's try the other one.
Travis: Should I punch the rubble?
Laura: No, let's try the other door first.
Travis: I make my way around.
Taliesin: We set ourselves up.
Travis: 20 on the dot.
Matt: 20. (metal creaking) It lifts over without an issue. Pull the door open. You lift it open, and a few rocks tumble past, but a slick rockslide incline continues upward, dry, no water. Nothing.
Travis: A rockslide continues onward. Slick, dry.
Laura: How big is the tunnel?
Matt: It's about four feet wide or so.
Laura: So we can fit in?
Matt: Yeah, you can fit in.
Taliesin: We have some Immovable Rods.
Matt: When I say slide, I mean smooth stone, like an actual slide. You get the sense that there was some sort of aqueduct-type scenario.
Laura: We brace ourselves on the wall to make sure we don't slide down.
Taliesin: Whoever's in the back should have the Immovable Rods, so if there's a sudden rush of water, we can create a grate for ourselves.
Matt: You envision that at one point, long ago, this would have been a beautiful waterfall in the center of Thomara's chamber that has now dried.
Travis: Dope. That's awesome. I'm getting creepy as fuck now. I've got the Immovable Rod; I'll be the caboose.
Marisha: I've got the other one, so I'll be second.
Matt: So Grog is the caboose.
Marisha: Keyleth in front of Grog.
Matt: Keyleth in front of Grog? All right. Who's in front of them?
Sam: Me.
Matt: Scanlan.
Laura: Pike.
Matt: Then Pike. All righty.
Taliesin: Myself and the twins, I suppose.
Laura: Yeah. I want to be in the front.
Travis: I'll go ahead and take the Immovable Rod out and have it in my hand.
Marisha: Samesies.
Matt: So you've got both of those. Oh, I totally forgot there was a winner for this. I'm sorry. I should do that, huh? RyanBoo, you're the winner. Danoba will contact you and get you your cherry deck box soon. Now that's taken care of. You make your way up the slide, and it's relatively gradual; it's not too heavy of a scenario. You make your way upward, upward, and about 30 or so feet up, the walls of it separate out and appear to break into two smaller chambers, like this was a breaking point where a person could enter from either side to check on the flow or do maintenance on whatever the ducting was. The slide continues upward. Vax and Vex, you get to that portion and lift yourselves up, looking right to left. It ends on one side, and it looks like there's some dry-rotted wooden crates, and to the left, a staircase.
Marisha: So it looks like a landing?
Matt: It's a brief landing for somebody who needed to come in and do repairs, maintenance, or checking on the flow of water.
Laura: Keep going up the slide or take the stairs?
Liam: Quick glance in the crates?
Marisha: No, if you're going to take a quick glance, then we have to bust them open like a proper RPG.
Travis: They're dry-rotted. They'll break easy.
Matt: They will. What do you do?
Liam: Check them out. I eat some edamame.
Matt: So you lift the crates. There are only two of them, and they're relatively small: two feet by two feet. The first one, you open up and look inside, and there are rusted tools. Long iron bars; some appear wrench-like. It looks like whatever mechanism was used as the early aqueduct system for this, this box contained materials, though you're uncertain as to what their application was into this system.
Taliesin: I'll take a glance at these things to memorize their general shape.
Travis: After you're done with them, I'll actually take them.
Matt: You go and grab a few. There's five rods of varying widths. Some appear to be ratchet elements, where they fit around different metal caps. There's one that looks like a wide crowbar that's used to hold or wedge elements separately. Very basic; nothing too intricate.
Taliesin: This is some basic shit that you're picking up right now.
Liam: That was the first crate. What's the next crate? Is it whoopee cushions?
Matt: No, the next crate you open up and it looks mostly empty, but it looks like there are a couple of rows of small glass vials, half of which appear to be broken or shattered, but there are three remaining, with a faint bluish liquid on the inside.
Laura: Does that sound familiar to us at all?
Liam: Healing potions are blue.
Matt: These don't resemble healing potions, actually.
Taliesin: Do these resemble underwater breathing?
Matt: They do. You've seen these before.
Liam: For toilet diving.
Taliesin: Emergency, yeah. Let's take those.
Travis: Okay. I got them.
Liam: I give one of them to Percy for being so sharp. I give one to my sister. You don't need it. I keep one. No, I don't. I'm barely alive. I give one to Scanlan.
Sam: I give it to Grog.
Travis: I've got one. I've got two, actually.
Sam: All right, then I'll keep one.
Taliesin: Just in case.
Travis: I've got two vials of underwater breathing.
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: Why is there no water running?
Travis: Any other boxes to smash?
Matt: No.
Marisha: I'd imagine because he's vertical now instead of horizontal.
Travis: And undead.
Sam: Let's keep going up the stairs.
Matt: All right. Heading up the stairs in the same order?
Liam: 30 to 40 feet in advance.
Matt: All righty. 30 to 40 feet in advance? Okay. You make your way up the staircase. Roll stealth.
Travis: Immovable Rod's out.
Liam: 28 for stealth.
Matt: Okay. Are you stealthing, as well? Are you going along with him, or are you letting him go ahead?
Liam: She's coming.
Laura: Natural 20.
Matt: All right, so the two of you very quietly make your way ahead, the rest of you keeping within, I assume, the range of the ring. The staircase doesn't go too far; it goes maybe 30 or so feet, and then it opens into a hallway. You're stepping up through the floor, and there's about ten feet behind and to the sides of you. There's a slight element of a cave-in to the left of you, where part of the stone seems to have collapsed, and a bit of the earth has filtered in. It's a smooth stone floor that's tiled in places. The walls continue on, a somewhat trapezoid-like angle. There are other portions of the wall that have caved in on certain elements, and there are two large pillars that mark the center of this hallway, either used as support beams or decorative, but they go from ceiling to floor. You glance over the side, and you see a distant staircase on the far end of this hallway, maybe 80 to 90 feet from where you are, if not further, with larger stairs. You've seen some of the dwarven-based ones. These seem to be a little more grandiose as they lift up higher and higher. Part of that hallway is completely collapsed; it's a wall of fallen earth. But there's a hole carved out of it. There's a tunnel that has been pushed through. You hear this very faint buzzing sound. Very faint. This (low humming). A very faint vibration. You also see a figure stepping from a side wall crevasse, an opening of a similar shape to the circular opening in the wall.
Liam: I hide.
Laura: We were stealthed.
Matt: You guys were stealthed. You re-hide, while stealthed.
Liam: That's what I do.
Matt: You hear some muttering across the way in the shadow. There's a faint source of light that looks like a glowing orb that's floating in the air above and giving this faint greenish-white light; a bauble that's giving a light source to whatever this cloaked figure is. You hear the muttering, and two more walk down the staircase to join them. You recognize, from the faint bit of light, a glimmer of metal around the neck of one of them that is the symbol, the hole with the metallic fork. You see Remnants of Vecna.
Sam: Remnants?
Matt: You don't see any faces. You see a glimmer or shine on the metal from the light cast from the bauble.
Marisha: What?
Taliesin: What?
Taliesin: This can't be happening right now.
Liam: We don't recognize faces? We don't see faces?
Matt: You see hooded figures that are walking in. There are three of them.
Marisha: Oh, so they're cultists.
Matt: Okay. So which ones are you aiming at? There's three of them.
Laura: I'm aiming at the first one I saw.
Matt: Okay, the first one you saw just stepped out of the center of the hall there, and then the two others walked down the hallway. You're aiming at the one that came out of the side of the wall?
Laura: Has he seen the two coming down the stairway yet?
Matt: There's been discussion over the shoulder. They seem to be aware of each other's presence, but they haven't come together to engage as three in the same area yet.
Liam: I will follow my sister's lead. If she attacks one, I send one to another one and two to the third.
Laura: I'll attack the first so he can take the second.
Liam: One. Two, three.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: All righty.
Laura: These are auto-crits, though, because we are surprising them.
Matt: This is true.
Laura: Can I Hunter's Mark him?
Matt: Yes, you can Hunter's Mark him.
Laura: Oh, so we don't have to roll for attack? It's an auto-crit.
Matt: Well, no, you still have to roll to see if you aim. You have advantage on the attack.
Laura: 27.
Liam: 27 on my first.
Matt: Okay, both hit.
Laura: Second attack. Oh my god, 20. 20 on the second attack.
Matt: Okay, that hits.
Laura: I got a one on both. Thank god they were both at advantage.
Liam: 27. 19, 25.
Matt: Okay, all three hit.
Laura: And they're all critical?
Matt: No, the first one crits.
Liam: Oh, really? Okay. The first is sneak attack.
Matt: They're not all crit. Once you hit the person they are no longer surprised.
Laura: Okay, so the first one is a crit. Solid! That's okay.
Marisha: Yeah, I feel so bad for you.
Liam: You are the most powerful person at this table.
Laura: 14, plus six lightning damage. Oh wait, you know what? Should I single out the lightning damage or say what all the damage is?
Matt: Well, it's an auto-crit, so lightning damage is doubled, as well.
Laura: So it's 12 lightning damage.
Matt: Right, plus whatever your sneak attack damage is.
Laura: Okay.
Taliesin: Yeah, that's happening.
Travis: You already did 40 point of damage without doubling.
Laura: Don't do that.
Sam: Travis, shut up! These two and their gigantic damage rolls.
Taliesin: Huge, mammoth.
Sam: Huge, bulbous.
Taliesin: Turgid.
Laura: I had already rolled that, but it was a six again, so 40, plus 12 lightning damage. On the first.
Matt: 52 points of damage.
Liam: I got 48 on my first, but that's it. 48, done.
Laura: I didn't do Hunter's Mark damage on that first guy.
Matt: This is on the other guy; the second guy.
Laura: Add ten because of Hunter's Mark on the first one.
Marisha: Little bit of that reach around.
Sam: The dice smell a little bit.
Liam: 48. 20, ten.
Matt: So 48 on your critical.
Liam: That's the critical. That's the dice damage. I rolled really low.
Matt: 20, ten. Okay, then. All righty. Are you shooting the same guy, Laura?
Laura: Yes, I was all on one, unless he went down. Would I notice?
Matt: No, he did not go down.
Laura: Okay, then the second one. 21 on the second one.
Matt: That does it.
Travis: How much damage? Total.
Matt: Total on that round from you would have been 110 with the first hit between the two of you on the first guy and the second hit. So the one that was off to the side, who is leaning forward, hunched over, and looking over his shoulder. The first arrow goes into the throat and he reaches for it, and as he does, the dagger (impact) into the face, into the socket where there is no eye, which then looks up with a groan. Finger goes out as soon as the second arrow takes the other eye out, and then falls back down to the ground, dead. Pointing your direction like (gasping). As soon as the two other daggers go into the other two, they both see the one crumple to the ground, the two left there, the guy who is standing at the stairs--
Liam: May I also dump some poison?
Matt: Sure, into which one?
Liam: Into the first one. I did one into my first target and two into the second; the poison would have gone into the second person. It's a DC of 15.
Matt: All righty. DC of 15? Yeah, that succeeds. 16.
Liam: So nothing, right?
Matt: Nothing, yeah.
Liam: Balls!
Matt: As soon as the one crumples to the ground and the two other daggers into the other two that are there, they (grunt). They see the one fall. The one in the center of the chamber glances over his shoulder and says, "It seems I'm the lucky one. Odell, run back and tell that Viskorad found sneaky prey." The one immediately to the left begins to run up the stairs.
Laura: Can I shoot him again before he runs away?
Matt: Nope because you took your turn. This is their reaction.
Sam: Oh shit. You need help, Matt?
Liam: Initiative!
Matt: We're about to roll initiative, motherfuckers.
Laura: Sorry, guys. We did it.
Marisha: Viskon? We've heard the name Viskon before.
Sam: We've also heard the name Odell.
Liam: Yeah, Odell.
Marisha: Odell comma tell Viskon we have visitors. Wait, when did we hear Odell before?
Liam: I just know we've heard it.
Sam: There's been three Jamieson's in our campaign, too. Matt isn't an infinite fount of names.
Matt: Everyone else is still down the stairs right there.
Laura: I wonder if we should have let them talk for a second. Oh, well.
Liam: That's not our way.
Matt: Apparently not, as recent events have shown. So now, I need everyone to roll initiative.
Travis: Don't fuck me, Gil.
Laura: No, it's okay. I've got advantage.
Marisha: Don't let them leave. I agree with that.
Taliesin: Leave one of them alive, but don't let them leave.
Liam: Not good for Pike.
Marisha: Did everyone roll shittily?
Travis: No.
Matt: 25 to 20?
Laura: 23.
Travis: 21.
Liam: Get that long range. Get that runner.
Matt: 20 to 15?
Sam: 18.
Marisha: 15.
Matt: All righty.
Marisha: What's up, bro?
Liam: I'm not fast.
Taliesin: 13.
Liam: 13.
Travis: That's weird for you.
Taliesin: It's almost as low as I can go.
Matt: 13 for Pike? No, that's Vax. What's Pike?
Liam: Pike clocked in at four.
Matt: Pike is clocking in as Pike.
Liam: Yeah. Where's the remix of this song?
Taliesin: I know. (beatboxes)
Matt: All righty, so beginning of the round. Vex, you're up first.
Laura: Okay, I'm going to cast Grasping Vine around here, so he can lash up and try to catch that wizard, the cloaked guy that's running away.
Matt: What's he have to roll for that?
Laura: He has to roll a dexterity save above 15.
Marisha: Get it! Get it, son!
Matt: That's an eight. He is running up the stairs.
Laura: So it snatches his ankle.
Matt: And then drags him.
Laura: Backwards. Then I'm going to shoot him twice.
Matt: All right. Go for it.
Taliesin: Not that one. That one looks like he knows too much.
Laura: What is that? 32.
Matt: 32, that hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
Laura: 14, plus four lightning damage. I don't get sneak attack on this guy, though?
Matt: No.
Laura: Okay. 14, plus four lightning damage, and then I'm going to hit him again. That is also a 32. No, that's-- well, it's very high. 27? 28
Matt: 28. All right, that hits. Roll damage. Grog, you're up next. You're in the back of the marching order.
Travis: We're not up at the top, are we?
Matt: No. So you've got at least 25, 30 feet before you can get to the top there.
Laura: 12, plus six lightning damage.
Matt: Nice. All right, 36 points of damage in one round. The arrows (impact) as he is pulled through the rock and rubble by the Grasping Vine that is currently wrapped around him.
Laura: I am going to use my movement to stand behind this little pillar right here.
Matt: Okay, go for it. Grog, you're up.
Travis: As I hear the sweet melodical Miami Vice tunes of warfare being played, can I double dash up past my mates and into the fray?
Matt: Sure, so at 30 feet, it'll get you right at the edge of the stairs. Still have 20 more feet you can go.
Travis: Yeah, straight towards them.
Matt: All right, so that's there.
Travis: Then can I use dash to go the rest of the way?
Matt: To close the gap there? Sure.
Travis: Now, I only have my bonus action left, so can I go into a rage?
Matt: You may, yeah. All righty, so at that point you go into a rage.
Travis: That's my turn.
Matt: All righty, so now it is his turn.
Marisha: You have that guy? But this guy was the runner, I thought.
Taliesin: Yeah, but he's vined.
Marisha: Okay. He's currently grasped.
Matt: Okay, as soon as you rush up into his face, you hear the individual, the hood pulled back at this point. You see shaved entirely bald, older, late fifties to early sixties, missing one eye, but in that socket you can see a faint spark of arcane energy. Shouting out amongst the space, "Glory and reward is mine! Wraiths, go forth and devour, while I bring oblivion to them." As you rush up, is going to cast Wall of Force right in the space between there.
Marisha: Between him and Grog?
Laura: (singing) The space between.
Sam: (singing) Your wicked lies.
Matt: It pushes you back five feet, and now there is a Wall of Force that is blocking that side of the hallway from where he is.
Marisha: Him and the other guy? Or just between him? How big is it?
Matt: Sorry, the entirety of this chamber is the Wall of Force.
Marisha: Fucking fuckface.
Travis: What does Wall of Force do? Can I walk through that shit?
Marisha: Yeah, it just might hurt.
Travis: Will it?
Matt: As soon as the wall appears there, you see a slight short barrier that forces you back about five feet. You catch your back foot, and now as the barrier finishes shimmering, it's invisible. Looks like there's nothing there. He's grinning from there. He glances over to the right into the hole in the wall where his friend was earlier.
Travis: Which was that way, right?
Matt: As he glances over, he goes, "Odell, bring me the sphere." You hear the humming noise, the faint humming vibrational noise, now louder. That ends his turn. Actually, he is going to take a step back up onto the stairs there. Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: I'm up? What can I do?
Matt: You're 20 feet down from the staircase.
Sam: My speed is 25.
Matt: That'll get you right up to about there, with five-foot steps.
Marisha: Don't let them leave!
Sam: Oh god, this looks like a crazy thing.
Travis: (counting) 60 is how far away he is.
Sam: Wow. There's a Wall of Force. Do I see a Wall of Force?
Matt: You don't. You actually rush up, and it looks like it's an open hallway right now.
Sam: Okay. I see Grog in attack mode, right? I see these two bad guys. I will send a Lightning Bolt at somebody.
Matt: Which one?
Sam: Looks like I can't see this guy because there is a pillar in between, so the other guy.
Matt: That's true, so it'll be that guy. All right. You'll have to move off to the side, or else you're going to hit Grog with the Lightning Bolt. It's going to be hard. He's up a few steps, though. You could probably aim it above and hit him without Grog. I'll let you do that. As you get to the top, you release your bolt of lightning. (crackling noise) It arcs forward, and as it gets right above Grog, it hits something solid and splinters. No effect.
Liam: So this Wall of Force visually is floor to ceiling?
Matt: You don't know; you don't see it. He saw a faint shimmer because something pushed him out of this space, but right now you have no visual perspective. That's going to end Scanlan's turn, I believe. All right. The other guy, who is currently held by the vine that falls limp off of his body--
Laura: It falls limp off of his body?
Matt: Well, it doesn't wrap around or keep him held. Every turn, it can pull something towards it. He's going to glance over towards the side, listening to what the other, Viskorad, said. Okay. At which point, that humming gets louder and louder.
Taliesin: He had the map. If he built the map, there's a way out.
Matt: You watch as a two-foot-wide black sphere of void-like nothingness comes carving through the stone wall immediately to the left of you, Grog, leaving a completely disintegrated form roughly the shape of its sphere. It's coasting in towards and into your space.
Travis: It's a Sphere of Annihilation.
Liam: Yes, it is.
Taliesin: Oh shit, son!
Laura: Oh god!
Sam: Is someone controlling it?
Matt: So Grog, I need you to go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw.
Laura: Oh my god, roll so well! Do you get advantage?
Travis: I do. I have Danger Sense. It fucks you up. Yeah, it hurts real bad.
Sam: I see this happening, right?
Travis: 16.
Matt: 16, okay. You manage to duck out of the way as it enters the space, and you can feel this weird energy. Your beard is almost being pulled toward it, and the loud vibrating (vibration) hum before you. It's like staring into an absolute nothingness.
Travis: Take my life, but not my beard.
Marisha: Who looks like he's controlling it? Odell?
Matt: The guy who is being pulled by her is concentrating and moving it over, at that point.
Laura: Oh, the guy in red? The guy in red is controlling it!
Matt: All right. That's going to end his turn. Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: (yells)
Matt: I've got to rest for a second. Controlling enemies hurt. It's okay.
Sam: We can get dudes behind you to hold you up.
Matt: We'll see how I can do it. Keyleth, your turn.
Marisha: Oh my god. So much has changed from what I thought I was going to do.
Matt: You're about 25 feet down the staircase.
Marisha: Yeah. So I come up from the staircase.
Matt: Okay. That gets you up to the edge there, where the staircase stops.
Travis: Does the Sphere of Annihilation get an attack of opportunity if I run away?
Taliesin: Probably not.
Sam: Is it a thing? Is it a weapon?
Matt: It's a black sphere of void. One of the guys is looking focused, concentrating on it, and it moved under his willpower in the direction of Grog.
Travis: It's real bad.
Marisha: Okay. I'm going to come up. I'm trying to think of what I have in range, and I'm terrified. And I'm going to stick with my original instinct and do Wall of Stone and try and wall these guys in so they can't run. I think they can still carve through it with their big black death orb now.
Travis: They can, but at least they'll be here.
Taliesin: They'll have to move the orb to do that.
Marisha: Okay. I can do ten ten-foot by ten-foot panels, so I want to be a semicircle block off, bring up a whole wall of stone behind them.
Matt: Okay. Hold on a second.
Travis: Who can get to the other side? You have Dimension Door. But that's it, right? That's the only person that has that kind of a thing.
Matt: As you attempt to concentrate and create a Wall of Stone, you are unable to pick a point or an area beyond the barrier.
Travis: The Wall of Force? No!
Laura: Say it again?
Travis: And you need to focus, or is it a random?
Matt: It doesn't fizzle the spell. You have no area to release it on. The barrier, while invisible, is preventing targeting a specific area to create.
Taliesin: We need to dispel this shit.
Marisha: I do have Dispel Magic.
Matt: You've used your action to attempt it. You didn't lose the spell slot, but you spent your action attempting it.
Travis: Hey, man. That was a nice try.
Marisha: Can't cast through it.
Laura: Good to know. But the orb went through it?
Matt: No, the orb is on the other side.
Marisha: Even though it's a nature thing, going up underneath there, I can't get around it? No?
Matt: You're targeting on the other side of the wall. It has to be in visual range for you to create it to happen.
Marisha: (singing) I'll see you on the other side of the wall. (laughter)
Matt: All right. That's Keyleth's turn. No, sorry. At the end of Keyleth's turn, you hear this (breathy noise) sound as these two shadowy figures emerge from the nearby walls.
Liam: Ghosts! Shadows!
Travis: No. What? Ghosts or wraiths?
Marisha: Wraiths.
Liam: There's ten different kinds of things like that.
Marisha: Hey, was wraiths what fucked me and you up when we were evil Vax and Keyleth?
Taliesin: Oh shit, and look what they're doing!
Matt: This one hovers over and lands behind Keyleth. And it's going to attempt, as it seems to shift through the pillar--
Marisha: I look over my shoulder and go  Oh no!
Matt: This one here stays within the pillar, and it reaches out, as it's incorporeal, and strikes at you. That is 24 against you, Vex.
Laura: That hits.
Matt: All right. You suffer 21 points of necrotic damage, and I need you to succeed on a constitution saving throw.
Liam: Fuck! Come on.
Travis: My fucking god!
Sam: It's a 20? (screaming)
Matt: All right. Well, you suffer the 21 points of necrotic damage, and your maximum hit points are reduced by 21.
Laura: Forever?
Matt: Until you finish a long rest. The other one's striking at you, Keyleth. That is a 16.
Marisha: Misses!
Matt: That's right, because your AC is 17 with the ring.
Marisha: That's right! I leveled up, motherfuckers!
Matt: All right. Cool. Technically, leveling up didn't affect your AC; however, calculating the magic item did.
Marisha: But I feated, so I'm good!
Matt: I know. So as it swings toward you, its claw streaks out and has no effect. And then they both vanish. You want to take an attack of opportunity? You can if you'd like to.
Marisha: War Caster?
Matt: War Caster. You can attempt to cast a spell on it as a reaction, if you'd like. This one's going to back away into the wall, as well. Vex, you also get an attack of opportunity if you'd like, with a melee weapon.
Marisha: Does it have to be a bonus action?
Matt: No, it can be an action. That's part of the War Caster feat.
Laura: I have a dagger, but I don't even have it drawn.
Matt: Then yeah, you're fine.
Liam: They're both out of visual range, right?
Matt: They both are now backing up.
Liam: One's in a pillar, and one went through a wall. Are they moaning and shit, in the wall?
Matt: You can't hear them.
Liam: I can't hear them. Can't see them, can't hear them. All right. Thanks.
Matt: No worries.
Laura: I have resistance to necrotic damage, by the way.
Matt: You do! Then you take ten points of necrotic damage, and your hit points are only reduced by ten.
Laura: Okay.
Marisha: Sorry, I'm trying to figure out what would be a good idea right now.
Taliesin: I have no ideas for anything.
Marisha: I have never done this before, but I have it learned. I will Ice Knife it in its face. Ice Knife! Level one, you create a shard of ice, fling it at-- oh, it's a flingy-thingy. But it's 1d10 piercing damage, and then it explodes?
Matt: Okay. It's right next to you. She has the feat where she can cast the spell as a reaction when something comes at her. Just know that whatever you're hitting is right next to you. So if it explodes, does any radial damage, it might come back and hit you.
Marisha: No, hit or miss, the shard then explodes, the target and each creature within five feet of the point where the ice explodes. Oh. I'm fine. I'm doing it anyway.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and roll to hit.
Travis: And Scanlan's in five feet of her?
Laura: No, he's behind her.
Taliesin: Oh, for fuck sake.
Marisha: What's wrong with us?
Laura: Wasted all of our 20s on goods.
Matt: Tonight is ridiculous.
Marisha: One.
Matt: All right, so as you release the Ice Knife, it slams into the wall. No effect. However, it does still explode, right?
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: So it does what damage?
Marisha: 2d6.
Matt: 2d6 damage. So go ahead and roll 2d6. To both you and the creature?
Taliesin: Yeah, all creatures within range.
Marisha: Technically, reroll ones. Three, four, five, six, seven. Yeah, each creature. Hit or miss, the shard then explodes.
Matt: All right, so you take seven points of ice damage, and it hits the wraith. However, the cold damage doesn't seem to have as much of an effect as you would expect.
Laura: It's a fucking wraith!
Matt: That ends their turn. Percival, you're up.
Taliesin: I hear a whole bunch of commotion, so I'm going to pop my head up out of the hole and see what the fuck is going on.
Matt: All right. You glance up and get just beyond where Keyleth is, pushing past. You have five more feet you can move if you want.
Taliesin: Well, I'm coming up the hole. I take a look. Oh, sweet god. I'm going to take a shot at the guy I see up on the table there.
Matt: Okay, go for it.
Taliesin: That's better.
Matt: Which guy?
Taliesin: Yeah, the gray. And that's 28?
Matt: Okay. (gunshot) You fire a shot and watch as it detonates against some sort of invisible wall that you didn't see was there before, scattering helplessly against the space in the air.
Marisha: I hate this force field shit.
Travis: It explodes near my head, and I'm like Stop shooting into this thing!
Taliesin: I'm going to drop back down the hall.
Matt: All right, you get right back down to right there. That ends your turn, Percy? Vax, you're up.
Liam: Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to dance through to here, where I can see Grog and these guys, and I can see all my friends here, and I'm going to hold my action to attack anyone who comes right up to one of my friends within striking range.
Matt: Okay, good to know. Perfect. Ending Vax's turn, Pike's up.
Laura: Pike comes running up the steps.
Matt: She can get right up to here, and that's as much as she can move. She can still cast a spell if she wants to. She's going to cast Beacon of Hope for all of the allies within range, which is 30 feet.
Matt: All right, so that is everybody but Grog.
Laura: Sorry, Grog.
Travis: That's my fault.
Laura: That gives everybody advantage on wisdom saving throws and death saving throws, and any time you're healed, you regain the maximum number of hit points.
Sam: Even if we move out of the radius?
Matt: It affects everybody at that moment, and then you carry it with you.
Laura: Wisdom and death saving throws.
Liam: You got glitter-bombed with holy goodness.
Marisha: Wisdom and death plus what?
Laura: And full hit points when you get healed.
Taliesin: You don't roll; you get the max.
Marisha: Beautiful.
Matt: Okay. So ending Pike's turn brings us to the top. Vex, your turn.
Laura: Oh, great. Well, I've seen all the things explode. Fucking hell. I'm going to pull out my Vecna symbol, that necklace that we still had, and put it around my neck, because that fucking sphere is out and I don't know if it matters.
Matt: Okay, so you quickly throw it around your neck.
Laura: Do I still have control of the vine?
Matt: Currently, yeah.
Laura: Okay. And it's on the other side of the force?
Matt: This is true.
Laura: So I'm going to use it and I'm going to try to grab a hold of the guy-- the guy in gray is holding the force wall, right? But it probably is a concentration. The guy in red is holding the sphere.
Matt: Correct.
Laura: The guy in red is holding the sphere. I'm going to try to knock him down and see if I can break his hold on the sphere, maybe? Is that stupid?
Matt: He does not make his save. He isn't moved. It wraps around him and pulls him tight against the area where it is again, but it's barely shifted him, so he gets moved a few inches, but doesn't seem to affect him at all.
Laura: That's a bonus action. I still get an action.
Matt: Yep, and movement.
Laura: And movement. Oh god. I'm going to spread out. I'm going to come over here, maybe? Or here. Oh jeez. I don't know. I can't hit anybody! I'm going to wait. I'm going to hold my action until I see something getting through that fucking force wall.
Taliesin: Until there's something to hit.
Laura: So that I can attack him.
Matt: Sounds good. All right, Vex, that's the end of your turn. Grog, you're up.
Travis: I'm going to try and run through the Wall of Force. It's only five feet of my movement, and we'll see what happens.
Matt: All right, you slam face-first into a stone wall. Immediately, the anger fills through you, the familiar smell and taste of iron-like blood as you seem to have busted some element of your nose in the impact.
Travis: Probably some eyelids? Do I go anywhere? Not even an inch?
Matt: No.
Travis: What if I channel all the rage from my life, and I draw on the undead? Okay, cool. I'm going to turn around and run the other way.
Marisha: You didn't get through?
Travis: No, it didn't even give, apparently. (counting) 50, right there.
Matt: Okay. That ends your turn, Grog?
Travis: Yeah, that ends my turn.
Matt: This guy turns around and begins to make his way up the stairs and move double dash, and disappears up the stairs.
Marisha: (screams in frustration)
Travis: We can't do anything. Nobody knows Disintegrate or anything?
Marisha: Whose turn is it?
Matt: That finishes that guy's turn. It is now Scanlan's turn.
Sam: I'm going to take a few steps forward. I will inspire Grog, I guess.
Travis: Or yourself.
Sam: I'm okay.
Travis: Really? Okay.
Sam: I'll sing to him. (singing) Don't mess with that big black ball, it can really fuck you up. I really hate that big black ball, all it better do is miss you, make it miss you.
Matt: Oh my god, that was not my intent in creating this encounter. Take your d12 inspiration die.
Travis: Thank you.
Sam: And I guess I'll Dimension Door, try to go through the Wall of Force. We've tried this before, Matt. Who knows how this shit works?
Travis: And the previous ruling was it worked.
Sam: Yeah, but that could have been a gentle nod.
Matt: The wording is important on this.
Liam: I think the cultist shits his pants and his brain explodes. I think that's in the book.
Matt: I've had to look this up very carefully. With elements like this wall, it's a targeting thing. You cannot target something that is in full cover, total cover, which being behind a wall is. Teleportation, however, you're the target and Dimension Door and Teleport is unaffected by that.
Sam: Matt fucking hates this.
Marisha: Get the runner!
Sam: I don't know where the runner went.
Marisha: He went that way.
Sam: I don't see him, right?
Matt: You saw him run away, you just don't know where he is at the moment.
Sam: Can I gauge roughly how far he went down that hall? Do I see down the hall?
Matt: Not from where you were over there.
Sam: So I'm going next to the red guy.
Liam: Also, if you get out of range of Vex, Vecna knows all.
Laura: Oh yeah. Stay within 60 feet.
Matt: All right, so you Dimension Door there. That's your action.
Sam: That's my everything.
Marisha: We've got to take out these guys' eyeballs.
Matt: That's the end of your turn. At which point, Odell, who's standing there currently, is physically sweating, concentrating on this sphere right now. Looks over and sees you appear and goes, "Viskorad, the little one made it through!"
Sam: Who are you calling little?
Matt: At which point, you glance over your shoulder and you can see that the darting, cloaked one stops and spins and faces towards you.
Sam: That's not good for me, guys.
Marisha: It's not good for you, but it's good for us. Fuck them up!
Travis: Oh god.
Matt: That's as far as they can get. However, it completely disintegrates the central pillar. It is obliterated, like it lays with a top part and a bottom part, but wherever the sphere passes through, about a good six inches around it is turned to dust and is gone.
Laura: Oh my god, what if we fail these rolls?
Matt: He's then going to go back around--
Taliesin: No, he's grappled.
Liam: No, he's grappled.
Matt: No, it doesn't grapple. It just moves things toward it.
Marisha: You're confusing Entanglement with Grasping Vine. Two totally different things.
Matt: He's backing up, and he's looking over at the sphere, concentrating on it. You can see the beads of sweat pouring down his face, and he's glancing over nervously at you, but smiling at the idea that his friend is returning. That's going to end his turn. Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: Okay. Seeing Grog slam into that. Ugh, fuck. This is a pretty beefy spell, yeah? Force Wall? Should I do fifth or sixth level to dispel this? Okay. Fifth or sixth level? Sixth level. I'm going to Dispel Magic this wall.
Matt: Okay. As you focus and concentrate, you release the essence of the Dispel Magic, the burst of arcane energy casts forth, and falls harmlessly against the exterior.
Laura: It's a higher level.
Liam: It's a higher level.
Marisha: Higher than sixth level? The spell.
Matt: Didn't appear to have an effect on the wall.
Travis: Come on, maybe it needed to be something else.
Liam: No. He did what Scanlan does with Counterspell. He beefed it up.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: You can move.
Marisha: It's higher than seventh level? Did you have to roll?
Matt: No effect on it.
Taliesin: Okay, it's going to be okay. Everything's okay.
Liam: So about that long rest...
Marisha: I don't know now, you guys.
Laura: We're fucked.
Marisha: I move forward. I guess. I don't want to move that far forward. No, I don't move that far forward! (laughter)
Marisha: I don't want to die!
Matt: That finishes your turn, Keyleth?
Liam: (singing) I want you to be alive.
Liam: (singing) I want you to be alive.
Marisha: (singing) I want you to be alive.
Laura: Oh no, here they come.
Taliesin: Oh no, here they come.
Matt: They take minor damage being in the physical wall, but that's fine with them.
Liam: Boom, I attack! Sneak attack on the one near Keyleth.
Matt: Emerge. All right, so the one near Keyleth. Go for it.
Laura: What was I holding for? I was holding until I could attack something, or until I could get through the wall? I think it was through the wall.
Matt: The wall.
Liam: All right, 27 on that guy.
Matt: That hits.
Liam: Okay. So that is three, plus three is six, so ten. (counting)
Taliesin: If we can hit them, they're probably squishy.
Matt: You took out one of three between just two of your surprise attacks.
Liam: 34 for the first hit, and I have the second paladin attack, so if it's not dead, I will attack again.
Matt: Go for it.
Liam: That is eight for the second.
Matt: As it emerges from the wall, its blackened shadow form giving off small tendrils of dark black ether and abyssal energy, it reaches out to strike at Keyleth, and you immediately release two daggers in its direction. Both hit its form. It gives this pained sucking sound as you watch its beady, burning red eyes seem to blink in the pain, and it angrily lashes out at Keyleth, its form somewhat more disparate and unable to maintain a corporeal form.
Liam: When is Pike? Is it her turn? No? Okay.
Matt: No, she cast Beacon of Hope. So attacking against Pike. That is 21. What's her AC?
Laura: 23!
Matt: 23. It tries to strike at her, and she manages to take the shield and bash it away. The light from her mace arcing around causes it to flinch, and it actually strikes a little too wide. The one that's arcing towards you, Keyleth, that is fucking 16 again! Yeah, because it's plus six to hit. Okay. You dodge out of the way a second time. It's then going to move back into the wall over here. He's going to move back into the wall, as well. Both of you get reactions.
Laura: Pike definitely takes it. With her Mace of Disruption, she gets an extra 2d6 radiant damage.
Matt: All right, so roll an attack on that one.
Laura: That's a 21 to hit.
Matt: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
Travis: I am wickedly out of my element. I'm running from an 8-ball.
Taliesin: We've got to get everyone away from that thing.
Laura: 27 for Pike.
Matt: 27 points of damage?
Laura: Is it a fiend or an undead? So it has to have a wisdom save of 15.
Matt: If it has 25 hit points or fewer after taking the damage, which it does not. That one has not taken a whole bunch of damage. However, it did take a relatively decent hit, and you watch as she swings the mace out. As it pulls back, where the mace impacts, it seems to almost evaporate part of the shadowed form, and it shrieks as it disappears into the wall.
Liam: For clarification, that is the one I hit, as well, right?
Matt: No, the one that you hit is where she was.
Liam: Oh, Pike hit the other one.
Matt: Correct. Keyleth, are you doing anything as a reaction?
Marisha: Yeah, I'm going to pull out my staff and do a Burning Hands on him. Dexterity saving throw.
Matt: Natural 20, so it takes half damage.
Marisha: Half damage.
Laura: Ooh, that's good. You did the six and the four.
Taliesin: And then there was a third one.
Marisha: And then there's a third one that is a six? Was that right? Six and six is 12, so 16.
Matt: 16 points of fire damage reduced by half which is eight, and even that impact seems to be lessened by the wraith-like being seemingly absorbing some of the heat from the impact.
Laura: Radiant damage is the bomb!
Taliesin: Radiant damage is what we need in here.
Matt: All righty, that ends their turn. Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: I'm going to stay in my little cubby hole. I've got some good visual on a couple of these guys down here. I'm going to yell at everybody to get the fuck away from the ball. I'm going to hold my attack until something happens that's going to give me something to shoot at.
Matt: Okay, so as soon as an enemy reveals itself that you can shoot. Okay, that ends Percy's turn. Vax, you're up.
Liam: Fucking hell. I'm going to do the same thing except I'm going to move to here and wait for something to attack one of my friends.
Taliesin: That's awfully close to the ball.
Liam: I know it is. That's what I do. I'm waiting until one of them attacks one of my friends. One of the undead. I can't do anything about that. That's what I'm doing. That's my turn.
Matt: All right, Pike's turn.
Liam: Stupid, I know. That's what Vax does.
Laura: I can only do this as a bonus action so that she can have that up, right? Okay, she's going to cast Spiritual Weapon. Should she do it at a second level? Okay, she's going to cast Spiritual Weapon up near the wall as a giant sword that looks like it's on fire.
Matt: Whereabouts? On the wall here?
Laura: No, near the wall, yeah. Up close to the wall so that she can attack as soon as that thing is down. And then she's going to hold her physical action until there's something that she can attack.
Matt: Okay, she's holding her physical attack?
Laura: Yeah, her mace.
Matt: Okay, that ends Pikes turn. Vex, you're up.
Laura: Oh, that's me!
Matt: Yeah, that's you, actually.
Liam: You're Vex.
Laura: I'm Vex. I'm going to dart away from this ball as fast as I can, and I'm going to come up here.
Sam: Hey, you broke through!
Laura: I broke through the wall. I can't reach. I'm too fucking-- It's fine; I got it.
Sam: Make Matt stand up, Laura.
Matt: Please do. I appreciate it.
Laura: And I'm going to hold my fucking attack until something comes out that I can attack.
Matt: Okay. All righty.
Marisha: I can't believe I couldn't fucking dispel that wall.
Matt: Grog, you're up.
Travis: Yeah, I am, aren't I? Okay. Cool.
Laura: Wait, I have bonus action still.
Matt: You do.
Laura: Okay, I'm going to use that Grasping Vine that I still have up, and I'm going to re-grab onto that stupid guy's fucking neck and yank him towards the wall he's right in front of.
Matt: That's a 15. What's your DC on that?
Laura: 15.
Matt: He succeeds, unfortunately. It slaps out towards him and this time-- I forget the adage, but never mind. He dodges it. (laughter)
Liam: It took 425 hours, but we did it. We broke his brain.
Matt: Blame it on the painkillers. The vine whooshes out and tries to wrap around him. He dodges out of the way, and it slaps harmlessly against the stone and withdraws back into the small crack of stone where it's based. That ends your turn. All right, Grog.
Travis: I'm going to put my faith in Scanlan that some sort of impossible miracle happens. (counting) 30. Right up against the wall. Can I look to the left down that hallway? Can I see down there at all? Is it blocking the hallway off from vision? Is that a moveable space?
Matt: Looking off, it looks like the orb was being used to carve a path.
Travis: It hadn't finished doing it?
Matt: No. It was maybe 25 or so feet down and was hitting solid rock.
Laura: My spell DC may be higher. I don't know if I have increased that in a while.
Liam: It's eight, plus proficiency bonus, plus her spell bonus.
Laura: So my spell DC is 17.
Matt: You need to keep up on that, girl.
Marisha: That was how I lost to Grog in our battle.
Laura: I wanted it around his neck, just to make him annoyed.
Matt: It hits him against the wall. He's still glancing over his shoulder.
Taliesin: He's lost visual range of the ball?
Matt: No, he can still look over the rubble there.
Travis: Not enough to make a concentration check?
Matt: If that's what it does.
Travis: I'm there. I can't get into that hole anymore, can I?
Matt: Not with the way the Wall of Force is placed, no.
Travis: Fair enough. I will hold my action until someone comes within melee distance.
Matt: Okay, ending Grog's turn. At the top of the staircase--
Laura: Oh no! He's coming back for Scanlan!
Matt: This guy here, we'll say he got about that far from the stairs and continues that way.
Marisha: Sanctuary!
Taliesin: Like he's parting the Red Sea.
Taliesin: You shall not pass!
Marisha: You shall not pass!
Laura: Oh my god, we're going against Gandalf right now, you guys.
Taliesin: That's not Gandalf. That's a cosplayer.
Liam: Do you know many hobbits I have under my cloak?
Taliesin: Five hobbits in a cloak. That's all it is. It's not a wizard.
Matt: He glances down at the staircase where you are, and as he begins to smile, the flash in the eye begins to glow briefly, a pale comparison to Vecna, but there is an essence of energy lent to him from his worship of the newly risen deity. He begins to speak in a language you don't understand. And as he speaks one alien word-- how many hit points do you have?
Sam: A lot. 167.
Matt: Fuck, okay. I miscalculated. No effect.
Sam: Power Word?
Matt: Power Word  Stun. He assumed the smaller stature of the gnome was not as hearty.
Travis: He's upset that he miscalculated. The DM wants blood!
Liam: That's what he gets for profiling.
Matt: He's going to continue moving upward, 30 feet back up into the staircase as he keeps focusing on you. That's going to end his turn. You're up, Scanlan.
Sam: Hold on. I need to look up the range of a fucking spell. How far is he from me?
Matt: It's hard to tell at this point. You'd say somewhere between 50, 60, 70 feet.
Liam: I bet your spell is 120 feet, Sam.
Sam: I'm looking. That one's not.
Liam: Is it Thaumaturgy? Because that's right where your eyes are.
Sam: You said how far? Oh shit.
Matt: Between 50 and 70 feet from you.
Laura: You can move.
Liam: You can move.
Sam: Yeah, I'm going to move 25 feet towards him.
Matt: Okay, so that puts you up here.
Sam: And with my darkvision, do I get a sense for how far he is from me now?
Matt: Yeah, you'd say he's about 40 feet from you.
Sam: Fuck no, it's not. Shit, I need 30.
Laura: You can move five more feet. You've got more movement.
Sam: No. That's my movement. I have tiny little nubs.
Travis: Tiny little nubs?
Sam: Yeah.
Liam: What about long-range shit, man?
Sam: That's okay. Yeah, I've got longer-range shit, but it's not as bad news.
Marisha: Keep them from running away.
Travis: Damn it, Matt. Why'd you have to back up?
Matt: Because that tactically made sense.
Liam: Bigby's Hand him? Grab him?
Sam: I'm thinking. I'm trying to decide between two things.
Travis: Yeah, do it. Take your time, baby. Take your time. Taliesin, give him a backrub. Come on, let's focus up here. There you go. Support. Feel the love.
Marisha: This is all on you, man. This is all on you.
Travis: Do your thing. Listen, Shadow of War comes out October 10th. A lot of us are in it.
Sam: It's going to have a lot of wisdom. All right. I will Bigby's Hand. I assume he's got a lot of wisdom, so I will Bigby's Hand him. At level seven. And I will punch the shit out of him.
Laura: Punch him back toward us. Bigby's Hand on the opposite side of him and punch him back toward us.
Marisha: That's a good call.
Matt: All right, so that is 8d8 force damage if you hit. Roll a melee spell attack.
Laura: Inspire yourself!
Taliesin: Inspire yourself!
Sam: I didn't. I forgot. I rolled an 18.
Matt: 18 hits. He's a caster; he doesn't have a lot of armor.
Marisha: Kill him!
Matt: All right, so roll 8d8 force damage.
Taliesin: I have three.
Sam: And I've got one.
Liam: That's just some dude from Sea Org in a bathrobe. Punch him!
Taliesin: Wow, that was a deep cut.
Sam: Wait. Shit. What did I just roll? 16 plus four. That's 20. And then this is another-- 40.
Matt: 40 points of force damage.
Sam: 40 points of force damage.
Matt: All right, that's a 20 DC concentration check.
Sam: Yeah.
Travis: Come on.
Matt: 16. No.
All: Wall down!
Laura: Did we notice? Did we notice that the wall went down?
Matt: No, you don't see it.
Sam: I don't know. Right?
Matt: But Grog would feel it. Grog is sitting there waiting for something, as Bigby's Hand full-on sucker punches him in the body, and he slams against the steps and has to shake his head as he glances at the giant fist and down at you.
Sam: As a bonus action, can I do anything?
Matt: If you want to do a bonus action, you can't do Bigby's Hand again.
Sam: No, but can I throw something to see if it goes through the wall?
Matt: Sure. I'll let you do that. Roll an attack roll, just to aim it.
Sam: Sure. 17, plus I don't know.
Matt: What are you throwing?
Sam: Scanlan found these two really crappy daggers in the desk in the casino.
Matt: He pulls one of these jeweled daggers that he wore and throws it behind, and Grog, you watch as this dagger passes through.
Taliesin: I see that, and I take three shots at this fucker up here immediately. How far away is he?
Matt: Which guy? The who Bigby's Hand just punched? Okay, he is about 120 feet.
Taliesin: I'm going to use Bad News, then, because that is within range for my fucking sniper rifle. He's going to take that.
Laura: I'm going to shoot at the dude in red in front of me.
Taliesin: I can't use a bonus action, and I have to reload once, so I can only take two shots with my action. I can't take three. So two shots with Bad News. Here we go. That's a 25 and 27 to hit.
Matt: Both hit.
Taliesin: First shot is 22 points of damage. Second shot is not as good. 14 points of damage.
Matt: So as you fire those two shots, the echoing noise of Bad News's explosions echoes through the hallway and stairway above. Vex.
Laura: I'm going to sharpshooter him, the guy right in front of me.
Taliesin: There's a lot of noises going on in this place. I think it'll be okay.
Marisha: Oh, it's fine. There are tunnels collapsing and shit. It's fine. I'm not concerned about the noise at the moment.
Laura: 22 to hit?
Matt: 22 does hit.
Laura: 21 damage on the first. And then 19 on the second. That's also Sharpshooter.
Matt: Nice.
Laura: No, that's 19 to hit.
Matt: Gotcha. That hits.
Laura: 27 on the second.
Matt: All right, nice. The guy who's controlling the sphere, after the first arrow strikes him right in the chest, he looks and starts to run up the stairway, and as it does, you take aim with your second arrow and release it, and it hits the base of the skull. You watch him go down one of the stairs.
Taliesin: So the sphere is still there?
Matt: The sphere is still there.
Laura: But he doesn't have control over it anymore. This guy in red is down, so all that's left is the guy and the wraiths?
Taliesin: Was there a third guy?
Laura: We killed him. That was the first guy we killed.
Matt: That finishes Scanlan's turn, right?
Laura: Yeah, that was your turn.
Sam: Yeah, I'm done.
Matt: Keyleth's turn.
Marisha: Okay. I run up as far as I can, 30 feet. Do I see this motherfucker?
Matt: Yeah, you see him. You have a 60-foot range of darkvision?
Marisha: Or I see the glimmering of Bigby's Hand?
Matt: Yeah, I'd say you could probably see him okay. A little bit. It's very dark, but barely.
Marisha: Fireball! (laughter)
Taliesin: That's an answer.
Matt: As you rush up, from the edge of the staff, a bead of red light engulfs the hallway above in flames. You see a split second of him and Bigby's Hand's outlines before fire engulfs the space. Go ahead and roll damage on that. That's a natural 20 on his save, so he gets half damage.
Marisha: What the fuckballs?
Matt: I didn't even roll with advantage on that one.
Sam: You said Fireball on this guy? Bigby's Hand takes damage.
Marisha: Does he? Magical?
Sam: Yeah, he has hit points.
Taliesin: He could roll a save, though.
Sam: He could!
Matt: Let's check. Yep, it has no bonus, so you roll a d20 and see what you get.
Sam: 11.
Marisha: 29 points of damage.
Sam: It's fine. Bigby's Hand has 167 hit points.
Matt: Yeah, it has your hit points.
Laura: That's amazing!
Sam: Yeah, it's me.
Matt: That ends Keyleth's turn. He's still alive. This one's going to move through the hallway here.
Marisha: He's still going after my ass?
Matt: This one's going after Pike.
Liam: I get to attack. I've been holding.
Laura: Pike gets to attack. Pike has been holding her action to attack as soon as she could, too.
Matt: So Pike gets her attack, and so do you.
Laura: So 20 to hit on Pike.
Matt: 20 to hit? That hits.
Laura: Where is my other d8? Here it is. (counting)
Liam: When you hold, does bonus action carry over?
Matt: Nope, just the action.
Laura: So it's 22.
Matt: 22. All right. And what's the saving throw?
Laura: Saving throw is 15.
Matt: 15. Four, no. As it comes out of the wall reaching for Pike, she swings wide with the mace. As it slams into it, there's a flash of divine energy. Her eyes seem to pulse with a matching burst of radiant power, and as it hits, the creature squeals and squeaks as the light from the mace actually dashes it from this existence or any other. That is scattered into nothing from the shadows.
Liam: I rolled an 18 and a one.
Matt: 18 hits. One misses.
Liam: Okay, so sneak attack. One.
Sam: One misses?
Laura: I know, right?
Liam: 39 for the second attack.
Matt: 39 for the second attack. All righty. And with that, as this one reaches out towards Keyleth, your dagger strikes the back of its body, and as it impacts, you watch as its shadowed form turns into nothing but a splash of dark, half-existing ether, which then fades as your dagger clatters to the ground motionless.
Liam: Back to the belt.
Matt: All right. Percival, you're up.
Laura: Kill him!
Taliesin: Reload. Going to take another shot.
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: Going to take a shot. Yeah, let's take another shot. Probably got a low AC. Let's make this a sharpshooter, just for fun. Yeah. That's a sharpshooter shot, so that's a 24 to hit?
Matt: 24 hits.
Taliesin: All right. So let's do (counting) 26 points of damage.
Matt: 26 points of damage. (gunshot) The echo of the impact as you watch part of the lower jaw and throat of the cultist in the robe gets blown apart. He stumbles back onto the steps that he had barely started to get up off to and you watch and you hear the horrible coughing sound as his last moments of life are robbed of it as it tries to get back up and then stumbles right back and bleeds out against the steps.
Taliesin: We can still interrogate him. He doesn't have to be alive for that. Any other problems?
Liam: How's the ball doing?
Matt: It's hovering there in the center of the hall.
Laura: We can't do anything about that floating ball. Cover it with a handkerchief.
Marisha: You beat me to it, man.
Taliesin: Let's rifle through these guys' stuff. Which one do we want to interrogate?
Marisha: Keyleth goes up to the red robe.
Taliesin: Let's throw gray robe into the annihilation ball. Let's get rid of him.
Travis: Vax. Why don't you go down the hallway and see if anyone else is coming? Keep watch.
Laura: But stay within 60 feet. Everybody gather up around me again.
Liam: Sis, come up to where Scanlan is so I can go a little further ahead.
Matt: Everyone is barely still within 60 feet.
Taliesin: Everyone gather up. We're going to get our stuff.
Laura: Avoid the ball.
Marisha: Vax, can I borrow a dagger?
Liam: Yeah. I give her Whisper.
Marisha: I take it and I stab it in his other eye. Red robe guy.
Matt: Okay. (splat) Other eye is destroyed.
Sam: I'm going to use Bigby's Hand to grab the sphere.
Matt: Do you? Okay. Bigby's Hand reaches over and grabs towards the sphere, and as Bigby's form attempts to grasp the chaotic point of destructive energy, Bigby's Hand suffers 26 points of force damage and is forced to pull back.
Sam: That's not so bad.
Matt: But cannot grasp it. Cannot move it. (electrical shock)
Laura: I'm going to rifle through the robes of red robe.
Taliesin: I'm going to get Odell.
Matt: That's the one she's rifling through.
Taliesin: Oh, okay. There was a third guy, right, that they killed early on?
Matt: Oh, the first guy. Yeah. Okay, gotcha.
Taliesin: Assume we're going through everybody and taking their shit.
Liam: I'm standing as far from Vex as I can, but I can't go much farther because obviously-- yeah.
Matt: Okay. Interestingly enough, based on the current scenario and what preparation has been, no money on them. They have no worldly possessions that are what you consider of use. They each carry a gnarled wooden wand that they've been using as a focus for their spellcasting. Beyond that, they have nothing on them except for the one that you shot has, you notice the left hand is withered and gray, the skin is pulled taut against the bone. But beyond that, there is no other possessions on them, beyond the symbol of Vecna they wear around their throat.
Marisha: How many of those symbols do we still have, and how many robes do we still have?
Laura: Well, we can grab their robes, I don't know how many of those we have, but I think we also have a necklace.
Liam: Also, we can have Pickle talk to one of these arseholes.
Taliesin: I think that's a good idea.
Marisha: The guy that I'm standing over, red robe, I'm going to rip his necklace off.
Matt: Okay. You tear it off.
Laura: I'm going to take his robes.
Taliesin: Oh yeah, we're taking all this shit.
Matt: So you take every set of robes. And these robes are different from the robes that you had seen in Thar Amphala before. These appear to be a little more ornate. They seem to have a little higher station, which is why it's interesting that beyond the robes and some basic undergarments and the wand, they have nothing on them. They are a sheer conduit of their own power.
Taliesin: Were they drilling? I want to take a little bit of an inspection. Were they drilling with this thing? Is that why they had it?
Matt: Looking around the pathway, you can see that a lot of the staircase probably was more caved in, but has been cleared out by the movement of this orb. It's being used as a form of excavation tool as they push deeper into the catacombs here.
Marisha: So they were holding on to that orb the whole time.
Laura: Yeah, the guy in the red was controlling it.
Marisha: Yeah. He didn't cast it, though. We didn't see him cast that.
Laura: It came out of the wall.
Matt: Yeah, it came out of that little gap on the side there.
Sam: I'm going to go over to the sphere and say to it: I command thee to respect my authority and obey me as your new master.
Matt: Are you trying to exert your will on the sphere?
Sam: I'm intimidating the sphere.
Matt: Make an intelligence arcana check.
Sam: Intelligence arcana check?
Matt: Just an arcana check.
Sam: Oh! 19.
Matt: 19? And you're standing right next to the sphere to push your will into it?
Sam: Yeah, I came closer to it.
Matt: Okay. As you stand there, you focus on the orb, and you can feel your will push past the event horizon of the sphere. However, the force is too strong inside, and as you pull out of it instinctually, it moves towards you. (screaming)
Taliesin: Why did you have to tamper with the fundamental forces of nature?
Matt: Yeah. Ten feet. Which is right where you are, so I need you to make a dexterity saving throw.
Liam: Matthew McConaughey is going to reach out of it for you.
Sam: That's not good. 11.
Matt: 11?
Sam: Bigby, save me!
Matt: The orb pulls back and slams into the edge of his gnomish face and chest, and you watch as his flesh is pulled towards and disintegrated at the exterior of the sphere.
Laura: Can we reach down and grab him away from it?
Marisha: Yeah, Grasping Vine!
Matt: You take 30 points of force damage, and it's currently now right in your square, right up against you.
Laura: I use my Grasping Vine and I yank him away from it.
Marisha: Yeah, move away!
Matt: Okay. So you all push him out of the way and the vine pulls him.
Travis: Two-Face!
Matt: Yeah, you look a little rough.
Laura: Scanlan, you're hideous now.
Sam: Don't look at me! I'm fine.
Travis: Some other voice starts coming out of him.
Sam: I think I can take this thing.
Liam: "So did you want me to talk to one of these guys?"
Matt: You got the sense that there is a way to exert your will over it the way these guys did, but in that moment, your will faltered, and you didn't quite understand the nature of the sphere.
Sam: I just need to try again harder.
Marisha: Wait!
Laura: You got to roll higher than a 19. Can you give yourself inspiration?
Sam: This is an ability check, right?
Matt: This is an ability check, yes.
Taliesin: Wait, was that a wisdom saving throw?
Matt: No. It was an arcana check.
Travis: It might be high, dude. You might have to roll a 30.
Taliesin: Let's leave it. Tend to the sick and leave the well alone.
Travis: Indiana? Let it go.
Laura: Or Dominate that shit.
Sam: I'll try one more time.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: All right. Let's all back up.
Laura: I get ready with the vine to yank him away in case it starts moving toward him.
Matt: Okay. And everyone else backs up a little.
Marisha: Keyleth stares with a vague familiarity.
Sam: I'm going to inspire myself.
Matt: Okay. So make your roll first, as you begin to focus and exert your will towards it. You add it on to it.
Sam: Pretty good.
Laura: Now inspire!
Sam: And inspire?
Matt: Up to you.
Sam: Okay. Plus my what? Arcana?!
Matt: Yes.
Sam: Ooh, that's a lot. 30.
Matt: Okay. As you this time begin to push your will towards the sphere, you push past the event horizon, your consciousness connects with some--
Sam: (garbled) Listen to me, damn it! Respect my authority!
Matt: Some ancient space of the void within this blackened circle. As it connects-- What's your intelligence modifier?
Sam: Plus three.
Matt: Okay. What are you trying to will it to do?
Sam: I'm trying to will it to-- Shit, it's just a big black ball. Slam straight into the ceiling!
Matt: It moves up ten feet and then it hits, devours the stone above it to create this small tunnel right directly above.
Laura: Oh my god! You did it.
Sam: We can use it!
Taliesin: Finally.
Sam: Have you guys seen The Explorers?
Taliesin: I'm in The Explorers, motherfucker. I'm in The Explorers.
Sam: You are?! That's one of my favorite movies of all time! Can I get your autograph?
Taliesin: No.
Liam: Were you kidding? Are you really in The Explorers?
Taliesin: Yes! I'm really in The Explorers.
Liam: Stop the game!
Taliesin: I'm one of River's little brothers. I'm Ludwig.
Sam: Oh, wow!
Marisha: Yeah, he knew River through that.
Laura: What if we use the orb and go straight up? We don't even keep tunneling, we juat go straight up to the city.
Sam: It only listens to me.
Laura: Yeah. Do you need us to heal you or anything?
Sam: No, this is a cool thing.
Travis: Yeah, but it only makes a hole its size. It's two feet across.
Taliesin: I think he's not ready to pop a wheelie on this thing yet.
Travis: Plus, remember the guy was concentrating super hard, so it's the only thing Scanlan will probably be able to do.
Marisha: But if he cores out a tunnel for us, we can carry Scanlan like on a palanquin? Like We Are The Champions?
Sam: Guys, I think we can make it. No, we can't! We'll never make it! Yes, we can!
Liam: All I'm thinking is I could come up and do Lay on Hands and heals, but I'm like, you made your bed, lie in it.
Taliesin: Yeah, no. I'm okay with this.
Laura: What do you think? Do you want to go up?
Sam: We're still investigating these guys and stuff.
Marisha: Fuck these guys! We got all their shit. Let's go!
Sam: I'm going to call this ball Simon 3.
Travis: Do we know how far the sphere can move in a single movement?
Matt: You watched him push it, and it went about 15 feet.
Travis: The sphere can only move 15 feet.
Sam: It will slow us down.
Matt: It's a very slow-moving ball of destruction.
Taliesin: Bring the sphere back down so that we can throw their bodies into the sphere so that they don't turn into undead fuckwads.
Liam: Wait a second, though! God, I don't know what this will do. I have a spell called Zone of Truth.
Laura: So it forces them to speak the truth? Does it work on undead?
Liam: A creature that enters the spell's area for the first time. If it fails.
Laura: So you could cast it, and then Pike could cast Speak with Dead, and it would come up into the Zone of Truth.
Liam: That's right.
Travis: No, they have to tell the truth when you do Speak with Dead.
Liam: No, they don't.
Matt: They don't have to.
Marisha: They can lie.
Taliesin: Here's a weird question  what saving throw do they have to make to speak the truth?
Liam: An affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. So it could avoid the questions.
Laura: But they have to answer the questions.
Liam: But they have to answer the questions because of the other spell.
Laura: Right?
Sam: Double mumbo-jumbo?
Matt: It can't tell a lie, as you're discussing this. Technically, a creature would be unable to lie in the area.
Liam: Unable to lie, and with Pike's spell--
Laura: They have to answer the question.
Liam: They have to answer the question.
Matt: Let me double-check for you.
Taliesin: And what's the save?
Liam: Charisma saving throw against my spell save DC, which is not huge.
Marisha: What is it?
Liam: 16.
Matt: I mean, it does have to answer.
Liam: I like it.
Taliesin: Are we going to try this crazy shit?
Laura: Let's do it!
Marisha: Might as well. Okay, hang on, though! What are we going to get from this guy?
Laura: Find out how close we are to Vasselheim.
Taliesin: Yeah, what's the plan? What are they trying to do?
Liam: What has Vecna got cooking?
Taliesin: What's Vecna planning? How many of them are there?
Marisha: I'm going to go pee, you guys.
Liam: He might not know everything. How long does it take for Keyleth to pee?
Laura: No, but how close we are to Vasselheim? What's the plan of attack in Vasselheim? How big is his army? We get five questions, I think, with Speak with Dead.
Taliesin: Five?
Sam: How close are we? What's his plan? Where is he?
Laura: Where is Vecna within the city?
Sam: Who's with him?
Laura: Who's the death knight?
Taliesin: He might not know that. But what are they excavating for? What are they looking for?
Travis: I think I know that.
Taliesin: I think I know, too, but I want to hear him say it. It'd make me feel better.
Laura: Let's do it! Cast your Zone, yo!
Taliesin: Get in the zone.
Laura: (singing) Autozone!
Matt: (chuckling) Autozone of Truth?
Liam: Shit. So can anyone drag him down on his roll to save, or boost me?
Taliesin: No. Not me.
Laura: I don't think so.
Liam: Does anyone have a cantrip? Okay. All right. Let's do it.
Matt: All right. So which one?
Liam: Well, first Zone of Truth, then Pike.
Matt: Okay. So you create the Zone of Truth, you create the area, the radial space where the divine energy kicks in and the compulsion to not lie remains within. And then Pike--
Laura: Casts Speak with Dead.
Matt: On which corpse? There are three corpses.
Liam: Red robe seemed more fancy.
Sam: Who seemed more senior?
Liam: Red robe did.
Matt: There are three, technically.
Sam: There was the guy they killed right when they burst on the scene.
Taliesin: We'll take the fanciest cloak.
Matt: Okay. It's relative, but the guy who was controlling the sphere seemed to be at least different.
Laura: He had a different color. Yeah, red robe.
Matt: All right. So as Pike takes the time to focus and recite the incantation, she grabs her holy symbol and focuses and speaks aloud the words in Celestial of the blessing of Sarenrae. And as she completes the ritual, she suddenly screams out in pain and grabs at her head and falls to her knees. No effect. And she suffers--
Laura: Oh no! What did he do to Pike?
Travis: Oh shit.
Matt: On 6d6, I rolled four sixes and a five. That's 31 points of psychic damage to Pike.
Liam: She tried to cast Speak with Dead Dumbfuck.
Matt: She's shaking and grabbing her face and rubbing her eyes, and it takes her a moment to come back to you and she looks around, and you can see a faint bit of blood slightly dripping out of the corner of her eyes. She's like, "All I heard was laughter."
Sam: Laughter?
Laura: And you said it was minus 36 damage?
Matt: 31.
Liam: Vecna is in these motherfuckers' brains.
Marisha: Everyone looks upset.
Laura: Pike got psychic damage from that dude.
Marisha: How much? A lot?
Laura: 31 points of psychic damage.
Marisha: Oh, that's a lot, yeah.
Taliesin: Burn the bodies. Fuck it.
Marisha: Throw them down the well.
Taliesin: Throw them into the sphere.
Marisha: Oh yeah!
Sam: Sphere! Do your worst.
Matt: One by one, you grab and take the corpses and thrust them towards the sphere, as they immediately crumple, fold and get pulled in, turned to nothingness, disappearing into the black void. There are elements of the way the sphere acts and manipulates things that remind you of the siphons, though differently. It's more violent in some ways, and it is its own contained magical entity. With each body, it vanishes in the sphere, and you all sit there for a moment taking a breath and deciding the next order of business in traversing the insides of this titan. And that's where we'll end tonight's game, because it's 11:30.
Marisha: I feel like I always come back from the bathroom right as we're ending games.
Sam: First of all, it's so great to be back!
Taliesin: It's so nice to be back.
Sam: Matt, thank god you're totally 100 percent healed and all better again.
Matt: It's great. Sorry. But yeah, missed you guys. We'll be back next week, pick up from here, see as the final charge gets closer and closer. What will you guys do next time? In the meantime, rest well, don't forget, if you can, to give to the Red Cross to help support the victims of recent hurricane battering in the US.
Laura: Look for Shadow of War.
Matt: Shadow of War coming out on October 10th.
Marisha: Our comic on Wednesday.
Matt: Yep, look for that. And we'll see you guys soon. Have a wonderful week, we love you, and: Is it Thursday yet? Good night. [music]
