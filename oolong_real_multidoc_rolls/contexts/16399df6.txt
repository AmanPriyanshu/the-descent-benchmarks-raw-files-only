[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Welcome back, everyone, to the next episode of Critical Role! This week, we have a full party. We'll be continuing just after the climactic battle with the twisted beholder, K'varn. We're going to go ahead and play a couple of videos here while we're waiting for the rest of the party members to settle in, so we'll be back here in just a few minutes. Sit tight and we'll get this party started. We have some fun announcements, some cool gifts that came in we'll be opening towards the end of the session today, but we'll go into those details shortly, so see you in a little bit. [dramatic music]
Travis: Right, Listen up! If you have ale, then you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw. A goliath of towering height and size, this barbarian has an appetite for the two great loves in his life: combat, women, and ale! (chuckle) (record scratch) Wait. Easily the brains of the group, Grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes, colors, and (chuckle) shiny things! Also ale. In his early years, armed with his two-handed great axe, Grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst the ranks of his family's wandering herd. But after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly gnome in the woods, he objected to the killing of such an innocent life. A creature of impulse, Grog felt only pity for this-- well, this terrified little thing. And his disobedience cost him dearly. Beaten bloody and banished by the herd leader, his uncle Kevdak, Grog was abandoned and left to die, exiled from his herd. It was then that the relative of the very gnome he fought to save, saved him. It was the kindness of a gnome cleric named Pike that healed Grog, bringing him back from death's edge. And they have remained close friends ever since. Most nights, Grog can be found challenging entire taverns to wrestling matches! Ha! Or accompanying Scanlan to the nearest house where you pay for lady favors. Also ale!
Marisha: A first impression of Keyleth would leave you with little information on the half-elven druid. You might even think that her social awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is kind of sweet. (chuckle) Of course, it would be unwise to underestimate her based on first impressions. (thunder) Under that unintimidating petite frame is a vicious beast waiting to be unleashed, whose natural powers have made even the fiercest of champions pee their pants, literally! (soft chuckle) Born to the Air Tribe of the Ashari people, Keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and the elemental magics. It is her people's inherent duty to protect the delicate areas in Tal'Dorei where the four elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm. Since she was a little girl, she had quite a knack for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities. Well, if you consider kittens and flying squirrels to be little beasts. Which, I do. (clears throat) Anyways, it wasn't long before the headmaster of the tribe, her father, Korren, realized her true prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster. Just like that, her jovial childhood was stripped and replaced with endless spell memorization, teachings from ancient traditions, and exceedingly high expectations. Every druid leader to be must embark on a journey to seek out the sister tribes in order to introduce and establish respect amongst the fellow headmasters. They call this the Aramente, or Noble Odyssey. When her father felt she was ready, he set her on the path to truly discovering herself, not knowing when, or if, she will ever return. As she hiked down the mountain towards Stillben, she meditated on the task ahead. Part of the Aramente is proving yourself a strong warrior, a valiant protector, and a wise and compassionate leader. With this knowledge, one thought plays on repeat in her mind: Is she even worthy?
Taliesin: Percy was the third of seven children, born to a noble family who lived far to the north in the ancient castle of Whitestone. With so many siblings to share the burdens of lordship, Percy turned his attentions to the sciences, engineering, and naturalism. One day, a mysterious couple named Lord and Lady Briarwood came to court. During a feast held in their honor, the Briarwoods violently took control of the castle, killing or imprisoning everyone who would stand in their way. Percy awoke chained in the dungeon, only to be freed by his younger sister. Together they fled, chased by the Briarwoods' men. As they ran, Percy's sister took several arrows to the chest and fell. Percy kept running, eventually jumping into a freezing river and floating unconscious to freedom. He did not remember waking up on a fishing boat. He barely remembered the next two years, as he slowly made his way as far south as possible. Then one night, Percy had a dream. A roaring cloud of smoke offered him vengeance against those who destroyed his family. When he awoke, Percy began to design his first gun. (gunshot)
Ashley: Pike grew up on the outskirts of town, near the Bramblewood. Her ancestors were a family of deep gnomes with quite an unfavorable reputation. Thievery, destruction, and trickery left them with the curse of the last name Trickfoot. Sarenrae, the goddess of healing and redemption, had other plans for Pike's great-great-grandfather Wilhand, who left his family at a young age after a dream: a dream that changed the course of the Trickfoot family. Wilhand devoted his life to Sarenrae and pledged from then on that him and his family would live a life of service and devotion. As a child, Pike seemed to have an affinity to heal. Whether it was animals, people, or even flowers, she felt she had a purpose in making things whole that had once been broken. She studied and learned the ways to heal though divine magic. She lived a peaceful life, quiet and simple, until one day, Wilhand was captured and almost killed by a group of goliath barbarians. One of the goliaths took a stand against the murder of the innocent gnome and he himself was beaten, bloodied, and left for dead, abandoned by his herd. Wilhand went to Pike for help. She prayed and healed this barbarian as best she could, bringing him back to life. When he awoke, she discovered his name was Grog Strongjaw. After that, they were the best of friends, a rather unlikely pair. Little did she know that in a few years' time, Grog would soon return the favor and bring her back from the clutches of death. (roar, crunch) After being killed in battle, Pike felt angry. She wanted to be stronger so that it would never happen again. She spent four months at sea training with the men and women aboard a ship called the Broken Howl. Gripping her holy symbol in one hand, and her morningstar in the other, this time, Pike is ready.
Sam: Oh, you haven't heard of Scanlan Shorthalt? Well, gird your loins, ladies, because he has his eye on you. A talented musician, master of disguise, and dashingly handsome in his own mind, Scanlan sings songs almost as much as he sings his own praises. Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used his endless charm and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and support his single mother. One day he was discovered by a half-orc promoter and joined Dr. Dranzel's Spectacular Traveling Troupe, where he learned the ways of the world and honed his skills as a bard extraordinaire. A loner much of his life, Scanlan has never quite come to terms with the violent death of his mother at the hands of a goblin invasion. While his years on the road provided many, shall we say, educational experiences with the opposite sex, deep down, Scanlan yearns for the one thing he's never known: the true love of a fellow gnome. Still, Scanlan considers himself a lover first, performer second, and fighter distant third. On the battlefield, he'll support his allies, but rarely draws blood, unless it's to protect fellow gnome, Pike. Count on Scanlan for a hearty laugh, a rollicking song, and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts and makes the females swoon.
Orion: Greetings and salutations. I am Tiberius Stormwind. I hail from a town called Ty'rex, located in the heart of Draconia. From a politically respected family, at the age of 15, I succeeded in passing the Sorcerer's Rite, showing prodigy-like control of my magic. The judges and the Draconian high council were amazed at how powerful my spells were for how long I had been training. At 20 years old, I was the youngest appointed member of the magic guild in Draconian history. For the next few years, I almost went mad from the malaise of being a guild member, as it's rather boring. However, one day I happened upon a chamber, unused for quite some time. In the room were stacks of books and maps of the surrounding cities and areas around the known world. For months, I would frequent the chamber, and learned of artifacts from legend. After a long period of research, I made a list of artifacts that caught my eye. I brought these findings to the high council and was told that all of the information in the chamber I had stumbled upon was either believed to be fiction, or unsolvable mysteries, and hence were lost forever. I found those answers to be unacceptable. A year later, I devised a ruse and managed to convince the city council to lend support in me leaving Draconia on a mission of peace and diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms, going from town to town and making friends and allies, in and for the name of Draconia. Being a red dragonborn, I had quite the task on my hands in that respect, but it was exactly what I needed so I could explore the world and find these artifacts, as I felt the truth was out there. Some may describe me as buffoonish, but I say poppycock to all that. I am much sharper than most give me credit for. I just don't pay attention to things sometimes. I've also been known to be rather cunning, loyal, happy-go-lucky, and well, dangerous. I can't help but show my true scales every now and then. But overall, I think I'm quite friendly for a dragonborn!
Liam: Never entirely welcome in the company of elves or men, Vax'ildan learned at a young age to skip past formality, preferring instead to invite himself in your door. Along with twin sister Vex'ahlia, Vax was born by a chance encounter between elven royalty and human peasantry. Raised by their mother in their early years, the twins were eventually sent off to their father in the elven capital of Syngorn. But their cool reception among the elves there never warmed, and their time in the capital didn't last. The siblings stole away one autumn night and set out on the open road. After a few years of wandering, they eventually decided to return to their mother, and journeyed back to the lands of their youth. But instead of finding their childhood home, they returned to a pile of rubble. Their mother was gone, their home burned to ash. Pressing the townspeople for answers, they learned of the day the dragon came. (roar) With their ties all severed, Vax'ildan and his sister set out to find their fortune together in Tal'Dorei. An outsider since birth, Vax quickly learned to solve life's challenges in his own particular way, often by side-stepping them entirely. And when his knack for circumventing adversity isn't enough, (knife scraping) the way of blades the elves schooled him in more than makes up the difference.
Laura: Like so many half-elves, Vex'ahlia has spent most of her life suffering the cool reception of a people who don't fully accept her. Born of a human mother and an elven father who only later in life took an interest in their existence, Vex'ahlia and her twin brother Vax'ildan quickly realized the only people they could truly rely on in this world were each other. It was at the age of ten when the two were taken from their mother and brought to live in Syngorn, the isolated elven city for which their father was an ambassador. He quietly took them in, but always kept an icy distance, and after too many years of disdainful looks, the pair decided to leave his indifference behind, and set out on their own. Vax took to the cities, stealing small trinkets and learning the ways of the thief, while Vex kept to the woods; she preferred the isolation. Always the keen observer, she learned to hunt and to track, to spy and to shoot. And through a series of fateful events, earned herself a companion in the form of a bear-- her own stolen Trinket-- to fight alongside her and protect her fiercely. Also, he is adorable, and gives expert massages. [dramatic music]
Matt: Hello, guys! Welcome back. Thank you for your patience. We have the whole group, finally seem to have defeated the horrible atrocity that is 13th-level Los Angeles traffic. (cheering)
Zac: What's up, internet? I've got a quick announcement.
Matt: Yes.
Zac: Guys, we have a big giveaway today, when we get to 3,300 subscribers. I think we're 50 away or around 48, something like that. When we get to 3,300, we're giving away a dice box, a signed t-shirt, a starter set, and a signed Player's Handbook all in one box for a lucky winner, so if you guys get those subscribers rolling in, that's what helps pay for this show and pay for the entire channel as a whole, so get on that! And we wanted to say thank you to Aaron's Books in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania for sending us this stuff to give away to you guys. (cheering)
Matt: Seriously guys, seriously, that was so cool of you to send that out there, and we want to say, happy sixth graduation, Aaron, congrats to you, well done. (cheering)
Zac: Aaron's a little young to be running a bookstore. That's all I have to say.
Matt: I consider that a very fine entrepreneurial position. You're getting started young, good man.
Zac: So guys, enjoy the game.
Matt: Thank you so much, and thank you again, Aaron and Aaron's books. That's awesome, guys.
Travis: Who was that strange masked man just now?
Matt: I don't know, it's so weird. Okay, so a couple quick things. First off, thank you guys for coming back and watching. Last week we had a few members away, so we had a fun little mini-game with a few folks, some who had played before, some who hadn't, and it turned out very interestingly. I hope my DM's tips were helpful for some folks out there. There's been some great feedback, and hopefully we'll do more things like that in the future for off-days. So, thanks to you. Welcome back, we're getting back into the main story line. Couple other quick things I wanted to mention: first off a big shout-out, birthday shout-out to Kit Buss, our fantastic artist for the show. (cheering)
Travis: Happy Birthday, Kit!
Orion: We love you, Kit.
Ashley: Happy birthday!
Matt: She's awesome, she's amazing, and I've seen a couple little previews of the next piece of art she's been working on and it looks pretty awesome. I think you guys are going to dig it. So she's not done, when she's finished drinking her birthday shots, then I think we'll hopefully see that soon. (laughs) Awesome, thank you so much, Kit!
Marisha: Yes, shots first, then draw.
Matt: Exactly, it's priorities! Also, anyone have any announcements they want to mention before we start the game? Any upcoming stuff?
Travis: The Justice League thing!
Matt: That's true, yeah! DC Kids on Youtube just released their new Super Friends animated series that both me and Travis are in.
Orion: Who are you? Who do you guys play?
Matt: Well, you play Lex Luthor.
Travis: Lex Luthor, and you play Superman.
Orion: Son of a bitch!
Sam: Interesting choice.
Taliesin: You can feel the tension.
Matt: It's a really, really cute show, it's a lot of fun, it's very much a playback to the classic Super Friends cartoon, that kind of comedic atmosphere. You should check it out.
Sam: You're Superman?
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: (Clarota voice) Does he talk like this?
Matt: Yeah, it gets a little weird around episode three. I don't think DC's happy with how we treated the license for that one. (laughter)
Travis: That's the best.
Matt: That's every character I do now. Matthew Mercer, reading for Superman: (croaking noise) Also, if anyone else has any other announcements they want to mention?
Marisha: Yeah!
Orion: Yeah!
Marisha: You go first.
Orion: Whatchamacallit, a few weeks ago me and Matthew wore these really cool shirts with the vermilion bird from Rubrum, which is in Type-0, the Final Fantasy that we're both in! That shirt was made from Greven, g-r-e-v-e-n, at Redbubble, and we wanted to thank him for those shirts, along with this awesome Final Fantasy shirt, made by August8913, where she did this super cool, it says Nine on the back, his says Trey. Thank you guys, for the really cool shirts.
Travis: Aw, yeah! Jumped on the jam, boogie-woogie jam-slam.
Marisha: I'm going to be at Lock and Load this weekend in Seattle, which is the War Machine Hordes con for Privateer Press.
Travis: Really?
Marisha: Yeah! It's awesome, I'm going to be dressed up in my Scar costume. It's going to be awesome, I'm going to be doing a big transformation with Espionage. Yeah, and we're actually going to be pushing the stream; they're going to be streaming it and Geek&Sundry is going to be hosting the Lock and Load stream, so tune in and watch me prance around at Lock and Load in Seattle.
Taliesin: Those are impressive shoes to prance in, by the way.
Marisha: Yeah, some intense stripper heels, yeah.
Orion: Who'd you play?
Matt: Kreoss.
Orion: You were Kreoss, by the way, War Machine Tactics, Matthew Mercer is Kreoss.
Matt: Kreoss, Asphyxius, couple other guys.
Orion: Yeah, yeah, check it out.
Matt: It's fun, it's on Steam.
Liam: Asphyxius?
Matt: Asphysius is the character's name, lich lord Asphyxius, he's bad in town.
Marisha: I'm Haley and Deneghra and Fiora.
Laura: We're going to be at MetroCon next weekend.
Matt: Awesome! MetroCon next weekend.
Travis: (sings) In Tampa.
Laura: (sings) In Tampa, Florida.
Travis: Tampa, Florida.
Matt: Okay. Real fast, before we get to that, I will be, for those who are near--
Marisha: You already did it?
Travis: How many did we have to go?
Zac: 50.
Laura: Ridiculous.
Marisha: 50 subscribers.
Matt: Well, we already hit the mark!
Marisha: Don't we normally hit that in, like, a show?
Matt: That works, you guys are amazing!
Ashley: Yes, that's awesome!
Orion: Thank you, everyone!
Matt: I'll finish my last announcement, then we'll go to that.
Zac: I'm going to go ahead and start the giveaway.
Matt: Go, start the giveaway!
Travis: When is the next giveaway?
Zac: We're going to do-- Those pictures already exist, they shared them with the chatroom. Yeah, so we're going to do this. We're going to do a whole other set of these when we get to the next 50.
Marisha: Oh, a whole other set? There's another one?
Zac: Technically, we have four sets.
Liam: See you in five minutes.
Matt: So we have four sets of those to give away. Every 50 subscribers another set goes out, guys, so that's amazing.
Orion: I could have Sam fart on this for you, if you want.
Sam: Again? Already done, friend, already done.
Matt: Whoa. Okay, there we go. (laughs)
Travis: The world just ended.
Matt: That was close. I just rolled a one on my camera save. Final announcement before we get to the game, for those who are-- (shushing noises)
Orion: Sorry. Okay.
Matt: Can't all talk at once. Also, this weekend I'll be in Sandusky, Ohio, at Colossal Con along with such great folks as Johnny Yong Bosch, Steve Blum, other fun greats--
Travis: Is that at the water park?
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: Son of a bitch.
Matt: (laughs) Yeah, because water parks are totally sanitary. Hot tub's going to be great.
Travis: The dysentery afterwards is--
Zac: Flyingsquid63 is the winner.
All: Flyingsquid63!
Matt: You are the winner of the first set. Congratulations, that's awesome.
Ashley: It's an awesome name.
Marisha: Oh look, and it's green. You're winning green speckled dice, like squid colors.
Matt: There you go, that worked out well, very Cthulhu-ian.
Marisha: I'm justifying. Shut up, Liam! (laughter)
Matt: Well awesome, so we hit our next 50, we'll do another giveaway, we have three more of those packages to give out, guys, so hopefully keep that up. All right, anything else or should we get back into the chaos?
Marisha: Yeah.
Ashley: I'm scared!
Matt: You should be.
Ashley: I really am.
Sam: We beat the bad guy! It's fine, it's all fine.
Matt: Where we left off.
Orion: I forgot to ask you something before the game, it's fine.
Matt: It's okay. The party, as they ventured deep into the Underdark beneath the Cliffkeep Mountains in the dwarven city of Kraghammer, they sought and discovered Lady Kima of Vord, a folk hero, a paladin of Bahamut who had been captured and tortured by the duergar that lived beneath it. After saving her, they discovered that there was an even deeper, darker, more dangerous evil brewing beneath the surface. There was an illithid, or mind flayer, city of Yug'voril deeper within these cavern structures, and currently the Elder Brain of the colony was under the control of an entity known as K'Varn, they came to find out was a self-mutilated and advanced beholder, who had come into contact with a dark artifact known as the Horn of Orcus that was actually gifted many many, many many, like hundreds of years ago by the god of undeath himself, Orcus, to one of his avatars. Somehow it found its way to this beholder, and gave it enough power to where it gained complete dominion over this colony and these caverns as a whole. The party fought their way through and made a few allies, including the ousted mind flayer, Clarota, seeking to return to his colony, has been fighting alongside them, as well as Lady Kima, the paladin they came to save. Upon finding their way into the final cavern, they used their magic carpet to completely go around the giant city of Yug'Voril, perch on top of the temple in the center of the city, and using a polymorphed fomorian giant (laughs), cascading down hundreds upon hundreds of feet, through the glass structure on top, managed to break their way into the temple, after which a very dangerous battle with K'Varn the beholder took place. A number of very close calls. I posted the stats for them after the fight, if any of you guys got a chance to see it. They made saving throws where it counted, or we'd have a lot more party members that'd be permanently dead. But they managed to take him out; using Tiberius's Telekinesis, they tore the horn from its forehead and the beholder fell to the ground, unmoving and finally killed, as opposed to its undead form, and that's where we begin. As you guys all sit there looking around yourselves, adrenaline still pumping in your ears, the flow of blood.
Orion: Pike--
Ashley: That's me! What do you need?
Orion: Do you have spell of Restoration, the thing that can reverse stone?
Ashley: Yes, I do.
Orion: Clarota, what do you suggest we do? Do we stay, do we leave, or do we-- what do you? There are hundreds upon thousands of illithid rushing at us right now, and they don't like me very much, by the way--
Laura: We should get out of here!
Matt: At which point, Clarota turns to you and says, "You. Bring her." Points to Kima, who is still frozen in stone mid-wielding her maul.
Ashley: To carry her?
Matt: "Stay but a moment; I will talk to them."
Sam: Talk to the hive.
Orion: Very good. Wait, do you want her un-stoned, or still stoned?
Marisha: Well, hang on. Maybe before we unstone Kima, we talk about what we should do with the Horn.
Orion: This is exactly what has to do with the Horn. Is there any way, Pike, could you perhaps half-cast it and hold the spell, don't quite undo her legs from stone, I don't want her to be mobile. I want to ask her--
Ashley: I don't know if I--
Sam: If I may, very quickly, are you with us, Tiberius?
Orion: We will discuss that when we get out of here.
Sam: Because you disappeared for like, the whole fight. Are you with us?
Orion: I am with you.
Sam: Are you going to disappear again?
Orion: To be fair, Scanlan, I never disappeared to begin with!
Sam: Well, you weren't there when we needed you the most. You were out doing God-knows-what.
Orion: Quite the contrary. If it wasn't for me, you'd still be fighting that damn thing.
Sam: What on earth are you talking about?
Orion: Silence. (laughter)
Sam: Dispel Magic. Yes, I did.
Orion: Counterspell.
Sam: Do I have a will save?
Orion: No, you're done, you're quiet.
Matt: That low enough level? No, unfortunately.
Orion: The idea, which I will share-- we don't have time to do that--
Sam: I turn him into a goat.
Orion: He has to say that, it doesn't work.
Matt: I know that. (laughter)
Orion: So the idea is, Pike, if we ask her why she wants the horn, if there is any other reason but to destroy it, we have to--
Sam: Okay, then I'll Banish him.
Laura: (gasps)
Ashley: How about-- well, hold on.
Taliesin: He can't stop it, he can't talk!
Matt: Also requires verbal casting.
Sam: I have to touch him, right?
Matt: You also have to be able to speak.
Sam: Fuck!
Matt: So while you're talking to them, Scanlan is tapping you and mouthing words angrily.
Orion: The idea is, if she doesn't want to destroy it, I say there's something awful, and Keyleth, I believe you want to destroy it, yes?
Marisha: Well, yes, I mean why does she want to take it back up to the surface if it's that terrible?
Orion: I know this is, did you say Orcus, is that his name?
Matt: Orcus, yes.
Orion: This thing is no good at all.
Marisha: Why don't we just throw it in some lava?
Orion: Where is some lava? I would much like to do that.
Marisha: Well, we're around lava, right?
Travis: We were.
Laura: We're not around lava now.
Taliesin: It's a thing of earth. Perhaps taking it to the surface is necessary to destroy it. Why don't we have a conversation with her?
Orion: But she wanted to take it back to Emon. That is not appropriate, we need to destroy this.
Taliesin: Let's get some information first.
Orion: I dispel Silence.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: Let's get some information, let's figure out--
Sam: Oh hi, hi there.
Orion: Sorry, I just wanted to get the point across.
Ashley: I can un-stone her.
Taliesin: We'll un-stone her, it's not like she can take it from us.
Ashley: That's my last 5th-level spell, so we might need to rest.
Taliesin: If something horrible happens, we're going to run anyway at this point.
Matt: I assume you guys have come down in here then.
Orion: I'm staying up, can I not--
Sam: Then how did we have this whole conversation?
Orion: Oh, then I'd be down there.
Laura: I was planning on staying up. I'm not leaving Trinket up there.
Matt: Okay. Good.
Taliesin: Why don't we find out what happens next? And if we have to, you can teleport us out of here, correct?
Orion: Oh, I have a wonderful escape plan.
Marisha: Okay, so Clarota, how much time do we have before something happens next?
Matt: As you say that, Clarota turns, and the two stone doorways on each side of the temple shift open and you notice three mind flayers glide in from the side of the room.
Laura: I notch my arrow.
Orion: No, no! Stop, no don't. It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.
Matt: Two small, bi-pedal, brain-like creatures.
All: No! No.
Matt: At which point, Clarota puts his hands up like this.
Travis: I'm grappled, so.
Matt: Yeah, you're still being held back, but you can try to break from the grapple if you want to roll an athletics check.
Travis: (laughs) I would like to, just because these things ate my fucking mind away. Seven.
Matt: Nope, you're still held against the bars.
Taliesin: You're like an extra in Big Trouble in Little China.
Travis: Oh, it's a 12! I looked at acrobatics.
Matt: Still not enough, unfortunately.
Ashley: Wait, but I cast-- nope, never mind! Keep going!
Matt: Okay. As they begin to move in, and are hovering forward, looking around the room, taking in the scenery, but they're all focused toward the center, they're all just moving towards the Elder Brain. And they make their way up towards it, looking very intent and very frightened at the prospect of what maybe has happened in this room. As they all approach, you can see that low, dull, kind of purplish glow of the Elder Brain is still pumping, but slowly brighter and brighter, almost like it's coming to more life. You can hear the cage rattling of the various entities that are still inside, like the one that's still grappling Grog off to the side. The horn of Orcus, which is still being held aloft by your Telekinesis spell, is just hovering through the air, slowly rotating on its own, little strips of K'Varn's flesh still freshly tumbling from the side.
Orion: And it's at the halfway point between where she is and where I'm standing.
Matt: So right here?
Orion: Yeah, right there.
Matt: Not this big, of course.
Orion: It's really heavy, guys!
Matt: As they all move towards the center, Clarota, with his hands up, turns around, pulls back the hood, and steps towards the other mind flayers, hands stretched out, moving up to the point here.
Ashley: (whispers) Can you instill an inspiration?
Sam: Inspire him? I think he's pretty good on his own.
Orion: "Don't do anything." I'm saying this on the ears.
Matt: The three illithid look over and notice Clarota, and there's a good 20 or 30 seconds of silence as they just look at each other. At which point, Clarota kind of turns around to the rest of the group and looks at them, looks at all of you and lowers his head a little bit as the mind flayers move in towards Clarota, one reaches over and pulls the cap from the back of his head, removes it, at which point Clarota raises up, and if you think you've ever seen an entity with tentacles for a mouth smile, the creases in his awful, rubbery, fleshy face almost give a look of joy, of rediscovered connection, and he looks out to the rest of you and bows a head for a second. I need Grog, Scanlan, Tiberius, Vax, and Pike to all make--
Travis: Tiberius, if he fucks us.
Sam: I think he's about to.
Matt: Intelligence saving throws.
Travis: Oh, I'm grappled! I'm raging, but. Fuck yes! Intelligence saving throws?
Matt: Intelligence saving throws.
Travis: Thank god I rolled high.
Orion: Natural 20.
Travis: (laughs) I get a negative two modifier, that's such bullshit. (laughter)
Matt: Not very wise, there, Grog.
Travis: 17.
Sam: Is this a charm?
Matt: This would be-- no, it would not be.
Marisha: So wait, am I still an elemental? Is that the deal?
Orion: It's 23.
Matt: 23, 20. Scanlan?
Sam: 12.
Matt: 12. Pike?
Laura: She needs better dice.
Ashley: I rolled a six.
Matt: Okay. Grog?
Ashley: Six total. (laughs)
Travis: Oh. 17.
Matt: Okay! So. Currently, all the mind flayers at once, including Clarota, angrily lash out with a Mind Blast. You feel your brains all of a sudden fill with searing, horrible pain. Some of you manage to shrug it off, but the rest of you find your bodies locking in place. All right, everyone who failed their save, which would be-- Keyleth, what'd you roll?
Marisha: You didn't have me roll.
Matt: Oh, you need to roll as well, sorry, you're in the blast there. You're still an earth elemental.
Marisha: I thought I was immune to this kind of stuff. (groans) What do I-- not good.
Matt: Not good? All right, that'll be 22 points of psychic damage to Grog, to Pike.
Travis: I passed, right?
Matt: No, you passed this. You're fine.
Laura: Teleport us out of here!
Orion: It doesn't work like that. It's what I was trying to say earlier!
Matt: Scanlan, you are currently stunned, you are actually unable to physically move. Pike, as well. The rest of you manage to resist the Mind Blast, but at this point in time you can now see that this crew, including Clarota, now reconnected with its people, your purpose serving its end, you're about to be swarmed by the rest of the entire city.
Travis: Son of a bitch, taint, fuck!
Matt: Let's roll initiative, guys.
Marisha: We should've gotten out of here!
Travis: I never trusted that Magneto motherfucker! Fuck.
Matt: All right, so. 25 to 20?
Laura: 21.
Marisha: 21, as well.
Matt: Nice. 20 to 15?
Orion: 19.
Taliesin: 17.
Ashley: 16.
Matt: All right, 15 to ten?
Liam: 14.
Sam: 13.
Matt: All right, Grog?
Travis: Eight. Against mind flayers. We're fucking fighting brains and mind flayers again.
Laura: We're all going to die.
Marisha: Okay, wait, you guys run.
Matt: Vex, you're up first.
Marisha: I can start bringing down the palace.
Laura: I'm stuck at the top. Until we can run, we're stuck, because there's only one flying carpet.
Travis: Tiberius has got something for us, right?
Laura: I'm going to cast Hunter's Mark on the Elder Brain and shoot Hail of Thorns into the Elder Brain.
Matt: Okay.
Orion: Yes! I like that idea!
Marisha: I'm going to start bringing down the temple! Are we okay with that?
Travis: We're still in it.
Orion: Not while we're still in it.
Marisha: Well, I mean it'll take some time, I'm sure.
Travis: Or it could happen really quick.
Matt: As you guys do notice-- you guys are beginning to see what looks like shadows seemingly coming out from the outside, and you hear what seems to be slight cackling of things sort of in the doorways. So you're shooting Hail of Thorns down into the Elder Brain? Go ahead and roll for the attack.
Laura: 19?
Matt: 19 will hit, yes.
Sam: We're going to be dead in ten minutes.
Matt: What, the teleportation one?
Orion: We'll talk about it later. Plan B, it's ten minutes.
Matt: One minute.
Orion: Sure!
Matt: Pretty sure it's one minute
Marisha: Wait, does this mean you can go and we'll distract?
Orion: No, don't look at it! You said one minute, that's the DM, DM is god.
Laura: Do I roll regular damage, plus the Hail of Thorns?
Matt: I thought it was.
Travis: If someone asks you if you're a god--
All: You say yes.
Travis: You shouldn't look! You shouldn't waste your time.
Matt: Spellcasting time  one minute.
Orion: Oh, yes, I'm so glad I'm wrong.
Laura: 39 on the first hit.
Orion: How many of us are down there?
Ashley: 39?! Yes!
Marisha: All of us except for Laura and Trinket.
Taliesin: And I'm on the carpet, so I can head that direction.
Laura: And then 18 for the second.
Matt: Okay, so you release the first Hail of Thorns. The arrow shatters into a whole--
Laura: And anything within five feet takes damage, as well.
Matt: That'll be all four of them. How much damage do they take?
Laura: They take the same amount unless they make--
Matt: Unless they make a what? Do they have a saving throw against it?
Laura: Oh wait. Yeah. They take half damage on a saving throw.
Matt: Okay. Against what? So two of them make it, two of them don't.
Marisha: Look, look, I do double damage to objects and structures. That's the thing, I'm really good at tearing shit down.
Orion: Now, sometimes fighting isn't the right thing to do!
Marisha: That's why I'm not talking about fighting, I'm talking about collapsing buildings!
Matt: All right, so Clarota and the one nearest to it get behind a pillar for a second and manage to reduce the damage a bit, but the other two are completely pierced all over their bodies where shattered pieces of these kind of jagged thorn arrows exploded all over them and the Elder Brain. The pulsing begins to-- you hear this shrieking in your mind, like the actual presence of the Elder Brain is starting to yell out in pain. You feel it's hardy but hurting. I mean, it's very hefty, it's a large chunk of matter, so god knows how long it would take to take that one down, but it's definitely-- (laughs) it hurt. It's not happy with that. Do you want to move at all or do you want to stay where you are?
Laura: I want to do my second attack.
Matt: Yeah, that's right!
Laura: Yeah. 15?
Matt: 15 does not hit, unfortunately. You actually fire down and it hits the stonework and the arrow splinters against it. Stay where you are?
Laura: I don't know what else to do. I'm stuck up at the top.
Matt: Jump? What could possibly go wrong! Okay, that's the end of your turn. Keyleth, you're up.
Sam: Keyleth!
Marisha: I think my best use-- I agree we need to get out of here, but I'm going to--
Matt: You have shadows moving in from the two open doorways on each side right now.
Marisha: What, so the Elder Brain-- is this a wooden well, or a stone well? What is this?
Matt: Essentially it's a giant stone platform that houses the Elder Brain at the center.
Marisha: Here's what I can do. I can start breaking the well, or I can start blocking entrances. I can start pulling down--
Travis: That one, the second one.
Taliesin: The second one.
Marisha: The second one?
Travis: The second one, close the doorway.
Marisha: All right. Who's coming in from where?
Matt: This is one doorway. That's the other.
Travis: I thought he said it was big.
Marisha: All right, I am going to-- I can make it there, right? That's 35 feet?
Matt: That-- ooh, that's maybe not enough. Yeah no, that's longer than 35 feet.
Laura: Just bull rush and tear down the well.
Travis: Yeah, do it. Fuck it, do what you want to do.
Matt: What do you want to do?
Marisha: All right, all right!
Matt: Just letting you know, just putting this into perspective, here: you're fighting four illithid in the room. You have a city swarming on you right now.
Laura: We need to get out! Or take down the Elder Brain.
Marisha: All right. I am taking down the doors.
Matt: Okay, what are you doing? Are you casting a spell?
Marisha: No, I'm going to start-- can I bull rush, not necessarily right next to the door but like right here, and I'm going to elemental-slam into the wall and siege monster this.
Matt: What's the movement speed of the earth elemental?
Marisha: 35 feet.
Matt: 35 feet? As it's still able to move through stone as well?
Marisha: Yeah! Well, actually, no. When I move through stone I think I can move 60 feet!
Matt: Okay, it is a thick floor. You actually shift into the stonework of the flooring itself and coast through, popping up right out there. That'll get you right at the doorway. You can see there is a slow spiraling incline, like a small-- like an inclined pathway that you can see four illithid making their way up right now, with some large looming stomping sounds coming up behind them.
Marisha: Perfect! So I materialize, using my girth to take up the door, and then I just go (deep voice) boom! And start bringing it down.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and make your slam attack or attacks, depending on how many--
Marisha: Slam, I guess.
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: Get it, Keyleth. (cheering)
Marisha: 26!
Matt: 26, okay go ahead and roll damage on that. Since you are an earth elemental, you do extra siege damage against structures, don't you?
Marisha: Correct. Double damage. So (laughs) okay. So does full damage, plus five, so that's 21-- 42 points of damage.
Ashley: Yes!
Matt: 42 points of damage. So the stone structure, which is pretty rigid and this is an old, old structure; the strange, weird, non-Euclidean design of it has a slight warbling feel to it. You take both of your earth elemental fists and slam them into the side. As you do, the structure gives way and a good 30 feet or so crumbles down around you. You can feel the stones raining onto you. Because of your proximity, you take four points of impact damage.
Marisha: I like it! It feels good! This is what I bathe in!
Matt: This entire doorway is ruined, and there's a good 15-foot pile of stonework now blocking that entranceway.
Marisha: 15-foot pile?
Matt: Yeah. But there's a hole above it, where the stone fell through. So there is about 50 feet up a section of the wall that is collapsed down.
Marisha: Whatever, it'll make it harder. Right, that's my turn.
Matt: Okay, do recall that mind flayers do levitate.
Travis: Aw. (groans) God! Maybe not now, they don't?
Matt: All right, Tiberius, you're up.
Orion: Yeah, okay--
Matt: You can also see forms swarming through the other doorway over there.
Laura: Teleport us!
Orion: This isn't good.
Laura: Fly us! Get us out.
Orion: How far? Scanlan's only like a foot away from me, right?
Matt: Yeah.
Orion: I'm right next to him!
Matt: Yep.
Orion: Oh!
Travis: Beam us out, Scotty.
Orion: Shit. Okay. I cast Fly on myself.
Sam: (laughs) Bye, Tiberius! (laughter)
Orion: I redact that, actually. Is it possible-- I'm at least standing next to him, right?
Matt: You are.
Orion: I don't have to use a move action right now. I can, like, look at him.
Sam: I leap!
Orion: Okay, can I give him-- can I take off my Ioun Stone as an action, and swap his crown?
Matt: No, I'm pretty sure-- if the item says "attunement" on it, you have to spend a short rest attuning yourself with the weapon. If either of them does.
Orion: But he didn't. He hasn't attuned himself to the thing yet.
Sam: To what?
Matt: Right, but your Ioun stone-- you mean take it from him?
Orion: Yeah!
Matt: You would have to attune it to yourself in order to use it.
Orion: How long does it take?
Matt: It takes a short rest.
Orion: Shit! Okay, that changes everything in a very bad way.
Matt: What are you doing? The other doorway isn't blocked, you have mind flayers running in, you have probably more and more swarming from underneath the temple, probably over at some point, from what you've seen of the temple structure.
Orion: Okay, so I'm going to attempt to crush the Horn. With a thousand pounds of pressure.
Matt: Okay.
Orion: Because my Telekinesis is still going.
Matt: That's true.
Orion: I can't do anything else without dropping this thing because as soon as I do anything else, I drop the horn. So I have to do that first.
Matt: Okay, so you use your action, go ahead and roll for that, for the crushing of Telekinesis.
Travis: Oh god.
Orion: What am I adding?
Matt: You're adding your modifier, which I think is five.
Orion: Oh, 23.
Matt: As you focus intensely, you feel that the Horn itself-- the sheer force of the artifact is far too powerful for your meager magic to have any sort of effect on its physical structure.
Orion: I thought so.
Matt: As you focus your arcane intent on crushing it, you feel almost like the back of your brain begins to crawl with cold energy, and if you could hear-- if you could hear laughter come from something that is inanimate, you're hearing it coming from the Horn right now.
Travis: Fuck that horn.
Matt: That's your action.
Orion: I'm going to--
Laura: Float it into the Bag of Holding!
Orion: I'm going to maneuver around the chaos because I'm not within range of anybody to hurt me, right?
Matt: Not currently, no.
Orion: So I'm going to hop on the carpet.
Liam: This is all taking six seconds, by the way.
Matt: 30, that's as far as you can get.
Orion: Well, I can run.
Matt: You already used your action to Telekinesis.
Orion: Oh. That's stupid.
Matt: That's how it works.
Orion: "Hey, Percy!" (laughs) That's my turn, that's all I can do. And I still maintain the thing.
Matt: Okay. That brings us-- end of Tiberius's turn, to Percy.
Taliesin: I'm going to start flying straight up, and while I'm flying straight up, I'm going to take... two shots with the Pepperbox at the big brain.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and roll twice.
Taliesin: I'm going to use Sharpshooter. That's a 21? That's 21.
Matt: 21 does hit.
Taliesin: And should I do both hits?
Matt: Yeah, roll both.
Taliesin: Oh, and-- no, that's right, I don't critical at 19?
Matt: No.
Taliesin: No, I need a specialty. Damn it! And that hits, so both hit, and they're both with Sharpshooter, so that's nice. (sings) I haven't pulled my dice out yet. There we go.
Liam: Come on, gunslinger!
Taliesin: Oh, that's nice! 25 points of damage.
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: And 17 points of damage.
Matt: All right, gotcha.
Taliesin: Oh, sorry. I forgot, sorry, four points of fire damage.
Matt: Okay, good. All right, so as you (gunshot) turn over the barrel of your weapon, fire again, the second one bursting into flame as it hits the top of the Elder Brain, you can see both bullets sink into the flesh. There's no impact; they just seem to be absorbed in by it. The flame one, you see a jet of flame go from the inside and the flesh of the actual large Elder Brain quivers for a moment. You hear another shrieking, angry pain growl in your minds just by the proximity of this entity. You don't see it doing too much to it, but it's definitely hurting it. That ends your turn?
Marisha: Things can hurt really bad and not do that much damage.
Matt: Clarota spins and comes up behind you--
Laura: Don't be a dick.
Travis: Remember our days watching Saved by the Bell together?
Matt: You are stunned currently, so it gets advantage on that. So that's 24. All right, so Clarota's tentacles wrap around your head-- (gasping)
Travis: Whose?
Matt: You immediately take 15 points of psychic damage and you are currently grappled.
Sam: And stunned.
Matt: Yes.
Sam: (sings) Grappled and stunned, so grappled and stunned!
Matt: All right, that comes to Pike! Pike, you're stunned currently, mind still reeling from the pain; go ahead and make an intelligence saving throw.
Ashley: Ugh, okay.
Travis: We're just trying to stay alive.
Ashley: I just rolled a one.
Matt: Your physical form is still unable to pull yourself out of that continuous psychic pain, you're like (groans) trying to just tear your mind out of it, unable to do so. Vax, you're up.
Liam: Okay, I click my Boots of Haste and I'm going to-- where's the thingie, do we have a thingie here?
Ashley: What do you need?
Liam: The light.
Travis: Yeah.
Liam: All right, great. How's this work? Like that. If I can run right between Pike and this little brain jerk right here, does that get me within five feet of Elder Brain if I'm there? I can't tell from the structure.
Matt: You can rush there, you would have to get up onto here.
Liam: Yeah, that's what I want to do, and then, I don't know. That's not my full double-movement, I don't know how that affects the number of attacks I have Hasted, but I just want to stab it as many times as I can, standing on top of this thing.
Matt: All right, got it.
Liam: Where's the meteorite die?
Orion: Fuck you, couch!
Liam: Using my poison dagger.
Travis: Prison shank that thing.
Liam: Yeah, yeah, I'm going to shiv him in his shank or shank him in his shiv, whichever is the more accurate phrase.
Matt: All right, go ahead and roll for attack twice.
Travis: Can you scream out "lobotomy" while you do it?
Matt: As a note, as you rush by, for an attack of opportunity, the intellect devourer does reach out and strike at you with its claws.
Liam: Okay.
Matt: Rolls a one. You just kick it off to the side, it rolls on its side, its brain matter (clunks) on the ground.
Liam: Do I get two or three attacks?
Matt: You get three if you use your bonus to attack.
Liam: First one misses. Second one is-- oh wait, the first was a 17, is that--
Laura: That doesn't miss.
Liam: Hit or miss, it's a brain, right, I'm standing--
Matt: Total 17? That would still-- it doesn't miss, but as you strike down for it, there's a psychic field that's defending it, and your blade is held at bay by the protective sphere.
Liam: Okay, then I'm using now dagger of venom is 26.
Matt: Okay, that does hit.
Liam: Okay, so that's four plus six is ten, because this isn't Sneak Attack or anything.
Matt: No.
Liam: That's ten plus a poison for a DC of 15?
Matt: Okay. It makes its saving throw. Rolled a 17.
Liam: So that was that, and then the third attack I'll go back to the keen dagger. 14.
Matt: 14. The second one strikes through, the poison tries to pulse through but once again it resists the impact; the third dagger comes down and before it even gets halfway towards, there's a blast of psychic energy from the inside of the containment unit that holds the Elder Brain that (boof) forces your hand back, the attack deflected entirely. That ends your turn. The other three illithids now go.
Ashley: I wish we had inspiration.
Orion: Isn't there a rope still hanging from there? Throw the damn rope!
Laura: You can climb it.
Liam: Yeah, I can probably get up 15 feet and hang there.
Travis: Yeah, I'm getting a massage right now.
Matt: This one's also going to turn around, reach forward, and its tentacles are going to attempt to wrap around Pike's head--
Travis: Don't you touch my friend.
Matt: That's going to be a 20?
Travis: A natural 20?
Matt: No, it's just 20. So Pike, you go ahead and take-- this'll be 15 points of psychic damage.
Liam: It was a good run, folks.
Marisha: What happened?
Laura: He rolled a 20.
Ashley: So he rolled a 20.
Matt: I rolled a total of 20. And you're stunned currently, so you take 15 points of psychic damage as you feel-- as you're trying to resist yourself, these cold tentacles wrap across the front of your field of vision, and you can feel this weird, toothy, pointy, biting sensation beginning to push towards the back of your skull. This one--
Ashley: That's it, that's all she wrote.
Matt: This one here is going to--
Laura: He's going to try to eat her brain!
Matt: Tiberius, that is a 15 versus AC.
Orion: Nope!
Matt: What's your AC?
Orion: 17, man!
Matt: 17, as you're rushing toward the magic carpet that just took off, yeah, you look over and the tentacles swing toward you, you duck just underneath and manage to avoid the attack. Now the two intellect devourers. One's going to go ahead and look up towards the magic carpet that's taking off and-- here we go. Oh, within ten feet? No, you're too far away. So instead it's going to go for you on top of the Elder Brain. I want you to go ahead and make an intelligence saving throw, Vax.
Liam: 20, natural 20.
Matt: Natural 20!
Sam: Needed that.
Laura: That's not to Matt, that's to the little brains.
Liam: The brains, the brains.
Marisha: Fuck you, little brains.
Matt: So you feel a similar blast of screaming energy, like you feel from the illithids, but it's more primal and more guttural. You manage to shrug it off in your mind and angrily look down at this weird, fleshy creature. The other one moves up and attempts to blast you again from the opposite side. Make another intelligence saving throw.
Liam: 19.
Matt: 19! Once again you feel from the back of your brain this like stunning impact and you shrug it off looking over this way.
Liam: (jeering) I'm smart! (laughter)
Matt: All right, that brings us to Scanlan.
Sam: I'm grappled and stunned.
Matt: Yeah, so go ahead and make your saving throw.
Travis: Come on, buddy. (cheering)
Orion: Boom!
Matt: You shrug off the stunned effect, you're currently grappled by the entity.
Laura: You're so smart!
Ashley: You're so smart!
Marisha: You're so smart!
Travis: Cardiac kid, come on now, here we go. Table's getting hot.
Liam: Aren't you inspired?
Matt: And then also make an intelligence saving throw.
Sam: Oh, Jesus. Because he's also got the things on me.
Liam: Just say 20.
Sam: Seven. (laughs) Plus two.
Liam: Big nine.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: I said big nine.
Ashley: He rolled a 20, so that's gotta mean something.
Taliesin: I think a nine is a big six.
Marisha: The 20 carries over one, right? (laughter)
Travis: Residual?
Marisha: You take the one and you carry it over.
Travis: Natural 20 residual.
Liam: I personally can't wait until we roll new characters next show.
Laura: No.
Marisha: Shut up!
Matt: Unfortunately, you're still stunned.
Sam: Still stunned? Oh, so I got off--
Matt: You resisted the mind effect, but the tentacles on your head are now locking your brain in place, and your eyes are kind of rolling back in your head as you feel the illithid's mouth begin to push against the outside of your head. Grog?
Travis: I've got to break my grapple, right?
Matt: Yeah. Just go ahead and roll an athletics check.
Travis: One.
Matt: A natural one?
Sam: This guy.
Matt: A natural one; it rolled a four!
Orion: Plus your strength! Oh, it doesn't matter.
Taliesin: It doesn't matter.
Matt: Okay. So it's still holding you in place; you have your axe you picked up off the ground with your chain of returning; you can't physically move from your position as it's holding you there.
Travis: The axe is across the room, remember?
Matt: Well, no, you threw it over here and retrieved it at the end of the battle.
Travis: Well that's a good, that's a good plus.
Ashley: (frustrated noise)
Marisha: The fuck!
Matt: So what do you want to do?
Laura: You could attack with your chain.
Travis: I can attack with the chain?
Matt: You have your axe with your chain of returning, you just can't move, but you can still throw if you want to.
Orion: Oh, awesome.
Marisha: Can you chop the dude's arms off?
Travis: I have no-- it's holding me, I don't think I can be like--
Ashley: Maybe the guy that has him, his tentacles or whatever?
Travis: I was going to try and save you.
Ashley: Well. That's far.
Travis: Can I reach the illithid-- it's far?
Matt: Well, you can throw to either of them right now. They're both bent over gnome heads, they're bigger--
Travis: Where's Scanlan?
Ashley: Why the gnomes?
Matt: He's here, and that's Pike.
Ashley: Why the gnome hate?
Marisha: It's rare. It's a rare delicacy.
Matt: You guys were right there.
Travis: All right, I can't-- I'm going to try and throw it at the illithid that's on Scanlan.
Matt: Okay, go ahead and roll for an attack.
Ashley: Tasty gnome.
Liam: All the fans who implied that Matt went light on us the last game--
Travis: 22?
Matt: 22, definitely hits, go ahead and roll damage.
Travis: Okay, it's just one, two, three. Shit balls. 14.
Matt: 14 points of damage, all right. That one, you throw the axe, it slams into the shoulder of the illithid that's grabbing on to him. You see it look up at you angrily and a large portion of its chest is now gashed open and blood is pouring from the wound, but it's still holding tight right now. I think that's going to end your turn.
Travis: No, I'm done.
Matt: Do you want to pull your axe back?
Travis: Yes, I would like to.
Matt: Go ahead and you (grunts). Go ahead and make your check.
Travis: What do I, what the fuck do I roll, to the thing. What do I roll? A 12?
Matt: Yeah. A 20, you have to roll a d20, that was a d12.
Travis: Okay, good. (laughter)
Travis: 18.
Matt: So you pull on the chain of returning and it yanks the axes out of the wound and you catch it in midair, preparing for the next round.
Travis: (laughs) The 12 was a one. (laughter)
Matt: All right, first round of combat over. Let's roll better, guys. This is looking really dire. Vex, you're up.
Ashley: Get it.
Sam: Save everyone.
Matt: You're up at the top, you have a clear view of everyone.
Marisha: That's true, you're the only one with a bird's-eye view.
Sam: Just run. Save yourself.
Matt: As it is, these two illithids look kind of hurt, these two look really rough, this one looks really rough, both of these guys haven't been damaged yet but they have low hit points.
Sam: Save yourself, start a new race of people.
Laura: I am going to attack--
Sam: Hunter's Mark!
Laura: I'm going to put Hunter's Mark on-- oh, my brother just died.
Liam: I fainted.
Laura: On the one attacking Scanlan.
Taliesin: Not on Scanlan, on the one attacking Scanlan.
Matt: Oh right, sorry. (laughter)
Travis: What did he do?
Matt: In the confusion--
Sam: (shrieking) Help!
Orion: Friendly fire!
Ashley: That was amazing.
Laura: 14?
Matt: 14 unfortunately does--
Ashley: Plus! Plus War God's Blessing?
Matt: You're stunned.
Ashley: But can't I just do it just because?
Matt: No, unfortunately.
Marisha: Once, just this once, please?
Matt: Unfortunately, no.
Laura: But he's bent over and I've got a bird's-eye view of him.
Matt: You know what? He is grappling and he is right in the way, I'll go ahead and give you advantage on that attack. Roll again.
Laura: Yes! So I just roll again?
Matt: Roll again. Take whatever it is.
Laura: 22!
Matt: 22 will hit, okay. Because it is a stationary position, completely engulfing, and you have such a great view from above.
Laura: Right? 11 points of damage?
Matt: Okay. Did you roll your Hunter's Mark damage?
Laura: No, I did not.
Matt: Don't forget Hunter's Mark.
Laura: I won't, though. Three extra. That's for Hunter's Mark.
Ashley: 14 total?
Matt: Okay, gotcha. That's your first strike.
Laura: Okay. On my second one, should I just try to attack him again, kill him? All right, I'm going to kill him, try to hit him again. 18?
Matt: 18. Okay! So both strikes (whoosh). Go ahead and roll for damage.
Laura: 16 plus-- 19.
Matt: 19, okay. Both arrows (zoomf, zoomf), one embeds itself in the wound that Grog had left with the axe and you see the body tenses. Clarota stares up at you with this beaming angry look on his face; you realize, oh shit, Clarota's the one that's going after Scanlan. Your second arrow you bring down and release and it pierces the side of its face, gashing through and embedding itself in the chest. You can see now Clarota's looking really rough, but he's still holding taut. This horrible thought goes into your mind suddenly, a familiar voice saying, "You've all done your work. Now it's time to feast!"
Sam: (gasps) He turned on us!
Laura: I knew he was going to do that!
Sam: What? None of us knew that!
Laura: I totally knew he was going to do that.
Matt: All right, that ends your turn; Keyleth, you're up.
Travis: I don't trust Clarota. I don't trust Clarota. I don't trust Clarota. (laughter)
Ashley: Every week.
Travis: Every week!
Sam: You know who would help us right now?
Laura: Kima would help us, but she's stone.
Sam: Can we make her not stone?
Ashley: We can make her not stone, except we didn't get a chance to.
Liam: If we live, we're in store for so much I-told-you-so. (laughter)
Liam: It's a big if.
Sam: Maybe we should leave her. I don't want to deal with that.
Travis: Who's up?
Marisha: I can make, I'm going to-- aw, crap. I'm going to phase down, and I'm going to pop up, and I'm going to break the well that's holding the Elder Brain.
Ashley: Get it!
Matt: Okay, so you're going to pop up here? Over here?
Liam: No, not there!
Matt: Right there?
Marisha: Not where I might hurt Vax.
Sam: Well, that's anywhere.
Laura: Just do the other side!
Marisha: You might have to do, like, a flippy-poo off it.
Matt: So what are you doing on the well, you're just grabbing it?
Marisha: Can I? Can I flip?
Matt: No, it's embedded in the ground. What are you doing?
Marisha: Oh, okay, so I want to take and I want to just punch to crack a big side of it to help spill out the brains.
Matt: Okay, go ahead and make a slam attack on the side
Marisha: Bust the side of it open.
Ashley: And then we'll stomp on him and make brain juice.
Marisha: I mean, it's an item, it's a stationary rock, so what do I add? Oh wait, I add-- so plus-- sorry, I'm not used to this. Plus eight, 16?
Matt: 16? You slam into the side of this; you're not attacking the brain, you're attacking the stonework. You can feel there is some psychic resistance, but because you're not attacking the brain directly, your fist slams into it, making purchase in the stone. Go ahead and roll damage against the stone.
Travis: Come on!
Matt: Double damage on this.
Ashley: Big damage!
Marisha: 20 damage.
Travis: Yes!
Matt: 20 damage. The side of the stonework crumples inward. Pieces of the stonework itself seem to be jutting in toward the Elder Brain, but it's stopped by some sort of psychic resistance, but the whole side here to here is now just open entirely, and you can see now the hole, the mass of-- there's probably hundreds of various illithid brains that have slowly congealed into one large brain structure as now you can see the underneath area. The liquid it kind of sits in is now pouring out, down the side of the structure.
Marisha: Hope they have flood insurance. (groans and laughter)
Travis: That was the worst Schwarzenegger action line ever. (Terminator voice) Hope they have flood insurance, ja.
Marisha: The Geico slayer!
Travis: Holy shit. That was amazing.
Marisha: Flo just got real, all right? Flo just got real.
Taliesin: That's no better, actually.
Marisha: From Progressive Flo? All the flow of the-- you know what, never mind.
Matt: So you only have the one slam attack? Earth elemental doesn't multi-attack?
Marisha: Yes, just the one. My slam attack is--
Matt: Right. Cool.
Marisha: Oh no, wait! I have multi-- earth elemental makes two slam attacks!
Matt: That's good to know. Go ahead and make another one.
Marisha: I could have done that last time?
Matt: Are you attacking the stonework still?
Marisha: Yeah, I'm just going to take the other chunk and punch it.
Matt: Okay. So we'll say you used some of your movement to move this way. By the way, guys, you can break up your movement. You can move, attack, then move if you want to.
Marisha: You can?
Matt: Yeah!
Travis: Unless Tickle-me-Elmo is holding you by the cage.
Marisha: It's cocked. 16 plus eight, so 22.
Matt: That'll definitely do it; go ahead. Is that total damage? Oh, that's the attack. Okay, go ahead and roll damage.
Marisha: Ugh, four plus-- 18 damage.
Matt: 18's fine. So you break out the second half and now the entire side of it is open. All the fluid just spilled out the side and you get the sensation this is very frowned upon. (laughter)
Matt: That ends your turn. Tiberius, you're up!
Travis: A tentacle frown.
Orion: So I rush up, and Percy takes off?
Matt: As a note too, just so you guys are aware--
Taliesin: I didn't know you were coming to the carpet, sorry.
Laura: Oh no, we never closed the other door!
Matt: You start seeing a series of other entities slowly making their way up from the downstairs tunnel area.
Sam: I think we can beat them all.
Orion: Seeing what's going on-- there's an illithid right behind me, right?
Matt: There is. Right behind you, yeah.
Travis: I thought she closed the door.
Laura: No, we didn't.
Matt: Yeah, the other door is open.
Marisha: I closed the one, but then he said that they could levitate so I decided it wasn't worth it.
Sam: Hey, man. Grog's being held prisoner by an 80-pound dude.
Orion: So I'm running off and then Percy takes off? So I can't get to him?
Matt: Yeah, he's (whoosh), you can't get to him.
Orion: Awesome.
Travis: I'm so ashamed right now.
Orion: I need a technical question. Can I move the Horn and let go of the spell so I can then do my turn? Or does that take a thing to do that? Like, I want to let it go--
Matt: No.
Orion: Good. So as I'm running up to the carpet, I see Percy go and I'm like, "(growls) Damn Tiamat-lover!" So I bring over the Horn and right at the tip, on the carpet, I let it go. "You deal with it then!"
Matt: Percy? (loud clatter)
Laura: Oh no, K'Varn!
Matt: That's what you get!
Orion: I don't give it to Percy, I let it land on the carpet.
Matt: I know. I'm saying it's on his carpet right now, staring at him from the side.
Ashley: Put it on, Percy!
Orion: I see the-- oh god. Okay, I can only do this once. I see the-- they're not inside yet, right?
Matt: No. They're just starting to get to the doorway. You can see them right there.
Orion: Awesome. Okay, that is a-- and this is a-- Okay.
Matt: What you got, Tiberius? (laughter)
Travis: (Tiberius voice) Poppycock, poppycock.
Orion: Right. I have-- I blow everything. I'm going to blow everything.
Travis: Yes! Blow everybody. (laughter)
Matt: How diplomatic of you!
Sam: I'm stunned!
Orion: You cannot resist!
Matt: So, Tiberius.
Orion: As I leave the Horn there, I turn to where the door is. Obelisk of Stone. I seal up the entryway.
Matt: How many with that, what level are you using it?
Orion: Well, how wide is it? Like 15 feet?
Matt: It's a little over five feet wide.
Orion: Great. I only need one, right?
Matt: Technically, yeah.
Orion: Okay. So I seal that one-- I'm going to use all three right now.
Marisha: Seal the other one, too. I only partially sealed it.
Orion: I'll seal the other one.
Matt: Okay.
Orion: And I'll use the other one on myself.
Matt: Okay!
Orion: And I'm going to use-- I only have three left. Yeah, okay. And I'm going to use my last three sorcerer points that I have, and I have zero points after this, and I'm going to cast Blur on myself. And that's my turn.
Matt: All righty. You now start hearing (boof, boof) slamming sounds from the other side of the stone walls. Both sides of the walls are now sealed off with pillars, and a large pile of rubble on that side. All right, Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: All right, before I go anywhere, I'm taking a shot at Clarota.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Betraying bastard.
Taliesin: With Sharpshooter, that's 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. 19 points?
Matt: That hits.
Taliesin: That hits, and let's do my damage. That's 22 points of damage.
Matt: Okay. So, Scanlan, as you're stunned, you feel the tentacles swirling around the back of your head. Teeth are grinding into the back of your skull, and you feel this horrible pain as all of a sudden, Clarota's mouth is beginning to find a way towards your skull. (laughter)
Matt: And then the tentacles suddenly go limp as the back of Clarota's head (gunshot) becomes a mess.
Taliesin: Traitor!
Marisha: Traitor!
Laura: I can't believe we killed Clarota!
Taliesin: Some people have no sense of fucking honor! (laughter)
Marisha: Traitor!
Travis: Oh, Percy!
Matt: In a split second, your longtime ally, now turncoat, is scattered across the stone floor. You're released, you're no longer stunned.
Sam: (gasps) Hi, guys!
Taliesin: I still have another shot.
Matt: You do.
Marisha: There's someone on Pike, right?
Matt: There's still one on Pike right now, yeah, right here.
Taliesin: I'm taking a shot there.
Travis: Come on, Perce!
Ashley: Perce!
Marisha: Pew pew!
Taliesin: Oh yeah! So that's 17-- 17, 18, 19--
Matt: That hits.
Taliesin: Okay, that just hits, all right. I'm trying to use Sharpshooter, so it changes everything. And that's 18 points of damage.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: And did we get a short rest before this fight happened?
Sam: No.
Laura: No.
Taliesin: Fuck, never mind.
Matt: No you did not.
Marisha: That's why we're all burnt out on spells.
Taliesin: That's why we're all burnt out on shit, okay.
Orion: Except me.
Matt: Yeah, the other one--
Taliesin: I'm going to go up further.
Matt: Even further? Okay.
Laura: "Because I didn't help you guys!" Thanks, Tiberius!
Ashley: "I abandoned my troop!"
Orion: It's going to come in handy now!
Taliesin: Am I high enough yet for her to jump down onto the--
Matt: Yeah, you could probably pull it off.
Taliesin: So, if you and your bear want to jump on?
Matt: It'd be an acrobatics roll, but yeah.
Sam: Wait, why would you-- you've got to come save us!
Laura: Yeah, no, go down and save them, honestly, because I'm staying up top for right now, unless we can teleport out.
Taliesin: Oh, in that case, instead of going up I'm going to go fly to the right, then.
Orion: Pick up Vax!
Laura: Why?
Orion: I said Vax.
Laura: Vax?
Marisha: Vax? Pick up Vax?
Orion: Yes.
Taliesin: Yeah, so I'm going to fly down towards Vax, as well.
Matt: Okay. So you're going down to here instead?
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: Okay, you can get about-- we'll say, if you're just going--
Taliesin: Yeah, go there.
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: Hi.
Ashley: Hey you guys!
Taliesin: Hey you guys!
Marisha: Hey you guys!
Matt: Okay. That ends your turn. That brings it--
Ashley: Did anything happen to the guy that had me--
Matt: He just took damage, but he's not done yet.
Ashley: He just took damage, he's still (slurps).
Matt: So, Pike, it's your turn.
Ashley: It's my turn.
Matt: Go ahead and roll to get rid of the Mind Blast stun.
Ashley: Come on.
Sam: Come on, Pikey.
Ashley: Fuck. It's seven.
Matt: Seven? Nope. You're still locked in place.
Taliesin: Can you heal yourself?
Matt: She cannot move. Her entire brain is locked in with a searing clenching pain, psychic energy is just clutching her brain and holding it hostage.
Sam: Still beautiful, though. (laughter)
Matt: You feel, once again, the teeth beginning to pierce the back of the flesh. You feel the teeth of the mind flayer beginning to scrape against the skull, the actual bone it's found in the back. Vax, you're up.
Liam: What did Clarota do with his hat?
Matt: Oh, it's somewhere on the ground over here.
Liam: Over behind--
Matt: Over behind this.
Liam: Okay, I'm still Hasted, I'm going to run down the center over Clar-- I'm going to step on Clarota's-- I don't know if he has nuts, but whatever's there, I'm going to step there, run around Scanlan, and place his fucking hat on my head.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: And then run up behind that third mind flayer, who I don't think has taken a hit yet, and just start stabbing him in the back.
Matt: Right here?
Laura: No, on Pike!
Liam: I can't get back there.
Laura: You can't?
Liam: I don't think so.
Laura: Would he be able to make it?
Liam: Well it's up to-- oh dear.
Matt: You can't, with the speed you're running there, because your Hasted speed is doubled, so it's 60 feet.
Liam: I'm Hasted, I can run 12 spaces, so if you think that I could have run around the mind flayer, put on the party hat--
Matt: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12. You can move right there.
Liam: Okay, great. So I'm going to start stabbing him in the back, angrily.
Matt: All right.
Liam: Okay, yeah, so, first one is a 15?
Matt: Unfortunately-- no, that does just hit.
Liam: That's a Sneak Attack, because she's next to him. There's nothing in the rule book about stunned, or unconscious, or anything.
Matt: How Sneak Attack works is if they're next to someone that's aggressive toward them; they feel like they have people on two fronts, which is why you get the benefit.
Taliesin: He is, to be fair, very occupied.
Matt: I will say, circumstantially though, because he is currently grappled on to Pike, and is in the process of trying to grind into her brain with his mouth, he is a little preoccupied at the moment.
Travis: He's sucking head.
Matt: So I'm going to go ahead and make a perception roll versus your fast movement. Go ahead and make a stealth-- roll stealth to see whether or not he takes notice and changes his position in defense.
Liam: I rolled a 24.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead. The first attack you rolled was a 15, that hits!
Liam: Okay, thank you.
Matt: And that is a Sneak Attack, he did not see you coming that quickly.
Liam: All right, so that is four, plus seven is 11, plus-- okay, that's 17, 21, thank you. 26, 30, 33. 33 with keen dagger.
Matt: 33 with the keen dagger?
Liam: And I'm sticking that in the back of his neck.
Matt: Okay. That was your first attack?
Liam: That's the first attack.
Matt: Okay, so the first dagger (shnk) sinks into the back of the neck. You just manage to miss all the seriously vital stuff, but you carve a giant section out of the side of its head. The rest of its leathery black outfit's now slick with its own blood. You see it angrily growls, almost this weird guttural, this (gurgling growl) sound as it still remains taut and clenched on Pike, its eyes glaring at you, basically telling you, "Look what I'm about to do to your friend."
Liam: Okay, so good thing I have more knives. So I take the other one, flip it in my hand and then stick it into the neck afterwards. That's a 24.
Matt: That hits.
Liam: Yeah, it does. That's eight. Fire damage, I don't know if he takes any fire damage, and I'm going to then stick him with my poison dagger, which isn't going to poison him. But that is a 26 which hits as well.
Matt: That does hit.
Liam: And that is eight.
Matt: Eight points of damage. So the first one you stab in the side of the head, you pull back and toss it in the air, catch the second one. As it bursts into flames you place the searing dagger down into the center of its back between its shoulder blades. Its back tenses, and as it does it reaches back and tries to grab for the dagger as you pull back the third one. As it looks back at you it brings up one arm to stop you as it goes in to directly go after Pike's head. The third dagger you then stab it right in the front of the skull. Its eyes roll back in its head and its tentacles limply drag off. (cheering)
Liam: As a bonus action, I would like to Goodfellas-kick him about eight times in the ribs. (laughter)
Marisha: Yes!
Matt: I'll allow it. Oh my god. Because that guy was next! If we didn't kill him this turn, she would've taken 55 points of damage.
Travis: 50-- Let's not even say the number.
Ashley: You saved my life.
Matt: Yeah. And if it takes you to zero hit points, they extract the brain and eat it.
Laura: Now we've got to squish those little brains.
Liam: There's still a mind flayer.
Travis: We're coming real close.
Matt: Let's see if they get their Mind Blast back. Nope. Nope.
Liam: This show is not good for my blood pressure.
Marisha: I know! It's like constant fight or flight.
Travis: I think I'm going blind in my left eye.
Marisha: This should fix your sleep schedule though, right?
Travis: Yeah, totally.
Matt: Seeing both of them get immediately slaughtered, both of these illithids just Plane Shift. A defensive standpoint, self-preservation is kicking in. However, intellect devourers do not have self-preservation. They're there for a specific reason. So this one here is going to move over to this side and is going to attempt to make a Devour Intellect attack against Keyleth. Keyleth, go ahead and make an intelligence saving throw.
Marisha: I'm an elemental, so.
Matt: You keep your intelligence score as you.
Marisha: Oh, I do?
Matt: The physical attributes you get from the elemental form. You keep your intellect, wisdom, and charisma.
Marisha: Okay, then 18.
Matt: 18, Okay. You resist the blast of mental impact from the intellect devourer, now on the ground with its four feral legs, its brain form rippling. The second one is going to turn over here and saw the two shots, the one that took out Clarota. It turns up towards Percy, as you've lowered on the magic carpet, Percy. Go ahead and make an intellect saving throw.
Taliesin: Eight.
Matt: Eight? All righty.
Sam: Oh boy. That ain't no good.
Matt: You take 11 points of psychic damage.
Taliesin: There's an "and" there, isn't there?
Sam: And it's undone immediately. (laughter)
Matt: And you take eight points of intellect damage.
Laura: Oh, this is what happened to Grog!
Travis: You're better off than six, right?
Taliesin: Eight points of intellect damage. What does that mean, precisely?
Liam: Minus from your intelligence.
Sam: You would know if you had more intellect.
Laura: Forever?
Matt: No, no, no, no. For this, it basically-- what's your intelligence?
Taliesin: 16.
Matt: 16? Yeah, the blast hits you and you just shrug off the impact. It has to exceed your intelligence.
Taliesin: So do I still take eight more points of damage, though?
Matt: No, no no. You just the additional--
Taliesin: I just, I'm just going to go duh-duh. (laughter)
Matt: Yeah, the intellect damage is not permanent.
Taliesin: I like purple.
Matt: Not quite that bad.
Travis: I can't not do it.
Matt: All right. That ends their turn. That brings us to Scanlan. You're no longer stunned. You now have full capacity of yourself and you're looking around, oh shit.
Sam: Do we get out of here or do we try to kill these things?
Travis: Can you get us out of here?
Sam: I can get some of us out of here.
Marisha: Start getting us out.
Sam: Are we getting out or are we fighting?
Travis: Getting us out.
Marisha: Because we still have these fuckers we have to--
Ashley: Because Tiberius can get some of us out, right?
Liam: It's just the brains. Just the little brains.
Sam: It's just the little brains. For now.
Matt: Make a perception check, by the way.
Marisha: For now, but people can beat through those doors. That's not a permanent thing.
Taliesin: We need 60 seconds to get out of here is what we need. We need 60 uninterrupted seconds.
Marisha: Well, we can start gathering our shit and packing up.
Taliesin: Oh, yeah.
Marisha: We can start packing up.
Sam: Am I leaving or am I staying?
Travis: You do what you want.
Liam: Do what you want. It's chaos.
Sam: (sighs) All right. Then I'll attack.
Matt: Swarming thing that drift up the sides of the temple from the floor. Coming from inside the temple and out toward the top.
Laura: We should probably get out of here! They're coming up the sides!
Ashley: We can't get you out of here if you don't come--
Sam: I run up to Pike. I grab her hand. I say, "I want to have babies with you." (laughter)
Sam: Let's get out of here. (sings) So now I come to you with Dimension Door.
Ashley: Wait! Can I do a Mass Cure Wounds before we leave? (laughter)
Sam: And we get out.
Matt: You're still stunned from the Mind Blast. You haven't made your save.
Sam: We're going up to the top of the-- to the thing. Just to the roof there.
Laura: They're coming up the sides!
Ashley: We've got to go somewhere else.
Sam: Well, I didn't know that. (laughs) It's done.
Orion: It's fine. It's good that they're up there.
Sam: And, as a bonus, I'm going to send some inspiration to Grog.
Matt: Okay, as you Dimension Door you just go ahead and look back. Using the song of love you gave to Pike, you give back, give a wink to Grog. Grog, you take a 1d10 inspiration. 1d10 inspiration dice to you.
Travis: Okay.
Liam: Grog, we would like you to rage.
Travis: I'm already there. I'm just being fucking grappled. Is it my turn?
Matt: It is now.
Travis: Oh, can I try it for the third time to break free?
Matt: You can. Go ahead and go ahead and make your athletics.
Liam: Use that inspiration die, man.
Travis: I'll use the inspiration die just in case I rolled balls again.
Matt: Well, you can use it after you do it. See what you roll and then add it.
Travis: It's athletics, right?
Matt: Athletics, yeah.
Travis: 18.
Matt: 18?
Liam: Come on.
Matt: Yeah, you (boosh) break out of the creature's grasp. Suddenly it's reaching at you from behind the bars. You can see there's this slick, brackish oil on your body from where it was holding you. Fleshless arms clutching you to the bars.
Travis: So is everybody leaving? Should I climb up the rope?
Matt: There is Lady Kima who is turned to stone.
Marisha: We've got to get Kima out.
Travis: Fuck Lady Kima!
Orion: Pick her up!
Laura: I thought you had a crush on her?
Ashley: Can he grab her and climb?
Matt: You can. She's not a big stone structure.
Travis: Okay, cool. I pick her up and start trying to climb up the rope.
Matt: Okay, so you rush, you grab the stone form.
Sam: Put her in the Bag of Holding!
All - sam - matt: No!
Travis: She's stone! It doesn't matter!
Orion: Don't do that!
Travis: I take her and-- oh, fine. I'll hold on to her.
Sam: No, put her in the bag!
Marisha: Can you make one of those baby slings? Stuff her in your belt?
Taliesin: It's not time for arts and crafts.
Matt: You run up. You grab Lady Kima. You grab her in your arms and you rush. The rope is currently dangling from this side where you guys first came in.
Laura: Stomp all over the brain to get to it.
Matt: 50 speed. You can get up to here. You can just get up to the rope and we'll say as your dash action you can begin to climb, if you'd like.
Travis: I would like to climb.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: I would like to raise.
Travis: I would like to rage. Rage climb.
Matt: It gets you about there. Rage climbing like (grunts).
Orion: Yes!
Matt: One-handed up the rope. That's pretty intense. Go ahead and make an athletics check.
Marisha: Yes. That Crossfit training come in handy.
Travis: 17.
Matt: 17. Yeah, it's sore. You know that arm is going to be dead tomorrow, but right now it doesn't even matter. You're just clutching Lady Kima, still locked in her attack pose, in one arm as you're overhand grabbing the rope and getting yourself up as fast as you can.
Travis: You better remember this when you wake up. (laughter)
Matt: Rage-climbing up the rope.
Liam: He's climbing the Cliffs of Insanity! (laughter)
Matt: That brings us to Vex.
Laura: I should just stay where I am, right guys?
Taliesin: And you should shoot things.
Laura: I'm going to do that, yes. Is there any other-- there's just a little brain in there right now?
Matt: Right now there's two brains, and you can see just in the outskirts of the temple's side here, two more illithid that are making their way up the side of the temple.
Laura: Oh, fuck me.
Matt: With about a hundred or so just now gathering towards the bottom of the temple base.
Laura: Jesus. We're going to get out of here real fast! You guys are listening to me, right? Because things are coming up the side and we need to get out of here.
Sam: But what if there's gold down there to find?
Laura: I don't give a fuck! I'm going to Hunter's Mark a little brain. Or should I keep attacking the Elder Brain? What do you guys think?
Taliesin: Elder Brain is spilling out the side now, isn't it?
Matt: The Elder Brain is still inside, just the stonework on the outside of it is currently knocked out.
Taliesin: Yeah, I have a carpet anyway, so let's just jump on it.
Liam: I mean, it might get sent reeling, that brain.
Laura: I know, that's why I'm kind of like, hm.
Liam: Maybe if-- we should try to get out of here, but maybe if we can frigging hurt that brain it'll stun them or send them reeling or something, or make them mad.
Laura: All right. I can do Hail of Thorns on it again, so I'll Hunter's Mark it and then I'll do Hail of Thorns on it.
Matt: All right.
Laura: 27.
Matt: That'll hit. Releasing again, in midair you can see all the thorns appear out the sides of the arrow shaft. It explodes into a giant conical-- just a ray, almost like a blizzard of thorns.
Liam: Get it.
Laura: I don't add-- do I add Hunter's Mark to that damage, or just my regular and then that?
Matt: At the end of all the damage you dealt with the attack, you then add Hunter's Mark to that.
Laura: Okay.
Liam: Big money.
Laura: 22. 24.
Matt: 24, all righty. Keyleth, go ahead and make a reflex saving throw.
Marisha: What's happening?
Laura: Oh, right, because you're right next to it, sorry Keyleth.
Marisha: Oh, it's okay. My reflex-- I use my dex modifier for my elemental, correct?
Matt: Or deflect, yeah, sorry, old carryover, it's dexterity.
Marisha: Ten.
Matt: Ten? Versus your spell save of--
Laura: 14.
Matt: Yeah, so you take the same damage. You take 24 points of damage.
Laura: Sorry. Oh right, you're really, really strong.
Marisha: Yeah, I've got 100 hit points still.
Laura: Okay.
Marisha: So how many points? 21?
Matt: 24. So, all the thorns explode against your rocky physical form; you just shrug it off, like it's nothing. (laughs) It tickles a little.
Marisha: Yeah, I'm good.
Laura: So I'll try to-- I guess I'll just attack it again, because I've got nowhere else to go.
Matt: Okay.
Orion: Yeah.
Laura: 17?
Matt: All right, 17-- actually no, 17 will miss.
Laura: Oh really, with it oozing out and everything?
Matt: The second, there's some sort of psychic protective field in the brain. As you fire down, the arrow looks like it should strike and then it just arcs off to the side nonsensically, and then just splinters against the stonework next to the--
Laura: Fudge!
Travis: Fudge.
Matt: You going to stay where you are? You going to move?
Orion: Get on Trinket!
Laura: I'm going to climb onto Trinket for some reason, because that makes sense.
Matt: Okay, you climb onto Trinket's back. That brings us to Keyleth. You're up.
Marisha: Okay, what's the situation with the brain soup?
Matt: The liquid is poured out.
Marisha: And how are the brains? Are just brains just floating downstream?
Matt: No, it's actually all-- at a long distance, it looks like one giant brain, close up it looks like all of these smaller brains have all congealed into one giant mind.
Laura: It's like a jello mold of brains.
Marisha: Like a jello mold of a brain. And there's fluid coming out from underneath of it?
Matt: Yeah. Literally the fluid it was sitting in, it was mostly submerged in, is all now poured out onto the ground near you, beginning to get slick.
Marisha: Okay, here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to be like, phase under, phase down, and I'm going to get under where the brain would be, and I'm going to Superman punch it!
Laura: Yes!
Orion: Yeah!
Marisha: From underneath.
Matt: Okay, go ahead and make an attack roll.
Travis: Come on, punch it in its big brain anus.
Marisha: 23!
Matt: 23, that hits, go ahead and roll damage.
Marisha: (laughs) 11? Wait, is that my--
Taliesin: No, 22.
Marisha: Oh, 22! You're right, 22.
Matt: It's not double damage, because you're not hitting the structure. So 11 points of damage? All right, now I want you to go ahead and make a strength check.
Marisha: Okay, that sounds fun.
Matt: So just roll and add your strength modifier of the earth elemental.
Marisha: 14?
Matt: Okay, as you punch upward, you're still partially absorbed into the earth, but your fist comes through and it slams in, and you feel this sickening thud sound as your fist hits the interior of the brain. It still moves a little bit but it stays in its place held aloft by its own psychic defense mechanism. Make your second attack.
Marisha: Okay, yeah, same, 21.
Matt: 21 hits. Go ahead and roll damage on that one.
Laura: Big damage!
Marisha: Come on.
Taliesin: Big money.
Marisha: Oh, that's better. 16.
Matt: 16 damage. Go ahead and roll another strength check.
Marisha: Eight.
Matt: Eight? Okay. Once again, you slam your fist into it and you feel like the impact is absorbed partially by the psychic field around the brain. It holds itself in place. It's still not moving from within that small--
Marisha: Do I stay or do I get out?
Laura: Get out.
Orion: Get out.
Matt: You still have about-- I'd say it only took you about 15 feet of movement to get underneath it.
Marisha: In my burrowing speed, right?
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: So, I'm going to start burrowing up the side of the mountain-- up the side of the temple, so I can pop out next to them.
Matt: Okay, so we'll say 25, 30, 35, 40, 45. What's your total burrow speed?
Marisha: 60.
Matt: So you'll be about there.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: So you're about as high as Tiberius is, partially up the wall.
Marisha: I'm in the wall.
Laura: They won't see you.
Travis: Vax, you're still on the floor, right?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: Up on there. As you glance in, you kinda have a brief look at the outside of the wall and on the opposite side there are two other mind flayers. One more coming up on the side and another troll behind it. And the troll's slamming onto the bricks you left up. And these two illithids are starting to look up and see you moving up, and their eyes go up and they can see the opening in the top of the-- where the wall collapsed earlier. And they both look up and kinda start drifting up towards it. So that ends your turn. Tiberius, you're up.
Orion: What's the order after me?
Matt: Well, it's Percy, Pike, Vax, and then they go. Then Scanlan, Grog.
Taliesin: I was going to hold my turn to get everybody on the carpet.
Liam: I'm coming.
Orion: Okay, okay, good. I cast Fly at 5th level. I cast it on myself. I cast it on Grog. And I cast it on-- you're not there.
Laura: Trinket!
Orion: Trinket. (groans)
Travis: She's on Trinket.
Laura: So I can fly if I'm on Trinket, right?
Orion: Yeah.
Laura: Sweet!
Matt: All right, so Grog, Trinket, and--
Orion: Me.
Matt: Yourself. Okay.
Orion: And I (flying noise).
Matt: What's the fly speed on that?
Orion: Um, outside?
Liam: A skillion.
Orion: I dunno, it's right here. It's right here.
Matt: It's on the card, the cards I gave you.
Orion: The cards! Look at the cards. It's 60 feet.
Matt: 60 feet. You make your way up top and you're now hovering. Trinket's now having another Peter Pan moment with you on his back awkwardly. It's just gotten used to flying on its own, that one time it had. Now it has an extra weight on its back. (bear noises)
Laura: You can do it, buddy. You can do it.
Ashley: You got it, Trink.
Matt: All right.
Orion: Oh wait, hold on-- I want to turn to to everybody and go, "Fly, you fools."
Matt: It's a free action, I'll let you do that. (laughs) Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: I'm holding my turn.
Matt: You're holding back?
Taliesin: I'm holding my turn.
Matt: Okay. Percy, holding back. Pike, go ahead and make an intellect saving throw.
Laura: Yes!
Ashley: 19.
Matt: 19. You finally shrug off the effect of the Mind Blast. Your eyes clarify.
Sam: Does she fall in love with the first thing she sees? (laughter)
Matt: (laughs) The first thing you do see is Scanlan holding you. You're now outside of the temple. There's the dark, kind of dull glowing green atmosphere outside the entire Yug'Voril city around you, with bits of blue crystal, you know, against the cavern walls. It's scary. You look around you, you can see illithid charging up the side of the temple, just gliding toward you angrily. You look forward and on your shoulders, clutching you, is Scanlan, blood streaking down the front of his face with a big smile.
Ashley: (gasps) Scanlan, are you hurt?
Sam: I'm fine, baby. How are you?
Ashley: I'm great. Well, not really, but I'm just going to pretend I'm happy so that everybody can be okay. (laughter)
Orion: That's right, Pike. Bury it deep inside.
Ashley: Well, can I do a spell? Okay, Mass Cure Wounds.
Matt: Okay.
Ashley: For the, well, hold on a minute. How low is everybody? Not really that low?
Laura: Nobody's really low.
Travis: I'm at 32.
Ashley: He's pretty low.
Taliesin: You two are the only ones.
Laura: Yeah. Can you cast something on Kima? Oh, no. We should just keep her stone for now.
Sam: You're low. You're super low.
Laura: Yeah, cast it on yourself, man.
Travis: Heal yourself.
Taliesin: She can hold this part of her turn until everybody's up there.
Matt: Mass Cure Wounds on yourself? Because Mass Cure Wounds is for multiple people.
Ashley: No, can I just do--
Matt: You can cast Cure Wounds on yourself.
Ashley: I can?
Matt: Yeah.
Ashley: But he needs it, too.
Matt: It's your choice. It's also touch. You have to be next to him to do that.
Ashley: Shit.
Travis: Just do your thing. You need it.
Ashley: All right, I need it? Oh no.
Matt: At six hit points, I'd recommend it to you.
Travis: The DM recommends it. (laughter)
Matt: You were so close to dying again. I was so scared.
Travis: I stringently urge you.
Liam: Four out of five DMs recommend. (laughter)
Ashley: All right, 17.
Matt: Okay, so you heal yourself 17 hit points. You clutch your holy symbol. You feel the warmth fill your body and your wounds seal up slowly. You feel a little better, because you were on death's door there. All right. You want to move at all? Anything else you want to do this turn or are you good?
Ashley: Now I'm at 23. Wait, so bonus action?
Orion: Get on the bear!
Laura: No, he can't--
Matt: You don't have to.
Ashley: He can "bear-ly" hold one. (groans and laughter)
Laura: Ba dum tss.
Ashley: I can't do that, right?
Matt: What?
Ashley: I can't get on Trinket?
Matt: Right now, Trinket can barely hold Vex.
Ashley: So as a bonus action, I'll give Scanlan a kiss on his cheek.
Sam: Oh! Do I get an inspiration for that?
Matt: You do. (laughter)
Matt: A d6 inspiration dice.
Sam: I'm never going to wash it again.
Orion: You never wash it to begin with.
Matt: It's this strangely romantic moment as she reaches forward, grabs him and kisses him on the cheek and pulls away and he looks at her with this beautiful smile, and then the sound effects kick in again, of the bats screeching ahead and the (inhales) of all the illithid swarming up the side of the temple.
Marisha: Oh god, we're still in a war zone!
Ashley: Oh no, we got to get it together.
Matt: All right, Vax.
Liam: Okay, I run up the dais, land on the brain. I'm on my way, but before I go, I'm going to kiss you goodbye. Dagger, dagger, dagger. Stabbing into the brain before I leap onto the carpet. So here I go. First one-- misses. Second one is a 25.
Matt: 25, okay.
Liam: Which gets nine damage.
Matt: All right.
Liam: And last dagger is a 13.
Matt: No.
Liam: Okay, so I'll give him a little cut, a little nick, and then jump on the flying carpet.
Matt: Jump on the flying carpet. All righty.
Liam: And I grab Percy around the neck and kiss him on the cheek, and say, "Let's get out of here, you bastard."
Taliesin: Do I get an inspiration point for that? (laughter)
Matt: No.
Laura: That's a double standard.
Taliesin: You know how I feel about you.
Liam: Fight the patriarchy.
Matt: Down the road, maybe. This is the start of something beautiful.
Taliesin: I'm feeling something new.
Matt: Let the seeds germinate for a while. Then the dice may come naturally. So you're holding your turn? Percy, you want to go now?
Taliesin: I want to go now.
Matt: All right. So, that brings you here. Percy, go ahead.
Taliesin: I'm just going to reel straight up. And on my way up, I'm going to take two more shots at the brain.
Matt: Okay, okay. We'll say here for the purposes of this. Taking two more shots?
Taliesin: 16.
Liam: Oh, I'm suffocating in the brain!
Matt: Oh no, it's fallen over. What's the first roll?
Taliesin: 16.
Matt: 16 does hit. Oh, it's not even flat, okay. We're just going to put it down there.
Taliesin: And 19.
Matt: 16 doesn't hit. The 19 just barely hits it. It pierces through the psychic barrier. (zoomf) The bullet sinking again into the fleshy membrane.
Taliesin: The second one has a bonus die, yay.
Matt: Ice shot.
Taliesin: Ice shot.
Marisha: Maybe you'll freeze it.
Liam: Percy and Vax, ship it!
Taliesin: That's 13 points plus two points of ice damage.
Matt: Okay, so 16 total. All right. As it blasts inside, you can see the ice, these strange crystals of frozen liquid, they burst out, almost like it actually freezes the blue explosion in place for a moment, and then the ice just slowly melts away. Yeah, there's some damage dealt to it, but this is a hardy sack of hit points. And it's coming online. So with the end of your turn, the brain, now taken a bunch of hits, begins to pulse with energy, now that it's been freed from its control and it's slowly brought itself out of this trance-like slumber that it was placed in by K'Varn. The Elder Brain is now becoming conscious once again.
Liam: Oh dear.
Taliesin: Can we go up there? Can you put us at our height now? (laughter)
Marisha: Can you represent us accurately?
Matt: So at a 30-foot radius, which you guys are, it gives off a pulse of energy, (boomf) this giant psychic burst of purple-ish, psychic blast just cascades out of the center and just fills the room for a second with this large dull thud-like "thoom" sound. All of you instinctively look down and see this explosion that just dissipates as it crests the bottom of the magic carpet, which is just out of range.
Taliesin: You're wearing the helmet, at least.
Matt: At which point, you guys who are at the top, looking off to the side, all the illithid that are rushing up the tunnel, there's a sudden flash of purple energy in their eyes simultaneously. Like now the Elder Brain has come back online and has reconnected with its people.
Laura: Out, out, out!
Matt: All right, that brings us to Grog. Grog.
Travis: I can keep flying up?
Matt: All of the sudden, the rope is really easy to go up. It's nothing, you're just going hand over hand.
Orion: You can fly, Grog!
Travis: I have one more level three, whatever it's called, level three healing potion. They're called called superior or something? What's the word for it?
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: I'd like to take that.
Marisha: I have so much adrenaline during these kind of fights.
Taliesin: I know.
Matt: They're moving around, they're angry, they can't quite get to their targets.
Travis: I heal 24 points of hit damage.
Matt: Fantastic. Rolling for the bottom of the attack round. Okay. The troll bursts through the door, filling in with the two mind flayers behind it. They both look up, frustrated. And both begin to drift up.
Laura: No!
Matt: As far as they can get.
Travis: Fuck this house of horrors.
Ashley: How do we get out of here?
Laura: How are we going to get out of here?
Matt: They are going to attempt two Mind Blasts. All right. That's as high as they get with levitation. With the full height that takes the top, because technically you guys are up here, I just couldn't put the structure that high up. The only people-- The only person that's in the radius would be Scanlan and Pike. Again.
Ashley: All right.
Matt: Both of you guys make intellect saving throws again.
Sam: I'm just looking into her eyes the whole time.
Ashley: Can you sing?
Marisha: You've got that inspiration die.
Sam: Oh, I do. I don't need it though.
Matt: What did you roll?
Sam: I'm at 20.
Matt: Okay.
Ashley: 14.
Matt: 14? All right.
Sam: Can I sing for her?
Matt: (laughs) Unfortunately, you have to do that on your turn. You manage to resist the effects of it. You take 22 points of psychic damage and once again your brain clenches--
Laura: Good thing you healed yourself, Pike!
Matt: Damn good thing you healed yourself.
Sam: She was at 23! That's 22. That's one point!
Laura: Yeah. That's the second time this round.
Matt: You feel all of the sudden, the blast hits you and you see her eyes roll back in her head as she reaches up and grabs the side of her head again, nearly dropping her shield and mace, which you manage to catch before they clatter down into the temple.
Ashley: Okay.
Sam: Baby, come on.
Ashley: Maybe we'll be okay?
Marisha: Do you want some more dice?
Matt: All right, Grog, you're up. Oh no, you're up there, they went. That brings it to the top of the round. Vex, you're up.
Marisha: Take it, take it. Give it to her, please.
Orion: Head to the beach!
Sam: Wait, top of the round?
Matt: Yeah, we're at the very top now. At the very end, the new guys burst in and attacked.
Laura: I'm going to-- (sighs) Is that brain fluid still floating around it? Like, out and stuff?
Travis: Well, we woke it up.
Laura: I know.
Liam: But now it's awake, so--
Matt: Percy shot-- No, actually, you didn't do your turn on that one. I'm sorry, I think we skipped Scanlan.
Sam: Should I kill the brain, or try to kill the brain?
Liam: If you can also flee at the same time.
Orion: Well, he has to wait for the carpet.
Sam: The brain is down there in the puddle? In the pool? Is that big scaffolding still hanging over it?
Matt: It's currently dangling over to this side. Because it's been busted from three different corners and it's precariously hanging.
Sam: But it's not right over the thing?
Laura: But it might fall and tip.
Sam: Or it could not.
Ashley: Could somebody also use Telekinesis to pull it to fall the other way?
Orion: I do not have the necessary item to do two concentration spells at once.
Sam: Is it super heavy?
Matt: It's pretty heavy. It probably weighs close to 700 to 1,000 pounds.
Marisha: What does?
Matt: The giant brass structure.
Sam: And how high above it is it? Like, would it get a significant amount of force?
Matt: It would fall down and then topple over.
Sam: Unless I made it fall--
Matt: Unless you made it fall. In that case, we'll see.
Sam: Do I do that or do I just Lightning Strike? Okay.
Liam: It's your decision.
Marisha: Go bold!
Travis: Do what you were going to do. Do it.
Sam: I'm feeling handsy. (laughter)
Sam: (sings) Bigby's Hand! So I take Bigby's Hand and I sort of try to wrench it off the last thing that's holding it up, but in the direction of the--
Matt: Okay!
Sam: Of the brain.
Matt: Go ahead and make a roll, adding your plus five for your casting ability.
Sam: Well, that's not good.
Orion: And inspiration!
Sam: Oh, yeah! Okay, so that makes it 13 plus what?
Matt: 13 plus five, which is your charisma.
Sam: Okay, then 18.
Matt: 18. As the spectral Bigby's Hand reaches over and grabs the top of the structure, you can see the weird bit of bent metal that was once part of the mostly-destroyed structure that held it aloft in the center of the temple (metal creaking) wrenches forth and snaps as the entire structure begins to be pulled at an angle.
Sam: (sings) It's Bigby's Hand.
Matt: It slams down at an angle into the side of the brain and coming to rest on top, crushing even further the corpse of Clarota, currently smeared across the ground. Oh, man. Go ahead and roll 6d6 force damage on that. Crushing damage, as this heavy thing jams itself into the brain.
Liam: Six cubes, Sam, six cubes.
Sam: Orion's my dice bimbo.
Orion: Here you go, boss.
Ashley: There you go, boss!
Sam: 16.
Matt: 16, so the structure slams into the Elder Brain, and you can see like a bit of purplish black liquid kinda squirts out to one side and for the first time you can see a part of the brain is actually torn open, and the purplish glow that you see throbbing in the middle of its folds is now visible from the interior. You can see now, it's taken some real damage. Immediately the two mind flayers that were floating up look down, freaked out, and begin moving towards the brain now, instinctively, to defend it.
Sam: And bonus action, can I pour some superior healing potion down Pike's beautiful throat?
Matt: You can. (laughter)
Matt: I'm not going anywhere with that.
Taliesin: Yeah, no.
Sam: I'm just pouring my potion down Pike's throat.
Matt: Anyway. All right, so Vex, what're you doing?
Sam: I don't know what superior is.
Matt: Oh, it's a superior one, superior goes to, it's 8d4 plus eight.
Sam: Do I roll or does she?
Matt: You roll.
Sam: Oh!
Matt: It's your potion.
Sam: 8d4 plus eight.
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: Holy bajeez. One.
Matt: Five, nine, 13.
Sam: 15, 18, 21.
Matt: 15, 18, 21.
Matt: One more.
Sam: 22.
Matt: Plus eight, 30. You heal 30 hit points.
Ashley: What? Awesome.
Sam: I got some good potion.
Matt: Very, very expensive potion used. All right, so. Vex? You're on Trinket still, do you want to hold your action and wait for the rest of the carpet, do you want to attack anyone, what do you want to do?
Laura: I want to attack the Elder Brain.
Matt: Okay. Go for it.
Laura: I'm going to-- I think all I can do is a Conjure Barrage.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: So it's the cone of attack.
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: So that will get hopefully all the things, because I'm shooting down, right?
Matt: Well, how big is the cone?
Laura: It's 60 feet.
Matt: 60-foot cone from your angle here, if you're going for the brain it'll catch this guy, maybe, as a cone that goes down this way.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: Unless you want to go this way and hit these guys, or this guy.
Liam: You could get the edge of the brain.
Laura: Yeah, can I do the edge on the brain and get--
Matt: Yeah. You can get, you can get probably these guys there.
Laura: All right, let's do that.
Matt: All right.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: So they get saving throws, right? How does that work?
Laura: Yes, they get saving throws.
Matt: So roll damage, and we'll see what their saving throws are.
Laura: Okay. But do I have to roll to see if it hits, or it just hits?
Matt: No, for that one, it's just a barrage and they get to roll a saving throw against it.
Laura: Oh! Okay, cool. 17?
Matt: All right.
Laura: Plus Hunter's Mark? On the Elder Brain.
Matt: Yeah, so the Elder Brain takes additional damage.
Laura: Three additional. Do I get plus two for the bracers on that Conjure Barrage?
Matt: Technically, yes you would, because they're ranged.
Laura: Okay, so that would've been 19.
Matt: 19. All right. Cool. And then this guy fails its save, so total damage on him?
Laura: 19.
Matt: 19 on him? Okay. So it's still alive, just looking really, really rough. The brain's just now pierced with a bunch of arrows, some of it, it's barely holding itself on top of its feet. And the troll also takes the damage as well, just seems to shrug it off, just seems to angrily-- roars up from the bottom of the temple at you, now seemingly helpless in the current circumstance.
Laura: So then I want to attack the Elder Brain again.
Matt: All right. So you release it down.
Laura: 20.
Matt: Very nice, that hits, go ahead and roll damage.
Laura: All right. 11.
Matt: 11 points of damage, all right.
Laura: Oh, wait, wait! No, lies! 13.
Matt: 13, okay, there we go.
Travis: (laughs) No, lies.
Matt: (laughs) Reach down again, release this one, aiming towards the now torn-open wound on the side of the Elder Brain as the arrow now sinks in, there's another pulse of purple energy, and you hear, all of you simultaneously in your heads this scream, this screech (screech) that echoes through your heads. As it does, the two illithid that were hovering towards it grab their heads momentarily out of frustration and glare up at you angrily.
Orion: Ooh! I took notice of this.
Matt: That brings us to Keyleth.
Marisha: I'm going to take the rest of my burrow speed to get up to the top.
Matt: All right.
Marisha: I'm assuming I'm there?
Matt: You just manage to make it to the top of the temple, yeah.
Marisha: Okay. Drop earth elemental.
Matt: All right. Keyleth is on the field.
Marisha: Would you say--
Sam: Oh boy. (laughter)
Matt: Nothing good ever comes out of this. What do you got, Keyleth, what are you doing?
Marisha: Theoretically.
Matt: Theoretically?
Marisha: Our brains are made up of water, right? Would you say that there is water in the like jello brain mold, like water molecules would be in it?
Matt: Make an arcana check.
Marisha: Okay. I don't know much in terms of arcana, but I can try. Ten.
Matt: You have no idea. You have never encountered an Elder Brain before.
Laura: Yeah, give it a try!
Taliesin: Give it a try!
Marisha: Okay. I'm going to cast Control Water. I'm going to assume that there's water, it's 300 feet, I got the range and I'm going to take the brain where it's already kind of sliced down the middle where Vex has already made progress, I'm going to take it and I'm just going to rip it apart.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and roll a d20 and add your wisdom modifier to it.
Marisha: Okay.
Travis: Wait, you're saying brains are made of water?
Taliesin: Whoa!
Marisha: 23.
Matt: Okay. There is an element of liquid to its structure, however it is difficult to extract it from a form that you're unfamiliar with, let alone one that's this stable. You manage to find a way to pull moisture out of parts of it and actually deal damage to it as you're beginning to shrivel sections of the brain. Go ahead and roll 3d6. You do 3d6 points of dehydration damage.
Marisha: I'll take it, I'll take it.
Ashley: Make some brain jerky.
Marisha: They'll have a really bad hangover tomorrow.
Matt: Oh yeah. Oh, you don't even know the half of it.
Marisha: Ooh! Just 3d6 or plus anything?
Matt: Just 3d6.
Marisha: 15.
Matt: 15, all right. 15 points of dehydration damage to the Elder Brain. You can see now the portion of the wound that's been opened, the corners of it kind of shrivel in and tuck in and the actual purple glow in the inside dulls slightly. And you now have, currently, in the air, a small amorphous globule of brain fluid that's just kind of floating there in this, in the air.
Ashley: Awesome.
Laura: Gross.
Marisha: Cool. (laughter)
Marisha: Scanlan, smell it! Smell it!
Sam: No, thank you.
Matt: Tiberius, you're up.
Orion: Did you say there was illithid coming up on the sides, too?
Matt: Yeah, they're swarming up the side. They're probably about halfway up.
Orion: Okay. I turn to the group. I suggest we go to the beach immediately. There we can shore up defenses and I can cast a spell and get us out of here. As I say that, I go (fwwt) and throw a Fireball right at that fucker's head.
Matt: Okay. Are you using your movement to bring the carpet, to take control of the carpet from Percy and move it up higher?
Orion: No, I'm up top. I have Fly on myself.
Matt: Oh, that's right. Sorry. Yeah. All right, so.
Orion: Yeah, I just let a Fireball down on the brain.
Matt: Into the brain, all right. All right, so that's enough to get both of these guys. Go ahead and roll damage. And they both failed their save, so full damage.
Travis: Crush the nuts.
Ashley: Little brains.
Matt: I like that, good.
Orion: 40.
Matt: 40?
Laura: Whoa!
Ashley: Yeah!
Matt: Those incinerate. And 40 points of damage to the Elder Brain as this giant echoing explosion blasts up from below. All of you at the top, you are underlit momentarily from the flash of red and yellow flame. As you look down, there's now a sizzling sound and this like smell of horrible burnt flesh as part of the Elder Brain now that was originally dehydrated is now also burnt and singed. You can see now, it's looking a little rougher and it's very very unhappy with its current circumstance.
Laura: I want to kill it before we leave now.
Matt: All right. Pike, go ahead and make a saving throw.
Marisha: Come on, Pike!
Laura: Why a saving throw?
Matt: Still trying to get rid of the stun.
Laura: Oh, right.
Matt: So intellect saving throw.
Ashley: 16?
Matt: 16. You shrug off the effect--
Ashley: Yeah! Man. Thanks, Keyleth. Much better now.
Marisha: New dice!
Sam: What? I've been doing it wrong this whole time.
Ashley: Can I do anything, or that's my turn?
Matt: That's your turn.
Orion: My movement, by the way is I head to the beach.
Sam: You're ghosting?
Orion: Yes.
Matt: You just get the fuck out of Dodge, Tiberius is that way.
Ashley: Wait, where do we go? Nobody's taking us?
Laura: No, you've got to hop on the carpet when it comes up.
Ashley: Oh, okay, got it.
Marisha: Classic Tiberius.
Taliesin: All right, here's a question  can everybody still fly?
Matt: Vax?
Orion: As long as I'm thinking about it.
Liam: Well I'm still sitting, still kneeling on the flying carpet with Percy, so I'm just throwing daggers at the bacon brain.
Matt: Okay. They're at disadvantage at this distance.
Liam: Okay. So that means, aw man, 17 on the first.
Matt: 17? (ricochet sound) Reflected, deflected by the arcane shield on the brain.
Liam: All right, so then the second one does as well, and the last one definitely does, so.
Matt: Yeah, so all three just (ping, ping, ping).
Taliesin: Take the wheel!
Matt: As it gets more and more damaged, it's waking up more and more and it looks like it's actually gaining power the more it does.
Liam: Okay, and then Percy yelled in my ear, so I take some of the little carpet tassels.
Matt: (laughs) Okay. So as your movement, you manage to move the carpet all the way up, it swoops up into the center of--
Laura: Grab the gnomes!
Matt: This right here. You guys are all looking precariously at this carpet that is now floating up from the center of the temple. As you get to the top, you look over and you can see there's probably close to 20 mind flayers that are swarming up the side. That brings us to, Vax, Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: All right, I pull out Bad News. And I'm going to lie down on my stomach, hanging off the edge of the carpet.
Sam: Hanging brain!
Taliesin: And I'm taking a shot straight down.
Matt: Okay. I'll say it takes you your--
Taliesin: My movement.
Matt: Movement to get it out. So you're there, you're unable to move the carpet, you pull the Bad News out, you get down, you're precariously off the side of it, and it is sagging as your weight touches it, you get ready, go ahead and fire.
Taliesin: Firing a deadshot.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Oh, come on.
Taliesin: That's 18.
Matt: As you fire, the blast sends you up almost onto your feet on the carpet again, and you hear this impact sound, this (crash) of the blast hitting stone as the psychic field around it deflects the bullet, sending it into the ground.
Laura: I thought 18 was the number that we were aiming for-- shit.
Taliesin: Wait, did I have an inspiration dice from last-- fuck.
Orion: You did.
Taliesin: I did have an inspiration dice from last game! I did! What do you give people with it?
Sam: d10.
Taliesin: d10? Oh fuck, that's right.
Orion: Can he add it now?
Matt: Yeah, I'll trust you on that.
Taliesin: I did! I did, because I'm always excited when I get them, because I never get them.
Matt: That's true, okay, yeah. All right. Go ahead and roll for that.
Taliesin: 21!
Matt: That'll do it.
Taliesin: Oh my god.
Matt: As the brain continues to wake up, it improves its defenses, improves its capabilities--
Laura: Oh, I understand.
Taliesin: Okay.
Matt: But that will hit. So go ahead and roll damage on that.
Taliesin: Okay.
Orion: It's Hulking?
Matt: Essentially. So as you release the blast, it hits the psychic field, the first impact you hear is it hitting the psychic field and pushing through into the actual brain matter.
Marisha: Come on!
Taliesin: Let me double-check that I'm doing this right, hold on, deadshot's weird. Plus weapon damage. Okay, so that's eight, nine, ten, 11, 12, 13... 25 points of damage.
Matt: 25 points of damage. Boom! You see the section of it that's kinda charred and burned gets blown off, and now there's a corner of the brain that's just an open and gaping wound. The purplish glow on the inside is pulsing more and more angrily. It's taken a beating, but it's hanging in there.
Taliesin: Oh my god!
Marisha: Will not die.
Matt: This is, you guys have left a good mark on it. You get the sensation, with the swarming incoming, you may start to consider self-preservation, because the Elder Brain looks like it's taken some hits, but it's not on death's door yet.
Taliesin: Oh god.
Marisha: Let's get out.
Laura: We need to go.
Matt: Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: Scanlan is up?
Matt: Yep.
Sam: We're out of here?
Taliesin: We need everybody to hop on the carpet first.
Sam: Okay.
Matt: You're hopping up?
Sam: No, I'm going to turn into a huge pterodactyl and carry some folks.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: What?
Laura: You can do that?
Sam: Sure, why not?
Marisha: He's got Polymorph.
Travis: Yeah, turn into a batwing.
Matt: Cool, so we'll say for the time being, we'll use this as Scanlan.
Sam: Great.
Matt: You are a giant pterodactyl, a creature that you've read in books in the past, you haven't actually seen in person. And what are you doing?
Sam: Who can I carry?
Matt: You can carry one person with your claws. You haven't used this form before, and this is you figuring it out, so pick one and you can take them with you.
Sam: I'm going to take someone heavy.
Liam: Grog.
Matt: Grog can fly.
Laura: I can fly on Trinket, yeah, everybody's covered, man.
Sam: There's only one person I can take.
Matt: As the pterodactyl Scanlan swoops down and both its claws grapple on your arms and lift you off the top of the temple, flying after Tiberius.
Taliesin: How do you make that weird?
Matt: All right, so they're now out of harm's way. Very top of the round, that brings us to Grog. Still carrying Kima under your arm.
Travis: We're getting out, right?
Laura: Yeah.
Travis: So I don't have to worry, so up and out.
Matt: So you just awkwardly fly with Kima under your arm, off with the rest of the group.
Liam: (sings) Sweet bird of prey, fly, fly away.
Sam: (sings) Up, up, and away, I'm a beautiful pterodactyl.
Matt: We'll get these guys off the board here because you do have two Illithid that get up to the edge here. They're going to attempt a Mind Blast.
Liam: We're gone, man, we're gone!
Laura: Not yet.
Matt: Still holding back. So--
Liam: I jump up to get out of range.
Matt: That can just get Trinket and Vex, if you can go ahead and make an intelligence saving throw for both of you.
Liam: Don't fuck with my sister.
Orion: Trinket and Vex are still there?
Laura: Yeah. I know, I didn't get to--
Sam: They never flew.
Laura: I know, I didn't use the movement on the last turn.
Matt: Nope.
Laura: I just didn't say it because I'm an asshole.
Sam: You are.
Liam: What kind of saving throw?
Matt: Intelligence.
Sam: Intelligence.
Laura: Ten? On me.
Matt: Okay. Roll for Trinket.
Liam: You rolled nine, plus two is 11.
Laura: Oh. Okay. 11.
Matt: So go ahead and roll for Trinket.
Laura: Oh! I rolled a nine, plus two, plus two.
Liam: For what?
Laura: For my ring that I'm wearing.
Liam: Okay.
Laura: So whatever that was.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: 13.
Liam: 13.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: For me.
Matt: And roll for Trinket.
Laura: Which is going to be a major fail because Trinket is the dumbest. (laughter)
Sam: Don't talk about Trinket like that.
Travis: Is he the dumbest?
Laura: No, that's a minus four. So that would be a nine for Trinket.
Matt: Nine for Trinket.
Laura: Who is, by the way, my only way to get out of here right now.
Matt: So communally, both you and Trinket freeze in place, and Trinket, who is flying, slumps onto the top of the temple, limply laying across the edge, about to tip over off the temple.
Sam: (whispering) Told you we should've left Trinket behind.
Matt: That ends your turn. Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: Okay.
Liam: A lot of Sandmen in there.
Marisha: Well first and foremost I'm going to get on the carpet.
Matt: Okay. So you leap up here with these guys.
Marisha: Secondly, I am going to-- Okay, wait, Trinket's stunned?
Matt: Trinket is currently catatonic (moans), just barely holding herself right there. You can see she's struggling with the flight spell, like she's kind of levering herself into the ground--
Laura: Trinket's a boy.
Matt: Him, sorry. I was thinking of you.
Laura: If he's about to die, at least get his gender right.
Matt: I apologize, Trinket. I'm sorry.
Marisha: Wait, shove him?
Taliesin: Shove him onto the carpet.
Marisha: No, I can't shove him.
Sam: Wait, he's floating.
Marisha: Okay, can I do this? Okay, here's what I'm going to do. I'm on the carpet. I'm going to cast Grasping Vine from the carpet and wrap around Trinket and have a Trinket tow vine.
Matt: Okay.
Orion: Like the Macy's Day parade!
Matt: So as you leap onto the carpet, you reach down, and the fibrous nature that the carpet was originally made from, you manage to pull the essence of that out to create a vine of similarly patterned color of the actual magic carpet material. The various silks form into this tendril that wraps around both you and Trinket and pulls you guys hanging behind the carpet, so you guys are essentially now towed to the carpet.
Marisha: Let's go!
Orion: Can she take control of the carpet, too?
Marisha: Can I now use the rest of my movement to be like--
Matt: You currently do not have control of the carpet because you used your action and everything to use that spell and your concentration at that point.
Marisha: Okay, I'm just holding.
Matt: You're just holding them there. That brings us to Tiberius, you're off, flying off. Pike is off, Vax, you're up.
Liam: I'm steering us the fuck outta here, man.
Matt: You tow Trinket and Vex out behind. As you guys pull off at full speed, the rest of the illithid swarm to the top, you can see about 15 or so get to the front top here, look down at the Elder Brain, look up at the rest of you with this angry look, and as you're pulling away, your eyes adjust to the darkness of the cavern and you look down and you swear you can see hundreds and hundreds of sets of purple glowing eyes just staring up from the city as you all slowly fly away to the far end of the cavern. As you're moving, so are the eyes.
Laura: (sings) We've made some enemies. They're coming after us.
Orion: I want to make a note, because I'm way ahead of everybody at this point, as soon as I land on the beach, I cast Circle of Teleportation.
Matt: Okay.
Orion: Barring that there's nobody there, but I do that immediately.
Matt: All right, so. A few minutes go by, you guys are moving past and over the water channel that's between the north side of the island and the beach where you guys previously set. (laughter)
Matt: As Tiberius, you land on the dirt. You land, immediately begin casting the Circle of Teleportation, you begin scrawling this circle on the ground, running your finger across the gravel surface to build the runes. As your fingers drag across, you can see the arcane light beginning to glow and form the sigils and the runes as you're drawing them feverishly. The rest of the group eventually catches up to you about 30 seconds into it. As you all eventually get back, you and Trinket manage to shrug off the effect. And you find yourselves halfway through being towed by this vine awkwardly.
Laura: What is happening right now?
Marisha: Stupid wrench.
Matt: A few seconds pass, you finish the incantation, you place your hand down on the center of the sigil, this wave of arcane energy blasts off, and suddenly, above this circle, this tearing sound pulls out of the middle of the ether, and this kind of purple shimmering doorway opens above the circle sigil that he crafted on the side of the beach.
Orion: By the blessings of Bahamut, I choose Emon!
Matt: At which point, the doorway that he just created takes some sort of a solid form and from what you can see on the other side, there appears to be some sort of low-lit room.
Liam: Greyskull!
Laura: (gasps) Greyskull!
Orion: I run right through.
Matt: All right. Tiberius runs through. Everyone else?
All: Yes!
Sam: Are we there?
Matt: You guys have all landed on the beach as he finished casting this, yeah.
Laura: Run!
Marisha: Run!
Matt: You all rush through the portal, one after the other, towards the very end is Grog, you bringing up the rear, holding Kima, you go rushing towards it as it begins to slowly close, this only lasts a round, you barrel through just in time as it closes behind you with a sparking sound.
Taliesin: We are time bandits. (cheering)
Travis: Oh, fuck. I just caked my pants.
Taliesin: Squish-squish.
Laura: I hate that phrase.
Orion: That was something, now, wasn't it?
Taliesin: That was fantastic.
Travis: Chocolate cake.
Matt: You all emerge within a small 20-foot-by-20-foot white stone chamber. You all are kinda crammed in this space currently, but you are all apparently safe and sound. As the doorway closes behind you, you turn and look, and on the ground there is a similar circle across the stone flooring, different patterns, different, you know, arrangement to the one that he had drawn, but with some similarities that are kind of a reminiscent glow, almost like a code to this circle, fade away, based on what he had drawn previously.
Laura: They won't be able to open that back up?
Orion: We are safe.
Laura: Okay.
Travis: Just a quick request  she is made of stone. Holding Lady Kima.
Ashley: Yes! I'll go over and cast Greater Restoration on Kima.
Orion: Hold on just one second.
Travis: Hold on.
Orion: We still have the Horn to deal with.
Taliesin: The Horn is on the carpet. It has been specifically not touched.
Matt: So it's just kind of sitting there. The carpet's bunched to the side now as you guys kind of flew into the portal and kind of left it there and the Horn's just resting there.
Orion: I think we should get it out of her view before--
Taliesin: I think we should put it in the Bag of Holding.
Travis: Sure, yeah. Do you want to teleport it in the bag?
Ashley: If your crushing couldn't kill it, the thousand pounds?
Orion: We can store it there.
Liam: Where are we? You said we're in a room.
Matt: It's a small yellow room, sorry, a small white stone room and there is a kind of yellowish brown stone doorway that is closed. There's some very faint white orbs that are locked into the wall. So you're not in Greyskull Keep now.
Marisha: Oh, we're not in Greyskull.
Matt: You guys don't have a teleportation circle installed in your Keep yet. You don't know where you are.
Sam: We're in a room right now?
Matt: You're in a room, you're in a 20-foot-by-20-foot room, with two small white orbs on the sides that are kinda set into the walls to give off a faint white arcane glow. There's a single doorway that exits the room that is currently closed.
Orion: The way Circle of Teleportation works is when I learned it I get to pick two locations that I know innately. I picked Emon as one of them.
Laura: Oh, okay. Okay.
Marisha: So we're somewhere in Emon.
Orion: But I just had to pick the two.
Marisha: So we could be in someone's living room right now?
Orion: I'll use Telekinesis to lift the Horn off the carpet.
Matt: Okay. You still have the spells?
Orion: Yeah, I can burn one from my Ioun stone.
Laura: Should we wrap it at all?
Taliesin: It'll be fine in the Bag of Holding.
Liam: Not knowing what else to do, Vax is going to go to the door and just inspect it, see if it's trapped.
Matt: Roll a perception check.
Liam: 24.
Matt: 24. All right, the door does appear to be locked. It is not trapped.
Liam: Not trapped. Okay, I'll get to work on it, then. 32.
Matt: Okay, 32. You, relatively easy, the door comes unlocked, the small, it's like a very very intricately carved brass handle that has swirls upon it, like it's almost like a burst of wind being blown and frozen in gold. You turn it and the door opens slightly.
Liam: Pull up, I'm still wearing my tin hat and I pull up my hood from my elven cloak, and I go stealth. And I am stealthed, because that's a 32. And I have a look around outside the door.
Matt: Okay. As you open the doorway, it leads into a secondary chamber. This is an 80-foot-diameter circular chamber now, so you're entering the edge of a giant circle. There are a series of other doors, almost in respective rows next to each other, and you also see, in the center of the room, a vibrant chandelier made of white crystal like the spheres you saw in the previous room you were in, giving off a warm, atmospheric glow to the entire room. In the center of the room, there is a semi-circle desk that is also made of a similar white stone material that the rest of the room is made out of, with polished gold leaf trimming on the edge, and you do see what looks to be an elven man sitting at the desk, longish gray-white hair, he's wearing robes that are finely dressed, and he's half-falling asleep at a desk with a series of books kind of piled up on the side. As soon as the doorway opens, he looks up, and you hear a slight little arcane tinging sound, like a little bell being rung, as you open the door. He looks up for a second.
Laura: Say hello.
Liam: Yes yes yes. I just walk forward and pull down the cloak and say, "Hello."
Matt: "Stay right where you are! Do not move!"
Liam: Hands up in the air.
Matt: "Do not move!"
Liam: Nothing in them. No threat, no danger here. A little lost, apparently.
Matt: "Apparently."
Liam: Yes.
Matt: "Who else is in, who else goes there? Who else, please, step outside! Reveal yourselves!"
Liam: They're--
Laura: Hi!
Marisha: Hi.
Ashley: Hello.
Sam: (pterodactyl screech)
Matt: As soon as he sees you, he goes, (screams).
Orion: I cast Dispel Magic on Scanlan.
Sam: Do you have it anymore?
Orion: Yeah, I do.
Sam: You just did it to me earlier in this round.
Orion: No, Counterspell, and I Silenced you, this is Dispel Magic, which ends your spell.
Matt: Okay. (laughs)
Sam: Oh. Hello.
Matt: So as you cast the spell and transform, he stops in the middle of casting a spell reflexively and goes, "Oh. And a bear. Interesting."
Orion: He's friendly.
Sam: He's real.
Liam: I have a very long, very strange story, every word of which is true, and if you will give me five minutes, I swear I can convince you--
Matt: He opens a book and starts thumbing through the pages.
Liam: No ill intent. Intent? Yes.
Matt: "We have no expected arrivals at this hour. I need to know your business, your names, and your affiliations immediately."
Marisha: We will totally do that when we know--
Laura: We are affiliated with the king.
Liam: Yeah, emperor. Just tell the emperor that Vox Machina has returned from Kraghammer, and we have news for him, and--
Matt: "Well."
Laura: We were on very secret business for the crown, actually. And that is why you weren't informed of our business.
Orion: Yeah, I'm Tiberius Stormwind. How are you?
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Laura: Okay.
Travis: Did you wink?
Orion: I'm responsible for casting the spell to get us here to begin with.
Laura: (laughs) With advantage.
Liam: Yes.
Laura: That would be a 20-- no. 35.
Matt: All right. He looks to you, as you guys are saying, he--
Laura: That's not possible. 25.
Matt: 25. (laughter)
Matt: He stands up from the desk and gives you all a look-over and says, "Well, I am Gatekeeper Xanthas, I am the evening keeper of the Traverse Junction here in the-- it's the Traverse Junction."
Orion: Gatekeeper?
Matt: "Here within the Lyceum. The hour is late. We are two hours past midnight."
Taliesin: Well, I am Percival Fredrickstein Von Musel Klossowski de Rolo III, and, hello, and we would love to report to the emperor of your great hospitality at this unfortunately early hour, and we would look forward to reporting of all of your kindness and good housekeeping.
Liam: I imagine he would be very upset if we were delayed. We come with very grave news.
Taliesin: I would hope not to imagine it.
Matt: "Well. I'm certain the Headmaster would like to know your business in the morning."
Laura: Yes.
Matt: "Headmaster Thurmond. He runs this Alabaster Lyceum within the Erudite Quarter. If you would please submit a report for your reasons for using the Lyceum Junction property by tomorrow, I'm sure that would suffice for the required paperwork."
Laura: Of course we will.
Taliesin: You are too kind.
Laura: In the meantime, we'll just go to our Keep that we have in town.
Orion: Greyskull Keep.
Matt: Gives you a very, a disbelieving look and kinda goes, "Very well."
Taliesin: Good day, good evening.
Sam: I cast Friends on him and I tell him, "You know of our Keep, don't you?"
Matt: Okay. He goes, "I seem to recall hearing about a Vox Machina at some point discussed, but I don't get out very often. Running the graveyard shift here at the Lyceum has taken its toll on my social life."
Laura: You poor thing, you should get out more.
Matt: "Well here, let me show you out." And he walks you through the rest of the hallways. It's a beautiful, beautiful kind of domed center chamber into a long series of white stone hallways, similar material to what the first room you arrived in looked like. Eventually to a main foyer area, which has a very high ceiling and a series of beautifully carved pillars that show different creatures, almost like devas and demons battling each other as they spiral up these pillars, to the front doorways. There are two guards that are adorned in kinda silver and gold armor with these very high, elven in design-shaped helmets, and they step to the side as the doors open on their own.
Laura: Love the hat.
Matt: Guards do not respond to you whatsoever, they just step to the side. Gatekeeper says, "All right, well, here is your way out, have a wonderful evening and do please return for your report on the morrow."
Laura: Of course.
Sam: Oh, one more question before you leave, what district are we in right now?
Matt: "The Erudite Quarter."
Sam: Thank you.
Travis: Gesundheit.
Matt: "Good night." The doors slam (boof) behind you as you guys exit, and you're now--
Laura: Holy shit, we survived! What was that?
Marisha: Oh my god! Keyleth just goes down on her knees and starts kissing the ground.
Taliesin: Well, that could've gone worse.
Marisha: Oh, we're home.
Ashley: I just want to get in my bed so bad.
Marisha: Look! Stars!
Matt: You look up and, for the first time in close to a week, you can see stars, you can see a crescent moon, probably just past its single quarter phase. It is a sight for sore eyes right now.
Ashley: I'm so happy.
Travis: Would you say it's a beautiful sight?
Matt: Currently? The most beautiful night sky you've seen in all of your years.
Travis: I ruin it with a fart. (laughter)
Orion: I'm glad you held that the whole time we were down there, Grog.
Travis: I've had horrible stomach pains this whole time, I'm sorry.
Laura: What, are we just carrying around this stone Kima with us, or are we taking her back to our--
Liam: Yes, but don't stand right in front of her when you undo the stone.
Orion: Actually, hold on a minute, let's all rest before we deal with this one.
Travis: Yes.
Ashley: No, because I want to be able to have an extra 5th-level spell.
Travis: Oh, right.
Laura: But we're in town now, so we're safe.
Ashley: Yeah, let's go to the Keep.
Laura: Yeah, so it'll be fine.
Ashley: Yeah.
Sam: It's a long way. We've got to go across the whole town to get there.
Laura: Well, we've got a fucking flying carpet.
Sam: We do have a flying carpet.
Taliesin: The metro's running at this hour.
Liam: We can probably flag down a wagon, too.
Laura: Yeah, we're in town!
Liam: Yeah.
Laura: Fuck it. Everything's possible.
Taliesin: Let's go drinking.
Marisha: I was going to say, what bars are open?
Liam: We've got a lot of bling and a cursed Horn. The sky's the limit.
Ashley: I know, should we go to a tavern and get some ale?
Sam: What, who are you?
Travis: Really? You mean it?
Ashley: Well what do you mean, do I mean it?
Travis: It's all empty, can we fill it please?
Ashley: It's all empty?
Marisha: We should get some ale. Wait, maybe we should drop off the Bag of Holding so we're not carrying it around.
Travis: And the stone gnome.
Marisha: And then go out drinking.
Liam: We don't want to lose it in a game of cards.
Marisha: Yes, exactly. Exactly.
Travis: And stone Kima.
Sam: We'll be fine, we've never lost it before. There's eight of us, we'll be fine, let's go drinking.
Ashley: How far is the Keep from here?
Matt: I'd say it's probably a good hour walk.
Marisha: Oh, we've got time.
Taliesin: We could do a pub crawl, we'll just have a beer at every pub we hit on the way back to the Keep.
Marisha: Yes, let's do that! Pub crawl!
All: Pub crawl!
Marisha: We're going to pub crawl back to the Keep.
Liam: Starting here at Geek & Sundry.
Ashley: But should I go just in a bush just behind and--
Sam: Do you have to pee or something?
Ashley: No, and cast Greater Restoration on Kima?
All: No!
Sam: We want to enjoy this.
Orion: She doesn't have a sense of time, she won't know.
Sam: Or humor.
Travis: Let's put her in the bag. She's made of stone!
Laura: We won't tell her how much time has passed.
Taliesin: We'll un-stone her once we're back at the Keep.
Travis: She's stone. Stone doesn't breathe. Right?
Taliesin: It'll be fine.
Sam: We don't know.
Laura: Do not put her in the Bag of Holding! Do not. (laughter)
Liam: For the record, I think she'd be fine, too. But we could bring her around and introduce her; it could be like Weekend at Bernie's. (laughter)
Travis: Ah, yes! I put a fancy robe around Kima's stone statue.
Laura: This is so messed up.
Matt: All right, so as you guys begin making your celebratory pub crawl, starting with the Laughing Lamia Tavern, you buy drinks, laugh, chatter, and kind of take in the lively atmosphere that you would find at 3AM. Which is a little, at this point most of the fun folk are pretty drunk, but at this point you don't care, you'll take your own, and we'll take a quick five-minute break to use the bathroom and we'll pick up from there in just a moment, we'll see you guys here in five minutes to continue.
Travis: We lived!
Marisha: We lived!
Matt: Holy shit, guys.
Orion: I was fine. [dramatic music]
Travis: Right, Listen up! If you have ale, then you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw. A goliath of towering height and size, this barbarian has an appetite for the two great loves in his life: combat, women, and ale! (chuckle) (record scratch) Wait. Easily the brains of the group, Grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes, colors, and (chuckle) shiny things! Also ale. In his early years, armed with his two-handed great axe, Grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst the ranks of his family's wandering herd. But after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly gnome in the woods, he objected to the killing of such an innocent life. A creature of impulse, Grog felt only pity for this-- well, this terrified little thing. And his disobedience cost him dearly. Beaten bloody and banished by the herd leader, his uncle Kevdak, Grog was abandoned and left to die, exiled from his herd. It was then that the relative of the very gnome he fought to save, saved him. It was the kindness of a gnome cleric named Pike that healed Grog, bringing him back from death's edge. And they have remained close friends ever since. Most nights, Grog can be found challenging entire taverns to wrestling matches! Ha! Or accompanying Scanlan to the nearest house where you pay for lady favors. Also ale!
Marisha: A first impression of Keyleth would leave you with little information on the half-elven druid. You might even think that her social awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is kind of sweet. (chuckle) Of course, it would be unwise to underestimate her based on first impressions. (thunder) Under that unintimidating petite frame is a vicious beast waiting to be unleashed, whose natural powers have made even the fiercest of champions pee their pants, literally! (soft chuckle) Born to the Air Tribe of the Ashari people, Keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and the elemental magics. It is her people's inherent duty to protect the delicate areas in Tal'Dorei where the four elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm. Since she was a little girl, she had quite a knack for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities. Well, if you consider kittens and flying squirrels to be little beasts. Which, I do. (clears throat) Anyways, it wasn't long before the headmaster of the tribe, her father, Korren, realized her true prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster. Just like that, her jovial childhood was stripped and replaced with endless spell memorization, teachings from ancient traditions, and exceedingly high expectations. Every druid leader to be must embark on a journey to seek out the sister tribes in order to introduce and establish respect amongst the fellow headmasters. They call this the Aramente, or Noble Odyssey. When her father felt she was ready, he set her on the path to truly discovering herself, not knowing when, or if, she will ever return. As she hiked down the mountain towards Stillben, she meditated on the task ahead. Part of the Aramente is proving yourself a strong warrior, a valiant protector, and a wise and compassionate leader. With this knowledge, one thought plays on repeat in her mind: Is she even worthy?
Taliesin: Percy was the third of seven children, born to a noble family who lived far to the north in the ancient castle of Whitestone. With so many siblings to share the burdens of lordship, Percy turned his attentions to the sciences, engineering, and naturalism. One day, a mysterious couple named Lord and Lady Briarwood came to court. During a feast held in their honor, the Briarwoods violently took control of the castle, killing or imprisoning everyone who would stand in their way. Percy awoke chained in the dungeon, only to be freed by his younger sister. Together they fled, chased by the Briarwoods' men. As they ran, Percy's sister took several arrows to the chest and fell. Percy kept running, eventually jumping into a freezing river and floating unconscious to freedom. He did not remember waking up on a fishing boat. He barely remembered the next two years, as he slowly made his way as far south as possible. Then one night, Percy had a dream. A roaring cloud of smoke offered him vengeance against those who destroyed his family. When he awoke, Percy began to design his first gun. (gunshot)
Ashley: Pike grew up on the outskirts of town, near the Bramblewood. Her ancestors were a family of deep gnomes with quite an unfavorable reputation. Thievery, destruction, and trickery left them with the curse of the last name Trickfoot. Sarenrae, the goddess of healing and redemption, had other plans for Pike's great-great-grandfather Wilhand, who left his family at a young age after a dream: a dream that changed the course of the Trickfoot family. Wilhand devoted his life to Sarenrae and pledged from then on that him and his family would live a life of service and devotion. As a child, Pike seemed to have an affinity to heal. Whether it was animals, people, or even flowers, she felt she had a purpose in making things whole that had once been broken. She studied and learned the ways to heal though divine magic. She lived a peaceful life, quiet and simple, until one day, Wilhand was captured and almost killed by a group of goliath barbarians. One of the goliaths took a stand against the murder of the innocent gnome and he himself was beaten, bloodied, and left for dead, abandoned by his herd. Wilhand went to Pike for help. She prayed and healed this barbarian as best she could, bringing him back to life. When he awoke, she discovered his name was Grog Strongjaw. After that, they were the best of friends, a rather unlikely pair. Little did she know that in a few years' time, Grog would soon return the favor and bring her back from the clutches of death. (roar, crunch) After being killed in battle, Pike felt angry. She wanted to be stronger so that it would never happen again. She spent four months at sea training with the men and women aboard a ship called the Broken Howl. Gripping her holy symbol in one hand, and her morningstar in the other, this time, Pike is ready.
Sam: Oh, you haven't heard of Scanlan Shorthalt? Well, gird your loins, ladies, because he has his eye on you. A talented musician, master of disguise, and dashingly handsome in his own mind, Scanlan sings songs almost as much as he sings his own praises. Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used his endless charm and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and support his single mother. One day he was discovered by a half-orc promoter and joined Dr. Dranzel's Spectacular Traveling Troupe, where he learned the ways of the world and honed his skills as a bard extraordinaire. A loner much of his life, Scanlan has never quite come to terms with the violent death of his mother at the hands of a goblin invasion. While his years on the road provided many, shall we say, educational experiences with the opposite sex, deep down, Scanlan yearns for the one thing he's never known: the true love of a fellow gnome. Still, Scanlan considers himself a lover first, performer second, and fighter distant third. On the battlefield, he'll support his allies, but rarely draws blood, unless it's to protect fellow gnome, Pike. Count on Scanlan for a hearty laugh, a rollicking song, and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts and makes the females swoon.
Orion: Greetings and salutations. I am Tiberius Stormwind. I hail from a town called Ty'rex, located in the heart of Draconia. From a politically respected family, at the age of 15, I succeeded in passing the Sorcerer's Rite, showing prodigy-like control of my magic. The judges and the Draconian high council were amazed at how powerful my spells were for how long I had been training. At 20 years old, I was the youngest appointed member of the magic guild in Draconian history. For the next few years, I almost went mad from the malaise of being a guild member, as it's rather boring. However, one day I happened upon a chamber, unused for quite some time.
Matt: Welcome back. We got a little refresher here and apparently our Overlord has an announcement.
Zac: You guys, we're only four away from another giveaway, which is--
Lucas: Two away!
Zac: Two away, you know what, I'm guessing this is, we're going to get that before I even get back to my seat, so we're going to go do the giveaway. It's the shirt, the dice, the handbook, and the starter set. The handbook and the shirt will be signed by the cast.
Matt: Yep.
Zac: And we still have, if we get to 400, correct, next? Lucas?
Lucas: Yeah. 3,400.
Matt: 3,400.
Zac: If we get to 3,400 by the end of the night, we'll give away a whole other kit like this, with the signed stuff, so you get to subscribe and it supports the channel, keeps us running. I'm not going to interrupt these guys, so when we hit the number I'm just going to give it away through the chat room.
Matt: Awesome, guys. Well done and congrats to whoever ends up getting that, real fast I hope. So, thank you Overlord.
Taliesin: Oh wait, this is in here. Can I throw this? Oh no.
Matt: Pass it off, it's fine.
Taliesin: You get the horn.
Laura: Can I hold it for a second?
Travis: No.
Orion: No. Oh, I mean in real life. Yeah.
Marisha: No.
Orion: I was like, don't touch it.
Matt: So. Eventually you all manage to make your way towards the outer wall of Emon to the southern portion of the city. The guards let you through. Two of them recognize you from the Winter's Crest celebration that occurred about seven months beforehand. Don't do that, that's going to end poorly. You make your way around the bend to the large grass hill that is surrounded by the river that skirts the outer southern portion of Greyskull Keep. Looking up, you can see against the moonlight the very welcome sight of your home there, beckoning to you to rest. You make your way to the front gates that surround the outskirts of it, and an iron bell kind of goes off for a second, and as you look up, you hear a voice go, "Who goes there? Speak your mind, or a bolt to the throat you'll find."
Marisha: Shayne, is that Shayne?
Orion: Is it dark right now?
Matt: It's dark, yes.
Orion: I cast Light. "It's us!"
Matt: Okay, a light pierces off, and you guys look up and you can see, sitting on kind of the watchtower perch--
Marisha: Or wait, is that Jarett?
Matt: No, you see up there, short, rough red hair, Shayne Tranter, one of the mercenaries you hired--
Marisha: Oh, it is Shayne, I was right the first time!
Matt: She's got her crossbow ready to go, and she's just kind of sitting back and pointing it at the group, and she goes,
Liam: Hello! Hi!
Laura: Hope you remember us!
Marisha: Shayne!
Taliesin: We're drunk!
Sam: We pay you!
Matt: She laughs. Takes her crossbow, sets it to her side.
Ashley: We forgot our key!
Matt: "Well, aren't you a sight for sore eyes? It's been nearly a week since you left."
Laura: That's it?
Sam: Feels like a month.
Ashley: Feels like three months.
Taliesin: Feels like eleven weeks. It feels like a very long time.
Matt: "Well, it's probably closer to two weeks. Fair enough. Either way. Open the gates! Cordell, open the gates!"
Sam: Cordell? I don't remember the names of any of our guards.
Matt: Cordell, he's one of the other half-orc guards that you hired when you left.
Marisha: We have Shayne, Cordell, Jarett, Kendrick, and Nitebe.
Laura: Jarett was the one we appointed as the head guard, right? Captain?
Marisha: Jarett? I think so. I didn't write that part down.
Laura: I don't remember about the little fellow.
Sam: Our staff is so unappreciated, guys.
Matt: So as the gate slowly opens, Cordell walking out, this is the hearty half-orc merc dressed in scale armor, and he has a large sword slung on his back, just shoves it open to about a two-foot distance. "Come on. Welcome home." As each of you guys walk through, he kinda claps you on the back as you walk in. You make your way into the small courtyard leading to-- making your way into Greyskull Keep. Towards the front door, as you get there, the front door opens on its own as you're about ten feet away and peering from the inside of the low-lit interior you see a woman's face, a plump blond woman's face, peek through. This is Laina. Laina goes, "Oh, you're back, fantastic! It's early." And she rubs her face and you see as she pushes the door open a little more, she's wearing her nightgown, and she's excited but still very tired. "Come in, come in, come in, please, please! Who's that?" And points to the large stone statue you're dragging behind you.
Laura: Oh, we decided to get a statue for the garden.
Taliesin: Garden gnome.
Matt: "Very well, very well, come in."
Ashley: Hey! (laughter)
Travis: He's drunk.
Taliesin: I'm drunk!
Matt: So the human woman leads you all back in.
Laura: Put the gun down, Percy.
Ashley: Bad News.
Liam: It's not Cinco de Mayo.
Matt: She steps back with her knitted boots; she's definitely in comfortable mode. She eagerly hugs each of you as you enter, happy that you've all arrived, she's like, "I swear it's-- I've not had an employer leave so quickly after my hiring. But glad to see you're all safe. Shall I make everyone a meal, are you hungry?"
Marisha: Starving.
Travis: Yes.
Matt: "I'll get right to it." And she turns around, and you see further down the hallway Erwen Dastell, your older halfling servant who shuffles up with his nightcap on, it's long and dangling off his shoulders, he's got this long night robe on, he's kinda carrying a small candle. "My goodness. The hour is late of your arrival, but I can't say I am not excited to see you. Come in, your beds are ready, everything's been cleaned and made to your specifications. Laina! To food!" "I'm already on it, Erwen." She kinda smacks him on the back. He says, "Very well, then."
Sam: I love their banter.
Laura: Yeah, they're so cute.
Matt: "I will go back to bed, if that's fine with you."
Sam: Is there any urgent, oppressing news, any visitors that we should know about who came while we were gone, anything before you retire for the evening?
Matt: "No, I believe your friend, the mage woman with the blue robes came by once."
Sam: Allara?
Matt: "Allura. She came by a couple days ago, just to see if you had returned. But I didn't know where you were, and she said she'd try again later."
Sam: Any packages, mail, post?
Matt: "None that I know of, no. In fact it's been very quiet."
Sam: All right, thank you.
Laura: All right.
Taliesin: Quiet is good.
Matt: "Back to my quarters." And he shuffles off, goes towards his bed. You guys make your way into the main dining chamber of your Keep, four large round tables set out with the chairs around it. You can see, for the most part, it's been untouched other than a couple of chairs that are set ajar, probably by your mercenary soldiers who've been eating and/or have been keeping up. There's a couple of empty tables set on the side that immediately Laina goes, "I'm so sorry, I guess I should've taken care of this." And she stumbles off towards the kitchen and you guys all eventually find yourselves sitting, sore, exhausted, mildly intoxicated, around these chairs and take a very deep-breathing sigh of relief at being back home here in Emon in Greyskull Keep.
Sam: Should we un-stone Kima, or should we sleep on it?
Orion: I stand up and I head towards the sleeping quarters and I just say, "Leave her to stone tonight, we'll deal with it tomorrow." And I go to bed.
Sam: I turn him into a rat.
Liam: Dispel Magic.
Matt: Go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw, Tiberius.
Orion: Hold on a sec. I can still cast as an animal, right?
Sam: Nope.
Matt: Nope, you cannot talk.
Orion: Oh. I still go to bed. (laughter)
Orion: So yeah.
Travis: Hoo baby.
Laura: That's adorable.
Matt: You go under your covers, go to sleep, nuzzle in.
Orion: In between my pillow.
Marisha: It's quite comfy sleeping like an animal.
Ashley: He's a little rat and he still went in his big bed.
Liam: I pick up the sleeping rat and just kinda scritch him.
Laura: He's in bed.
Liam: It's all right, he's fine. Look, see, his leg's going, he's dreaming about something nice.
Travis: We ate already, right?
Matt: You snacked a bit as you made it through the town, but for the most part like, a meal's being prepared. You begin to smell now the cooking of meat, Laina's setting it up for you guys.
Liam: You're dreaming of magical artifacts, aren't you?
Laura: Quick question, friends  So we kind of started a war, am I right?
Liam: Yeah. Pretty sure we did.
Laura: Kraghammer is potentially in grave danger, am I right?
Marisha: We might want to let them know.
Laura: We should probably let them know as soon as possible.
Liam: First of all, Clarota was lying through his noodles, and second, even if he wasn't, which he was, he's now fucking pissed off--
Laura: He's dead.
Liam: Well, they're all one hive-mind, right? Listen. This is number five tonight.
Taliesin: They weren't particularly connected until the very end, he was dead before they were actually connected.
Liam: They're angry. They were following us.
Taliesin: They may not know who we are.
Marisha: That's interesting.
Liam: You don't think they're going to scurry up the bottom of Kraghammer and tear that place apart?
Taliesin: We'll let them know, but we may have time, we hurt them very badly.
Liam: It took us about a week to get from Kraghammer in, so we've got about a week.
Marisha: Well, why don't we do some research, I mean, this was the first time.
Sam: Yeah, we'd have to stop them on the way out the hole, right? There's only one way in and out.
Ashley: Don't the dwarves already know that they were there, and they were already prepping for battle?
Sam: They don't really know what's coming for them.
Liam: They don't know anything about mind flayers, they know about weird things coming out, but not the mind flayers.
Travis: So let's send a pigeon or something.
Taliesin: The mind flayers have been down there for ages. There's nothing new.
Laura: You don't think they'll come up and attack?
Marisha: To be fair, we also did sort of release the mind flayers from their evil dictator.
Liam: Yeah, they seemed very grateful.
Sam: We could stop them on their way out.
Taliesin: I think this will also be a conversation that Lady Kima will have some--
Marisha: Okay, well, the thing we then need to immediately decide, before we un-stone Lady Kima, is what're we going to do with the Horn?
Taliesin: I think if we have Allura here, and begin that conversation, then we can have Allura's insight.
Marisha: Before we un-stone Lady Kima?
Taliesin: Yes. I think we tell Allura before we un-stone Lady Kima. Everything that's happened--
Liam: The only person, the only person that would remotely know is you, Tiberius, and I don't think--
Sam: He's a rat.
Liam: Oh, that's a good boy.
Travis: And he's asleep.
Liam: He didn't seem to know anything, I think Allura is the person to go to right now.
Laura: Well, you need to share it with us.
Ashley: Wake up from bed!
Travis: He's sleeping.
Taliesin: No, let's wait until Allura's here, I think, and we can--
Travis: Do we tell her, do we tell her we have the Horn? Or do we not?
Liam: Yes, yes, we do.
Marisha: Why don't we just wake up Tiberius?
Laura: Tiberius. Little darling!
Sam: I'm still punishing him.
Liam: I'm still cuddling him.
Orion: Did they wake me up?
Liam: No! I'm holding you.
Orion: Okay.
Liam: I don't want to wake you up.
Matt: You start to wake up, and then he scritches the side of your cheek and you go right back to sleep.
Laura: Damn it, he's so cute. I don't know what to do.
Matt: Laina comes out with plates for you guys and sets up these--
Travis: Thank. God.
Matt: They're not pretty, but functional meals of cooked pork, some fine mashed potatoes.
Travis: I would like to eat.
Matt: And you do ravenously, and this is the first warm meal you've really truly had in five, six days.
Travis: I take Lady Kima's portions and I--
Matt: There were no portions made for your garden structure.
Travis: Never know.
Matt: That's okay, there's plenty more.
Sam: So talk to Allura first, then unfreeze Lady Kima?
Liam: She sent us after Kima. Kima thinks that she's in the middle of a fight, the moment she comes out she'll be all hot and bothered--
Marisha: Okay, hang on, hang on. That's true, she did send us after Kima, so what if they're both on the side that we don't--
Travis: Yeah, Allura's going to unfreeze Kima.
Taliesin: We're going to have to trust somebody.
Travis: Why don't we just hold onto the Horn for a second and see what they do without it.
Laura: Why don't we tell them we didn't find it? Why don't we just hide the Horn?
Travis: We just hold onto it in the bag.
Marisha: Don't we have a safe? Didn't we build a safe in our Keep?
Matt: You did not have a safe built, but you could possibly have that done.
Ashley: Wait, so why are you guys so against giving the Horn to Kima?
Marisha: I just feel like if it's so terrible, why does she want it for herself?
Laura: She doesn't, she wants to hide it.
Ashley: Does she want to destroy it?
Laura: Maybe she wants to destroy it, maybe she wanted to get it up above ground so she could destroy it.
Sam: There's a second Horn, maybe she has the other one and wants the matching set.
Taliesin: Do we know that there's a second horn?
Laura: She's a paladin, she's good, paladins are good by--
Sam: I'm fine trusting her. I was fine trusting Clarota.
Travis: Do you want to wake up, do you have something important to say?
Marisha: Right, because no one of the church has ever been bad before.
Liam: We didn't trust Clarota. We were using him as much as he was using us.
Laura: Some of us truly trusted Clarota.
Liam: It went south. Well, most of us.
Travis: All right, fuck it, I walk over and I take the rat out of Vax's hands and I shake it awake.
Sam: He's still a rat!
Travis: I shake it a lot.
Marisha: I undo his Polymorph, I undo his Polymorph.
Sam: With what?
Matt: With what?
Marisha: By Polymorph.
Matt: You re-Polymorph him?
Marisha: Can I release Polymorph by using Polymorph?
Matt: No. It's his incantation.
Travis: I spit on Tiberius's head and rub it in vigorously.
Marisha: Scanlan, come on. We need to talk to him.
Orion: I'm trying to bite Grog. I am not happy.
Matt: It's like this viscous Grog spit mixed with chunks of pork and mashed potato rubbed in your fur.
Marisha: Scanlan, he's nipping! Scanlan. Tiberius is nipping. Please.
Sam: All right, fine. He's a human thing again.
Liam: He's not human at all.
Sam: A dragonborn.
Orion: Why did you wake me up? I was so comfy being furry! (laughter)
Orion: I always have scales. It was nice having fur!
Marisha: I told you. It's nice being cuddly.
Orion: I was so soft.
Laura: Tiberius, we're sorry to wake you.
Taliesin: Tiberius, we're having a lovely breakfast. Tell us a story.
Orion: Have I rested? What's going on?
Matt: No, it's been ten minutes.
Orion: What the fuck? (laughter)
Travis: Vex has a question for you.
Marisha: We're all still drunk and awake. We don't want to go to bed yet! Just, just talk with us.
Laura: I just want to hear your lovely little explanation, darling, about what the Horn is and why you don't trust Kima.
Orion: Oh!
Taliesin: Tell us a story.
Marisha: Tell us a story!
Laura: Please. You haven't told any of us anything.
Marisha: We haven't talked to you in a week.
Orion: The Horn of Orcus.
Matt: Horn of Orcus.
Orion: This thing comes from a devil, a demon. Nothing good could ever come from anything it made in existence. It needs to be destroyed. And I'm sorry. Let me articulate these words a little bit more. There is nothing that you can use this particular artifact for any reason of good. The fact that it is even here is a very bad sign because it was taken from one of these beasts.
Ashley: So why don't we destroy it?
Orion: That's exactly what we need to do.
Travis: Isn't that what Kima wanted?
Laura: What if they want to destroy it?
Orion: I don't think they wanted to bring it back.
Laura: Question. Why?
Orion: Because there is-- the liquid hot magma that was below where it was being held was very sufficient for it to be thrown in.
Marisha: That's true. See, I'm with him.
Laura: Wait, but your crushing fist couldn't destroy it, so maybe lava can't destroy it, so maybe it needs something extra special that only they know about.
Travis: It needs the Sword of Gryffindor.
Orion: No. Pike could destroy it.
Ashley: Ex-squeeze me? I don't think that's true.
Orion: Give yourself a little bit more credit. You killed a dragon.
Laura: You did kill a dragon.
Travis: You did kill a dragon.
Ashley: I did kill a dragon. Huzzah.
Marisha: And you died. And come back to life. By the way, we haven't talked about that. What was it like on the other side?
Travis: Let's stay on topic here.
Marisha: Oh, I'm sorry. I'm a little tipsy.
Liam: Vax shoves another flagon in front of Keyleth.
Ashley: I don't think I can destroy it.
Taliesin: From what I understand-- is it possible that it's not possible to destroy this and instead it has to be banished somewhere, perhaps?
Orion: No. If it could be a permanent banishment, yes. But we don't know what kind of plane and what creatures lie there that would, perhaps, come upon that artifact. What are the elements? Fire burns earth.
Laura: Wind blows.
Orion: Light destroys darkness. Pike, you're the only one who--
Sam: Rock beats scissors.
Orion: Exactly, Scanlan. You're the only one who could-- if your weapon had any kind of light enchantment on them, could probably smash this thing to bits. Then we would have to scatter the remnants, the pieces, far from each other, if not find different ways to destroy those pieces.
Laura: Why don't you trust them?
Orion: Because it comes from something that would--
Laura: Not the Horn. Why don't you trust Kima?
Orion: Because they wanted to bring it somewhere where they-- I don't know. Which is why I wanted you to do the half thing, where we could question Kima without her attacking us or trying to attempt to take the Horn from us.
Marisha: Well, here's my thing. Even if she has good intentions. Say she has good intentions and maybe they just wanted to bring the horn back to study it. And no one should be messing with this whatsoever.
Laura: I think they want to destroy it.
Taliesin: I'm of the opinion they probably want to banish it somewhere.
Travis: Yeah, I think they do.
Marisha: Then why don't we just agree to not hand it over.
Taliesin: No, this is good. This means that there's no reason, necessarily, not to trust them. We just know that we don't trust the Horn, and that's a perfectly reasonable way to come at it.
Liam: In the short term, Scanlan, are you able to send it to another dimension for a while?
Laura: No, I don't trust it anywhere out of our sight.
Sam: I cannot. It is not alive. I cannot.
Travis: Put it in the bag.
Laura: It's in the bag.
Taliesin: It's perfectly safe in the bag.
Travis: How about we rest, we put the Horn in the bag, we wake up Kima, we go, "Oh, we brought you back, sorry we don't have the Horn. If we did, what would you do with it?" And then we decide what we do.
Taliesin: I like half that plan.
Marisha: I kind of like that plan.
Orion: I like that plan, too.
Laura: I think we should tell her we didn't get it and see what she does.
Orion: Allura is somebody who should not be here when this conversation happens, because if they turn south, she's a more powerful sorcerer than I.
Marisha: We need to decide, do we tell her that we destroyed it, or do we tell her that we just didn't get it and that it's still down there.
Travis: We can't say destroyed because we don't know how we did that, right?
Laura: No, we didn't destroy it. We say, "Oh no, they, we got overrun and we had to leave."
Taliesin: But then they're going to tell us to go back for it.
Travis: That's fine, but if we ask like what she would've done if we had it, and when she leaves we go, "Hah, we have it."
Laura: Or we go, "Oh, well good, then actually we do have it, you can do that."
Travis: Yeah, if she wants to study it or use it or transform it into something, we don't give it to her, we try to destroy it ourselves. If she wants to banish it and do something that Tiberius is happy with, then we go like, "Hey, we have it."
Liam: When we meet her I don't think we should have it, I think one or two of us should take it away. We don't all have to be at that meeting.
Taliesin: I think we just keep it in the Bag of Holding, she'll never suspect.
Marisha: Well, hang on, it's in the Bag of Holding right now?
Laura: Yeah.
Taliesin: Yes.
Orion: Grog, is there nothing else in that bag of holding?
Travis: Nothing it can, we took out all the stuff it can turn into some like evil transformer or something.
Liam: You know, the other characters can make insight checks too, you know that, right?
Matt: There's a pile somewhere with armor.
Travis: Everything has out with parentheses next to it.
Liam: If we have it, then she's, she could say you're lying--
Laura: Or she might not be able to tell because we're so good at lying. (laughter)
Liam: I don't think your winks will work on her.
Sam: Legitimately, no one can tell when I'm lying.
Marisha: I mean, we could Stone Shape it and I could like Stone Shape it and bury it somewhere in our Keep.
Travis: One person should leave with it. I'll leave with it.
Liam: Yes, it's fucking simple.
Taliesin: That's genius.
Travis: Yeah, I'll leave. It's not like I'm going to talk to the sorcerers.
Liam: You and I could take a walk with it and play tiddlywinks or something in the woods. That's fine, what's wrong with that, it's easy.
Taliesin: That's a very good plan.
Orion: Do you want it very far away?
Travis: Yeah, you're a talker, I'm not.
Taliesin: No, we don't.
Marisha: Wait. You're talking about just taking a stroll through the forest with the Horn of Orcus?
Travis: No, I'll just hang out outside.
Orion: In the Keep, how about just stay in the Keep?
Liam: Just be somewhere else. Anywhere else.
Ashley: You could hang out in the temple downstairs.
Laura: I fall asleep on the table.
Travis: Shall we sleep?
Sam: Let's sleep and meet with Kima in the morning.
Taliesin: This was a fabulous breakfast, good night.
Liam: Vax gives his sleeping sister a wet willie.
Laura: Ugh!
Travis: I put my head right in my food and fall asleep.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: Let's not forget, you've still got a funny toe.
Sam: I check my bed to make sure no one shat in it. (laughter)
Orion: I did leave a little rat turd before I got scooped out. Just so you know.
Laura: Trinket, let's go to bed.
Marisha: I turn, I go Minxie and I curl up by the fire.
Travis: Yeah, Minxie!
Liam: Scanlan! Turn Tiberius back into a rat.
Orion: Oh yes, I'm going to bed.
Liam: Back into a rat.
Marisha: You can curl up with me.
Sam: Would you like to be a rat?
Orion: I like being furry.
Sam: Well then, no. I'm still punishing you. (laughter)
Orion: That's fine. Have your fun tonight, people, you will have your licking in the morning. I go to sleep.
Matt: All right. You guys all go to rest for the evening, the best rest you've had in a long time, your beds are comfortable, well set, it's a warm interior.
Ashley: I'm starfished on my bed.
Matt: This is the first time in a while that Pike, you've been able to sleep without your armor on, and it's so nice.
Laura: That's great.
Matt: You sleep hard, you sleep for an extended period, eventually you all begin to rouse, as you all wake up, the smell of fresh breakfast food is already coming to--
Laura: That and Pike's stank from her armor.
Matt: Yeah, you're going to have to wash that armor, girl.
Travis: It's like when you take a cast off, you're like, ugh.
Matt: It's bad.
Marisha: Actually, is there a bath house in the village?
Matt: You haven't inquired. You could ask around if you want.
Marisha: We should have a girls' day at the bath house.
Orion: I woke up and took a dirt bath.
Liam: You're not a rat, though.
Matt: Yeah. Oh, but he didn't transform you, though.
Orion: Huh?
Matt: He didn't transform you.
Orion: I know, in lizard form.
Sam: Gross.
Orion: In my form.
Taliesin: That's awesome.
Orion: Scales, you rub it off with clay?
Matt: Yeah, there you go. Out in the front of the Keep.
Laura: Gross!
Orion: I have a little dirt in my room.
Laura: A little pile of grossness.
Liam: We just don't fear for our lives for the first time.
Sam: Let's go down and have our meeting.
Matt: So you guys head down into the dining room again, Kima's still standing there with the maul, left where she was. Grog is still face-down like on the table, grabbed the plate up against his face with mashed potatoes across his cheek. Across the way at the far table, you see Cordell and Shayne are both finishing their breakfast, and are sitting there at the table with their arms kind of gathering as you enter. "Morning!" "Morning." And they both kind of finish their meal. Get up and stand up. "Enjoy your breakfast. You've earned it." "I think our shift is done." She pats Cordell and they both get up and they exit out.
Laura: Have a good night! I know, I know, but they're sleeping.
Travis: I start awake with food on my face and I wipe it off and eat it. "I had a horrible dream about two walking testicles that were hurting my mind."
Sam: That was no dream! (laughter)
Liam: I am so sad that you woke up. I was just about to go to the hearth and get some ash and draw a penis on your head.
Travis: I had a feeling something was coming.
Liam: Next thing out of my mouth, that's a promise.
Ashley: Where's the Bag of Holding?
Travis: I've got it.
Ashley: Can you check in your bag to see if the Horn is still there?
Laura: And it's okay?
Travis: I look in the bag of holding and I see a Horn?
Matt: You look in the bag and you see nothing. You imagine something, you reach in, you pull it out.
Taliesin: Don't do that.
Laura: How are we going to get it out of there?
Orion: I can.
Ashley: Can you tell if it's in there?
Sam: Can you teleport something out of a bag?
Orion: It's Telekinesis, I can picture it and--
Laura: Teleport it, can you pull it out and make sure it's still there and okay?
Matt: Okay. So you use Telekinesis, you lift the Horn out--
Orion: No, I don't do it. I'm assuming it's there. I'm not doing that right now.
Laura: Wait, no, check though, I want to make sure it's okay.
Orion: I'm pretty sure it's there.
Laura: But I want to make sure.
Sam: All right, I will check with Mage Hand or whatever, I got something else. Mage Hand, yeah, I'll Mage Hand it.
Matt: Mage Hand gently and slowly lifts it out, you can see the Horn kinda holds there for a second, it moves very slowly.
Travis: Yeah, put it back in.
Matt: Put it back in the bag.
Travis: Thank you, tie it up tight. I'm going to go down to the, what is it, the temple below the thingie?
Ashley: Okay, yeah, go down to the temple.
Travis: All right, I'm going to go play in the dark with myself. That sounded wrong.
Matt: Okay, so you head down into the temple to Sarenrae, which is beautiful, it's all like a giant two-story stained glass three-set walls with trees and hedges set up and flowers, bunch of wooden kind of long benches set up towards this, the altar in the center, it's beautiful, especially this time of day, it's close to noon right now so the sun's streaking through the top of it, and it's cascading through the tree boughs of the two trees that are closest to the entrance. It's a beautiful sight. Even you, Grog, are moved.
Travis: Just because I'm nervous, I reach into the Bag of Holding and pull out a vial of holy oil that I have. I have three vials of holy oil and I just hold it in one hand while I'm down there.
Matt: All right. So while he's down there, the rest of you guys, what're you doing?
Orion: I'm going to cast Circle of Teleportation in my room.
Matt: Okay.
Orion: No, I'm going to go to the treasury first, I'm going to take out 500 gold pieces, and then I'm going to go to my room and cast Circle of Teleportation.
Matt: Okay. Tiberius is gone.
Sam: Let's heal Kima.
Laura: You just left us?
Orion: By the blessing of Bahamut, I choose Draconia.
Matt: Tiberius is gone.
Ashley: Okay, so, I'm going to stand behind Kima and--
Taliesin: We're going to face her towards the wall.
Ashley: Face her towards the wall.
Liam: Good idea.
Ashley: Or towards something happy.
Taliesin: We're ready to pull you away when she starts to move.
Ashley: Yeah, okay. So.
Marisha: Wait! Are we unfreezing her?
Taliesin: Yeah.
Travis: Yeah.
Marisha: No, I thought we were going to talk to Allura first.
Laura: No, we're going to talk to her first.
Marisha: Oh wait, that's right. And we were going to do that thing.
Laura: You were drunk, it's okay.
Marisha: That's right, I was probably tipsy, sorry. We came up with like eight plans last night.
Laura: You were so drunk.
Sam: Wait, shouldn't Grog be here, he's the one who likes her.
Travis: Oh, the things I sacrifice for the group.
Ashley: So I cast Greater Restoration on Kima.
Laura: And then run away!
Matt: Okay, you reach out and touch the back of Kima. Her stone armor turns to gold and rapidly her entire form goes back to flesh. As she finishes her swing with the maul (impact sound) against the stone wall. And she kinda steps back for a second, confused, and looks over her shoulder at the rest of you.
Sam: Everything's okay, everything's okay, we're out of danger, we're at home, it's okay.
Laura: It's fine, it's fine, guess what, we are alive.
Sam: We lived.
Matt: Just drops the maul for a second and kinda leans back against the wall.
Marisha: I just get the leftover mashed potatoes from breakfast.
Matt: "Thank you, thank you, oh thank you. What happened?" She's not even using utensils, she's just like scooping it with her hand at this point.
Laura: So we killed K'Varn, right?
Matt: "Obviously."
Sam: Funny story, you were right about Clarota. He was horrible, we killed him. We killed him! Hey, you were right.
Laura: But not before we were overrun with a bunch of evil brothers of his.
Taliesin: And we got a very fancy hat out of it.
Laura: Hey, right, look at his hat.
Sam: We should've known all along, you were right, we should've trusted you, sorry.
Matt: "It's all right. He had his uses, certainly."
Liam: You were right, we were wrong, you're very attractive, we're all quite ugly.
Matt: "That isn't necessary, but the compliment is appreciated, regardless. Thank you for bringing me back with you. You could have easily left me back and I appreciate that you took the time."
Sam: So, you're alive, that's good because you were sorta on a suicide mission.
Matt: "Not a suicide mission."
Laura: What exactly was your mission, Kima?
Matt: "Where's the Horn?"
Laura: Well, thing is, it's not here.
Matt: "All right. It's not with the illithid, is it?"
Sam: It's in a safe place.
Matt: "How safe?"
Laura: Pretty safe.
Taliesin: Why, what can it do?
Matt: She looks visually nervous and she goes--
Laura: Nothing can touch it.
Matt: "Well, that's what the Order that originally sealed it believes. Even if it's somewhere safe temporarily, we can possibly relocate it. But we have to-- (sighs)"
Liam: You saw your mission as a suicide mission, but if you had secured it, what were your plans? What was plan B? What were you going to do?
Matt: "Well, if I were to fall in the process of trying to get the Horn, others would come after me. I sent word to my Order that if I did not return they would send more."
Laura: Can I insight?
Matt: Go for it, yeah, go ahead and roll insight.
Laura: 19.
Sam: Ooh!
Marisha: Whisper time! Sweet, sweet whispers.
Sam: Keep subscribing, guys, because whispering action doesn't come free.
Marisha: How many subscribers away are we?
Lucas: 38.
Marisha: 38 subscribers.
Travis: That's a lot.
Marisha: That's a lot.
Sam: That's a lot.
Marisha: That is still a lot.
Sam: Keep subscribing to Geek and Sundry, where you can watch Matt Mercer whisper at people.
Matt: And she goes, "So this Horn, which is one of two, if Allura is correct, was sealed a thousand or so years ago by those who originally cut it from the head of the avatar of Orcus of which it was bestowed. They, once he was slain, did everything they could within their power to destroy it, yet this artifact, instilled with the purity of Orcus, was indestructible to their knowledge. So the least they could do was to seal both horns across the world from each other and forget that it even existed. Which worked well until recently. It wasn't until these visions came to me and other members of my Order that we knew that this, this was a thing, and me being the closest in my pilgrimage, we took that as time of the essence I was to go in there with a team and retrieve it. If it couldn't be destroyed, at the very least we could convene and decide a safer place to possibly reseal it and forget. There are magical ways of forcing those of us who know how to forget. That would be the safest thing for it. If there is a way to destroy it, we don't know, but that could also be sought after. We have arcane and divine knowledge we didn't have back then, so, in the long run it needs to be retrieved, the longer it stays down there in the Underdark, no matter where you placed it, it draws like a beacon all darkness to it until something else like this beholder K'Varn will take up the mantle and themselves be as dangerous or more so than he ever was."
Laura: So the other Horn is still safe?
Matt: "As far as I know. The visions only gave me access to where this one was. I can only assume that it's out there, but if someone else were to find it, I would know that they probably have knowledge of the second one existing, as well. I don't know if K'Varn shared this information, but if someone else takes the mantle of this Horn, what's to stop them from seeking the other?"
Liam: Bummer.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: "Regardless, I appreciate that we're all alive and we're together, and where are we?"
Laura: Oh, you're in our home.
Sam: Greyskull Keep. It's in Emon.
Matt: "We're in Emon?"
Sam: Yes.
Matt: "Well, that's wondrous, we can speak with Allura. She would have the wisdom to know what to do with this next."
Sam: Hypothetical. What if an army of darkness was slowly approaching Emon to kill all of us?
Matt: "What are you saying?"
Sam: Well, we killed Clarota and K'Varn, but we, there was a lot of bad guys down there that we could not kill--
Laura: We hurt that Elder Brain real bad, but not bad enough.
Matt: "I don't know much about the illithid themselves, but they reside deep and they are not fans of the surface. I believe that it was K'Varn's initial onset that was pushing them, both in union with the duergar and pushing them towards the siege. They spoke of something about bringing twilight to the surface world. I don't know what that was about, but I fear what knowledge they have if left alone. At the very least, I know that they're probably having to return and lick their wounds where we left behind. It would be folly for them, especially knowing that we're aware, to attack now."
Laura: Okay, that's good.
Matt: "But we can notify those in Kraghammer to buffer their defenses, close the tunnels that you took down there and my army as well, and that should give us time to prepare if we choose to seize or at least seal them off."
Laura: And your Order is what?
Matt: "The Order of the Platinum Dragon."
Laura: Right. That's a really good Order, right?
Taliesin: History check, can I do a history check?
Matt: It's a religion check.
Taliesin: That's a religion check, not history check?
Marisha: Pike.
Matt: You could roll a history check and probably gain some knowledge based on that, but the--
Ashley: Could I do it?
Matt: If you'd like to.
Ashley: Are you doing a religion check, Percy?
Taliesin: I'm doing a history check, if you want to do a religion check.
Ashley: I'll do a religion check.
Matt: Go for it.
Taliesin: 22.
Ashley: So fucking close.
Matt: I mean, you guys are familiar loosely with the name Bahamut, you've heard Tiberius bring it up before, you've seen temples to it, but your knowledge knows that Bahamut is very well regarded as the lawful good deity of justice and honor and is primarily one of the great good gods of this pantheon.
Taliesin: If we're going to trust anyone, I think this is a good--
Travis: Yeah, I feel pretty good about this.
Taliesin: I trust the organization, they have a sterling reputation.
Marisha: So, Kima. Pie-in-the-sky goal? You would destroy the Horn?
Matt: "If we had the means of doing so, yes. We'd have to talk to the Order, we'd have to talk to the Council, we'd have to bring people that we could trust and that had the capabilities of knowing if this were possible how we would go about it. It's beyond my knowledge."
Liam: I think what worries us is anyone coming in contact with it would be corrupted.
Matt: "Don't go into contact with it."
Laura: No.
Liam: No, of course.
Marisha: Just within range.
Sam: Yes, is proximity okay?
Matt: "I don't know, I saw it for as long as you did."
Laura: This could be bad.
Sam: Evil Grog?
Laura: Kind of uncomfortable.
Matt: "The essence of most artifacts like this, it goes more than just touch, one has to be imbued, bond with these artifacts, to attune with them like any powerful magical item to truly gain its power, but that's not to say that itself does not contain some sort of foul intelligence."
Ashley: Can I go downstairs and go get Grog?
Matt: Okay. So you walk your way down.
Travis: (sings) I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts.
Matt: As you're walking past, as you walk past you are immediately met in the hallway by Erwen, your servant, your halfling elder servant who walks up and says, "Dear, I wanted to let you know that a scroll came for you, some sort of a summons." And he hands it to you.
Ashley: Me?
Sam: Probably jury duty.
Matt: And he kinda walks past you in the tunnel.
Taliesin: Always the worst time.
Matt: You open it up a little bit, it's not, hasn't been opened, you kinda pull the paper and open it up. It's a summon to the Council of Tal'Dorei, it's written by the hand of the clerk, and it says, essentially, the sovereign Uriel has been notified of your arrival and would like to see you at the council chambers posthaste.
Ashley: Okay. I'm still going to go get Grog, but I'll pass the scroll around. Hey Grog, come upstairs.
Travis: Oh yeah?
Marisha: That was for all of us?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: It was addressed to Vox Machina.
Travis: Is it clear?
Ashley: Just don't say anything yet, but just come upstairs.
Travis: Did she ask about me?
Laura: She definitely did.
Ashley: She did, yeah.
Travis: With my bald head.
Matt: All right. You make your way back in, Kima finishes her meal, and you guys are chatting a bit, she's just like, "All right, if I may ask, how did you seal it? I feel uncomfortable knowing the process and that it's at least safe."
Marisha: Oh, we have one of the best defense mechanisms. Grog!
Travis: Hello, Lady Kima.
Laura: It's in a very secure magical item.
Matt: She glances at you and goes, "All right, very well. Just be mindful that you don't go reaching in there."
Marisha: I use my Druidcraft as he enters to make little sparkles and lightning bugs appear around him. "Grog!"
Matt: Lady Kima, who is currently covered in dirt and sweat, still in the golden armor that she wrestled from the long-dead corpse of a dwarf in the Underdark, her chin is smattered with dried mashed potatoes and a bit of her breakfast, kinda gives--
Laura: So she's covered in food as well.
Matt: (laughs) Gives you a look as you're walking in like. "It's good to see you alive, friend."
Travis: Yeah, more than alive, I think.
Ashley: And also, he actually pulled you out of the cavern with one arm while you were stone. Out of the whole place.
Travis: Oh, stop, I don't like to brag.
Matt: She stands up and kinda wipes the food off her chin, clutches her symbol, and then steps right before you, looking up towards your face and says, "I thank you, friend Grog."
Laura: Friendzoned!
Matt: And then reaches out and gives you a big hug.
Liam: Plus he decided not to put you in the magical bag when you were a statue.
Matt: She releases Grog slightly, and kinda gives you a keen look and goes, "Also appreciated."
Travis: Yeah, well, you know.
Laura: Oh my god, thank god.
Sam: Why don't you go rest? We'll summon Allura and we'll continue the conversation from there, I guess.
Matt: "Please, I'd love to see her, it's been too long. All right, I'm going to, is there a room I could rest?"
Taliesin: Yes.
Travis: You could use my room.
Taliesin: There's a guest room.
Laura: Yes, we have a guest room.
Sam: We should use it.
Orion: I would've had your back, by the way, there.
Travis: Thank you.
Matt: Erwen, who's by the door, leads her to the guest room and you guys take a moment to rest. We'll go ahead and pick up next session at that point, where Allura's being brought in, so we'll stop the game there as I have to rush to the airport, but before that we have some gifts to open from you guys.
Travis: You're rushing to the airport tonight?
Matt: Huh?
Travis: You're rushing to the airport tonight?
Matt: Yeah, I got a redeye, 1AM. To be in Sandusky, Ohio. At Collisi--er no, Collosalcon. Please come.
Travis: You're going to do the waterslides, right? You won't ride waterslides?
Matt: It'll be fun. Guys, thank you so much for watching, that was a lot of fun.
Sam: We lived!
Matt: And everyone lived! Barely.
Marisha: We lived!
Matt: Barely, oh my god.
Marisha: Holy shit, we lived.
Travis: One roll away from her being--
Ashley: That was rough.
Matt: Her and Scanlan.
Laura: One point, twice.
Matt: Twice for you.
Travis: Twice.
Taliesin: I'm going to go get our d20s back.
Marisha: Crazyballs. Oh yeah. We had two sparkles and a green one.
Ashley: I was just rolling bad.
Zac: Hey, guys. We got some gifts for you from the chatroom. Some letters.
Liam: I got an Asus computer with an "aren't we clever" sticker on it?
Marisha: Sweet.
Zac: Man, I'll give you an "aren't we clever" sticker if you want, it's worth about the same. We also have some donations to read off. (cheering)
Zac: So guys, as long as we're live, that subscriber giveaway still stands.
Laura: How far away are we from it?
Zac: 36 subs away from another giveaway. All right.
Matt: All right.
Zac: If you want to go ahead and, actually I don't know if she wanted this to be read. Oh, okay, but this is cool. Do you want to hand me those disposable cameras? Where did he go? Oh, I lost him.
Matt: Essentially it says, "Vox Machina, I have sent you a disposable camera. Basically I had this idea to send this to you and have you guys go crazy, fill up the camera with random shenanigans, whether it's behind-the-scenes, setup during a stream, or elsewise of your shoes, and then once you guys have filled both cameras, you can send them back with the already printed label included in the box I sent this in, send it back to me, I can get the pictures printed and doubled and then send you guys a set back once they're developed."
Marisha: Aw, that's a good idea!
Matt: "I thought it'd be something different for you guys to do, hopefully you enjoy it and I can't wait to hear back from you. Becca."
Marisha: That's fun!
Matt: Thank you so much, Becca.
Marisha: Awesome.
Ashley: Thank you, Becca.
Matt: Yeah, we'll keep the rest to ourselves. We've got an awesome picture of Grog and Mustang Scanlan. Look at that.
Taliesin: (sings) Mustang Scanlan.
Travis: Horse head. Evil horse head of doom.
Laura: Nice.
Taliesin: (sing) Slow your mustang down.
Marisha: (sing) Slow your mustang down.

Liam: Thank you, Kat! Thank you Katkitten112 for this craziness, oh my god!
Matt: That's amazing.
Taliesin: That is so badass.
Matt: I'm going to say that's the keen dagger.
Laura: Look at how many daggers he has now! Ludicrous.
Liam: Just ten more.
Marisha: So many daggers.
Matt: All righty, guys, so. As a heads-up. "Attn Geek and Sundry Twitch. To the awesome people at Geek and Sundry, please forward this package to the members of Critical Role on my behalf. I have made them each a personalized pendant with their character names, plus a few extras. Earrings inspired by Keyleth, Pike, and Vex'ahlia for Marisha, Ashley, and Laura, and four Vox Machina pendants which can be kept or given away. Many thanks to all involved for making Critical Role possible. Those short videos of their campaign on Vine were never enough to know what was going on. Sincerely yours, Ipec Psy." That's so awesome. Thank you so much, Ipec. Okay, pass this down to Percy?
Orion: I got this amazing Tiberius pin.
Laura: So cute!
Taliesin: So fantastic.
Zac: Tiberius.
Laura: Oh, it's got a little deck.
Orion: Pike. Ashley. A three-inch figure of Pike is coming for you and a three-inch figure of Scanlan is coming. They're on their way.
Matt: You guys are ridiculous!
Orion: David.
Matt: It's your holy symbol.
Marisha: They're little flowers!
Zac: Hey, guys, we have some boxes of very special dice here, and they included a letter, but it says, "Please do not read on stream," so this is for you guys to read when we go offline, but we're going to hand these out as well.
Marisha: Holy crap.
Laura: Oh, this is for me!
Marisha: I'm pretty sure she has an Etsy store.
Taliesin: She does.
Laura: Oh my god, this is the best day ever.
Matt: You guys are ridiculous!
Liam: It's Critmas!
All: Critmas!
Liam: Whoa, look at that. That's a die, it's dangerous.
Travis: No it's not.
Matt: That's so cool, you guys are ridiculous.
Sam: Whoa, that's an awesome die!
Travis: Are you fucking kidding me?
Sam: Whoa, the first roll was a 20! (cheering)
Laura: This will never go in the dice graveyard.
Zac: Each one is unique to you guys, it's nuts.
Marisha: Oh my god!
Travis: Skulls!
Ashley: What? I got a Celtic knot!
Laura: This is the coolest thing ever.
Taliesin: Holy shit.
Marisha: What does yours look like?
Taliesin: Holy shit.
Laura: Let me see!
Ashley: Nice, what the heck!
Travis: It's made of skulls.
Laura: Wow, I got a 20!
Marisha: Whoa, with the whitewash on it.
Zac: Okay, wait.
Taliesin: I just rolled a 20! Look at it, look at it!
Marisha: Wait, did everyone roll 20s on their first roll?
Matt: These are magically enchanted handcrafted dice.
Travis: I rolled an eight.
Marisha: I rolled a four.
Matt: I got a Sputnik dice, by the way.
Ashley: Thank you so much!
Taliesin: Thank you so much!
Marisha: These are crazy! Holy balls!
Sam: Okay, a benefactor sent the holy charm of Sarenrae for me to present to you.
Marisha: Oh my gosh, that's so pretty!
Sam: In, I think, holy matrimony?
Ashley: Oh, well, let's just--
Matt: Ellie, these are all amazing. Thank you so much.
Laura: Thank you, thank you.
Ashley: Thank you, thank you.
Orion: A dragon-bone die for the dragonborn.
Matt: I've rolled nothing lower than a 16 on this die, so it gets used a lot moving forward.
Liam: Also, for my birthday I got (Gollum voice) precious.
Marisha: That's awesome!
Orion: Good job, guys.
Matt: You guys are ridiculous.
Zac: You guys are all going to post pictures to Twitter, right, because everyone's asking.
Taliesin: Oh, yeah. Oh yeah, this is happening.
Liam: (Gollum voice) Precious!
Zac: While these guys are still opening their presents, I wanted to-- go ahead.
Marisha: Ellie, whoever made the jewelry, to tweet at us and let us know her Etsy store.
Matt: Ellie did the dice, wasn't it, I think?
Marisha: Ellie did the dice.
Matt: Yeah, the pendants were--
Zac: Ellie did the dice.
Marisha: The pendants were from Ipec.
Laura: Oh, I've got to get all my presents in the picture.
Marisha: From @millena, let us know about your Etsy.
Ashley: Guys, thanks so much.
Matt: An awesome letter from Meghan Levann, cards from Meghan Levann's site, we're going to go ahead and pass these out, and I'll read this after the stream. That's so awesome, thank you so much, Meghan.
All: Thank you, Meghan!
Zac: While these guys are still going through their presents, I just want to remind you guys, thank you for tuning in, and tomorrow we have So You Don't Have To, and we're going to play Jazz Punk on the stream, and it's a lot of fun, and then after that we'll have Gather Your Party and IndieKate is joining us, the all-female punk band Blood Candy is joining us, and then we have the-- oh my gosh, I feel like a dumb-dumb now. What's the name of that-- the Dance Free Movement people? The group that threw the party for the guy that was shamed on the internet, the--
Matt: Mercer shirt. Dice on the back. DM represent.
Zac: I'm sure a lot of you guys heard about the man that was shamed on the internet.
Marisha: Yeah, the punk teenagers made fun of him?
Zac: Right. Made fun of him on the internet, and a large group of-- the Dance Free Movement came Together, flew him out to Los Angeles, and threw a big party for him, so we have the Dance Free Together group coming tomorrow to play Just Dance with us, to talk about their movement and everything like that, so make sure you guys tune in tomorrow, it's going to be a lot of a fun, that's from 7-10PM. And we had a couple more donations really quickly come in. Just wanted to say thank you to--
Matt: What's that?
Lucas: Did you read the dice on the shirt?
Matt: (laughs) Nice and hidden. Didn't notice that. The dice say, 'How do you want to do this?'
Laura: Awesome!
Taliesin: That's so cool.
Laura: Oh, that's really cool.
Zac: For the people that donated after we started reading the donations, I know Matt's trying to get outta here pretty quick, so thank you, FoxyForsythe, Zopher, Metheram and Hunter, I'll make sure these guys get the messages that you guys sent, but we're going to go ahead and let these guys start packing up. I know that they have lives!
Marisha: We're tweeting pictures of our dice and our things so everyone can see now.
Laura: I'm hashtagging Critmas.
Zac: Did we make that sub goal?
Orion: Oh my god, is that your die that you got?
Zac: We did not make the sub goal, so we'll get you guys-- no, we're not going to get it, so we'll get you guys with a giveaway tomorrow.
Matt: Next time, you can do it then. You guys are ridiculous, thank you so much. Have a wonderful night.
Ashley: Thank you guys so, so much.
Matt: See you next week on Thursday.
Marisha: We love you guys, you're amazing! [dramatic music]

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello everyone, and welcome to Critical Role, the show where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors get together, roll dice, and play Dungeons and Dragons. My name is Matthew Mercer, I'm the Dungeon Master of the game. Welcome, new folks who haven't seen this before, hope you're not too lost, and returning Team Hooman and Critter fans, welcome back, we love having you and let's get this evening on the road. We have some announcements and things to talk about before the game actually kicks in, so we'll first pass it over here to our fantastic overlord to get that kicked off.
Zac: That's right, you get to see my ugly face for a couple minutes while I get through a couple quick announcements, guys. A lot of you have been asking me on Twitter and in the chat room when you will get to see Critical Troll? That will be up on the website tomorrow night at 8PM Pacific Standard Time. So go over to the website at 8PM, you'll be able to see that and I'm sure you guys will secretly pass around the youtube link and stuff.
Matt: Watch me go crazy.
Zac: Currently you can find Laura's article on GeekandSundry.com.
Laura: What?!
Zac: That came out today, so make sure to head over to the website and read that. And I know a lot of you are probably wondering about D&Diesel. Which is apparently the name, D&Diesel.
Laura: Yeah, it is.
Zac: Got a ring to it.
Taliesin: Hashtag D&Diesel.
Zac: Hashtag D&Diesel. That will be showing tonight during the midpoint of the show. Now, there's a couple special things with this showing, you need to watch it live. If you think that you're going to come back later, watch it on the rebroadcast, and you're gonna go dip out for a pee break or pizza break, whatever, don't! Stick around because after it shows tonight live, you will be unable to see it again until Monday on the website. So it will be cut from the rebroadcasts.
Laura: Whoa.
Zac: And I'm very sorry to our European audience. I'm really sorry about that, but that's just unfortunately how PR deals work sometimes and that's just the way it is. But, it'll only be--
Matt: It's only a few days!
Zac: Yeah, it'll only be a few days and you'll get to see a lot more on Monday. A longer cut and that's why it's a website exclusive. It's longer, it'll have some tightening and all sorts of other stuff. But, you guys get a special treat tonight with a preview showing, and it's still a long preview, it's like 20-25 minutes or something like that.
Laura: Whoa, it is?
Matt: Yeah.
Zac: It's pretty cool.
Matt: That'll be exciting.
Zac: So there's that. Tomorrow we have a very special event happening for all of those that joined us for the Extra Life campaign, thank you so much, and a lot of you guys were here as well.
Matt: Yes indeed.
Zac: And thank you for donating, getting us well past our goal, and as some of you may remember during Critical Troll, Felicia mentioned that if we reached a certain goal, she would come on, on a scheduled date and play Rock Band 4. So that's happening, tomorrow.
Matt: Yup!
Zac: We are having a battle of the bands from 5 to 7PM Pacific Standard Time, and Mr. Mercer here is going to be playing the drums.
Matt: Yeah, I'm drumming for them, which, first off, I haven't played since probably 2011, and I'm a little rusty.
Zac: Have you seen your competition?
Matt: No, but I assume they're gonna destroy me.
Zac: They're really good.
Matt: That's okay. I will narrate my failure.
Zac: There we go!
Matt: In a way that will still be as engrossing. (laughs)
Zac: And there's been a Twitter battle happening between the two teams.
Matt: Oh really?
Zac: You're kinda walking into the fire, my friend.
Matt: That's okay.
Zac: Felicia's put a lot on the line for you guy's team.
Matt: That's cool. I got fire resistance. That's fine.
Zac: Okay cool, cool. That'll be happening tomorrow 5PM to 7PM Pacific Standard Time, you guys should tune in for that. We are still going to be donating to Extra Life, but we're not really going to be pushing it, it's more of a reward for you guys for helping us get past that $75k goal.
Matt: Yes.
Zac: Our next giveaway is going to be at 9,500, we're getting pretty close. The other real quick little announcement I have as far as subs go, is last week you guys were able to get our sub train up to 420 subs, now that counts resubs and new subs. So we have the sub train going right now, I believe it's well over a hundred--
Matt: Woof.
Zac: If we break last week's record of 420 which I think they purposely stopped at 420--
Matt: (laughs) Of course they did.
Zac: Hey guys, don't go. We will do a giant giveaway of board games, D&D stuff signed by the cast, signed by the rest of the Twitch crew. We'll throw in a couple video games, t-shirts, all sorts of stuff. Plus Ivan has said if we reach that goal for TPK, which those that watched last Monday, thank you so much.
Matt: Yeah!
Zac: It's a new show on Monday nights where our Twitch cast plays as themself in Outbreak Undead. Last week, some of you saw the Twitch cast leave me for dead outside of the studio. And a lot of people thought that I might come back if given the opportunity. Well, if we break that sub goal, Ivan has said that I will come back and probably wreak havoc in some way for our Twitch host that thought they could get away with leaving me for dead in the middle of the street.
Matt: (laughs) That's awesome.
Zac: So let's break 420. The last announcement, guys, is just a real quick community announcement. We like to pride ourselves at Geek & Sundry for being a very open and loving and warm community, and that's absolutely the most important thing to us and to Felicia and to a lot of our viewers, and I know last week things got a little heated in the chat room, and we just want to remind everyone that we don't get the opportunity to talk to you much during the show, but we want to make sure you guys stay as positive as possible or I will have to throw the hammer down on you.
Matt: Shit. All right. There you--
Zac: That's pretty much it.
Matt: You know, just goes to say that this community is built on so many great, positive people and such a wonderful sense of community, and a big huge thanks and please share appreciation for our fantastic mods who work consistently and constantly throughout the day.
Zac: (sings) For free.
Matt: For free.
Zac: (laughs) You guys are crazy.
Matt: Through our chatroom, which if you've watched, as you're now seeing and have seen previous episodes, is I can only assume readable by super mastermind computers at this point. So, you guys do an amazing job, it's really appreciated and to all of you guys out there in the community, keep that positivity, keep that understanding, and enjoy our game for its ups, for its downs, for our good character choices, bad character choices. It's all an experience in a story that we're all having together at the same time. So, kick along, hold on, and keep smiling.
Zac: Well said, Matt.
Matt: Yeah, thank you.
Zac: We love you guys, kind of. (all laugh)
Matt: I do. I love you. We do.
Zac: I'm on the fence.
Matt: He's a-- you know.
Laura: We love you so much!
Matt: It's a thing. So yeah, so, couple other announcements for you guys. What's our sub count right now? When's our next one hundred?
Crew: 9.5k, 9,500.
Matt: At 9,500 we will be giving away our signed photo and signed art piece by Kit Buss to a random person who's active in the chat. So next time we hit that goal, we'll have that giveaway, which is awesome. Once again, Extra Life has been our big charity push right now. Everyone who's given, thank you so much. So, so much, and if ever you want to be a part of helping that out we have the information there available for you, it goes to a really great cause. Let's see, Sam will be here shortly. Unfortunately, we're down a Tiberius tonight. However, yesterday was Orion's birthday, so feel free to go ahead and wish him a happy birthday on Twitter.
Laura: Aw.
Liam: Happy birthday, Orion.
Travis: Happy birthday, buddy.
Matt: Happy birthday, Orion. But yeah, Sam should be here shortly. And, let's see, do we have any project announcements?
Liam: Just a project announcement?
Matt: Or any other announcements you've got.
Liam: Hey, yesterday I started directing for the World of Warcraft. So that's pretty good.
Laura: You did? (all cheer)
Matt: Congratulations, buddy.
Laura: That's so great!
Liam: I think it's gonna be ongoing and it was really nice.
Travis: Big deal.
Marisha: I'm so excited for you!
Laura: That's super exciting.
Matt: That's awesome.
Liam: Then anything right now?
Marisha: I'm so fangirly.
Matt: Anything you want.
Liam: All right, I also want to thank Pupgames from Twitter for sending me this.
Laura: Oh yeah.
Liam: Look at this. It came in the mail separate and I have a hood and now I can just, you know, I can go like that and no one will see me so thank you, Pupgames.
Matt: That's awesome!
Liam: Let me set it here. I haven't figured out how to wear it exactly, but I will.
Laura: (laugh)
Matt: (laugh)
Travis: Take all your clothes off and then figure it out.
Matt: It's warm on the chesticles.
Liam: And then, I just want to take a minute, I said thank you on Twitter, but I just want to thank everybody who for the last week has sent me well-wishes and today who has sent me well-wishes, and a lot of the Critter community got together and made a video just to, you know, just support, support me in-- I am having a hard moment in my personal life, not gonna get into it, but you guys kind of took my breath away today for real. So, thank you very much.
Travis: Yeah.
Marisha: We have the best fans.
Matt: This whole community is brilliant, so you guys.
Taliesin: So many of them in New York and in San Francisco this week, where we've been all over the place.
Marisha: Yes. Shout out to our New York and San Fran.
Matt: Yeah, we hit both coasts.
Marisha: San Francisco. Both coasts.
Matt: Yeah, in the same week. It's crazy. Yeah, we all went to New York Comic Con. We had a panel that went really well. We had a bunch of great critters come out and Team Hooman folks come and sit in the audience, ask questions. We had some fun banter back and forth. We gave out 'Critical Rolls,' these cookies that were our little meal deal.
Taliesin: That were neither critical nor rolls, really to be fair.
Matt: Right.
Taliesin: But they were good.
Marisha: But we're into it.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: Imaginary rolls.
Marisha: Imaginary rolls.
Matt: Much like our realm is imaginary.
Taliesin: I may have hit a couple people in the face, for which I greatly apologize.
Laura: I definitely hit somebody in the face with one of those rolls.
Taliesin: Yeah, I like split someone's lip.
Matt: Completely unintentional, I'm sure.
Laura: I'm so sorry.
Liam: Her aim is excellent. She never misses.
Laura: Yes, I am an archer.
Travis: She Hunter's Marks that shit.
Laura: I Hunter's Marked your face.
Taliesin: And we played golf. It was quite nice.
Matt: Also, thank you guys for coming out to that event. Also, for those who came to see us at Forbidden Planet in New York, we had a great turnout, and that comic shop wasn't quite expecting what they were in for.
Travis: We weren't expecting that.
Matt: We weren't expecting, but they especially were like halfway through like, "Who are you guys?! What is happening?!"
Marisha: (laughs) Yeah.
Travis: We are legion.
Marisha: We freaked out our Uber driver.
Matt: Yeah we did.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: We pulled up and got out of the car and all of a sudden it was like hundreds of people cheering and we all went "What?!" and the Uber driver went "What?!?"
Taliesin: I think his exact words is, "Is this for us?" (all laugh)
Matt: And even we were like "I don't know."
Laura: I don't know!
Matt: You guys were amazing. Thank you for that.
Marisha: I feel like we need to find and screen cap in the thread where we were like, 20, 30 people, guys. Let's not get our hopes up.
Laura: Yeah.
Liam: Well, that's who got back to me, was like, I don't know, 40ish.
Laura: Yeah, we thought it was gonna be like 40 people.
Matt: Yeah, that was a good turnout.
Laura: That-- pretty great. Was great. Pretty great.
Liam: It was pretty metal.
Taliesin: The internet went, nope.
Matt: Yeah. Other announcements  Coming up in I think the next couple weeks or so, the release of the Minecraft Story Mode.
Marisha: (whispers) Yeah.
Travis: (sings) Yeah.
Matt: Comes out on Xbox. Completely a fun show. We went to the Archlight Let's Play of it they did, which was really a lot of fun. I play the characters Aiden and Otis in it.
Marisha: Hundreds of screaming children. Screaming, yeah.
Matt: Yes, lots of screaming children. Yeah, so I play Aiden and Otis and a smattering of other characters throughout. I think Sam also worked on it. Anyone else?
All: Ashley.
Matt: That's right, Ashley Johnson, our very own Pike!
Liam: She's one of the mains.
Matt: Yeah, she's one of the main characters in that show. So if you're a Minecraft fan and you like Telltale and you have an Xbox, check it out.
Laura: Speaking of Telltale, the final episode of Tales from the Borderlands comes out next week.
Travis: Oh snap!
Laura: Episode five, what!
Taliesin: Yeah!
Matt: Awesome!
Laura: Exciting.
Matt: (sings) Yeah.
Taliesin: Also in that role, if any Critters are in the Galveston area for Halloween, I will be at OniCon over Halloween weekend. So, you can come say hi in beautiful Galveston by the sea. Galveston, Texas.
Matt: There you go.
Taliesin: I'll be wearing a costume. It'll be great.
Matt: Perfect.
Liam: We have a gnome.
Laura: We have a gnome.
Taliesin: We have gnome? Oh god!
Marisha: You're in Minecraft, right? Story mode.
Sam: Yes I am.
Marisha: Yeah.
Sam: In fact you and I--
Matt: I think we have a couple scenes together.
Sam: We do something together, I don't know what. Or you're playing a version of me or something, I don't remember.
Matt: I can only assume that it's tawdry.
Sam: (laughs) The director told me something about you and I just assume we're probably having sex in the game.
Matt: Probably.
Sam: Yeah, okay.
Matt: It's just like an extended, fully interactive too. Talk about choices you make that affect the storyline. (laughs)
Taliesin: I blank out in the booth any time they mention his name.
Matt: But yeah, cool, guys. Any announcements anyone want to talk about, or shall we get things started?
Laura: Let's do it!
Matt: All right, let's do it.
Marisha: Do it!
Liam: Wait, where did Grog go?
Taliesin: Wait, wait, wait.
Sam: He'll be here.
Matt: Grog, he'll be here in a minute but in the meantime, let's go ahead and dial in for the next episode of Critical Role.
Taliesin: Dun dun dun dun. [opening credits]
Matt: Welcome back. So. Sh. (laughs) So, to go over the current adventure in its current sequence, we have-- the party recently had an encounter with the Briarwoods. Two individuals that were responsible for a lot of strife--
Liam: Dicks!
Matt: -- in the background of Percival's history. Seemingly responsible for the destruction of his entire family, and have for the past five years been essentially ruling his home city and castle. They were out for a political banquet with Sovereign Uriel in Emon and the party members of Vox Machina, they were all invited to be part of this. Didn't quite go as planned. There was a scuffle and the Briarwoods absconded back to Whitestone. They sent a couple assassins out to attempt to take out their driver, who was spilling information and essentially was going to be Vox Machina's way of being free of any sort of political issues based on their actions that evening, and after much discussion and preparation and purchasing a lot of mirrors, the party took their transit over to the east-northeast towards Whitestone, where they began to traverse the Alabaster Sierras to the north, using the mountain range as opposed to going directly through the forest. There they managed to avoid encountering a bunch of harpies that were distracted by eating the horses they left behind.
Travis: Damn.
Matt: They camped for the evening and began to make their way through some sort of a mountainous valley that led in towards the forest surrounding Whitestone. While they were traveling down this pass, there was a rumbling, and some sort of really fast, rapid-moving large blue creature that leaped down in front, catching them off-guard. And that is where we begin today.
Travis: Probably should have fucking researched that creature.
Taliesin: Did the creature look like that?
Matt: That blue creature.
Laura: Yeah, right? That would have been smart.
Taliesin: Okay, just checking.
Travis: I never do that.
Laura: I know. So dumb.
Sam: What's dumb?
Travis: I have a question.
Laura: That we didn't research that creature.
Travis: What did you roll on your beard check?
Matt: What'd I roll on my beard check?
Laura: I know, it's growing!
Marisha: It's metagaming, you can't. We're not allowed.
Matt: Well, obviously. (all laugh)
Matt: Well, No Shave 'Til 10k.
Travis: That's true!
Matt: And my Halloween costume requires a decent amount of facial hair.
Taliesin: Oh, that's right.
Travis: A sexy amount of facial hair, you beast! Be glad there's a table between you and I. (all laugh)
Liam: I was a little worried about some performance capture coming up, but it got moved back--
Laura: So you can shave--
Liam: Off to the races.
Matt: Yeah!
Laura: How far are we from 10K?
Travis: I gotta shave tonight.
Crew: 509.
Matt: 509 away.
Laura: All right.
Sam: So, like, tomorrow.
Marisha: Yeah, no.
Matt: We'll see.
Marisha: Tonight.
Matt: All right, so, everyone. As this huge, blue-scaled reptilian-like creature with multiple arms and legs comes skittering down the side of the cliffs, blocking off the entirety of this passage, snarling at you with sharp teeth and this sparking-blue electrical energy jutting out of the corners of its mouth. I want you all to roll initiative.
Marisha: So soon! Which one?
Sam: I add 20 to this, right, that's how it works?
Marisha: Not good.
Laura: Oh no!
Sam: See you guys in--
Marisha: Always cocked!
Travis: I didn't level up! What a dick.
Marisha: Still not great.
Liam: Wait, you did but you didn't, is what you're saying?
Travis: I did, but I didn't.
Liam: Add some hit points!
Laura: Yeah, add your points right now.
Liam: Add some hit points!
Travis: How many do I add?
Marisha: It's like--
Matt: 1d12 plus your constitution modifier!
Laura: 1d12!
Marisha: Barbarian, man!
Liam: Hey, we play D&D!
Laura: Hey, that's good! Plus--
Liam: Plus--
Laura: Whoa! 16 extra health points!
Matt: Whoa, what'd you roll?!
Laura: He rolled an 11 plus five!
Liam: Dang!
Marisha: That's hot.
Matt: That's pretty hot. So many hit points for the barbarian.
Liam: And, if you want, you can just boost to, are you at 12 now?
Travis: What?
Liam: Level 12? Are you at level 12?
Laura: Don't complicate things.
Liam: Just smash, smash, Hulk smash.
Sam: How many spells does he get?
Matt: All of them. All right, so initiatives we have-- 25 to 20, anyone?
Taliesin: 21.
Matt: All right. 20 to 15?
Laura: 19.
Travis: Me too. 16.
Matt: 16? 15 to ten?
Marisha: Ten.
Matt: Ten, Keyleth. Ten to five?
Liam: Eight! I consistently botch this roll.
Sam: See you guys in like an hour. I got a four.
Matt: Scanlan, you have consistently the best initiative rolls.
Sam: Oh, yeah. I save it for when it counts.
Matt: As you should, as you should. So, first up Percy. Instinctively, with your drive towards Whitestone and this creature in your way, you are already ready for this encounter. What are you going to do?
Taliesin: It's bigger than sin, isn't it?
Matt: It is considered a huge creature.
Taliesin: Okay, so, I'm going to alert everybody, get down! And I'm going to take three shots--
Sam: You're just going to start shooting.
Taliesin: Hmm?
Sam: You're just going to start shooting.
Taliesin: I'm just going to-- look at that thing!!
Marisha: Hey, Percy gonna do what Percy gonna do.
Sam: What if you could reason with him?
Laura: He is definitely--
Taliesin: Why doesn't it reason with me, is what I'm asking! It could reason with me!
Liam: There's a lot of heads in the way. Just aim true.
Taliesin: I'm aiming, I'm going to use the Sharpshooter for extra damage.
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: Three pepperbox shots.
Liam: I will be less handsome with one ear, I'm just saying.
Matt: With the minus five.
Taliesin: Yeah, so that's 17.
Matt: 17 hits. Just go ahead and roll the attacks in succession.
Taliesin: Hmm?
Matt: Go ahead and roll the attacks in succession so we know how many hit.
Taliesin: Okay.
Matt: Second shot.
Taliesin: Second one, it hits, 18 plus seven.
Matt: It hits. Third one?
Taliesin: For the third one, I'm going to go for a head shot instead of a Sharpshooter.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: And that's 21.
Matt: Okay, all three hit. Go ahead and roll damage.
Travis: The dark cloud aids his rolls.
Laura: (whispers) Vengeance!
Taliesin: 17.
Matt: 17 damage.
Laura: (whispers) Vengeance!
Taliesin: Better!
Travis: Vengeance!
Taliesin: 25.
Matt: All righty!
Taliesin: That went really well. The last one-- do I do any damage when I hit the head? Normal damage. So, last one is seven points of damage plus he's got--
Matt: Disadvantage on his attacks this round.
Taliesin: Yeah, disadvantage on attacks.
Matt: Gotcha. Do you want to stay where you are, or are you going to move?
Taliesin: Am I touching a wall?
Matt: You're right close to one. You can--
Laura: Stop touching me. Stop touching me.
Taliesin: All right, I'm going to brace against a wall.
Matt: Okay. Brace against that wall, there. Gotcha.
Taliesin: And I'm going to mark all this off.
Matt: All righty. Okay. Next up is the creature.
Laura: Argh.
Matt: (Laughs) Because it rolled really high on its initiative. It's going to go ahead. Let's see, at a movement of 50 feet.
Liam: Oh god.
Laura: (gasps)
Travis: (whispers) Are we in a valley? Or are we--
Laura: We're in a freaking--
Marisha: We're in a death trap.
Liam: It crawled down the wall.
Sam: No, it's going to be fine, guys. We're like a--
Taliesin: We're outdoors.
Sam: The valley is like a taco shell.
Laura: Is it a valley, or is it like those are cliff sides and we could fall?
Matt: It's a valley. The cliff sides go up.
Sam: Yeah, it's like a taco shell and we're the meat.
Travis: Okay.
Laura: Okay.
Marisha: And we're-- Yeah. Yeah. (all laugh)
Matt: You could climb around it without a problem. But it's pretty sheer. You'd have to make climb checks if you want to--
Marisha: Yep, accurate.
Liam: We're in a tight spot.
Laura: Okay. Got it.
Liam: We're in a tight spot.
Marisha: Unless you're in Japan.
Matt: So it scurries forward--
Taliesin: Taco.
Matt: Lowers its jaw and rears its head back. As it does, you see its eyes flare with electrical energy and inside its mouth begins to glow with a brightish blue, white power.
Liam: Get down.
Matt: A bolt of electrical energy comes forward, hitting Grog, Vax, Scanlan, and Percy.
Travis: It's electrifying!
Laura: Electrified.
Matt: Well, let's see. Actually, no, it would move out to-- Hmm, that's only 20 feet, so to get maximum-- This, let's see.
Sam: Maybe it doesn't do math well.
Laura: Don't think about it, just go.
Sam: Maybe it doesn't know math well. Maybe it doesn't move right.
Laura: Don't calculate it, Matt. It's fine.
Matt: No, actually for optimal--
Laura: Fuck.
Matt: --optimal impact here, instead, it's going to go there.
Travis: I have to put my head in its mouth?
Matt: (laughs) Practically.
Liam: (laughs) Eh.
Matt: It will then do it on-- It would be Grog, Vex, and Trinket.
Sam: I approve of that.
Matt: I realized that its bolt is only 20 feet long. So, utilizing its optimal Lightning Bolt length, you guys were clustered together.
Travis: Okay.
Matt: All right, so I need you guys, you three, to roll a dexterity saving throw.
Taliesin: With advantage?
Laura: With advantage because I'm in the mountains?
Matt: You do it with advantage. It only affects attacks, not for saving throws.
Taliesin: Oh, that's right. This is a magic save.
Travis: 19.
Matt: Good to know.
Taliesin: I probably should spend Grit.
Laura: 21.
Matt: All right. And Trinket?
Laura: Argh.
Liam: (Chewbacca sounds)
Laura: (growls) Eight. Yay.
Matt: He got an eight?
Laura: He got a eight.
Matt: Oof, okay. 33 points of lightning damage to both of you.
Laura: (gasps)
Sam: Wait, that means--
Matt: Trinket takes 66.
Sam: 66?
Laura: Trinket's fucking dead, yo.
Sam: What?!
Matt: Unconscious.
Laura: That fast?!
Travis: Which one  dead or unconscious?
Laura: He's unconscious.
Taliesin: Unconscious.
Travis: Don't throw around the "D" word, unless it's the "D" word time.
Matt: So, as there was a crackling of energy forward, you two brace yourself, managing to get mostly out of the way. Unfortunately, both of you dodging out of the way leaves an open shot for bear, that just takes the brunt of it, throwing Trinket up against the side of the actual mountainous cavern. And slumps to the ground, smoking off the fur.
Laura: Does Trinket have to make saving throws?
Matt: Yes.
Liam: Death saving throws? Yes.
Marisha: No one has any resistance, spell resistance?
Matt: Not yet. Until we get to his turn. That will end--
Laura: Ooh, ooh, wait.
Marisha: Forgetting-- Your armor? I've got a spell you're--
Laura: He's only got 42 hit points.
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: Whoa.
Matt: Technically, he should have more from leveling up. But, even more wouldn't be that much higher, so-- Okay, so that's rough. That ends its turn. Vex, you're up first. (all laugh)
Travis: She would like to rage.
Marisha: (as Matt) So that sucks, but--
Laura: Vengeance! Vengeance.
Taliesin: Say your soul is forfeit.
Laura: I'm going to Hunter's Mark him.
Matt: All righty.
Laura: And then I'm going to-- Why is he closer now? Sorry, Grog. I'm going to Hail of Thorns him.
Matt: All righty.
Sam: Grog is always in the way.
Laura: Yeah, well--
Travis: I do need a good back tickle.
Liam: (as Grog) Got an itch back there.
Travis: Yeah. (laughs)
Laura: 30.
Matt: 30 hits.
Laura: No, wait, that's wrong. No, 30.
Matt: 30 hits.
Laura: (sighs) I'm so angry right now! Thorn's d--
Travis: It's not at me for once.
Laura: Ten. (sighs) 3d10.
Taliesin: For once, you're not the one doing damage to the bear.
Travis: That's good.
Laura: 18 plus two is 20.
Marisha: It's a bonus action, so we can do other shit if Scanlan and I both do it.
Laura: What is that?
Travis: 22.
Laura: 22.
Matt: 22 also hits.
Laura: No, that's the attack.
Matt: That's the damage. Okay, gotcha. And Grog, also--
Laura: Oh, yeah.
Matt: Because you're right next to it.
Travis: (posh accent) Would that be considered piercing, bludgeoning, or slashing damage?
Matt: (posh accent) It doesn't matter, you have not taken your turn to rage yet.
Travis: (posh accent) Oh fucking shit. (all laugh)
Matt: That would be full damage upon you, Grog.
Travis: Ow! (laughs)
Laura: Oh shit, I'm sorry. The other one was 27.
Matt: To hit? Okay.
Laura: Awoo. Ten plus--
Sam: Angry d10.
Laura: Plus 15.
Matt: 15. That's including the Hunter's Mark, right?
Laura: Yes.
Matt: All right, good.
Laura: Oh wait, no, I wasn't adding the seven. Wait no, that's a lie. That's a 15, 16, 17, plus five. 21.
Matt: 21, got it. So, as you look over and you see Trinket on the ground, smoldering spire of smoke pouring off of his body--
Laura: Can I pull him? Can I pull him out of the way?
Marisha: Smells like burnt fur.
Sam: Burnt fur.
Laura: Just pull him into the little crevice, for my move.
Matt: This way, do you mean?
Laura: For my move. Is that a move action, or would it be an action-action?
Matt: That would be more of an action-action, unfortunately.
Laura: Ugh. Oh no.
Matt: But you angrily turn around, release your arrow, firing a completely furious Hail of Thorns into the creature. As it hits, it shatters across its hide, some of it scattering onto Grog. You don't even care. You just focus the anger, pull out a second arrow, unleash this one. Actually jamming underneath one of the scales. You can see a little trickle of dark, deep purple blood beginning to pour from the wound.
Laura: I get out of the line.
Matt: Okay, where do you want to go?
Laura: Towards the little crevice.
Matt: Right there?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Did we lose--
Laura: But I still want to be near Trinket.
Matt: Okay. That ends your turn. Grog, you're up.
Travis: Getting ass-lit up with the Hail of Thorns, I go into a rage.
Laura: I'm so sorry.
Matt: (laughs) Okay.
Travis: I go into a Frenzied Rage!
Matt: All righty.
Travis: And I would like to attack three times with my flaming warhammer.
Matt: Certainly.
Liam: No more shopping today.
Travis: That is 24.
Matt: That hits.
Travis: 21?
Matt: That hits.
Travis: Eee! 26.
Matt: That also hits.
Travis: Nice. Those were really good rolls. Okay. First one is 11.
Laura: I think I missed a box.
Travis: 13? First one.
Matt: 13 damage. Good to know.
Taliesin: Brought another sign.
Travis: 14 for the second one.
Marisha: (laughs) Yeah.
Matt: Mm-hm.
Travis: Yes. 17 and 18, 19, 20, 21 plus the fire damage.
Matt: Good to know.
Travis: Including fire damage.
Matt: All right, so, going into the rage, you just see that same fury. You can smell the burnt hair in the air and you use that to fuel that moment of pain. You just (impact sounds) and just start bludgeoning the creature right up in its face. You can see it's thrashing and snarling at you and snapping with each blow. You guys are locked in this titan-versus-human battle right now. Cool, and are you going to stay where you are?
Travis: I'm going to move. Can I move towards you a little bit?
Matt: This way, there?
Travis: Yes, staying next to him, but just out of the way of other projectiles that might be coming up my butthole.
Matt: Fair enough. (laughs) Okay, Grog. Ends your turn. Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: Okay. I'm right next to Trinket, right?
Matt: Mm-hm.
Marisha: Okay, right? Where is Trinket?
Matt: Trinket's right there. You're over here.
Liam: Follow the smell.
Marisha: I'm going to go ahead and go to Trinket.
Laura: (laughs)
Matt: Oh, that's right. Make a death saving throw, by the way.
Sam: Oh, snap.
Matt: Almost forgot.
Laura: (whimpers) Oh no.
Matt: Roll a d20.
Liam: (sings) Roll high.
Marisha: He'll be fine. He'll be fine.
Taliesin: Roll like your bear depends on it.
Travis: You should pick a blood-colored one.
Laura: Why would you do that? He rolled a 19.
Sam: Ooh.
Matt: Okay, so not creeping closer to death yet.
Laura: Don't say that.
Marisha: Okay, I'm going to go ahead and do a Cure Wounds spell on him.
Matt: All right.
Laura: Thank you, Keyleth.
Marisha: I'll just do first level.
Sam: Oh. Trinket's not worth second level?
Marisha: No no no no no. I'll give him a-- shut up, Scanlan. (all laugh)
Liam: Wake him up, wake him up, wake him up.
Marisha: I instantly felt guilty, dick.
Taliesin: You guilted her up to another level.
Marisha: Yeah, you did. Okay.
Travis: (laughs) That was the best.
Sam: I would've done a cantrip.
Marisha: (laughs) That's 2d8 plus ten.
Travis: Dick.
Laura: 2d8 plus ten? That's great. (all laugh)
Travis: Guilted it for an imaginary bear.
Marisha: All right, that's pretty good.
Taliesin: That's not bad.
Marisha: That's an eight and a seven plus ten. So--
Matt: 25.
Sam: 25.
Marisha: 25.
Laura: 25!
Matt: So Trinket's at 25 hit points, conscious.
Laura: That's great!
Matt: Prone, but conscious.
Laura: He licks her.
Matt: You hear the-- okay. (laughs)
Marisha: And then, as a bonus action--
Taliesin: Ack.
Matt: Mm-hm?
Marisha: Can I, looking at whatever the shit this is, pull out my spark stone--
Laura: (gasps)
Marisha: --that I got from my Fire Ashari.
Sam: That's a thing? Oooh.
Matt: Uh-huh.
Marisha: And (shattering sound).
Sam: (gasps)
Taliesin: Oh, wow! We're going there.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Is that, like, "Break glass in case of emergency"?
Marisha: Yeah, I don't know what it does.
Sam: (laughs) Oh, great!
Travis: We'll find out.
Sam: Hope I'm right next to you.
Matt: After you finish healing Trinket--
Laura: Oh my god.
Matt: -- you pull up, reach out, and pull this. And you're going to hold it in your hands, you could feel it's warm to the touch. Almost too hot to hold. And there's this slight pulsing, almost like a heartbeat pulse to it. You hold it in your hands and just crush it, concentrating all your energy on it. As you do, what seemed to be hard and sturdy all of a sudden turns brittle in your fingers, and it cracks and breaks, almost like it was made of a very, very brittle earth. As it breaks and your hands come together, the "too hot to touch" becomes too hot to touch, and for a moment, your hands burst into flames--
Sam: Ah.
Matt: And you instinctively pull back like you want to go ahead and put out the fire--
Marisha: Ow!
Matt: -- but then it falls to a normal temperature again, but the flames remain.
Laura: (gasps)
Matt: And you can now see your hands are now emitting flame from all the fingers.
Sam: Woo.
Laura: Is that permanent?
Sam: What does it do?
Marisha: We'll find out. And I go Minxie.
Matt: All right.
Travis: Yeah, Minxie! (all cheer)
Marisha: And I brought the hood. (all laugh)
Sam: Too hot to handle, too cold to hold.
Liam: That tiger's on fire!
Travis: They in control.
Matt: Keyleth transforms into Minxie! And as Minxie--
Travis: Bobby Brown.
Matt: -- appears, her form transitioning into this large, albino sabre-toothed tiger--
Sam: (sing) Well, I guess we're gonna have to take control.
Taliesin: (sing) Well, I guess we're gonna have to take control.
Matt: You can see both of the tiger's claws embedded into the ground of this rocky terrain are having licks of fire and flame curling off of the actual claws.
Marisha: Hell, yeah. I look like an Ed Hardy tattoo. (all laugh)
Matt: (laughs) I regret everything! (all laugh)
Matt: All right. That's your turn. Are you going to move, are you going to stay there?
Marisha: Well, I moved to Trinket.
Matt: Right, but you can break your movement up.
Marisha: Oh, yeah.
Matt: You've moved 20 feet, so you still have ten more feet to move if you want to.
Marisha: I'll start heading to try and flank him. To flank the blue beastie.
Matt: That should be there. Okay. All right, that ends Keyleth. Now would be Tiberius. Tiberius, who now takes the turn to cast Stoneskin on himself. Then backs up behind this side, there, preparing for the next round. Vax, you're up.
Liam: Okay, Vax drops low. I click the boots of haste together, and for everyone who keeps asking, if I click my boots of haste together, I then get to attack three times. I get that question about three times a week. So that's how I do it. So, I click the boots of haste together, and then I'm going to crouch low and scoot. No, the other side of Minxie, and I should be able to go 60 feet without a problem all the way past the fucker.
Matt: Mm-hm?
Liam: Yeah, keep going, as far as I can. That's as far as I can go?
Matt: Yep.
Liam: All right. And I guess I will just dagger him in the ass, then.
Matt: All right.
Liam: So-- First is a--
Taliesin: I love that die.
Liam: Two, three, 24?
Matt: 24 hits.
Liam: Yes. And this would be Sneak Attack--
Matt: This is with Sneak Attack, yep.
Liam: Because he's with Grog.
Matt: Yep.
Laura: Yeah!
Liam: So, here's the damage for the attack. Ooh. Two, seven, is nine, plus-- Ooh.
Laura: Ooh, oh no.
Liam: This is 13, 17, 19, 20, 26, 31 for the first.
Travis: Jesus.
Liam: Second attack go. Oh, that's not the right die at all. Second attack goes. Same. Eee, 23?
Matt: All right, that hits.
Liam: Okay. And this is--
Matt: Regular damage now.
Liam: Yeah yeah yeah. That's seven?
Matt: Seven, all righty.
Liam: And then the last dagger, the keen dagger, stabs him in the butt again, and that is--
Laura: Ow.
Liam: Ow, 16.
Matt: 16. That does not hit.
Liam: Whiff!
Matt: You actually go with a third one. The first one stabs through, and you can see you've actually hit some sort of an internal organ as you pull back and starts gouting blood. You see that, you stab a second blade in the same area and tend to open the wound another inch, inch and a half. The third one, you pull back, but it slinks around over its shoulder, its long sinewy neck curling over and staring at you. And your blade catches the hide instead and streaks off of the scales.
Liam: Oh, hi.
Matt: That'll end your turn. Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: Do I have to heal Trinket anymore?
Laura: No, he's okay.
Sam: Okay. Then I will-- (laughs) Let's see here. Do we want to get him away from us, or do we want to hurt him? Let's do--
Laura: We want to hurt him!
Sam: Well, I don't hurt things very well. (laughs)
Travis: Do what you're going to do.
Laura: Do what you do.
Taliesin: You hurt feelings.
Marisha: You do you, Scanlan.
Sam: Okay. I'll do some Bigby Hand.
Matt: All righty.
Sam: I summon Bigby's Hand. (sings) Bigby's Hand! (all laugh)
Matt: This giant spectral hand, sparkling arcane energy appears roughly in front of your space.
Sam: It's in front of me. I can't make it go in front of him?
Matt: You can.
Sam: Okay.
Matt: Like, I'm just saying, from a flavor standpoint.
Sam: Okay. Well then, I do one of these, the Sugar Ray Leonard. I do this-- (all laugh)
Sam: And then I throw my other hand forward. (all laugh)
Sam: And I'll just punch him in the face.
Matt: Go for it. (all laugh)
Matt: I like that.
Sam: Right? Because I can do the-- It says huge or smaller creature, at least with Grasping Hand. Is that only-- does that count?
Matt: Right. Oh. You can just punch something with it, no matter its size, to do damage.
Sam: So the Clenched Fisht, Clenched Fist.
Matt: Correct. Correct.
Laura: Clenched Fisht.
Matt: Clenched Fisht.
Sam: Clenched Fisht attack, Money Penny.
Matt: Thish ish the one you're talking about. Yes. All right, so-- For the Clenched Fist, make a melee spell attack. So roll a d20 and add your spell attack modifier.
Sam: (laughs) Nope. (all laugh)
Laura: Oh no.
Sam: 13.
Matt: 13. As the fist swings out, it ducks out of the way. Its serpentine body ducking as the fist arcs off into the middle of the air.
Marisha: Oh.
Matt: Spinning around, preparing itself for a secondary round, hopefully.
Laura: Good try, Scanlan.
Sam: Oh boy. (laughs)
Matt: That's good.
Liam: Vax sees it fly over his head, and watches it pass. (all laugh)
Sam: I'll take a step to my left, so I'm not in the same line of fire as Percy.
Matt: All right.
Sam: And I'll also inspire Grog. (sings) He's Grog, he's Grog, he's big, he's strong, like wood. He's better than bad, he's good. (all laugh)
Laura: That's awesome.
Matt: (sings) Everyone wants a Grog.
Travis: That's amazing. Is that a ten? That's a ten?
Matt: d10, yeah.
Travis: Amazing.
Matt: d10 Inspiration die from the bard.
Travis: Thank you, Scanlan.
Matt: Top of the round again. Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: I'm going to scoot a little bit forward, just into that little crevice. I'm going to take three more shots, just to see what I can do.
Matt: Okay. You have the Sharpshooter feat, right?
Taliesin: With the Sharpshooter feat.
Matt: Okay, so yeah. Because it would have partial cover right now, but you ignore that with the--
Taliesin: I have Sharpshooter, so I can ignore cover.
Matt: Good to know.
Taliesin: Yeah, so. But I'm going to be taking a negative for these hits. Still three attacks per--
Matt: Yeah.
Taliesin: Okay. Just making sure I'm doing this right.
Matt: But you have to reload after this turn.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: Oh no.
Travis: Misfire?
Taliesin: Misfire. (all groan)
Matt: First shot. As you pull up to the side, you pull your pepperbox out and go to fire. As you do, you pull the trigger and the actual barrel sticks out the side. Spins off, and (ping-ping-ping) on the ground.
Travis: Fuck.
Matt: So that's your attack.
Marisha: Balls.
Matt: That's your turn because it'll take you the rest of the turn to collect the Bad News.
Sam: Just say, "Your soul is forfeit," just for coolness. (all laugh)
Taliesin: This normally doesn't happen to me. I don't quite know what-- (all laugh)
Travis: It happens to all guys sometimes. (all laugh)
Taliesin: So can I, at least, use my bonus to pick up the pieces and--
Matt: Yeah.
Taliesin: Okay. I'm going to pick up the pieces and--
Matt: You collect Pepperbox and you pull your back up to it and mutter curses.
Laura: Oh no.
Liam: Make sure you grab your dignity as well.
Taliesin: I'm just going to leave that as an open target for a little while.
Matt: Fair enough. Okay. Now, on its turn--
Sam: Oh shit.
Laura: Oh no.
Matt: First off, let's see here.
Liam: Damn it, attack attack!
Sam: We did great. (laughs)
Matt: But that does not recharge its Lightning Breath. It's going to move here. It's going to go ahead and make two attacks. It's going to turn around and its head that's looking at you, now, after you stabbed it in the back.
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: Reaches down, its giant jaws open. You can see, like, this thick saliva that's coating its fangs, and it, with serpentine speed, bites at you.
Liam: Hey, rogue's Evasion.
Matt: That's going to be a 23 to hit.
Liam: So, Uncanny Dodge, I can dodge for half damage, so it was a what to hit?
Matt: 23.
Liam: 23 hits, but I take half damage.
Matt: All right.
Laura: (as Vax) Half damage.
Matt: So, let's see. That would be--
Liam: Yesh.
Marisha: Does a bite attack--
Liam: Half. Not whole.
Laura: (as Vax) Half damage.
Liam: 152 hit points.
Travis: Stop rolling, Jesus.
Matt: (laughs) It would be 26 damage, so you take 13.
Liam: Ah, nothing.
Laura: Okay, okay.
Taliesin: Ain't nothing.
Laura: Don't say that's nothing.
Matt: Points of piercing damage.
Laura: Don't say that's nothing.
Matt: And then, as it bites, it turns around and its tail begins to snake around your body, Grog.
Laura: (gasps)
Matt: And its whole body begins to try to reach around to constrict and crush you.
Travis: Oh shit.
Laura: What?
Matt: That is a 21 to hit.
Travis: That hits.
Matt: All righty, so. You take 21 points in bludgeoning damage.
Travis: Halved.
Matt: So that'd be 11 points of bludgeoning damage plus 21 points of slashing damage.
Sam: Whoa.
Travis: Halved.
Matt: As well. So a total of 22 damage.
Travis: Okay.
Matt: And you are considered grappled and restrained, currently, as the entire creature begins to wrap around you. And you're currently (sound of struggle). You're trying to hold onto your axe but your whole body's being crushed by this large serpentine creature. (all laugh)
Travis: You piece of shit.
Matt: You feel every pulse of its muscles tensing. As the pain and ache, you can feel muscles and ligaments tearing and popping as it pulls in on you.
Travis: Not cool.
Matt: And it's going to, as part of its grapple, move you with it to there. And it'll end its turn. Vex, you're up.
Laura: Okay. How does the Hide thing work? Do I hide at the beginning of the turn or at the end of the turn?
Matt: At the end of the turn.
Laura: Okay. I'm going to move out.
Matt: Okay, it has a reach of ten. So you are technically within its melee range. So you can run but you'll take attack of opportunity from it if you do. Just so you're aware.
Laura: Can I still arrow it from where I am?
Matt: You can, but you have disadvantage on all your ranged attacks because you are in melee range.
Laura: Does it cancel out because I'm in the mountains?
Matt: Doesn't affect your attacks.
Laura: Damn it.
Matt: Sorry. It's up to you, you can stay where you are and take disadvantage on all your attacks, or you could run past and it gets a free swipe on you. Your call.
Laura: I'm going to try to back up.
Matt: Okay. Over to here? Like, how far?
Laura: Oh no. Wait, I can't see. I forgot my glasses.
Matt: Okay, you're right here.
Laura: Uh-huh.
Matt: You can try and back up this way if you wanted to get away.
Laura: Yeah, I'll try to back up towards, who is that?
Matt: That's Scanlan there. Oh, here?
Laura: Percy? I'll try to back towards Percy.
Matt: Right there?
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: Over here?
Laura: Sure, yeah. Why not?
Matt: Okay, all right.
Sam: What's Trinket doing?
Laura: Well, Trinket's healed, and he's going to come with me.
Matt: Okay. So Trinket gets up and used half its 40 movement. It can move--
Laura: Although he's angry about it, because he wants to fight, but I just won't let him right now.
Matt: Okay, so as you rush away, the creature takes-- Ooh, that's a 26 to hit.
Laura: Aw, Jesus. Really?
Sam: Oh shit, does it hit Trinket, too?
Laura: No, just me.
Marisha: 26.
Laura: Trinket was too far away.
Matt: So you take 18 points of piercing damage. Oh, it's 3d10, sorry.
Laura: Oh. (laughs)
Matt: 19. I rolled a one for damage.
Laura: Oh, yay!
Matt: 19 points of piercing damage as its mouth lashes out, takes a chunk of your shoulder for a second, and you wrench yourself away and keep running.
Laura: Ugh.
Matt: Take the rest of your turn.
Laura: Ugh, okay. I'm going to shoot him.
Matt: Yes, you are.
Laura: Okay. That is 22.
Matt: That hits.
Laura: Okay. 14 for the first hit.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Second one is through the blazing bow, at 22.
Matt: Second one hits, first one misses, or did it hit?
Laura: Oh no, 14 was the damage to it.
Matt: For damage? All right, second one, blazing bow?
Laura: And then, (noises).
Sam: (noises)
Laura: (noises) Ugh. 16.
Matt: 16 damage, all right. Okay.
Laura: Oh, and I hide.
Matt: You currently are completely in its visual range. You have to be behind something to reasonably become hidden.
Laura: I'm hiding behind--
Taliesin: But you are behind me.
Laura: Percy.
Matt: No, behind a person doesn't work. It has to be, like, behind a pillar.
Marisha: Human shield.
Matt: Or in deep shadow.
Laura: (groans) Oh.
Matt: Something that would break your line of sight to it--
Travis: Like me.
Matt: For a moment, to the point where it no longer knows quite where you are.
Marisha: It works.
Taliesin: It totally works.
Laura: I hid in the wrong place.
Sam: Who said that? Who said that?
Laura: I went to the wrong place.
Matt: But now you know.
Laura: It's okay. Next time I know.
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: Putting glass for the dog--
Matt: That's your turn. Grog, you're up.
Travis: I would like to try and break the grapple.
Matt: All right.
Travis: 20.
Matt: 20, yes.
Marisha: I can picture that. Why did you do that?
Matt: Because you are restrained--
Taliesin: Kicking myself.
Matt: Need to check what effect the condition-- Here. Just to be safe. Okay, yeah. Go ahead and you're making an athletics check.
Travis: Natural 20. (all cheer)
Travis: Oh, that was good.
Matt: All right, so--
Travis: I bite its tail.
Marisha: Yeah. (all laugh)
Laura: You can.
Travis: Son of a bitch! Ahhh!
Matt: As your teeth sink into one of its scales and you yank it out with the sheer force of your muscly neck.
Laura: Throw it over my way. I'll catch it.
Matt: It unfurls for a second, you manage to pull yourself out of its grasp.
Travis: I'm so pissed that I broke free, that I would like to use Intimidating Presence on this creature.
Matt: Okay. All right. That is an action to do that, though, isn't it?
Travis: Is it?
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: Yeah.
Travis: I reserve Intimidating Presence--
Matt: For a later time.
Travis: (laughs) -- for a later time.
Matt: But you have a bonus action, still.
Travis: I hit the shit out of it. (all laugh)
Matt: You gain another attack, go for it.
Travis: Okay, 21.
Matt: 21 does hit.
Travis: All right, that's 22. 22! Sorry, 22 hits?
Matt: Also hits. One more.
Travis: Oh, I get one more.
Laura: Ha ha! Also 22.
Travis: Also 22.
Matt: "Hit" meaning--
Sam: You hit once.
Matt: It was one better than your previous--
Travis: Oh, got you.
Matt: You hit once, yeah.
Laura: Oh.
Travis: Just one hit.
Matt: Just one hit.
Sam: Just keep rolling 22s.
Laura: Just keep rolling.
Travis: Nine, ten, 11, 12. 15.
Matt: 15 points.
Travis: With fire damage!
Matt: All right, so, as you pull away, you reach back with your hammer and slam it into its side, causing this giant burst of fire--
Travis: Bitch.
Matt: To emanate from the impact. It shrinks back for a second and (growls).
Travis: You grabbed me. You ask first.
Taliesin: This is a repair die.
Matt: (laughs) All right, Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: I'm going to do my Bite and Claw attacks.
Matt: All right.
Marisha: Yeah, I'm going to move in that crux a little bit more, one more, if I can?
Matt: There? All righty.
Marisha: Beautiful. I'm going to do my claw attacks first.
Matt: Go for it.
Marisha: To see what they-- what it does.
Matt: What was it?
Marisha: It was cocked.
Sam: It was halfway between two.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: So that's 12, plus, it's always different. Okay, 20.
Matt: 20 hits.
Travis: Yeah.
Marisha: I haven't been Minxie in battle for a while, 1d10 plus five.
Laura: Plus your flaming claws.
Travis: (laughs) I love Minxie.
Laura: Don't forget your flaming claws.
Liam: She's got the plan.
Marisha: Yeah, six, so 11 damage for the claws.
Matt: An additional 1d6 fire damage.
Marisha: Plus 1d6, oh wait that's actually-- What did I just say? I said ten, 11? And then an extra 1d6?
Matt: Yes.
Marisha: Ooh, another four, so what did I say?
Sam: 15.
Matt: So, any of your claw attacks or any claw attacks you do in any of your forms now get an additional 1d6 fire damage.
Sam: Nice!
Travis: Hell yeah!
Sam: Nice!
Marisha: Then I'm going to do my bite attack.
Matt: All right, go for it. Your bite does not get the effect.
Laura: I know, it was really loud!
Travis: It was a good one.
Marisha: 16, so plus-- 20, plus my six, plus seven, so 24.
Matt: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage for the bite.
Marisha: Which is 2d6. Eight plus five, so 12.
Matt: Eight plus five is 13.
Marisha: 13, 14! Plus, I get an extra damage for my collar, so 14.
Matt: Right. Cool. So, your flaming claw strikes across its outer body, its legs pull away from the pain as you reach up and bite into the edge of its tail. As its tail tries to whip away, you catch it and it pulls you forward a few feet as you clench down on it. Eventually, it yanks its way out, taking a couple of scales with it, you can see a streak where teeth marks are on the back of its tail.
Marisha: (growls)
Matt: Awesome. Does that end your turn?
Marisha: Yeah.
Travis: Nice, Minxie!
Marisha: (growls)
Matt: Tiberius is going to go around the corner again and is going to cast Telekinesis and send his glaive up spinning.
Laura: Glaive?
Sam: He has a glaive?
Laura: The thing that he killed the old lady with.
Sam: Oh!
Liam: It's the granny grinder!
Marisha: Granny grinder?!
Matt: Granny grinder?!
Travis: So bad.
Matt: Rolls a two, unfortunately, though. Just streaks off and spins back around and then, while it misses the creature and stops, hovering above his head with a slow spin. Sits there curling his fingers, grinning at the creature. And is going to the use of the rest of this movement to go back behind the rock because mama didn't raise no fool. Vax, you're up.
Liam: It's preoccupied, so I just leisurely walk backwards about 30 feet, looking at the same wound that I started before.
Matt: This way?
Liam: No, back up the chasm here. Even further away. Yeah! And I'm just going to throw three daggers into the wound I already hit, so I'm going to do that again. I know that hits because it hit the last time. That's a 23.
Matt: That hits!
Liam: And that's Sneak Attack because he's occupied. That's 11 plus--
Laura: Ooh, those are good!
Liam: 11 plus 17, 21, 26, 29, 34, 39 for the first dagger.
Sam: What, that's just the first dagger?!
Laura: Yeah!
Marisha: Whoa!
Matt: Sneak Attack, man.
Liam: Next one doesn't hit, probably, that's a 17.
Matt: 17 just barely hits.
Liam: Just barely hits, yeah! That is an eight of damage. And just wait a second and go-- and throw it. And because I was such a cock it misses, that's a 16.
Matt: So, oh, perfect! Second dagger wedges in with the second dagger, opening the wound even more. You're like, perfect opening! You go for the third one, and it's grown wise to it, and turns around and rakes its claw out and deflects the dagger midair.
Liam: Vex, look at me! Oh, shit.
Laura: Nice one! Nice!
Matt: That brings us to Scanlan.
Sam: Oh! This is unusual.
Marisha: A turn.
Sam: I still have my Bigby's Hand up, so I do one of these where I say, oh, a wise guy, see? (taunting noises) and I just poke him in the eyes.
Matt: All right, as you say "Wise guy, eh?" as this giant hand's floating in the air, and its head snarls at it and tries to bite at the hand. Go ahead and roll your spell attack.
Sam: 19.
Matt: So, you get to go ahead and--
Sam: 4d8.
Matt: Yeah, 4d8 points of force damage.
Marisha: It's the eyes!
Laura: Into the eyeballs!
Sam: 19.
Matt: 19 points of force damage as you jam both its fingers into the sides of its head. Both of its eyes recoil on it, it reaches out and starts thrashing at the air around as the hand dodges around for a minute.
Sam: I hide behind Trinket, the smell of smoldering fur in my nose. As a bonus action, I will-- who's up next, who's coming soon? Is Percy next?
Taliesin: I'm up next.
Sam: I'll inspire Percy. Just doing this move--
Marisha: Sexy dance.
Sam: Going, pour some Scanlan on you! When you need a hand! That's all I've got.
Taliesin: Ugh!
Sam: And I get closer. Pour some Scanlan on you!
Matt: You begrudgingly take 1d10 inspiration dice from Scanlan.
Travis: Is the creature blinded from the pokey-poke?
Matt: It is not. It is a resilient creature, and the impact was mainly absorbed by the ocular sockets, as opposed to the eyes themselves.
Travis: Hey, I didn't ask for science. Jesus. (all laugh)
Matt: There's bone around-- never mind. All right. It ends Scanlan's turn. Percy, you're up.
Travis: (laughs) Just a little pokey.
Taliesin: All right. I'm going to try and fix this broken piece of gosa.
Sam: Do I lose another spell for that, or is that just the same--?
Matt: No, you can maintain concentration.
Sam: Okay.
Taliesin: I hit a 12, which is just barely enough to fix it.
Matt: Okay. So you take your action to go ahead and repair the gun.
Taliesin: And I'm going to burn an Action Surge, so I'm just-- I finally get it, and it just starts going. And I'm just going to empty out the chamber.
Matt: All right, three shots.
Marisha: (laughs) It just starts going.
Taliesin: Ho, nelly.
Matt: Using your bonus action to reload.
Travis: I got my finger on the trigger, I got my finger on the trigger, gun!
Taliesin: I don't have to reload, yet, I've got six shots, so we're still three in the chamber.
Matt: That's right. We-- yeah, yeah.
Taliesin: Unless you, actually--
Matt: As part of the misfire, you would lose one, so you have two in the chamber right now.
Taliesin: I have two in the chamber?
Matt: Yes.
Taliesin: Okay, so I'll do two, and then use the third one to reload.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Pew, pew.
Laura: (high-pitched) Pew, pew.
Taliesin: All right, so-- Ooh, this'll be fun.
Sam: Don't shoot me.
Taliesin: Sharpshooter shot. That's 22.
Matt: 22 hits.
Travis: Nice.
Taliesin: I'll just take the second shot right now. That's-- really? Really? Really, are we going there?
Laura: Oh, no.
Sam: Did he misfire again?
Marisha: No, you didn't misfire, did you?
Matt: What'd you roll?
Taliesin: Misfired again. I rolled a two.
Laura: No.
Taliesin: I got one shot off.
Matt: You got one shot off. Go ahead and roll damage. Sharpshooter damage, so it gets the plus ten damage.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Marisha: That's fun.
Laura: Could you have added inspiration dice to that?
Taliesin: To a misfire? No.
Matt: No, misfire still hits. There is a lot of strengths to the gunslinger. This is the one penalty, is if you roll bad.
Taliesin: So that's, okay, at least this is a badass, as I at least did some damage. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 24 damage, plus four points of fire damage.
Matt: Nice. Okay. So, as you go, and you fix it-- It takes the first shot, with a burst of flame that shoots out the front of the barrel. The second shot, this time, the actual metal in the front arcs upward, and it looks like this is going to take a moment, to really seriously repair it. Pepperbox is coming through pretty rough in this fight.
Laura: Oh, no. Oh no.
Matt: So that's your turn.
Travis: But not as rough as Stitch over there, huh?
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: We're in a group.
Matt: Yeah. (laughs) The creature does regain use of its Lightning Breath.
Liam: Right.
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: Oh, I was about to say, and--
Matt: So you wanna move anywhere?
Taliesin: Yeah, I wanna get a little further back. I wanna roll to the other side of the cave again, if possible.
Matt: Which way? You mean over here?
Taliesin: Yeah. Like, see that little outcropping of rock?
Matt: Right here?
Taliesin: Further back. Like that over there.
Marisha: That little chunky thing?
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Smart move, Percy.
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: That thing scares me.
Laura: Why are you abandoning me?
Matt: Okay. That ends Percy's turn.
Taliesin: The beast.
Marisha: I don't like the dice that I have.
Travis: Don't think too hard.
Taliesin: That's not good.
Sam: No.
Laura: It just burps out lightning.
Travis: Jesus, I don't think we've ever seen anything this hard.
Laura: I know.
Liam: Guys, guys.
Sam: What is he doing?
Liam: Guys.
Marisha: Have you seen anything like it?
Sam: What is he doing?
Liam: Guys.
Laura: He's thinking.
Liam: Guys.
Sam: We broke the DM.
Laura: I know.
Travis: You know the silence before the storm?
Matt: Considering optimal--
Laura: This is bad.
Liam: He erupts.
Travis: He hasn't said anything.
Matt: All right. So. (all groan)
Marisha: You stared at that for a really long time.
Sam: Here comes the other three.
Travis: Here comes the boom?
Matt: So, this behir is going to shift back here. You get an attack of opportunity on it, Keyleth. So go ahead and take a swing.
Liam: Burn it.
Sam: Fire slap!
Marisha: So. 16.
Matt: 16 just misses. It gets right out of your grasp. The flames just lick across the outside of its scales. As it pulls back, rears down right in your face, Godzilla-style, just unleashes a burst of electrical energy.
Laura: Oh, God. Dodge it. Dodge it.
Matt: It hits you and Keyleth. I need you guys to both make dexterity saving throws.
Sam: With inspiration.
Marisha: Who, me and Grog? Okay.
Sam: With inspiration.
Travis: I don't need it.
Sam: Okay.
Marisha: Dexterity saves? That's not good.
Travis: 19.
Marisha: Four.
Matt: 33 points of lightning damage to you, Grog. 66 to you.
Travis: Can I use my Stone's Endurance?
Matt: You can.
Travis: Okay.
Taliesin: What?!
Matt: What's the maximum health of Minxie's form?
Marisha: Looking-- I'm out.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: I'm now in Keyleth form.
Matt: And how much damage goes over?
Marisha: Not that many, thank God. 12.
Matt: 12. Okay, so you-- As Minxie all of a sudden gets blasted, you can see the form shrink down to Keyleth's crumpled form on the ground, hands still flaming, little bit of singe to the back of her hair, and stands back up.
Taliesin: I'll take that. I'll take that. (all laugh)
Laura: Oh no!
Matt: That'll end its turn. Vex, you're up.
Marisha: That felt like Shockwave.
Laura: Oh, God. Can I, as a bonus action, give Trinket a healing potion?
Matt: You can-- that would be more of an action to feed it to something else.
Laura: Okay, never mind. I am going to attack it.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Okay. He's, oh, I missed. That's a 14.
Matt: A 14 does not hit, unfortunately. The first arrow just ricochets and shatters across the part of its body.
Laura: Great. Good times, good times. 16. Both miss. Fucking A. What a waste.
Matt: Both arrows just explode across its hide. It's too thick.
Laura: This dice is out for the rest of the game. I'm gonna run. Is there an outcropping where we are? I can't see.
Matt: Right here, a little bit. If you pull fully in on this side from where it--
Laura: I'm going to pull fully in on that side.
Matt: Okay. Don't forget your laser pointers, by the way, guys. It's good for letting me know exactly where you want to go.
Laura: I can't see.
Matt: I know. Just so you know. And Trinket's going to stay there?
Laura: He's gonna rest. And he's going to keep protecting Scanlan, because--
Matt: All right. Trinket's gonna stay right there, guarding the giant gnome.
Sam: Oh, thank you. Giant gnome?
Matt: Giant hand, small gnome. Grog, you're up.
Travis: (yells) I try and match the Godzilla roar, it's not really as good, and I swing three times with my fire hammer.
Matt: Go for it.
Travis: That's a 18.
Matt: 18. That hits.
Travis: 21.
Matt: 21 hits.
Travis: And 19.
Matt: 19 hits. Roll damage.
Laura: Yeah, yeah.
Travis: That anus! That's 13.
Laura: Eee, good.
Travis: 23, and 22.
Matt: All righty. How do you want to do this? (all yell)
Taliesin: But you never said he looked a little rough! I kept waiting for you to say it's looking a little rough.
Matt: It's hard to tell with this entity.
Taliesin: Damn it!
Matt: It's moving so fast.
Travis: I'd like to reach up with my firebrand warhammer.
Sam: Yes!
Travis: And I would like to smash it on top of its skull, and when it hits the ground, I'd just like to keep turning it into jelly and paste and sweet jams that I can bottle it up and sell later!
Matt: You guys watch this continuous barrage, this horrible bludgeoning. Every impact almost quakes the inside of this valley. Rocks are beginning to tumble and fall around it. And you can see, as each horrible, sickening smack, its head just collapses more and more. The mush begins to spill out from under it, this giant pool of, like, dark violet liquid and gelatinous mush that was once the inside of its head, begin to just grow around it as Grog just keeps hitting and hitting and hitting and hitting and hitting and hitting--
Marisha: Grog? Grog?
Matt: And hitting and hitting--
Laura: Grog?
Sam: I use Bigby's Hand to stop the hammer.
Laura: Maybe you unrage. Lullaby, Hulk. Lullaby.
Sam: It's over. It's over.
Marisha: Lullaby?!
Travis: Lullaby?!
Sam: Think of the beard.
Travis: What happened?
Taliesin: Well.
Laura: You killed it real good!
Travis: Oh, look, we made jelly.
Marisha: Speaking of jelly, I would like to go ahead and do a nature check to see if I can salvage some goods from whatever.
Laura: I run, I walk up to it and kick it, and say, that's for Trinket. Dick.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: Can I roll a hit dice to recover some--
Matt: If you guys want to take a short rest, you can.
Travis: Oh.
Laura: That'd be great.
Taliesin: Yes! I would like to fix my gun. Just a giant pile of tools.
Laura: Do we need to hide? Do we need to climb up to its little cave that it was in, maybe? And hide.
Sam: Did it have a cave?
Travis: Was it in a cave?
Laura: It had a cave. Didn't it come out of a cave, when we saw it?
Matt: You saw it was up on a higher platform, you didn't see a cavern, or anything.
Laura: Oh, I thought it was a cave.
Marisha: I rolled a 21 to collect goods.
Matt: Okay, looking through the book that you have. You eventually take a while to look while you guys are having your short rest. You can use your hit dice to heal yourself. It is known as a behir.
Sam: A behir?
Matt: B-E-H-I-R.
Marisha: B-E-H-I-R.
Taliesin: Behir.
Travis: Be here.
Laura: Be here right now. Be present.
Matt: Behir. There are two things. Anything in the face and teeth are gone. They are just mush. The entire head is destroyed.
Marisha: Sure.
Matt: The the two things in the book that are worthwhile, like, really worth money, are some of its hide can be repurposed for, you know, like, lightning resist-based armor, but currently it's unknown who has the speciality to actually work with that material. These creatures are difficult to harvest and a lot of their locations are unknown. A lot of them were hunted down for that long ago and almost thought to have gone extinct. (all groan)
Matt: However, yes, you don't know anybody, possibly Karin in Emon. The hide can be harvested. There is also a gland in its throat that it uses to charge its Lightning Breath.
Taliesin: I'd like that.
Marisha: I'd like that.
Matt: Go ahead and roll for the hide first, if you guys want to go for that.
Laura: Can I stealth and climb up and see if I can see a cavern?
Matt: Sure.
Laura: A little cave.
Marisha: Natural 20!
Travis: Oh snap!
Laura: Yeah!
Travis: I'll take it.
Sam: She gets advantage because mountains are her favorite terrain.
Laura: What do I add to that?
Matt: This would be, add your--
Laura: Acrobatics?
Matt: For climb, this would be athletics.
Laura: Athletics. Oh, really? That's not what it was; I moved it.
Liam: It was 14, I saw it.
Laura: Oh no, 12.
Matt: It takes you a little bit to get up there. It's steep, you slide down a few times. But eventually, because there's no immediate threat, you're given time to get up onto this upper platform. You can see that there are these various parts of the rock that jut outward, that have some short term passageways that this creature uses.
Laura: I'm so weak, but I'm holding to see if I see a cave.
Matt: (laughs) Roll a perception check.
Laura: (groans)
Matt: Once you're up there. You take time and with help from some other folks, you manage to harvest, I'd say about ten pounds worth of scales at most. It's not a whole lot. A lot of it has been torn and destroyed from the impact and damage you guys did. Parts of it are not really armory functional, but you manage to get enough to maybe make one set if somebody manages to work really well with it.
Marisha: Here, Grog, bag of holding.
Laura: 23.
Matt: 23? Currently, you have no eye shot on any particular--
Sam: Don't eat it, Grog.
Matt: -- tunnels. Nothing that resembles an abode or a cavern from this position.
Taliesin: Lick it.
Laura: (groans)
Liam: I see my sister's struggling.
Laura: Oh god it hurts.
Liam: I climb up next to her.
Laura: You're almost as weak as I am, dude.
Liam: Yeah.
Laura: Here we go.
Liam: Acrobatics? What is it?
Matt: Athletics.
Laura: Athletics.
Travis: Athletics.
Liam: Athletics? Oh, shit. Acrobatics would have been much better.
Travis: Oh yeah, c'mon.
Laura: I know, I don't think so.
Liam: Can I flip up there?
Matt: Eh, it doesn't work like that.
Liam: No, no-- (all laugh)
Travis: No, I can't.
Liam: Wait, I'll use Luck. I'll do it again to get--
Matt: Go for it.
Travis: You're going to use one of your Lucks?
Liam: -- to get past that one.
Laura: No, we were about to rest. Wow.
Liam: Oh, no, I didn't.
Laura: Oh, really, you rolled worse than me.
Liam: Oh no, my fingernail, that really stings. Damn it.
Matt: The twins give a--
Marisha: Just terrible.
Matt: -- terrible display of rock climbing in the middle of this.
Travis: I laugh heartily.
Taliesin: Parkour! Parkour!
Matt: Go ahead and roll for the glands.
Marisha: The glands?
Liam: Stupid video game moment of like jump, jump, jump, jump.
Laura: Like Skyrim trying to get--
Marisha: Glands? 18 is not bad. I'll take that 18 for a 28. Hey, Vax, can I see your dagger?
Liam: Yeah, here you go.
Sam: He's up a hill.
Laura: Nice. We didn't even get up a little bit.
Matt: It takes most of your short rest. You will not be able to use your hit dice for healing on this, because you spend your time harvesting instead. But you manage to-- thankfully, the damage that Grog had inflicted upon its head destroyed most of its matter, right up to the throat gland which is mostly untouched. It's salvageable. You don't know how much it's worth. Probably a decent amount, as the book says that they're rare. Especially to find intact.
Travis: That Grog, what a dick.
Taliesin: We have jars. I'm going to put that into the jar and put it away.
Travis: There's not even like a tooth. Like one broken tooth? A piece?
Matt: You did a number on that one's face.
Travis: When Grog goes to work. LIAM Boom. Kill the behir, take its glands, money.
Taliesin: I may have something I can do with this actually.
Travis: With what, the gland?
Taliesin: Yes.
Marisha: Maybe, yes. (electricity noises)
Taliesin: You're very clever, yes. We'll work on that.
Travis: Hello? I don't speak your language.
Matt: You place it within a preservation jar.
Taliesin: Yes.
Matt: Back in the bag of holding?
Taliesin: Back in the bag of holding.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: I'm going to try and fix this mess, for a minute.
Matt: Go ahead and make your check.
Taliesin: 18.
Matt: 18. It does cost you half the--
Taliesin: It wasn't a dual fail.
Matt: Oh right, just a single fail. It was a dual fail, but it was separate.
Taliesin: Yes.
Matt: You take some time with it during the short rest to tinker with it. You manage to bend the metal back in place. Test it for a bit. Make sure the aspects that move move smoothly as they should. Eventually, you get pretty confident that it is back to a functional piece of weaponry. All right, so, as you guys finish this rest--
Travis: I'm rolling one more hit dice.
Matt: Go for it. The sky is starting to get a little bit into the orangish color. Though you can not see the sun from its current location, you gather you have about an hour and a half or so before full sundown.
Sam: Let's get out of this little taco in case that was the daughter of something else.
Matt: Wait, you guys stayed the night-- never mind, in the cavern. So actually, no, I take that back.
Sam: Oh?
Matt: I just realized you guys stayed the night last time over on the seaside cavern and walked here--
Travis: That's right.
Matt: -- and it only took you a few hours to get here. So, no, it'd be about mid-day noon.
Travis: Okay.
Matt: So, I take that back. Never mind.
Liam: Ah.
Sam: We should still go.
Matt: Can see the sun, it is straight above.
Taliesin: We should still get out of the taco.
Matt: There is some cloud cover coming in.
Travis: Definitely should still leave.
Matt: From the north side, it doesn't look like anything too dense.
Marisha: Percy?
Taliesin: Yes?
Marisha: Do you know how much longer we need to continue on this path?
Taliesin: Honestly, I've never taken this road before. This is further east than I've ever come.
Marisha: Can we see how far ahead-- does it look like it goes on for a while, this chasm?
Matt: It moves around, so it's hard to get to much of a visual of the--
Taliesin: The geology starting to look familiar?
Laura: Does my tracking tell me anything?
Matt: You can go ahead and make a nature check.
Liam: For all of this, I'd like to--
Matt: With advantage.
Liam: -- walk about 40 feet in front of everyone and creep along.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: 17.
Liam: Cloak up.
Matt: Make a stealth check.
Sam: He's a weird loner, that guy.
Travis: He is.
Liam: It's my job.
Matt: Make a stealth check. The mountains here got its name for the white stone mountains. The rock--
Taliesin: It's starting to look like home, though?
Matt: Yeah. The mountain range here is a large part of the material that is mined, well, was mined beneath the-- It's very rare white quartz-like rock that is used for many purposes. And it's generally only found in this mountain range. It's what a lot of the Whitestone's original economy was based on.
Liam: 22.
Matt: 22, good to know. All right, so.
Laura: 17 on nature.
Matt: Okay. I mean, you gather the same thing. The rock formations here match the same as the coastal mountains. The mountain here is all made of the same material, few deposits here and there of just normal bits of granite and other forms of simple stone.
Laura: Granite.
Sam: Oh.
Laura: Simple stone. (all laugh)
Travis: That was so much better than shopping. (all laugh)
Matt: As you guys are pressing forward, at this point, you guys are taking your time waiting and Tiberius is getting impatient, and is crossing his arms. "I feel like I should have gotten more materials. I don't think I'm quite prepared enough for this."
Laura: What? Tiberius, you prepared a lot.
Liam: Tibs.
Matt: "Not enough. Never enough".
Liam: You brought along a sack of mirrors, I think you've got enough. What do you need?
Matt: "I have an idea. I'll be back in a few days."
All: What, no?
Sam: Don't leave.
Matt: He sits down and starts making his teleportation circle.
Laura: No, no, we need that!
Liam: Tiberius.
Laura: We need that.
Liam: Tiberius.
Laura: We need that. Tiberius.
Liam: You are a heavy hitter, we don't know where we're going, what we're doing. He's strong. You're strong, in a way, maybe hang out a little bit longer.
Laura: He's actually got a lot of hit points, really.
Travis: Yeah, he's got a lot.
Matt: (laughs)
Liam: More than I do. You're stronger in frame than I am. Sure you want to go?
Matt: Tiberius leans in and whispers to you in a strange tongue and it sparks in your ear somewhere. (whispers) "The player's not here and the DM's trying to not make it too complicated for him to keep track of an additional character for this session." (all laugh)
Laura: I understand that.
Liam: (whispers) I know, but I'm just trying to give you a hard time. (all laugh)
Matt: I'll remember that.
Laura: Oh, no.
Taliesin: I grab Lockheed and we hold him hostage. (all laugh)
Marisha: You can't leave! (all laugh)
Laura: We need you.
Matt: "Don't worry, I'll be back soon and now I know how to find you."
Liam: (whispers) Send an iPad with Pike on it. (all laugh)
Matt: He finishes his teleportation circle and with a whoosh, with a flash, vanishes.
Laura: Shit. Really, Tiberius, really?
Marisha: He does that a lot.
Sam: It's very much in his character.
Laura: (groans)
Travis: Where'd Tiberius go?
Liam: He went to get an army, I think.
Laura: (groans)
Travis: That's fine.
Taliesin: Or more mirrors.
Marisha: It might be more mirrors.
Taliesin: Or an army with mirrors.
Marisha: An army with mirrors.
Liam: I can do magic. I do this great coin trick thing where I flip it on my thumb and then it lands in my hand.
Laura: And then, you pull it--
Liam: That's the end of it.
Laura: -- out of someone's ear.
Liam: It's right here.
Laura: Whoa!
Travis: We start walking.
Marisha: That's fun.
Taliesin: Yeah, no, I'm walking.
Matt: Progressing forward--
Marisha: It's a start.
Matt: -- you begin to--
Travis: Jauntily stealth ahead.
Liam: 40 feet out, yeah.
Travis: Like a beagle.
Laura: I keep a perception out to see anything.
Taliesin: I'm keeping an eye open for anything familiar.
Sam: Can I just bump into Vex and ask her to maybe scan ahead for dragons?
Laura: What do you think I'm doing?
Sam: Dragons, though. Six miles.
Laura: I'm scanning.
Sam: Don't you have six miles of dragons or something? Thank you.
Taliesin: Do you have to do the hands?
Travis: Is that your scanning face?
Matt: It's good to help out in the--
Laura: I'm thinking.
Sam: Six miles of dragons.
Laura: I'm wanting to see if I see any dragons. Do I see any dragons?
Travis: I thought you did a different technique last time.
Matt: You take a moment and anticipate the circumstance, and there is, within-- what's the distance on it?
All: Six miles.
Matt: Six miles?
Liam: Yeah, man.
Matt: You ascertain that there are quite a few sources of life in this vicinity, of some sort of dragon kin or dragon-like entity.
Laura: Was the behir a dragony sort of thing?
Matt: No. Technically not, from what you can gather, but you do gather there are a few blips that are three miles off north, at the center of the mountain range. You don't know how big or how dangerous, but you sense there are some dragon or dragon kin sources.
Laura: There's a dragony something.
Sam: Could be dragon eggs.
Marisha: Dragonborn?
Laura: I don't know, Scanlan.
Marisha: You're not picking up Tiberius six miles away?
Laura: There's dragony things, though.
Sam: Listen. When I poo somewhere, I can see everything.
Laura: I didn't poo. I'm sensing with my mind.
Travis: Listen, if we do run across a dragon, remember we have the dragon slayer longsword, which is a plus one to attack and damage rolls, and if you hit a dragon or a dragon creature, it gets an extra 3d6 of damage.
Laura: What are you reading? How did you even know that?
Taliesin: That's the most complicated sentence I think I've ever heard you speak.
Travis: Sorry, I blacked out for a little bit. (all laugh)
Taliesin: Nothing.
Laura: Nothing. You're good, Grog.
Travis: What do you have to do to attunement?
Matt: Attunement, you take a short rest with the weapon, learning its properties.
Travis: Caressing it?
Matt: Essentially. Stroking it, making sure it feels comfortable.
Taliesin: Buying it dinner.
Matt: Nice spread so it feels welcome.
Travis: That's more than I usually do.
Laura: Maybe a steak, some salad. Shrimp cocktail.
Travis: Just in case you need a sword.
Liam: As we progress, I say into my earring, Scanlan, I've seen some of the logs she's left behind. They're not small.
Laura: (gasps) You are seriously. What?
Taliesin: Wow.
Laura: That's disgusting.
Travis: I missed it. It must be good, though.
Sam: She usually buries them quite well.
Laura: Really gross, both of you. Enough.
Liam: They don't sense anything.
Sam: All right.
Taliesin: Well, we're not heading north.
Sam: We're not?
Matt: You guys are heading eastish.
Taliesin: Westish. We're heading westish.
Laura: Nothing that I can sense.
Travis: Can we keep walking?
Matt: You guys came up on the eastern side-- sorry, the western side of the mountains. You're now heading eastward.
Taliesin: Oh, we came up on the western side of the mountains?
Laura: There's nothing that we're going to run across.
Liam: Just flip that.
Marisha: Western side of the mountains?
Taliesin: Western side of the mountains? So Whitestone's to the east?
Matt: Whitestone would be to the east of you guys.
Taliesin: Oh, okay. I thought we went up the eastern side of the mountains. I'm so confused. You wouldn't think I'd lived here before.
Matt: That would have brought you through the forest, and you were trying to avoid that. That's what I thought you said last time.
Taliesin: No, that's very true. Oh, god.
Travis: West side's on the shore side, right? Ocean's there?
Matt: There's a giant peninsula to the north. Either side would have been coast.
Laura: So we're not going to run into any dragons?
Sam: At least we're not going north.
Matt: You're aware that they're not anywhere close to you to currently be an issue, no.
Laura: Okay, we're fine.
Taliesin: In two or three miles, we'll take another check.
Laura: Yeah.
Travis: (laughs) He winked at me!
Matt: All right, so.
Travis: It's like being blessed.
Sam: We're going to just keep going towards the town.
Matt: You guys press on, following this winding path that narrows at certain points and then widens for a bit. You come across, partway through, the twins at the front notice, around the edges as it begins to descend down into the beginning of the valley descent, you see an edge of the mountain that looks more angular than the usual natural formations of it. It almost looks like it comes to a point, like a very sharp edge, and a smooth side.
Liam: I'm not sure I understand. We see a drop-off?
Matt: It begins to descend towards the valley, and on the side of one of the giant--
Travis: Chasms?
Matt: Chasm you guys are at the bottom of. You see an outcropping ahead that's angular and pointed.
Sam: Like, designed by man?
Matt: Like it was sculpted, constructed.
Travis: That might have sentries.
Liam: Some sort of outlook or something. Something that was not formed by nature here.
Taliesin: Do I know what this is?
Matt: You--
Taliesin: History check?
Matt: I'd say, make an intelligence check. Roll and add your intelligence modifier.
Travis: I could do it with you, if you want.
Matt: You can make a history check. You know many things that exist here in the mountains, but at this distance, you don't see enough of it to actually--
Laura: (shocked noise)
Travis: He's not going to let me do it.
Laura: He rolled a natural 20.
Matt: For?
Travis: An intelligence check, because I'm an idiot.
Sam: He doesn't know the--
Taliesin: I kind of want Grog to speak truth right here.
Laura: He's an expert on mountains.
Matt: Actually, this works out interestingly. As you guys are walking forward and you're seeing this, and you're keeping back, Grog, you instinctively look over and go, oh. That's a stone giant fortress.
All: Oh!
Marisha: Shut up!
Travis: (laughs) I did something smart! (all laugh)
Matt: With your bloodline and knowing where you come from, and you've had a few close encounters in the Cliffkeep Mountains with a few of this kind, you've seen a few fortresses, and from the details of it, the way of the roof, and the scope of its design, and the way the mountain range lends itself to that type of topography, yeah. This is obviously a stone giant fortress.
Travis: Oh, and I drank some of that nasty dank in the fight with the Hammer, round two.
Sam: Wait, should we-- those are bad guys, right?
Travis: Yeah, that's bad.
Sam: We should not go that way.
Laura: We should definitely stay away from that.
Travis: Maybe go up on the other side of the chasm opposite of it?
Matt: Or you can move around the side, you're welcome to.
Laura: Maybe hide and make sure we're hidey-hidey?
Sam: We could stealth through it, we could invisible through it.
Marisha: Pass Without a Trace.
Travis: Pass Without a Trace.
Laura: I have Pass Without a Trace.
Travis: And climb along the opposite side.
Laura: And do we have invisibil--oh, no.
Taliesin: No, we don't, no.
Laura: You have--
Sam: I have some invisibility. Not great, though.
Travis: I have dust of tracelessness.
Laura: Maybe we'll stealth it.
Liam: Can I hide Scanlan under my cloak? Can he use his invisibility on someone else?
Matt: If he was to cast Invisibility on you--
Liam: No, on somebody else, so I'd just hide him.
Travis: What about one of those things that always works on me--
Matt: You could--
Travis: -- a diversion?
Matt: You would move very slow and you would have disadvantage on your stealth checks because you guys don't have a way to move quietly.
Liam: All right, all right.
Laura: No, I don't want to bring any attention.
Marisha: I could create a diversion.
Sam: What kind?
Laura: Like what?
Marisha: I mean, I could-- What's nearby? Is anything nearby? Any animals? Have we seen any wildlife?
Matt: There have been birds that fly through, an occasional harpy, in the distance you hear screeching and you guys keep quiet until it vanishes and disappears. (screech in the background music)
Taliesin: Wow.
Travis: That was perfect timing!
Laura: How'd that happen? How did that frickin' happen?
Travis: His ways are mysterious, my love.
Laura: You are magic.
Matt: I am lucky.
Taliesin: Holy cow.
Matt: What were some seafaring like seagulls and various coastal birds have slowly been disappearing and turning into more eagles and hawks, things that eat small rodents, more of a lush side of the hill. You see as you get closer to the valley itself that the actual forest that surrounds Whitestone is more and more of these birds of prey are beginning to show up. Other than that, you see very few small things other than occasional lizards about that big in your hand that live on hot rocks.
Taliesin: Should we observe this encampment for a bit, just to see what's happening as we slowly make our way around it?
Laura: Can we see any kind of movement? It's really far away, or--?
Travis: Couldn't hurt.
Matt: It's still a ways away right now, you're just catching the edge of it.
Sam: Are we a mile away? A thousand feet away?
Matt: I'd say you're about a good 600, 700 feet from it.
Liam: That's not that far.
Travis: You know, we could try to work our way up the opposite side of the chasm.
Taliesin: That would also allow us a good view of it as well.
Marisha: I happen to have Hallucinatory Terrain right now.
Sam: What does that even mean?
Marisha: It means exactly what it sounds like.
Sam: I don't speak your language.
Marisha: I can make terrain that's not real.
Liam: Do you remember when we psyched out the duergar--
Sam: It would block their view of us maybe? Perhaps?
Laura: Is it movable?
Travis: Yeah, it can't move with us.
Marisha: It could block their view of us.
Liam: Can you make some shrubs to come along with us?
Matt: You guys actually used it previously to camp for a night along a cliffside.
Laura: Right.
Matt: And made the cliff extend further than it was.
Liam: Yeah, we lured a bunch of duergar into a chasm that the ground extended over.
Laura: Let's try to climb up the other side and then see what we can see.
Marisha: I mean, I can do a lot of things, I can make a thunderstorm, I can make a sleet storm.
Sam: That would keep them in their fortress.
Travis: Could you make it fire?
Marisha: I could.
Taliesin: Or very cold if they came out.
Laura: They like cold.
Taliesin: Oh, yes.
Marisha: I could, I could make a big storm.
Travis: We're also on a chasm, so if it gets wet and slippery and muddy we might all go down.
Taliesin: That's true.
Laura: Maybe get up at the top of it and then do this.
Taliesin: I like the plan of going up the other side of the chasm.
Laura: Can we try to climb the other side?
Matt: Certainly.
Liam: Giants like to throw fucking boulders.
Laura: Yeah, I don't wanna be down on the bottom.
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: As you guys make your way up the other side, you're helping each other, I want everyone to go ahead and make an athletics check.
Sam: I put on my climbing gear, which I definitely own.
Marisha: An athletics check?
Matt: Okay, giving you advantage on your athletics check.
Laura: I actually own climbing gear too, does that help?
Matt: That would help you, yes.
Laura: Okay.
Travis: I have mine too, so I'll put that on as well.
Marisha: I don't know if I have climbing--
Taliesin: I don't know if I have climbing gear.
Travis: Attached to a rope and a grappling hook that's in my hand.
Sam: And it was the same. (laughs)
Matt: All right. So.
Sam: What am I doing? Adding what?
Travis: Fuck yeah! Nipple tits.
Matt: You have advantage, you add your strength modifier. Or your athletics is what it would be.
Sam: Athletics.
Laura: Do we add anything because of the climbing gear or is it?
Matt: You get advantage because of the climbing gear.
Laura: Ah, that's important.
Travis: 26.
Matt: 26.
Liam: We were all using climbing gear or just--
Matt: No, those who have it.
Laura: I give you my climbing gear because I already get advantage. How about that? Does that count? No.
Matt: Because it is mountain? All right, I'll let you do that.
Laura: All right.
Liam: All right, well, I got 19.
Matt: 19.
Laura: Oh, so you don't need that.
Liam: Yes I do, I need it.
Sam: 11.
Travis: 26.
Matt: 26. Vex, what did you get?
Laura: I got 15.
Marisha: 11.
Taliesin: 19.
Matt: Okay. A couple of missteps and almost sliding, Keyleth, at one point, you grasp her by the hand and Grog pulls her back up onto the platform.
Travis: No, no, up here.
Marisha: Thanks, Grog.
Matt: Over time, you guys make your way along this very rocky and precarious, anywhere from five to three to two feet in width, sometimes even lesser than that and you guys are having to shimmy across. You make your way around and you can see this large fortress that is built out of extremely large and in-place stones and stonework. It looks ancient. For size-wise, it's two stories for a giant, which means it's probably close to six or seven stories of height.
Laura: Whoa.
Matt: Built into the side of a mountain, and it goes down almost like two giant steps. It's built on essentially where the giant bowl, the caldera if you will, of where this valley of this mountain range would be. It's built on the inside of it, so it's actually constructed, as you continue to descend into the valley. Looking at it, you can see openings, windows, there are areas up top where you see giant piles of rocks and boulders that are used for anti-siege, for throwing off the top, stockpiles of that. You do see boulders around the ground that may have been thrown and not picked up. Everyone make a perception check.
Laura: I feel-- (whispers) Should I say?
Liam: (whispers) I'm not gonna tell you.
Taliesin: That's an intimidation check.
Laura: How did Trinket get up the cavern?
Matt: Hm?
Laura: Can Trinket climb?
Matt: Trinket--
Taliesin: Bears climb!
Marisha: Bears are good climbers.
Laura: They're good climbers?
Taliesin: They can get up a tree.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: Roll an athletics check with disadvantage.
Sam: Disadvantage.
Laura: I'm sorry! But it felt wrong to lie.
Matt: Rangers.
Sam: Of course. It's an honor system.
Liam: Could I have given the climbing gear to Trinket?
Laura: No.
Travis: No. (all laugh)
Taliesin: You could've, it just would've been adorable.
Laura: But we could tie the rope around Trinket's waist.
Matt: Roll your dice.
Laura: With an athletics check?
Matt: Yes.
Laura: Does he get an advantage because of mountains?
Marisha: I love that he says 'roll your dice' like it matters.
Matt: Nope. He gets disadvantage because he's a big bear.
Travis: I told her not to say it, why'd you say it?
Laura: I'm just trying to be honest!
Matt: Which is appreciated.
Laura: Strength modifier? He got a 15, too.
Matt: Okay. It's been difficult, and it slowed your guys' progression, but you've managed to keep Trinket along with you; this large bear is now like pushing against the side. He's managed to keep up, but it's been a harrowing experience.
Liam: I've been behind him the whole time, pushing on his buttocks.
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: You got this buddy, you got this.
Matt: So, once again, perception rolls.
Laura: Sorry. Yes.
Taliesin: 20.
Marisha: 19.
Sam: 17.
Liam: Can I use passive perception?
Matt: This is active actually looking for something; the passive is more--
Liam: Well then, I get-- 26.
Travis: 15.
Laura: 19.
Matt: All right. You got 26, you said?
Liam: Yep.
Matt: Looking from this distance, and keeping the best visual you can see, there is no movement, at all, from the interior of the fortress. The two front doors, you see these two large stone doors that are the entrance to it. One of the doors is actually broken in half and left partially ajar and open.
Travis: We gotta go in now.
Laura: No, no, no.
Sam: They could be dead in there.
Laura: If something could've taken out giant giants. What could it be that could've done that?
Travis: Vampire giants.
Taliesin: It could've been the Briarwoods. We should see everything that's up here.
Sam: (sings) There are giants in the sky.
Travis: How awesome would that be?
Laura: (sings) There are big, tall, terrible giants in the sky.
Travis: Can we please go see? Can someone please--
Sam: You want me to go in?
Travis: Vax!?
Marisha: I can bird it. I can bird it and go in.
Taliesin: I can't believe I'm about to say this.
Marisha: Bird in and do a recon mission real quick?
Sam: You're going to bird in? They're going to see you fly in.
Laura: No, but she's a bird.
Marisha: I'm a bird.
Sam: It doesn't matter, they're still gonna see you.
Laura: Recon it.
Marisha: I'll go bat!
Laura: Yeah!
Taliesin: Now you're not going to be able to see anything because they have terrible eyesight.
Marisha: Not in a small--
Taliesin: I'm kidding, they really don't. That's a myth! That's actually a myth!
Marisha: They have echo vision!
Taliesin: They have actually very reasonable eyesight. That's a myth. You can look it up on Wikipedia, it's true.
Marisha: (laughs) Very reasonable eyesight.
Liam: You could also be a sparrow.
Laura: Yeah.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: So, at about the two in the afternoon day sun, 'cause that's what it is. But you're fine. You become a bat--
Marisha: Bats come out during the day!
Matt: I know. She makes her way, down through; you swoop up to one of the windows and you glance inside and look around. You can see most of the furniture inside is in tatters. There are large, giant-sized tables and chairs that have been broken in half and strewn across the room. Make a perception check.
Laura: Ooh, come on, Keyleth!
Sam: Come on, oh yeah.
Taliesin: Oh yeah!
Marisha: Oh yeah! 28.
Matt: 28. Glancing inside you also see there are--
Marisha: (squawks) That's my echovision.
Matt: -- splatters and puddles of blood. Large bits of blood across the ground that is dried, but from your current vision from this, there is no sign of any living or individuals or bodies. There was a battle that took place here, but there is nothing present to signify who or what.
Marisha: How big is this room?
Matt: This room is about 25 feet tall
Marisha: Does it look like it goes deeper?
Matt: It does look like it goes deeper, there is a slight-- this is the upper floor, there is a grade, almost like a slow-- the word escapes me for a second.
Marisha: Like a downgrade.
Matt: Yes.
Taliesin: Like a ramp.
Matt: A ramp!
Sam: A slope.
Matt: Thank you.
Matt: A ramp that disappears below and into the lower floor.
Sam: A siggle.
Marisha: I'm gonna go into that-- (all laugh)
Travis: Careful. Oh no no no no! Don't roll! Don't roll! (all shout)
Taliesin: We turn on him.
Marisha: Fear of god.
Liam: Grog sacrifices the gnome. (all laugh)
Matt: So yeah, you do see the ramp, that's downward.
Marisha: I'm going to go into the room that I see is for sure empty, and go toward the threshold of the ramp.
Matt: Okay. Make your way down to the threshold of the ramp, looking down. Downstairs as well, it looks like there are some fur rugs set aside that have been kicked aside and bunched up on the edge of the room.
Marisha: Like it's been ransacked, or just a really nasty fight?
Matt: Like some sort of a major fight went down. No sign of any bodies or body parts. No sign of leftover weapons or armor from whatever giants lived in here. You just see large amounts of dried blood across the stone floors.
Marisha: Like something came in and slaughtered and completely stripped the place.
Matt: Or the giants slaughtered something horribly here and are currently out and about, you don't know. But--
Marisha: Can I tell if the blood looks-- how dusty is this shit?
Matt: Did you want to land and make an investigation check?
Sam: Call us in.
Travis: Do it.
Liam: Do it, Batwoman.
Taliesin: You are the night.
Marisha: How much dust goes pff?
Travis: (laughs) You are the night.
Matt: Quite a bit; a little puff.
Laura: Oh.
Matt: Not a huge amount, but enough where it's not fresh, and a closer look, the blood's been dry for a while. Make an investigation check.
Taliesin: What is the sound of a bat coughing?
Marisha: (squawking and coughing noise)
Taliesin: Thank you. It's the simple things.
Travis: What did you get?
Marisha: Investigation. What about a 12?
Matt: 12. You can't really make it out, unfortunately. You know it's dried, it's been a little bit, but you can't quite gauge how long it's been.
Marisha: All right, I'm gonna go ahead and-- are there any other rooms, or is this it?
Matt: There's the upper floor, the lower floor. They're two large rooms on their own. It looks like-- You haven't actually gone down the grade yet, so.
Marisha: You said seven stories, so it's like room, downgrade, room, downgrade, room?
Matt: Seven stories for your size, it's two stories for a giant size. It's a large top room, and a large bottom room.
Laura: Ooh.
Marisha: Is there another room going off the bottom room?
Matt: There are just two rooms  top floor, bottom floor. You're currently on the top floor, looking down.
Sam: Split level condo.
Marisha: I'm gonna go out to the front door.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Nice flat, upper east side. Land, and I'm gonna bamf out of my bat form, and say, all right, it looks like the coast is clear if you guys want to check this place out.
Sam: Yeah, let's go check in.
Taliesin: Let's check it out.
Matt: All right, the rest of you make you way back down towards the front of the fortress and enter the inside. As you go through the front door, you see that the impact that destroyed it was from the inside out.
Sam: Oh!
Laura: Ooh.
Travis: Really?
Matt: So it's not like it was beaten in, it was beaten from the inside out.
Laura: Oh.
Matt: And there is a streak of dried blood against that portion of the door. Looking inside too, you see there are a large cluster of matted hides and furs, like it made for bedding for close to four or five giants put in the corner, and there is a musty smell of whatever they were using to make it comfortable and ripe for their own personal needs.
Liam: Stealth!
Laura: Yeah, yeah, let's stealth.
Travis: Can giants become vampires?
Laura: I don't know, I hope not. You should use the dust of tracelessness, Grog, just so our footsteps aren't seen.
Liam: 17.
Matt: 17, okay. So what do you guys want to do in here?
Laura: Stealth.
Sam: I'm going to go downstairs.
Marisha: How dark is it?
Matt: You are downstairs at the entrance
Sam: Oh. Down the grade, I mean.
Travis: I want to look for any weapons that are lying about.
Matt: All right, make a perception check.
Liam: I want to ransack the joint.
Matt: Actually, it'd be more of an investigation check.
Travis: Me, investigate? That's funny. Eight.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Investigate or perception for me?
Travis: I find dirt.
Matt: You find a giant's fortress.
Liam: Investigate or perception?
Matt: For this? Perception is just seeing things at first glance. Investigation is going through and rummaging through to find things.
Liam: I'll investigate.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Shall I for downstairs?
Matt: Yeah, go for it.
Liam: 17.
Sam: 23.
Matt: Okay. As you guys are going through, looking at the blood and the way the splashes are, the blood that was spilled here was very thick, and large amounts of it, and it's probably been anywhere from two to three months since this entire fortress was ransacked.
Travis: Wow. MATT You do notice that some of the blood is dragged through, like something was dragged out of the puddle. But not for a long distance. Whatever was there was cleaned off at some point, or lifted up and carried out from whatever was originally pulled through those puddles of blood. You also do notice that in the pile of furs and refuse and there are bones of things that were left there to rot in the corner. You find roughly 120 gold pieces.
Sam: I give it to Vex.
Matt: Over time you find a number of shattered glass vials that look like they once contained various elixirs, there is one that is unshattered.
Sam: I take it.
Matt: All right. And underneath all, covered in quite a bit of filth, but a little bit of metallic sheen streaks through, you see what looks to be a very, very well-crafted longbow.
Laura: (gasps) What is that?! What is it? What did you find?
Sam: Nothing, nothing.
Laura: What is it? What is that?
Liam: Here you go
Laura: Ah, what is this?
Liam: What are you going to do with it?
Laura: What is this?
Sam: I'll use it as a hammock.
Liam: Shoot yourself?
Marisha: Does it look like it's magic-y?
Laura: Can I tell what it is?
Matt: Taking it, it appears to have some sort of magical radiance to it. It looks like it's very well crafted. You recognize the construction is elvish in nature.
Laura: Hey, look at this.
Matt: And there are bits of mithril scrolling all throughout the bow itself, with platinum caps on the edge of the longbow.
Travis: Is it evil?
Laura: I don't know. Keyleth, do you know anything about magic-y stuff? Tiberius bamfed out.
Marisha: I can try, I'm not as good as he is, but I'll try.
Laura: What about you, Scanlan? Do you know anything about arcana?
Marisha: Ooh, 20!
Matt: Natural 20?
Marisha: No, 18; 20 total.
Matt: Yes, this is definitively a magical item, it is enchanted.
Marisha: It's definitely magical.
Matt: If you want to take a short time to work with it and attune yourself to it, you could get a better idea of what its effect is.
Laura: Okay. Thank you. Can we do that?
Taliesin: I'm going to look around a bit more, anyway.
Laura: I'm going to think about it real hard.
Liam: Probably shoot a couple dummy arrows out of it
Travis: Can I walk out the front door?
Laura: I'm going to buy it a steak and I'm going to--
Travis: Can I walk out the front door and keep post on the porch?
Liam: I'm following Grog and I'm doing the same.
Matt: All right.
Travis: And I want to look in the direction we want to be walking.
Taliesin: I'm looking around, I'm trying to find out what happened to the bodies.
Matt: Investigation check for that. Here are the potion and the bow you guys managed to--
Laura: What is it, what is it?
Sam: I took the potion, I took the potion!
Matt: (laughs) Give that to Scanlan.
Taliesin: I know, apparently, from this roll that I'm in the mountains.
Laura: What is it?
Taliesin: I got a six.
Matt: A six. It's hard to tell. It's a very strange scene, and you have no inclination as to what may have transpired here. Who is the winner, who is the loser, and what has been done with the bodies.
Liam: Sorry.
Marisha: What did you find, what did you find?
Taliesin: Vex is making happy noises.
Liam: She's taking the bow for a spin.
Travis: She's attuning.
Liam: Seeing what it can do.
Travis: Do we see anything outside on the porch?
Matt: Over time the only thing you catch is occasionally you see flocks of birds moving through and swooping through the area. You watch one flock come up and begin circling a little bit.
Laura: Should we get out? Should we leave?
Matt: And then make its way down toward the valley.
Travis: Stealth.
Laura: Just leave. Let's leave. Stealth it out? Stealthy out-ie?
Matt: This is for Grog who is outside, roll a stealth check.
Liam: I'm out there too, and I rolled a natural 20.
Matt: Yes you did.
Travis: I might use your inspiration on this.
Sam: It's probably not in effect anymore.
Laura: (groans) No, you're in the mountains!
Travis: I am in the mountains.
Matt: Which means you have knowledge of mountains.
Laura: You don't get advantage?
Travis: I don't have advantage on--
Matt: Let me double-check on this, actually, what the specifics of the goliath's-- You don't take issues with cold climates, because you're at high elevation. You don't actually get advantage on anything mountain-wise; that is a ranger ability.
Travis: So can I add an inspiration on this?
Sam: I inspired him quite a while ago. How long does that--
Matt: It's been a while, how long does that last?
Sam: 20 minutes?
Matt: Yeah, that would've faded by now.
Travis: That's a one.
Matt: Oh, well, if it's a natural one it wouldn't have mattered.
Liam: Yeah, it doesn't matter, you can't add shit to one.
Matt: So while you sneak off to the side, you see these birds. There's a lot of birds there! You start yelling out to everyone, there's a lot of birds out here! Shouting it loudly back into the fortress.
Laura: Aw, shit.
Marisha: Grog, Grog, those might be centurion birds!
Travis: (loudly) That's what I said, birds!
Marisha: They might be spies! They might be spies.
Travis: (loudly) Yeah, I spy birds, they're flying everywhere. (yells) Go away!
Laura: Grog, Grog, inside.
Marisha: Inside!
Matt: The birds immediately start circling the fortress very close. You can hear the screeching. You can see the birds now, they're crows. A very, very thick murder of crows, probably close to a hundred of them, cawing.
Laura: I cast Pass Without a Trace.
Marisha: Wait, wait, wait.
Sam: I'm still down there, investigating.
Matt: Mm-hm.
Sam: I pull a David Caruso and say, It looks like these giants had... big trouble. (all laugh)
Matt: You hear an echoing sound, yeahhhh! Formless, sourceless. You all stand there confused for a moment, then continue to try and stealth.
Travis: I run back inside.
Matt: Back inside. Eventually the crows take back to their original path.
Marisha: Oh, oh, but before the crows leave, before the crows leave--
Liam: Yeah?
Laura: Yeah?
Marisha: Can I do something?
Matt: Yep. What are you doing?
Laura: Do it!
Travis: Do it!
Sam: Kill them all.
Marisha: I'm gonna go like Storm and I'm gonna Sleet Storm them. I'm gonna start conjuring a Sleet Storm over the top of this mountain, right where the crows are.
Taliesin: It's been so long since you've killed something innocent! Let's bring it!
Laura: Do it, do it, Keyleth!
Matt: As Keyleth concentrates for a second, you see her eyes, the actual color of her irises, begin to fade to this cloudy white and then the entire eye itself becomes this icy blue. A slight cold mist beginning to drift off the corners of her face.
Laura: Badass.
Matt: You start hearing this pounding sound on the top of the fortress as sleet and hail begins to rain down. Go ahead and roll damage for the spell.
Marisha: Oh, jeez.
Matt: Sleet Storm? Oh, it's just a dexterity saving throw. It says heavily obscured, but doesn't actually do any damage.
Laura: But it knocks them all down.
Marisha: I know, they're like frozen though, right? Don't they get frozen with Sleet Storm?
Matt: Sleet Storm knocks things prone, makes the area hard to see.
Marisha: Knocks them prone
Matt: Douses flames.
Marisha: They're in the sky, I wanna hear birds hit the floor.
Matt: And a few do. There are a few birds that get pelted and knocked to the ground, encased in sleet, but most of it immediately takes note to get away from the storm and vanish and disappear back to--
Travis: Do they fall to the porch?
Matt: I'll say one does.
Travis: I run out there and I grab it.
Laura: No, no, no!
Travis: I rip its head off with my teeth. (all laugh)
Matt: Grog, you run out there and grab the one on the ground, it's struggling, and (squawks), there's ice gathered everywhere.
Travis: Yeah, shut up!
Matt: You grab it and you pick it up, you hear Vex go "Grog!" and you go (chomp) as she's staring at you. Silencing the crow. You hear the cawing of the crows dissipate in the distance and silence eventually takes the fortress once again, and you're left amongst the smell of death.
Laura: We should get the eff out of here.
Marisha: I think so.
Taliesin: We should probably leave.
Laura: Now. Stealth and out.
Laura: Dust of tracelessness. Hide ourselves.
Travis: Dust of tracelessness.
Matt: You make your way out of the fortress and begin to follow the path down into the outside of the forest and just as you make towards the base of the mountains where the forest canopy begins to take your vision, you can see just over the edge, a couple of small castle towers and what looks to be a single central spire of the castle of Whitestone.
Laura: They know we're here now. They know we're here.
Liam: Yeah.
Taliesin: I think they might.
Laura: That was a sentry.
Travis: Why? They were just birds.
Marisha: Yeah, but we don't know--
Sam: Don't worry, we still have the element of surprise. Oh wait, no, we don't.
Matt: And with that, we're going to go ahead and take a break. All right, guys, we'll be back here in about 20-25 minutes.
Laura: Oh yeah!
Matt: Let us begin where we left off.
Laura: Oh, we're looking at the city.
Sam: There's the city! Shall we storm it?
Taliesin: It's a chalkboard.
Laura: I was pointing at you!
Taliesin: Well yes, so I can now recognize where we are.
Matt: Yes, you know this area very well. This entire forested area, the Parchwood Forest that encompases the entirety of this valley, toward the center of it, center north, is where Whitestone sits and for your reference as well, since you've been here before, you would know the city relatively well.
Sam: Maps!
Taliesin: This is the most exciting map I've ever been handed. Whoa!
Laura: What the what?!
Matt: Hold that over by your seat there for people to take a look at.
Sam: Don't. Just don't.
Taliesin: It won't fit in my folder.
Matt: That is a basic rundown of the size, design and shape of Whitestone, with Castle Whitestone toward the top, built on top of a leveled off mountain that marks the southernmost point.
Sam: This is the castle, this is the town?
Travis: And we're at the southern part of that?
Matt: You guys are actually coming in from what would be the northwestern side of the city
Marisha: So over here?
Matt: A little bit further down. About that angle there. That's the direction you're coming in from.
Travis: That's a detailed map, man.
Matt: I don't have any free time anymore. (all laugh)
Travis: They sell those stock, right?
Matt: Oh yeah, totally.
Taliesin: What's this little outcropping?
Matt: The little outcropping to the east of it was the graveyard to Whitestone. It's where most of the regular denizens were interred. It's been expanded over the years as the city itself has been around for quite a few generations.
Marisha: Does this graveyard have catacombs? Tombs? Underground passages?
Matt: Do you ask this of Percy?
Marisha: Yes.
Taliesin: Does it?
Matt: That graveyard does not--
Taliesin: That graveyard does not--
Matt: -- it is a surface graveyard.
Taliesin: -- it is a surface graveyard.
Matt: There is a mausoleum--
Taliesin: There is a mausoleum--
Matt: -- but that--
Taliesin: -- but that--
Matt: -- is actually contained beneath the castle.
Taliesin: -- is actually contained beneath the castle. (all laugh)
Travis: Riveting.
Sam: So knowledgeable, Percy.
Laura: So Percy, do you know of any secret passages to get actually into the castle?
Taliesin: I was wondering that myself.
Matt: There is one, one that you took to escape.
Taliesin: Yes, there is one!
Marisha: (laughs) Stop.
Matt: He has an aneurysm. Yeah, it is to the very western edge of the mountain precipice the castle was built on. It was built to be specifically an escape in case the place was under siege. Unfortunately, the circumstances that the evening happened so rapidly, and with creatures that seemingly were unnatural, the family didn't have time to make it out. And even you weren't fully aware of it. Cassandra, however, had overheard discussions about the passage and took that as your escape route. It's a hidden tunnel at the very base of the mountain.
Taliesin: I say we scope out the hidden entrance, see if it's guarded, see if they've discovered it.
Sam: To the town, or to the castle?
Taliesin: The hidden entrance to the castle. Instead of using it, I think we should possibly spend the night and get a view of the town, see if there's anything unusual.
Laura: I agree, can we camp out and hide?
Sam: Watch from afar? What's that going to tell us?
Travis: We could send one in.
Taliesin: We could send a bird in. Or an invisible gnome.
Sam: Or both.
Taliesin: Or both. An invisible bird-gnome.
Travis: Just to see if the town is normal or not.
Sam: It could be all vampires. Or it could be a totally normal town.
Taliesin: If it's all vampires, it'll be empty right now.
Sam: Because it's daytime.
Laura: Because it's daytime.
Marisha: We should do a fly-by.
Laura: We should definitely attack during the day.
Taliesin: Yes.
Travis: We should send one by air and one by land.
Laura: What?
Marisha: Do you want to do that?
Sam: How far away are we?
Matt: You guys have been travelling through the forest, and it is a very dense forest, but it is mostly cold-weather trees, pines. And there is, you can see once you get inside the forest, the ground itself is very thick and there are elements of melting snow on the top of the trees, there was recently a snowfall in this area but it seems like it's been a while and most of it has turned to slush and water. You have about two hours of travel into the forest, and you all immediately catch the sound of distant howling.
Sam: Is it nighttime?
Matt: No.
Sam: Oh. That's scary.
Marisha: Distant howling? Does it sound like wolves? Can I make a nature check?
Matt: Yeah, make a nature check.
Laura: Stealth?
Matt: If you want to make a stealth check
Marisha: 26.
Matt: 26. Those are wolves. It sounds like a pack of wolves, probably close to anywhere from five or six.
Marisha: Would I think it's weird that they're howling during the daytime?
Matt: You gather that it is strange that they're out. Though it is getting later in the day, you are pushing four or five in the afternoon, the sun is starting to get closer to the horizon. It is strange that they're out this early, you're not sure what the reasoning would be for that.
Marisha: Odd.
Taliesin: I say we hide in the trees.
Laura: Up high.
Travis: Like up in the trees?
Laura: I like it.
Travis: We're gonna climb some trees.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: We're gonna Hobbit this shit.
Sam: We're just hiding in the trees, we're not going in to investigate?
Taliesin: Well, it's about to be nighttime, so we'll send a scout.
Sam: How long would it take to get into the town from where we are?
Matt: About two more hours of travel.
Sam: Ew. We'll get there at night. That's all right though, it's early evening.
Marisha: How long would it take me to fly over if I was a bird?
Matt: About an hour.
Sam: Vax.
Liam: Yes?
Sam: Can I ride you into town?
Liam: You want me to jog into town?
Marisha: You could ride me into town.
Sam: Well hello lady.
Marisha: Man, every time, Scanlan, every time.
Taliesin: Now that just got weird.
Laura: Could you turn yourself and fly?
Sam: Yeah, I guess I could fly.
Marisha: You wanna go invisible and jump on my back and I can eagle up?
Sam: Whatever you're into, baby. (laughs) I've become Austin Powers.
Laura: Ridiculous.
Marisha: Let's do it.
Liam: If the coach driver was any indication, there are going to be people--
Laura: Normal people.
Liam: -- in town.
Sam: What about this  I'll make us both invisible and you fly us in.
Laura: I like it.
Travis: Yeah, get on the ground, not just above.
Matt: All right. Now, Invisibility  how long does it last at full duration?
Sam: Looking. Up to an hour. Ooh, and it takes two hours just to get there?
Matt: Well, flying takes an hour. So, it's one of those things you could do once you approach it. It'll last you awhile, as opposed to doing it now.
Sam: How long can you be Polymorphed for? Forever? Concentration?
Marisha: For half of my druid level, we discovered.
Matt: So somewhere around six hours, five hours.
Sam: Okay, so you fly us in, and I'll Invisibility us right as we get to the gates.
Travis: And as they're going out, we get in the trees.
Taliesin: Make sure you bring an earpiece.
Marisha: He's got an earpiece.
Travis: Do we, the four of us, all go up in the trees?
Liam: Everyone get your own tree.
Laura: Everyone get your own tree?
Matt: Everyone who's in a tree, please roll a stealth check.
Sam: Except for Trinket, who can't climb up.
Laura: Trinket can climb trees! Bears climb trees!
Matt: Roll an athletics check.
Laura: I'm casting Pass Without a Trace. How long does it last?
Sam: You have to roll for Trinket.
Laura: Okay, fine! I guess I'll cast it tonight, never mind.
Travis: Plus ten to stealth?
Laura: Why are you being a dick, Scanlan?
Matt: Well, she did not cast it.
Laura: I'm not casting it yet.
Travis: 14.
Laura: What are we rolling?
Travis: Stealth.
Liam: I already did. Those are good rolls!
Laura: 21 for me, and what do I-- just nothing. 19 for Trinket.
Matt: Okay. We'll say you guys all manage to slowly get yourself up into the tree the best you can, as you guys take off. While you guys are away, making your way towards Whitestone, the rest of you look down, and just from a passive perception standpoint, you pick up the most detail: you can see there is indeed a pack of about five wolves and/or dogs a little ways away, but they're being followed by one humanoid. They're being guided, there is a pack out here for some reason, whether it be a hunting party or whatever other reasons there may be. It isn't a wild pack.
Laura: And they're close to us now?
Travis: I've been doing the dust of tracelessness.
Laura: So, I'll cast it on us now that they're closer.
Marisha: I wonder if that's the ground search party.
Laura: Maybe.
Travis: We'll see.
Laura: So, should we add ten to all of our stealth rolls that had been, or do we have to roll again?
Matt: You'd have to roll again.
Laura: Shit balls.
Liam: So we're stealthing again in the tree?
Matt: Because she's casting Pass, or you won't get the benefit.
Liam: I'm already at a 32, man!
Travis: I'll take it.
Laura: You don't have to.
Liam: Let's do it, let's roll again.
Taliesin: Let's roll again.
Liam: What do we add?
Laura: Ten to whatever we roll.
Matt: Go ahead and just add ten to the previous roll. (all cheer)
Liam: Good.
Marisha: We want to keep our good rolls.
Matt: So, about five breathless moments pass as the dogs, wolves all get relatively close. One of them comes up and returns back to the pack. You don't get a good view of the individual that is currently guiding the pack, and you see them disappear between the thick trees in the distance. Make an active perception check for you, Vex, if you don't mind.
Laura: Not advantage. Mountains?
Matt: Is forest? No, you're in forest, now.
Laura: Oh wait! That's another!
Matt: You're sure that's a favored terrain? Then go ahead and roll again.
Laura: That was worse than the first one, that's great.
Matt: So your total is?
Liam: I rolled 20.
Laura: Okay, well, you didn't say you were doing it. 18.
Matt: 18, okay. It's hard to make out the details at this distance. You check out, it does appear to be a female form.
Laura: Oh, it's a chick!
Matt: Best you can tell, you can't tell specific race or details. Then, another minute passes before the barking and the howls fade and the hunting party seems to have been eluded.
Taliesin: There was no way to get a good look at who it was.
Matt: No. Do you want to make an active perception check?
Taliesin: Actually, I would love to.
Matt: Normally, if they'd passed by now--
Taliesin: Natural 20.
Travis: What?! Really?
Matt: A natural 20?!
Marisha: I'm looking at it!
Taliesin: This is an 'I love you' for those awful rolls earlier.
Travis: The golden snitch wins again.
Taliesin: That may be its name now.
Matt: You see the female form, it's not someone you particularly recognize. But the woman does appear to be older, probably in her late 40s, early 50s. She has some hunting gear over her shoulder. She has a short bow that's strapped over her, she has a quiver of arrows. She looks like she's hunting for food.
Sam: If she was a little older, Tiberius would kill her. (all laugh)
Sam: Give her ten years.
Matt: Give her ten years.
Taliesin: I don't recognize her, though?
Matt: No, you don't have an immediate lead of visual recognition. In the meantime, you guys make your way. Swooping down, you can see that cluster, that murder of crows circling out. It's making a large pass over this entire valley. You take this cue as you get to within visual range of the city to cast Invisibility on both of you. Is that a 3rd-level spell?
Sam: Yes.
Matt: Okay. Both of you vanish from view, which is a strange feeling for you because you cannot see Keyleth, you're grasping onto something you can't see.
Sam: Oh, shit.
Matt: And you just look like you're gliding through the air.
Sam: Can I do one of these?
Matt: Yeah, you grab on very tightly.
Marisha: (choking noises)
Matt: -- without choking. The eagle does not have--
Sam: Damn it!
Matt: -- human physiology. You get two fistfuls of feathers. And you really don't want an eagle to buck you angrily at this height. I don't think you have Featherfall so that wouldn't go well. Looking over Whitestone, you can see outside of the city there are some areas where the trees are carved out, and there is farmland set up specifically to grow food and to till to maintain sustenance for the people that live there. You can see that there's a small area that's also being cut for timber. Not a perpetual thing, but the wood here is, you've heard previously, one of the major exports here is very high-quality timber from this type of tree that is used for very exquisite woodcraft and furniture. So that's one of the major exports of Whitestone as well as the quartz from the mines itself. There are people in the city, but sparse. Make a perception check.
Marisha: Can I also make a perception check?
Matt: You may.
Marisha: With my eagle vision?
Matt: (singsong) You may.
Marisha: 14, so that's 24. And I have Keen Sight, which means I have advantage on all perception checks.
Matt: Yes, you do.
Marisha: I'll take that 14.
Taliesin: She'll take that 14.
Marisha: As opposed to that one.
Matt: Total of 14?
Marisha: 24.
Matt: 24. Okay. As you get close enough to start scanning over details, you can see that a lot of the buildings appear to be closed or empty. There are people working in the fields. As you make your way to the center of the town, there is a town square. There is a tree there, a very large, old tree that is twisted, with all these various gnarled branches that reach out. You recall Desmond mentioning something called the Sun Tree that is the centerpiece of this area. And you get a view enough of the tree to see that there are eight humanoid bodies of varying ages swinging from it.
Sam: Ooh.
Laura: Oh no.
Matt: You also notice that, patrolling through the city at very slow paces, there are a few larger than normal humanoids.
Laura: (gasps)
Matt: You see what appear to be approximately six giants patrolling through the town, but you can see some of them are like wrecked and broken. One of them is missing an arm and is dragging a foot behind it.
Laura: They're zombie giants?!
Matt: Apparently, whenever one of them is moving through, most of the denizens of the town keep a very wide berth, and generally avoid them entirely and go about their business, at a distance.
Laura: Oh my god.
Liam: I miss Pike.
Travis: Six?
Sam: No problem.
Matt: Like over all of the entire city. They're pretty well scattered about. After you do a full pass over the city, those are most of the details you can make out at this height. Anything further, any specifics, you want to go for before heading back?
Sam: You want to set me down so I can go talk to people?
Marisha: You want to talk to people?
Sam: Well, or at least eavesdrop. We don't know if they're all vampires or not.
Marisha: Does it look like there's a central part where there's a lot of people gathered?
Matt: Farmlands look likely to be the largest cluster of people. You can see, since it's getting to the end of the day, there are folks finishing up gathering the crops that were available to them or sort of planting as they go through. And you can see there's about five or six people that are all in one group. Most everyone else seems to be relatively solitary and trying to go about their business as fast as possible.
Marisha: The town square's emptying out?
Matt: The town square? Nobody is in the town square. People are avoiding it like the plague. There's eight bodies hanging from the tree, and nobody wants to be there.
Marisha: All right. I'm going to swoop down and find a tree, where the five or six farmers are, and perch, see if Scanlan can get a good--
Matt: There actually are no trees by the farm, all the trees have been cleared out to make the farmland. So there's actually a bit of the forest that's been cleared for that purpose.
Marisha: It's just open and empty.
Matt: Yeah. You can go to a tree that's nearby, but that's like 300 feet away.
Marisha: A rooftop? A wall? Anything I can perch on?
Matt: There is a wall. There is a wall on the outskirts of Whitestone.
Marisha: I perch on the wall.
Matt: Okay. You swoop down and you perch on the edge of the wall there. It's about 25 feet up.
Sam: I'm just going to walk down there. I won't be able to see you, so I'm going to leave a little--
Marisha: I'll keep an-- Oh, wait, I can't see you.
Matt: And you can't talk right now, you're an eagle.
Sam: I leave a little, like a canteen or something, right where she's perched, just so I know where to find her.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: Smart.
Taliesin: Leave the mug.
Sam: Yeah, my stein. And then I'm going to walk down and see if I can stealthily eavesdrop on some conversations.
Matt: Okay. You make your way down the 25-foot wall she's perched on.
Sam: Oh, shit. Am I going to fall?
Matt: Go ahead and make an athletics check to climb.
Taliesin: You say that out loud?
Sam: Athletics?
Matt: Yes.
Sam: 17.
Matt: 17. The stonework here is old and you manage to not lose your footing entirely as you bring your way down. Thankfully, you're light enough, and the stones are not too large, so you can get some good handholds. You do, over the next 12 minutes or so, make your way to the base of the wall.
Sam: It took me 12 minutes to climb 25 feet?
Matt: Yep.
Sam: Nice. I suck.
Marisha: Maybe whistle for me when you come back.
Matt: A lot of moments of (gasps) 'whoa, okay'. But, you catch yourself. I mean, you can just jump if you wanted to make it less. But, the duration of your invisibility-- you have about 20 more minutes before it dissipates.
Sam: Oh shit, I have to do this quick.
Matt: You look over the edge, and you can see that they have carts up and that they have what vegetables they have, and a lot of vegetables, even at a close look, a lot of them look withered. It looks like there is a general sense of frustration that the land itself is not producing quality crops. And even the people look unhealthy and gaunt by nature. Whether it be the cold winter recently or just their general spirit is broken, but there is a feeling about these people that life here is not what it used to be. There isn't a whole lot of conversation, there's mutterings here and there. "We have to make sure we get these back in time. Fill the cart, we have two carts we have to get in." And the other one's, "I know, I know, I'm trying," And they're putting it over there and there's a little bit of frustration among them.
Sam: He's doing walla. (all laugh)
Matt: One of them ends up counting the last bit of crop. "That's it, that's all we have. That is the entire pull for the day." And the older gentleman, who is overseeing it, grinds his hands and goes, "Sir Kerrion is going to have my hide."
Sam: Wait, wasn't that one of the people--
Matt: "At the very least, let's gather it together and hopefully Pelor will protect us." And the people take the carts and begin making their way towards the outer gate on the southeast side of Whitestone, where you guys are currently at.
Sam: Okay. I'm going to hustle back to the roof.
Matt: All right. Make an athletics check.
Sam: Jesus.
Marisha: I can come get you.
Taliesin: You'll hear a thump.
Sam: Eight. (all laugh)
Liam: Hopefully he lands on his lute.
Sam: No, it's nine.
Matt: Okay. 15 minutes. After five minutes of eavesdropping you realize that you are not going to make it up that wall, and you feel the magic of your Invisibility illusion about to fade. At this point, by the way, the sun has just hit the edge of the mountains, the sky itself is a vibrant, reddish orange slowly turning to purple and sunset is upon you.
Sam: I want to spend the night here. No.
Marisha: Can I see him?
Matt: He's invisible, no.
Sam: I will sneak around the corner a little bit, wait for an opening, and I lose Invisibility, which will drop it on her as well, and I will Dimension Door back up to the roof.
Matt: Okay. As you pass to the side, the illusion fades, you step into a small opening of dark, purplish energy and then reemerge on the top of the wall--
Matt: Grab the canteen.
Sam: Grab the canteen.
Matt: --and hop back on the back of her.
Sam: Oh, shit. Invisibility again.
Matt: Okay. Okay. You guys vanish, and Keyleth, you take off back in the direction you guys traveled from. In the meantime, guys, what do you want to have been doing? Are you just waiting, are you traveling further in, are you staying where you are?
Travis: (snores)
Taliesin: We have to wait.
Laura: Yeah, keeping an ear out for the wolves and just chilling in a tree.
Travis: (yells) I fall out of the tree.
Laura: And also, I'm restringing my new, awesome bow.
Matt: With the--?
Laura: With the blazing bowstring.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Which, by the way, is a longbow of sky sentinel.
Sam: Sky sentinel, what does that mean?
Laura: Once per long rest, I can use a Storm Arrow, which means that the next arrow I fire splits into three arrows. Roll an attack for each of them, they all get 1d6 extra for each one that hits. It's amazing!
Sam: Every time you use it, or is at a one-time--
Laura: It's one time per long rest.
Marisha: That's awesome!
Matt: Once per day, she fires an arrow and the arrow splits into three, and each one bursts into thunder damage, bursts of them.
Laura: Say what?! So, is it lightning damage or is it--
Matt: Thunder damage. It should say on there.
Laura: It says lightning damage.
Matt: Oh, then it would be lightning damage.
Marisha: It's a taser arrow.
Taliesin: It's basically a taser.
Matt: So yeah, it's pretty fun.
Sam: Thunder!
Laura: Thunder!
Matt: What's that from?
Sam: I don't know.
Matt: So, the night falls and the crickets begin to emerge, the slow mist begins to form.
Laura: Wait, our friends aren't back yet. It's already night and they're not back?
Liam: I just want to say that I pulled my hood down, and put on my calamari hat, and pulled the hood back over it.
Matt: Okay. So you take the partially rusted over, but functional, metallic skull cap that Clarota was wearing when you guys met in the Underdark, that Clarota no longer needs.
Travis: Because he's dead.
Matt: You place it on your head and it's a little loose. As you place it on, it rattles for a moment, and then it form-fits to your skull. Your hair being pinched beneath it and just emerging from underneath, almost Loki-helmet-style.
Laura: Looking snazzy, Vax.
Travis: Nice bonnet.
Sam: (imitating Clarota) I'm on your head.
Matt: There's a weird buzzing vibrational feel as its magic attunes to you over the next hour or so as you're waiting, but you get the sensation that it will offer some decent protection from impeding charm effects.
Liam: It tingles.
Laura: It looks like you have a mullet.
Liam: Yeah, dude.
Matt: A Loki mullet. You start to get really nervous about the arrival of your friends, until eventually you hear the flapping of wings. You look up and you can see, since it has taken an hour to get there, the illusion just fades, both a giant eagle and Scanlan appear in the moonlight, right above the canopy of the forest you guys are close to, and return to the place you were.
Laura: Keyleth, question. Can you make it look like we're not here with your foliage shit?
Marisha: I drop my Beast Shape, holding onto a branch.
Laura: You know, the illusions.
Marisha: Yeah.
Taliesin: Good, good.
Laura: Can we camp up in the tree? So nobody can come towards us.
Marisha: Yeah.
Sam: What if we fall out?
Marisha: I Druidcraft some spiderweb hammocks.
Laura: Ooh.
Taliesin: Sticky.
Marisha: And, as usual, light some sage.
Matt: Takes about an hour or so, but you manage to pull from the surroundings these really nice, thick spider silk hammocks, that should be able to support your respective weights. Grog is the only one that might be questionable with the sheer amount of weight that is his form.
Travis: I like it.
Marisha: Maybe take a rope and tie it.
Travis: Nope, this is a trust exercise.
Laura: I'm using Hide in Plain Sight to make me and Trinket extra, extra hidey.
Liam: I have a question. The only reason I have this question is because I posted that video from a couple of years ago. Do I still have the unending rope?
Laura: I have the unending rope, motherfucker.
Liam: Why don't we reinforce with the rope?
Laura: Sure, why not.
Travis: You don't like the trust exercise?
Laura: That's where all the rope comes from that we ever use.
Liam: I'm sorry I brought it up. I'd love you to fall on your head.
Laura: Let's reinforce the spiderwebs.
Travis: No, I'm good, thank you.
Marisha: Whoa, Vax. Nice helmet. Don Quixote called.
Liam: Aerodynamic, isn't it?
Marisha: He wants his bowl back.
Sam: Before we slumber, we did a little intel, a little recon.
Laura: Oh, yeah. What's up?
Sam: Turns out the town is full of humans, except for these six vampire giants-- zombie giants.
Marisha: They all appear to be fairly miserable people.
Sam: However, this could be useful. Everyone in the town, the farmers anyway, seem to be gathering produce to deliver to the Briarwoods. We could pose as some sort of farmer troupe with a basket of goodies, and maybe get through the front gate.
Laura: Don't you think they would know all the farmers around at this point? They've been there for a long time.
Marisha: They did reference Sir Kerrion by name. Oh, they referenced Sir Kerrion, Percy.
Taliesin: Thank you.
Sam: We could make ourselves look like some of them. One of us has a hat of disguise.
Marisha: Also, there was something other really important.
Sam: What?
Marisha: The town was pretty much empty.
Sam: Oh, yes, this.
Marisha: And that Sun Tree, that what's-his-name-- Who said that? Jarett?
Matt: Desmond.
Marisha: Desmond. Looks like there were some executions that took place. There were about eight bodies hanging from that tree.
Laura: Why is it called the Sun Tree?
Sam: It's really lovely. I don't know, maybe it gets sun.
Marisha: I don't know. Why do they call it the Sun Tree?
Taliesin: Can I go with this? Unless you have a particular reason to--
Matt: I mean, you can go with-- There are maybe many reasons it's called the Sun Tree.
Laura: There's reasons. Maybe we need to battle them at the Sun Tree.
Taliesin: Legends say that before the castle was built, that the journey into the valley was treacherous and stormy, and the original builders of Whitecastle feared they would die. And this one, great tree stood in the valley, and it was underneath it that they took shelter. And as they began to take shelter, the storm broke. And the storm did not return until the castle was completed.
Sam: That's a lovely story.
Taliesin: We hold our festivals there every year.
Sam: And now it's being used as a--
Taliesin: As a gallow, yes.
Laura: Does it get a lot of sun?
Matt: You do know, and this ties into your story as well, because the guidance in forging the city of Whitestone, that tree was representative to them as a guardian of Pelor, the god of the sun. The protector of light, holiness--
Sam: Who that?
Taliesin: A very serious god.
Travis: That could help.
Laura: That could help us, because vampires hate the sun.
Sam: Why would they make camp in the place where the god of the sun--
Laura: Maybe that's why they're hanging bodies from it, to taint it.
Liam: Maybe that's why it's protected. Maybe--
Sam: Are any of us religious with that god, or--?
Marisha: Can we call Pike through your magic poo?
Laura: Would she be able to hear us?
Taliesin: Tablet of Apple?
Sam: I can at least see what she is up to.
Liam: Keyleth, would you be able to revive the tree?
Laura: (gasps) Bring it back.
Sam: What would that do?
Marisha: Yeah, I can, actually.
Laura: I don't know. Bring up the god of the sun again, I don't know.
Sam: We're not religious people. We can't summon the gods willy-nilly.
Liam: We can please Pelor.
Laura: Don't tell us what we can and can't do, Scanlan.
Sam: I'm sorry. We can do all of those things. Yes, let's go in the middle of the vampire-infested town and do some arbory to try to heal the tree, and then we'll just say, oh, sun god, please rain down sun here.
Laura: I like it. Let's do it.
Sam: That's a great plan.
Travis: Can we at least try cutting down the bodies and running, and seeing what happens?
Sam: We could.
Taliesin: I say, in the morning we take a look at the passage, see how well-guarded it is. And if it looks dangerous, sneak our way into the town. If people are not enthralled, if they are being forced to work, then maybe we can find some allies.
Marisha: Find allies in the town?
Taliesin: I don't think they're happy.
Laura: I think they're terrified. And I don't want to let them know we're here, for fear they'll turn us in, in hopes of saving their own necks.
Marisha: That's what I'm thinking. Yes, they're terrified, but this whole town's being ruled by fear.
Liam: I have a feeling we can revive that tree somehow. It may weaken the Briarwoods' hold on the psyche of the villagers here.
Laura: This is true! It could help out. Let them know the god of the sun is on their side.
Travis: I heard you're supposed to pee on a lemon tree, so.
Laura: Probably you and Scanlan are on that, I have a feeling.
Travis: Can I make a nature check to see if that's true?
Taliesin: I really wanted to ask. What does peeing on a lemon tree have to do with anything?
Matt: Sure.
Travis: 19! That's 17.
Matt: In your experience with the roving band of barbarians, you guys enjoyed very much peeing on very colorful trees, of all sorts of plant life. All of them, generally, didn't seem to, over time, react well to the process, whether it be the fact that you all drank a lot of the time, so the content of your urine was probably not very hospitable.
Liam: It's known as a lemon party. (all laugh)
Matt: That's a whole different kind of festival.
Marisha: You killed Percy.
Laura: You killed Percy.
Taliesin: Thank you for bringing the text chat all the way back around.
Travis: Operation tree rescue.
Matt: The lemon party is held on the far, far southern continent of Tubgirl, the region of Goatse.
Travis: I have an idea. Should we wait until the sun comes up, create a distraction, so all the undead giants come looking, and then we have someone go cut the bodies off the tree, and--
Laura: And bring it back to life!
Travis: -- let Keyleth give it a little love.
Marisha: And then what happens after that?
Travis: I don't know. It's an experiment, all right?
Laura: Then we get the fuck out.
Sam: Won't they know we're here? Won't the people see us doing things?
Marisha: I know. I feel that's the equivalent of putting dish soap in the fountain on prom night.
Laura: No! Didn't you say that all around the Sun Tree nobody's there?
Marisha: Yeah, we did that. What?
Laura: Didn't you say nobody's around the Sun Tree?
Sam: That's true. But we still have to get in.
Laura: We'll fly up and over. You just did the same thing.
Sam: I know, I know.
Laura: Fly up and over, land, bring the tree back to life, get out.
Sam: Are you sure you don't want me to be a carriage driver, and you'll hide in the hay of my carriage and I'll go straight up to the Briarwoods.
Laura: I feel like they know all the townspeople.
Sam: I will put on my hat of disguise, I will be someone completely different.
Travis: They can see through that.
Liam: I'm telling you, they looked right through me.
Laura: When he was invisible!
Liam: Invisible. They saw me.
Laura: They probably saw you!
Sam: So while he was transparent, they saw through him?
Liam: No, but I was heavily stealthed.
Laura: No, you were invisible.
Marisha: Oh, wow!
Matt: No, the invisibility faded when he attacked the guard.
Liam: When I beaned the guard. They should not have been able to see me.
Sam: I'm not talking about getting past the Briarwoods. I'm talking about getting past the guards that guard their castle.
Marisha: Here's another issue. It's going to take me a minute to do the tree.
Laura: How long?
Marisha: It might take a bit.
Laura: How long's a bit?
Marisha: Well, I mean, it's one of those things where the longer I do it the better it'll be. I can do it for up to eight hours.
Travis: Oh, shit.
Marisha: If I do it for up to eight hours, I enrich the land over half a mile radius, centered on a single point, and the land becomes enriched for a solid year.
Laura: I don't want to enrich all of the--
Liam: Question. What time was it when they were doing their little scouting thing they've just told us about? The sun was going down?
Matt: Yeah, they probably would've gotten to Whitestone around seven o'clock, and leaving right as the sun had fully set.
Laura: If we go right when the sun goes up--
Liam: Yes, we get there at sunrise, take those fucking beasts out, and you start at eight AM.
Sam: But then what?
Laura: We just sneak in. Here's the thing. I don't know if you want to get all the crops all fancy, because it'll just feed the Briarwoods. Maybe just do the tree area, which will be like two hours, maybe.
Marisha: Yeah? I think if I have a solid hour or two hours with it.
Sam: Once the tree is healed, we have no one of religious power to summon any god. We don't know anything about this god, none of us do!
Taliesin: I do, in theory, if I'm from--
Matt: Go ahead and roll a religion check.
Taliesin: A which?
Matt: A religion check.
Laura: A witch?
Matt: A witch.
Taliesin: 16.
Matt: 16? Okay. Pelor is the god of the sun and agriculture. It's a good deity and is generally worshipped by farmers and simple folk and people that live off the land, and generally it's the most nature-based deity of the main spectrum, outside of Melora, which is the deity of nature.
Marisha: Oh. Well, dope! Would I know stuff like that too, then?
Matt: You know of Pelor, yeah. There are elements of Pelor's following that bleeds into your druidic nature, though you don't necessarily follow a deity.
Marisha: Right. We're free.
Matt: You believe that the essence of nature in itself is your patron.
Marisha: Totally.
Matt: You are not a religious man by nature, and you know that there is a strong following of Pelor in the town. The entire graveyard that you talked about earlier, that one is largely built around the imagery of Pelor. And of all the gods that are worshipped here, Pelor's probably 75% of the population of Whitestone where, in some shape or form, if not devout worshippers, at least were like, yeah, Pelor's cool.
Marisha: Here's my question. I feel Pike's energy tonight. Maybe, while I'm meditating, I can somehow reach out to her, and maybe ask her to get in touch with Sarenrae, and maybe Sarenrae can call up her homeboy Pelor.
Laura: Do you think that works?
Marisha: I don't know.
Travis: This is like phone a friend?
Marisha: We're not organized religion people, we Ashari.
Liam: The tree is called the Sun Tree. It's Pelor's tree. I'm not a cleric of Sarenrae, but these shitbags could not have set up camp in a temple of Sarenrae because there is too much goodness there, as there was around this tree in this town, and it's why it is dead. It's why it's being surrounded by a bunch of giant undead things, as you described. You need faith, Scanlan Shorthalt.
Sam: Me? I am the antithesis of faith.
Liam: Then you need to shut up and let us fix that tree.
Sam: And then what?
Travis: Who knows?
Sam: We're going to fight off a million monsters to heal a tree, and then we're going to say, "Okay. Bring out the sun," or something.
Marisha: Hang on! What did you just say?
Taliesin: What?
Marisha: That thing you just said that no one heard because we were all shouting and arguing? Rally the townsfolk?
Taliesin: Rally the townsfolk. This is something I think-- I don't think that sneaking in is necessarily the answer. I'm not saying go in, guns blazing, but I say we let them know--
Marisha: You want to build a militia?
Taliesin: I want to build a rebellion.
Laura: I like it. They would recognize you, wouldn't they, Percy?
Taliesin: I have a plan.
Travis: You have a plan?
Sam: Does it involve healing the tree?
Taliesin: It does.
Liam: I don't think there is any sneaking in, thanks to those birds, so we make a stand out here.
Travis: Tell us your plan.
Taliesin: My plan is, we do our best to sneak in, we find cover. Obviously, you said there's abandoned buildings. We find cover. We heal the tree. I have some other ideas. We take those zombie giants out one by one, quietly.
Sam: We're going to be insurgents?
Travis: Shh! Let him finish the plan!
Sam: I kind of love this.
Taliesin: Okay.
Marisha: It's like Attack on Titan. That's cool!
Taliesin: Let's start finding our friends, and we start making friends. We let them know we're back.
Laura: I like it.
Marisha: I like having the people. It feels less like we're the United States.
Travis: Okay, where do we start?
Taliesin: I have some parchment. I have the thing I want to build, while I'm in the tree. It's very simple, and I want to show you what it is.
Matt: What is it?
Taliesin: I want to take some gunpowder and basically--
Sam: Make a pipe bomb.
Taliesin: Basically attach it to a piece of parchment. I want to wet it into a piece of parchment and let it dry so that when I set fire to that piece of parchment, I get a burn scar. I'd like to create a burn scar.
Laura: (gasps)
Matt: Yeah, that's totally doable.
Taliesin: Thank you.
Matt: Go ahead and roll a tinkering check, just for the sake of a possible epic failure.
Marisha: A burn on yourself?
Taliesin: No, it'll scar anything. It just creates a very high heat.
Sam: Like a mark?
Marisha: Like a brand.
Sam: Like our mark.
Taliesin: Like a mark.
Sam: Like our mark.
Taliesin: Not our mark.
Sam: The resistance.
Taliesin: The resistance.
Sam: I need a beret. (all laugh)
Taliesin: I rolled a 23.
Matt: While the rest of you end up taking your evening's rest, Grog, you immediately snap your hammock and fall 15 feet to the ground.
Travis: (pained groan)
Matt: But you manage to make your way up there and just bear hug the tree trunk for rest. You're used to sleeping in uncomfortable situations.
Liam: I throw five or six pine cones at his head.
Matt: Over time, or at once?
Liam: At once.
Travis: Fucking gravity.
Matt: You manage to complete three pieces of parchment, roughly page-sized, with your black powder treatment, successfully. The mist rolls in and gets thicker and thicker, to the point where you cannot see the floor of the forest. The little bit of moonlight that manages to make its way through the boughs of the trees trickles through and then vanishes into these slowly-shifting bits of fog. Your breath, every time you exhale, is visible, as the cold night air begins to take. You find yourselves instinctively shivering, as you cannot grow close to each other for heat, nor build a fire. The night, while uncomfortable, you do manage to get an evening's bit of mostly uncomfortable rest, but rest nonetheless. Eventually coming to as the morning sun comes up and heats it up, the fog begins to fade away and burn away. You're at about an hour past sunrise as you all unrestfully come to consciousness as the temperature shift hits. You manage to relieve yourselves of your spider silk-based hammocks and/or tree grasping. Both you and Trinket have found this way of clutching onto the tree. Trinket's used to the wild.
Travis: This is, like, sunup, right?
Matt: It's about seven, 7 30 in the morning.
Sam: Can I do a quick scry back to the poo jar that I left back in our kitchen?
Matt: Certainly.
Sam: Just to make sure that our home base is okay.
Matt: You take a moment and concentrate on the kitchen. At this point in time, you can see early morning. Laina is currently in there, yawning, and is cleaning about and starting to make a small breakfast for all the guards. You can hear in the distance, some conversation in the distant room. It appears to be a couple of your various employed mercenaries having a conversation as she's making breakfast.
Sam: So they're fine.
Matt: They seem fine.
Sam: So I knock that one off, and I'll try for Pike.
Matt: Okay. Concentrating on Pike-- about two minutes of hard concentration. There's no connection.
Sam: They wiped my poo away.
Matt: You gather, due to the relatively fresh and unstable nature of this potion you had concocted, you can only have one source connection up at a time, so when you left it in your keep, it seems that the one you had at the temple of Sarenrae was alleviated of its magical presence. What was once a magical scry poo is literally just Scan-scat at the temple.
Sam: Which some could argue is magical in its own right.
Matt: Sure enough. With a high enough persuasion roll.
Laura: Teacher. Teacher.
Taliesin: Does it change color when it loses its power?
Matt: You don't know.
Taliesin: Damn it! I want to know.
Sam: Only one way to find out.
Taliesin: God damn it.
Matt: Ask Pike when you see her again. (laughs)
Taliesin: Your poo power may come in very handy. This is good to know.
Travis: Let's go find an abandoned building and set up.
Liam: Could we throw in a Scanlan grenade and be able to see through it?
Sam: Sure.
Taliesin: A scat grenade.
Liam: A scat grenade.
Sam: Sure.
Liam: Scatlan.
Marisha: Scatlan!
Taliesin: Scatlan!
Sam: I could get in, shit in their bedroom, and leave.
Liam: You shit in your hand, and you toss it.
Sam: Oh, yeah. That, too! Pull the pin. (all laugh)
Laura: Yeah. Remember that. That's awesome.
Travis: This is what happens.
Laura: You could fly overhead with Keyleth.
Sam: Yes?
Laura: Drop it like a bomb!
Sam: And then we'd have eyes in there.
Laura: I like it.
Sam: I like this a lot. Give me something to eat.
Marisha: What?
Sam: I need some fuel.
Travis: Holy crap.
Laura: I have a sweet potato right here, Scanlan.
Sam: Sweet potato? That's good, yes. Some prunes?
Marisha: Yeah, something hearty.
Liam: All right. We're off the rails.
Travis: Step one of this.
Matt: So, you make your way down into the forest. About another hour and a half of travel before you start getting to where the trees begin to clear up a little bit, and you can see the base of the cleared-off mountain that Whitestone Castle is built upon, and the pathway that descends into the outer wall of the city of Whitestone.
Laura: How far of a travel is it down into the city?
Matt: It's maybe a quarter mile.
Laura: So we can do that a little amount of time.
Matt: Space-relation-wise, you guys are just getting to this side of the forest right there. Right there, and this is the mountain.
Laura: So if we're going to try stealth this shit in--
Travis: Do we take the stealthy one or the invisible one?
Sam: Wait.
Marisha: Wait. Wait. Which plan are we doing first?
Travis: First part is getting an abandoned building.
Laura: So that we can be near the tree to protect you.
Sam: So that we can be townspeople.
Marisha: Okay.
Sam: Right?
Taliesin: So you can get a beret.
Travis: Abandoned building, part one.
Sam: We're setting up shop.
Laura: Get into the town.
Travis: So who goes and finds the abandoned building?
Sam: Percy is known here.
Taliesin: Which is why I'm going to be wearing-- I haven't been seen in years, and when I was seen, I was much younger, and honestly--
Marisha: Yes, but the Briarwoods knew who you were.
Taliesin: I had different hair. Yes, they do.
Marisha: The Briarwoods recognized you instantly.
Taliesin: They did, which was disorienting.
Sam: But they're not on sentry duty.
Travis: We need a forward operating base, so who wants to be stealthy or invisible and find an empty building?
Liam: Question  for the Assassin path of rogue, at 9th level, if I have seven days, which is way too much time, I can impersonate anyone I want. In half a day, could I just be a dirty nobody?
Matt: Yeah. You'd be able to disguise yourself.
Sam: We also have the hat.
Matt: The disguise kit?
Sam: His hat of disguise. Percy knows this town. Perhaps Percy should wear the hat.
Travis: Does it require attunement?
Sam: Just a few minutes, I think.
Taliesin: I already have the hat.
Sam: Yes, you had it from the dinner party.
Taliesin: I've been trying to think of what sorts of buildings would be the most defensible and the least likely to arouse suspicion. Things with basements?
Matt: A lot of the houses have basements. There are varying degrees of it. There are larger homesteads that were reserved for the actual nobles that ran the day-to-day life of Whitestone when your family was in power. As you heard from Desmond, probably the places where the new nobles live. Those are the ones that have the gates surrounding them: the larger homesteads scattered throughout the town.
Taliesin: That's too obvious.
Matt: It's far too obvious. There are many small abodes and even some farm-based hovels. The poor end of town is the farming side, which is the southwest, which is the closest area to where you guys made your stop earlier.
Taliesin: I would almost say a shopping district. If there's an abandoned storefront.
Matt: The shopping district is the center of town around the town square.
Laura: Around the Sun Tree?
Matt: Yeah. Right there.
Taliesin: Might be too close.
Sam: Before we go marching in there, finding an abode to live in is not going to be too difficult. We'll need food.
Laura: Are we living in there?!
Sam: Yes.
Taliesin: We're not going to be there for long.
Travis: We have dried food rations.
Taliesin: We have food rations. We have options.
Laura: We've got food for days.
Sam: We might be there for days and days.
Laura: We've got food for days.
Travis: We've got dried food rations.
Sam: We also have to go around town and, forgive me if I'm going too far with your plan here, but aren't we trying to win allies among the people?
Taliesin: I have a plan.
Sam: But we'll need to communicate with them. How?
Laura: He has a plan.
Travis: He has a plan.
Sam: (sighs) All right.
Travis: Come on. Drop your pants and get with the plan.
Marisha: What time is it? Have we gone to sleep, or are we waking up?
Matt: You guys are awake. After this discussion, I'd say it's about 8:00 in the morning. 8:30.
Taliesin: Let's make our way in.
Liam: This is the time.
Laura: We should stealth in.
Marisha: Are we doing the tree thing right now?
Matt: Actually, your travel to the city and you're on the outskirts of it now. It would be closer to 9:30.
Marisha: Okay.
Laura: Yeah. We try to get in.
Taliesin: We find a place to at least set up our operation.
Marisha: Well, that's what I was going to say. Do we want to find operations, try and recoup--
Liam: We don't really know what we're going to find this morning. Those big guys could still be there; we don't know.
Taliesin: We don't.
Liam: We don't know if there are people in the pocket of the Briarwoods here.
Travis: It's like 12% of a plan.
Marisha: If we take a day to get in and get settled, I can do a Heroes' Feast and then I start crack of dawn in the morning?
Liam: I think that's a good idea.
Taliesin: Let's get in and set up.
Liam: Hole up. Let's find a place.
Marisha: All right.
Sam: Wait, we're just going to walk into the city?
Taliesin: No, we're going to stealth into the city.
Sam: Okay.
Laura: We're going to cast Pass Without a Trace on everybody.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Beard check?
Travis: That was an eight.
Matt: Stealth?
Travis: Beard check.
Matt: Oh. (laughs) Your beard is pretty much at the fullest it'll ever be. You gather you can probably get a little more thickness to it, but your beard is at maximum, Grog. The fact that you even have a goliath with a beard is a feat of magic in its own right.
Travis: Amazing.
Liam: You would be a freak.
Travis: Is it like that Vidal Sassoon commercial? Whip it.
Marisha: That's dope.
Taliesin: Isn't that dope?
Sam: Grog, I've heard that no one in this town wears a beard.
Laura: Oh, natural 20 on stealth!
Travis: You can forget it. I won't go in.
Matt: So you guys are traveling as a group. I need stealth checks from everybody.
Taliesin: Do we have Pass Without a Trace?
Laura: Yeah.
Marisha: Can we each take a little bit of time to look more like commoners?
Taliesin: I'm wearing my hat, too.
Travis: Look like commoners?
Sam: I rub dirt all over my face.
Travis: Shit, I'm a goliath.
Laura: Plus, we have a bear.
Sam: You should try to look less handsome.
Marisha: Yeah, we do look like quite the motley crew.
Liam: I'm wearing a natural 20.
Sam: Okay.
Matt: Did you roll a natural 20, as well?
Liam: I did.
Matt: Both of you guys rolled natural 20s in stealth?
Liam: Had a little help with Luck, but I got it.
Matt: There you go.
Taliesin: That's really good, because I rolled a one.
Laura: Oh no.
Sam: We've got Pass Without a Trace, so 28.
Taliesin: 11.
Marisha: Still a failure.
Travis: Are we all going together? Are we not sending one person in to go find an empty building?
Sam: We're all going together.
Matt: You guys are all going together. You dirty yourselves up a bit. You're still a large goliath. You're still a few half-elves, a gnome.
Laura: There's still a bear.
Matt: Outside of illusion magic, you're still going to stick out like a sore thumb.
Laura: Could we cast illusion magic? Do we have it?
Sam: What's illusion magic?
Liam: I'm walking 50 feet in front of everybody else.
Laura: Seeming! To make Grog and Trinket look like commoners.
Liam: I'm 50 feet in front of everyone else.
Laura: Yeah, do that!
Marisha: Oh, yeah! Seeming us?
Sam: Sure. All right. I will cast Seeming on us.
Matt: This is a legit use of Seeming, too. Okay.
Sam: We'll all look like dirty--
Marisha: As opposed to the cows? Come on.
Sam: -- dirty, ragged peasants.
Matt: Trinket, as well?
Laura: Yes.
Taliesin: Trinket looks like a donkey.
Laura: No, he'll just be a really drunk peasant.
Marisha: A donkey. A mule.
Sam: Can I just say this? Can we just leave Trinket behind--
Laura: No!
Sam: I don't want to walk in there with a bear!
Laura: He'll look like a fucking donkey, or he'll look like another commoner.
Sam: I think I can only make us all look the same.
Laura: Then he'll look like a fucking commoner.
Matt: Of similar size. I believe, as far as Seeming is concerned-- If not, then I'll allow it for the purposes of this.
Laura: He'll look like a commoner--
Marisha: A Clydesdale!
Laura: -- a weird commoner.
Travis: Leave the bear.
Taliesin: A milk cow!
Laura: I'm not leaving a fucking bear on the outside of town where there's hounds around, and there's fucking vampires and birds flying around, fuck you!
Sam: Oh, wait, no! You can give each target a new appearance.
Matt: Yep!
Sam: So I can make everyone look a little different.
Matt: Each creature can seem a foot shorter or taller, or appear thin, fat, or in between.
Marisha: Make him look like a milk cow.
Matt: You can't change their body type. So, Trinket will still be a four-legged creature, but you can make him look like a different four-legged creature.
Laura: There you go!
Sam: Okay. He's a milk cow.
Liam: Real talk, real talk, Scanlan. My sister will cut you.
Travis: Or do you want him to be a donkey, something we can move. Milk cows are slow.
Liam: Bring the bear.
Taliesin: Donkeys can move more quickly. This is true.
Sam: All right. Donkey.
Laura: All right.
Sam: He's an ass.
Matt: All right, so Trinket takes on the form of a donkey.
Laura: (laughs) So are you darling, so are you.
Travis: Just like her owner.
Matt: The rest of you are a smattering of various humanoids, you--
Laura: (fake coughing)
Sam: I make myself look like a weird hunchback, sort of, not all there.
Matt: Okay, so you guys look like pretty rough peasants, dirty faces. You know, hair a little razzled. It looks like you've been living the harsh life on the outskirts of the slums of Whitestone for quite some time--
Travis: I wanted to be a model.
Matt: -- with a donkey.
Taliesin: (goat bleat)
Matt: So. You guys, utilizing your stealth checks and the Seeming, you make your way up to the-- which side of Whitestone are you coming in from?
Taliesin: Thank you for the double 20.
Matt: Percy?
Laura: Where are we coming up?
Taliesin: Coming in from the west.
Matt: Okay, so you come into this entrance here. You make your way into the center of town, blending in best you can. There are a few folks who see you enter, just give you a strange look. You all are unfamiliar to the denizens of Whitestone--
Travis: Oh shit.
Matt: -- but you don't look like a threat, per se. So you are noticed, and some people seem to just stop and watch you pass, but no one seems to make any active mention, note, or change in behavior towards it.
Travis: Are we checking buildings while we're walking through?
Laura: I have passive perception of 21; I'm always looking.
Liam: I walk over to just one random person on the street and say, anyone hiring hands? On farms?
Laura: Our farm burned down!
Matt: (laughs) Make a deception roll. I'll give you advantage on it because the Seeming does give you the visual perspective of being close to their type.
Liam: That is a four-- No, hold on--
Laura: No, no, no.
Liam: I'm gonna use Luck, that's the Luck.
Travis: Was the first number gonna be a 40?
Liam: No, it's not 40. So it's 14.
Matt: Okay. That's two Luck rolls, by the way, that you've spent.
Liam: Yeah, I know.
Matt: The woman you approach who's probably in her early 30s, pale blonde hair, looks like she actually might be losing it in some places, gives you a look and goes, "You poor people shouldn't be here."
Liam: We just need some work.
Matt: "You'll find it, but you're not going anywhere else. Welcome to Whitestone." She turns around and walks back, joining arms with apparently a man that she's paired with, and the two of them just walk away, a bit dumbfounded that people walked into Whitestone. As this happens, you glance over your shoulder and you see coming from the northern edge from this side wall-- (sounds of booming footsteps)
Laura: Oh, we should avoid that shit!
Matt: A very tall, noticeably undead giant with its jaw broken off and hanging from the hinge, dried, caked blood across its chest, it's just dragging this large club behind it.
Liam: Where are we? What are our surroundings right now?
Matt: You right now, you're in a T. To the right and left are roads that go along the inside of the wall that surrounds Whitestone, to the front of you is the path that leads further into the city.
Laura: Let's go into the city!
Travis: We casually begin--
Taliesin: I wanna head through the city, possibly in the direction of the cemetery.
Matt: Cemetery's over here.
Taliesin: Yeah, I wanna head in that direction.
Matt: All right. So you guys make your way through--
Laura: Keeping an eye out for, you know, buildings that look clustered and abandoned that we can hide in.
Taliesin: What's changed?
Matt: What you've noticed has changed is, one largely, the population is far more sparse than you recall. What was once a bustling city, you're now seeing about half as many people as you would would see this time of day. Going through, everyone seems to be in relatively poor health. There are a few buildings that look long-term abandoned, immediately in this area here, in the outskirts, catches your guys' eye. You do notice that the corner lamps that you had set up at the different corners of the streets appear to be shattered.
Travis: Interesting.
Matt: There would be like, you know, glass oil lanterns that at night someone would go around and light them after the sunset. The posts that hold them now are all either broken, or the glass itself has been shattered.
Marisha: They want it to be really dark.
Taliesin: They want it to be really dark. I'm also thinking about that cemetery.
Sam: We're not gonna live in a cemetery, that's super creepy.
Marisha: As opposed to all of the other things we've done?
Taliesin: Everything here is super creepy.
Laura: Is there any other abandoned buildings around?
Marisha: As opposed to sleeping in the Underdark?
Matt: There are plenty of buildings that look dark and mostly untouched in this section here, as you begin to move closer and closer inward.
Taliesin: Let's get east of the center square and set up camp.
Laura: Okay. Where's the castle? Is it on the top of the--
Travis: It's north.
Laura: Oh, it's that thingy? Okay.
Sam: We're trying to shoot for here?
Matt: Okay. You guys move this way, as you push towards the center of this here. You--
Sam: You speak Giant, Grog?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: You move past the center here and to the left of you, you can see the town square and there it is, the Sun Tree. Very, very large, you imagine beautiful tree at one time, full height was probably about 40 feet tall. The branches twist out, and almost look like they're hanging loosely, the ends, everything looks droopy and desolate; there's not a leaf on it.
Marisha: Can I do some sort of a check from a distance to see if I can recognize what kind of tree it is?
Matt: Make a nature check.
Marisha: 18.
Matt: Okay. It's hard to tell from this distance, there are a number of types of trees it could be. It's not indigenous to this land. The fact that it grew here means that either it was transplanted, or it was some sort of--
Marisha: Magical grower.
Laura: (sings) Divine Intervention!
Matt: -- magical creation for its presence.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: And you do see the silhouette of the eight figures slowly swaying from beneath the branches.
Travis: We continue on. Don't pay too much attention to it. Find a place to post up.
Marisha: Right. Don't get emotional.
Laura: If you, if you do your nature-y spell from inside a building, does it still do the same thing or do you have to be next to the tree while you're doing it?
Travis: That's a large radius, right?
Marisha: So the way the spell works, I can do it one of two ways. I can do it instantaneously, essentially grow up a whole bunch of plants and brush and shrubbery around me, or I can wait and I can concentrate for a while and instill a plant with vibrant--
Laura: Okay.
Marisha: -- life energy and heal the farmlands and it would stretch out for a really far radius.
Laura: Let's keep moving.
Marisha: I'm gonna probably wanna do more the second one.
Laura: Okay.
Travis: Do it from inside a house.
Matt: Did you guys want keep moving down this path, to go through the square, closer to the tree, do you want to go southward?
Marisha: I don't know, it's a central point.
Laura: We avoid the tree a little bit and just keep going straight.
Matt: Okay, so you're going this way.
Laura: Yeah?
Liam: There's a larger building, isn't there? I can't see--
Taliesin: Actually, I would say let's get a good look at the tree, let's walk by it.
Sam: Oh, we're gonna walk by the tree?
Marisha: Look like it's no big deal.
Travis: I know.
Matt: You guys turn left, and you make your way towards the town square. And as you enter the square, looking around, you can see there are what would have been carts and small booths set up for selling of meats and other goods, what was a small, you know, barter-and-sale based hub of this town-- nowhere near on the scale of Emon's bazaar, but you know, enough to support this town-- desolate. All look to be closed down and untouched for quite some time. As you get a closer look to the-- actually I'm gonna have you guys all roll perception checks. You're not getting too close to the tree.
Travis: Five.
Sam: Nine.
Liam: 26.
Laura: 19. No, that's a-- yeah, 19.
Marisha: 14.
Taliesin: 23.
Matt: As you guys are keeping on the outskirts of the square, it's hard to make out the details, and the weathering has muddled the figures that are hanging there. Percy and Vax, you guys notice the figure on the far left--
Liam: The body.
Matt: The body on the far left has red paint smattered across its face and its arms. It's wearing a dirtied, green, vest-like robe that dangles below it as it hangs there, loosely. Immediately to the left of it you see what looks to be the body of a child. The child is dressed up in a purplish, billowing shirt, very fine silk shirt and pantaloons, and is dangling there next to it. To the left of that you see what appears to be a female, adorned in greens and browns, looks like red paint has been driven through the hair, and dangles to the left of that figure. Next to that, you see what appears to be--
Taliesin: I am walking the fuck away.
Matt: -- you see what appears to be another woman, dressed in dark blacks and browns, leathers, some furs across the top, dark hair, dangling. To the left of that you see another man dressed similarly, dark greys and blacks, long dark hair, dangling. To the left of that you see a rather large man, older, rotund, probably in his forties, clothing padded but mostly open chest, hair completely shaven bald, it looks like there are dark scars placed across the face, hanging. To the left of that you see, this figure is actually not humanoid, you see what appears to have been--
Marisha: Oh my god.
Matt: -- a recently hunted bear, who is dangling.
Marisha: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Sam: Wait, what? Is that us?
Marisha: It looks like us.
Travis: What?
Marisha: It's us!
Sam: They killed people they thought were us, or they killed--
Liam: Or it's a message.
Sam: Or it's a message to us.
Marisha: Do they look like us or were they just dressed like us? Are they made to look like us?
Matt: Do you want to get closer and look?
Marisha: Yeah.
Taliesin: I'm a little curious--
Travis: Do you want to get closer and look? Are you sure--
Taliesin: Is there anything around the tree other than us?
Travis: They're probably watching the tree.
Taliesin: Is there something at the base of the tree, is there anything?
Matt: From what you can see now, nothing but just rocks and stones and piles of loose cloth rotting below it. Approaching, it looks like each one of these bodies has been dressed up. It looks like the color in the redhead's hair has been smeared through with paint. It looks like the person who has been painted red has been slapdash. You gather with a moment of looking at it that these were not individuals that were caught this way. This was set up as a message.
Laura: (whispers) My god.
Sam: Oh shit.
Laura: Keep walking, keep your head down and keep walking.
Marisha: Oh, my god.
Travis: I don't think they're here.
Marisha: Oh, my god.
Travis: I don't think they're here.
Sam: You mean in town? Of course they are!
Travis: No, remember they have to, like, be where the soil they came from is?
Laura: No, they have, like hideouts, they don't have to be where the soil they came from is.
Travis: I don't think they're here.
Sam: Holy shit.
Liam: They're in their keep, buried deep.
Travis: Okay.
Matt: You guys continue past, down this pathway. There's other buildings you see in the vicinity that, you know, look abandoned or for the most part unoccupied. I'd say about one in every three buildings looks like it's in disuse.
Liam: Did we see this big building right here as we walked by? Yeah, that big one.
Matt: You guys came-- made this path-- you can see a little bit, you can see is a--
Taliesin: I should know what it is, anyway.
Matt: -- iron fence, it used to belong to one of the noble families of Whitestone. Each one of these large buildings here, these three, and you remember this, were the three families that ran the town.
Taliesin: We can't go anywhere near those buildings. We have to stay as far away as humanly possible.
Marisha: Question. You said there were eight bodies?
Matt: Eight bodies.
Marisha: Is there one that looks like a gnome cleric and one that looks like a dragonborn sorcerer?
Laura: That was the first one.
Matt: The one's painted all red--
Travis: The one's painted all red--
Laura: There wasn't a gnome cleric one there.
Matt: No. There was a bear.
Liam: There was no cleric when we faced them before. All of us who stood against them in Emon.
Travis: We're all there.
Sam: Body of my guy. Is he sort of handsome?
Marisha: But, it does mean that it was because of when they saw us in Emon--
Matt: Think of an eight-year-old child.
Laura: It was a kid, yo.
Sam: Oh, it was a child? Oh, god.
Marisha: -- because Tiberius wasn't here with the crows.
Travis: No, it was because of Emon.
Marisha: It was because of Emon.
Laura: Yeah.
Marisha: So, can we get like a vague idea of how long these people look like they might have been here?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Marisha: (whispers) Fuck, I'm not good at this shit.
Taliesin: Can I help?
Matt: Sure. It would be advantage on that check for you.
Marisha: Oh, that, you know, that wasn't bad. Woo!
Taliesin: Oh! Never mind.
Marisha: I'll take that 19, 21?
Matt: 21? You gather these bodies have probably been here for the better part of a week, week and a half? There is some mild decomposition starting to settle in, there is a bit of bloating to some of them. Couldn't have been much longer than that.
Sam: A week? That's before we set out.
Marisha: Why would they put a warning for us here in the city?
Sam: They assumed we would come, but they don't know that we're here.
Taliesin: They invited us.
Liam: Those birds might have told them we were here.
Sam: This was a week ago, this was before we were even close.
Travis: Let's stick with the plan.
Taliesin: Sticking with the plan.
Sam: Let's go find a building.
Taliesin: Going to go find something that's a decent distance away from the three noble households, that has a reasonable view of the tree.
Travis: Yeah, 150 feet from the tree.
Matt: That would probably be somewhere in this vicinity here, as the three main houses are right there.
Taliesin: Something with a second-floor view, but with some distance.
Travis: Preferably three bedroom, three bath.
Matt: (laughs) I'd say make an investigation check.
Taliesin: Meh. Six.
Laura: Can I look out too, I've been on the lookout for a building the whole time!
Matt: Yeah. I'll say, I'll say it takes the better part of the next hour or so, and you do a little bit of meandering to find it, you guys are being stealthy best you can through alleys and such, but even so you are out in the open, midday, but you are also, you know, under Seeming.
Marisha: Does it look like there's a covering nearby, roughly, 30 feet or so from the tree?
Laura: 30 feet?!
Sam: 30 feet?
Matt: No.
Sam: What about 150?
Matt: No, the tree is out in the center, and essentially the nearest building is probably anywhere from 100, 200 feet away from it. It's the tree out in the middle of the square, and the square, which used to have probably more things towards the center, more temporary establishments, have all been put to the sides and put to disuse.
Sam: Maybe underground stuff.
Matt: You do manage to see what appear to be what was once a tavern or an inn of some kind that is silent, closed, the doors locked and chained. The windows look dusty.
Laura: Can we sneak in the windows, so it keeps chained?
Matt: Okay. You go around the side of it, to the alley.
Taliesin: Dust of tracelessness.
Laura: Yeah, Dust of tracelessness.
Sam: Are you guys going in?
Liam: Yeah.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Laura: Yeah.
Taliesin: This is where we're going to hole up.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: I kind of want to talk to the tree.
Laura: Then go talk to the tree, Keyleth.
Matt: The window is locked.
Sam: Wait, not now. Not now.
Travis: No, no, no, no, no, not yet.
Sam: Let's find a place first.
Travis: Let's post up first.
Liam: What am I, stealthing right now, or checking for--
Matt: Continuing your guys' stealth as your going, this would be your attempting to unlock the window.
Liam: Oh, unlock, okay. So that's a 22.
Matt: 22, okay. It takes a bit to jostle it in a way, because the lock is on the inside, but there are ways that you could shimmy the glass and get something underneath to push it aside. You manage to get the window open, and as you pull it up the dust billows up around you, you set it aside. You step in and the place smells stale, musty. Dark. There are, you can see, candlesticks set around that have not been lit for a while, and the oil lanterns that normally light the interior of the main tavern social area have been long in disuse.
Laura: Is there a cellar here?
Matt: If you guys want to look around. Are you all going in?
Taliesin: Yeah, we're all going in.
Travis: Yeah, we're all going in.
Matt: You as well? Or are you talking to the tree?
Sam: Yes.
Travis: Come inside.
Marisha: Does anyone want to come talk to a tree with me?
Taliesin: Not yet.
Laura: Not yet, not just yet.
Travis: Don't bring that-- don't mess with that thing.
Liam: Yeah, come with us. Keyleth, come with us.
Marisha: All right, all right.
Travis: Once we do it, it's like ringing a dinner bell.
Marisha: All right, all right, all right, I'm coming, I'm coming.
Sam: I'm gonna look for a brothel! (all laugh)
Taliesin: That's going to be the saddest brothel.
Marisha: The saddest brothel!
Matt: You find your way inside the abandoned tavern. And it is what was this giant L-shaped building, right here in the corner of the town square. There is a second floor, approximately runs 20 rooms. They are all currently unlocked, some of them left open, the bedding covered in dust, some of it looks like it was left in a hurry.
Travis: Yeah, we'll take it.
Matt: There is a cellar.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: You find the cellar, and down there, there are a number of empty barrels, and a couple of ones that are still full.
Sam: Ooh!
Matt: One that appears to be a heavy whiskey barrel, probably about twenty untouched wine bottles. A little bit of ale, but it looks like a lot of ale was either completely used, or taken with whoever left and abandoned the premises.
Laura: I think we can definitely use these for explosions, if we need them.
Marisha: Ooh!
Sam: Or to drink.
Taliesin: Muscle relaxers. Is there a view of the tree?
Matt: Going from a number of the rooms up top, not every room has a window, but it's like every third room on that side of the building does have a view of the entire square.
Marisha: Can I get an eye as to how far away it is?
Matt: I'd say probably about 200 feet? 250 feet?
Laura: Can you go invisible and still talk to the tree?
Marisha: Hmm?
Sam: I can make her invisible if she can talk to the tree.
Laura: Can you talk to the tree if you're invisible?
Matt: If you cast a spell while invisible, unless it's Greater Invisibility, then it will drop the illusion.
Sam: I can make her invisible.
Marisha: I got an idea.
Sam: We can burrow under, we can--
Laura: Yeah.
Sam: -- find something closer.
Marisha: Actually, what are we up to right now? Are we doing anything? Are we busy?
Sam: Well, there are windows on the first floor, right?
Matt: There are some windows in the tavern; there was one on the second floor.
Laura: We're in the cellar, that's why I went to the cellar.
Marisha: Oh, there's a cellar?
Sam: I'm gonna just find some old rags, or anything I can find, tablecloths, and just cover the windows.
Laura: But make it not obvious, because it doesn't want to look like we covered the windows.
Sam: True.
Liam: I've watched you pass through solid stone and earth. How long can you do that for?
Marisha: I mean, I can burrow us a tunnel right now.
Laura: Do it!
Liam: Can you get us close to underneath the tree?
Laura: That's what she's going to do.
Marisha: I'm going to do it right now. I'm going to cast Move Earth.
Laura: From the cellar.
Matt: You're going to start carving a tunnel--
Marisha: To the direction of the tree. And I want to be careful, I don't want to damage the roots of the tree at all. So, as I start getting closer, I want to start looking for the roots of the tree.
Matt: Okay. Easy enough to find old rags; all of them have that stale, musty towel scent to them. You get them a little wet. There's no water here; all the water here has dried out.
Sam: We use the wine.
Matt: You'll have to use the wine; it'll probably kill some of the bacteria. There are wells throughout the towns you see, ground wells that are set in the city. There is no nearby river. The closest river, the one you know about, is about a 30 minute walk south.
Taliesin: It's a bit of a ways.
Matt: Yeah. You use that to coax them out a bit. It's easy enough for you to go around and put cloth over the windows. It's a dark interior, so it's not like an immediate--
Taliesin: Just so light doesn't leak out.
Liam: But, just in case, I think I'll hang back. I'm not going down to the pre-made tunnel, I'll just keep an eye above ground.
Travis: I am, too, I'm staying up in the tavern.
Laura: I'm going with you to the tunnel.
Taliesin: I'm going to tinker a little thing. Can I borrow an arrow?
Laura: Yes.
Taliesin: Thank you. I'm going to tinker a very little, easy thing.
Travis: You want the top floor, I'll take the bottom floor.
Taliesin: I want to be able to fire and ignite one of the parchments on an arrow. So that I can--
Laura: Do you want me to shoot the arrow for you?
Taliesin: -- set a burn mark at a distance.
Matt: Interesting. Okay.
Taliesin: It would be a spark, as opposed to actual flame. It would just be concussive force.
Matt: Right, it's more getting the parchment there without it tearing or the arrow leaving it behind, because it is a thin, flimsy piece.
Taliesin: It would be coiled.
Matt: Coiled and then--
Taliesin: Hit, release.
Matt: That's going to be a really intricate-- go ahead and roll a tinkerer's check.
Liam: 20, 20, 20.
Taliesin: 16.
Matt: Okay. You toy with it for a while; you think you have something that may work. You're uncertain as to on its release if it'll function or not. So, write down 'Parchment Delivery Arrow' with a question mark next to it.
Sam: Maybe there's a simpler way.
Taliesin: There might be, but just in case there's not, I want to make sure this works.
Marisha: You could always slap it up there and shoot it with a flame arrow.
Taliesin: I've got three of them, so I've got options. But I just want to make sure--
Marisha: How's my burrowing going? 200 feet.
Matt: All right. You continue to burrow through the ground, moving the earth aside and the tunnel opens before you like the clay slowly melting away. And it is wet earth. Eventually, you start getting to a few thick roots under the tree.
Laura: Can you talk to it from here, Keyleth?
Matt: The roots that you see, they continue past the tunnel. They go very, very deep into the ground.
Marisha: Awesome. I'm going to clear out a little more area, and I'm going to touch the roots and cast Speak with Plants.
Travis: Holy shit.
Sam: Speak with Plants?
Liam: Haroom haroom.
Taliesin: The only superpower more pathetic than Aquaman's.
Laura: Yeah.
Marisha: Shut up.
Taliesin: Sorry, had to.
Laura: (kid's voice) Gee wiz, I wish I had some water.
Marisha: (kid's voice) The sun is so bright today!
Laura: Too bad we don't have Tiberius with us with his endless water fucking pitcher.
Liam: It's Ent voice. Haroom haroom!
Taliesin: Hi, Aquaman.
Laura: Sure, sure, sure.
Taliesin: Hi, Aquaman.
Sam: I can go to one of the wells and get some water.
Taliesin: Hi, Aquaman.
Marisha: Hey, he's cool sometimes.
Taliesin: Hi, Aquaman.
Marisha: Sometimes.
Taliesin: It's what fish say. Hi, Aquaman.
Marisha: That's what fish say.
Liam: That's all they say.
Taliesin: Hi, Aquaman.
Matt: You finish the spell and you reach out and you touch the root and you instill the force of your nature-based divine energies into the root. Silence.
Sam: Oh no.
Matt: This tree is dead.
Travis: No!
Sam: Dead?!
Laura: You can bring it back!
Marisha: I can bring it back. Should I?
Sam: You can do that?
Marisha: I'm a druid, that's my-- yeah man!
Sam: You can bring dead things back?
Marisha: Yeah, it's called Plant Growth!
Sam: What?!
Marisha: Yeah!
Sam: This I gotta see.
Marisha: Should I? Okay. But it's dead. What time is it now?
Matt: Right now, with all the traveling you guys have done, I'd say it's past noon, probably. Including the time you've spent inside the tavern, searching it through and preparing it as your base of operations.
Laura: Try it.
Marisha: Should I start it up now?
Sam: Yeah!
Liam: Go for it!
Laura: Go for it!
Travis: Go for it!
Marisha: I'm going to start my Plant Growth. I'm going to drop. Can I try to clear out an area where I can-- I should be fine.
Laura: Reach up in its junk.
Taliesin: Put your hand in it.
Marisha: I'm going to strap on my gloves.
Travis: Okay.
Liam: Turn and cough.
Marisha: Hope you guys are ready for this.
Sam: Is it going to be loud?
Marisha: No, it's just going to take a long time.
Travis: Vax and I are guarding the tavern, so if anything comes--
Sam: I'm going to get provisions ready to spoon-feed her.
Marisha: Actually, before I do that, can we all have one last meal together and eat a Heroes' Feast?
Laura: I like it.
Taliesin: Yes.
Matt: Certainly.
Taliesin: Let's eat.
Matt: So, you've made the purchase within Emon for how many of the requisite chalice for the Heroes' Feast?
Marisha: How many did I buy?
Taliesin: You have at least one.
Marisha: It gets used. It's expensive.
Laura: It's $1000.
Marisha: It's $1000.
Matt: It's a gem-encrusted bowl worth 1000 gold pieces, which the spell consumes. So, we'll say how many of those did you purchase in Emon, knowing you'd be casting this in the future?
Marisha: How much gold do we have?
Sam: Not a lot.
Laura: Is that for each person, or 1000 gold for the whole party?
Matt: For the whole feast.
Laura: How about you did three bowls?
Marisha: Three bowls.
Matt: Mark 3000 gold from the group's queue. And you have three gem bowls, using one now. So you have two bowls left at your disposal. And you prepare a Heroes' Feast for the group to consume.
Marisha: I take some of that leftover wine, use that to make it fancy wine.
Sam: This is great. This is awesome.
Laura: Are we eating in the cellar?
Marisha: So you get, I believe, 2d12 additional hit points on top of your maximum hit points.
Sam: Wait, forever?
Laura: No, no, for how long?
Marisha: For 24 hours.
Matt: It lasts for 24 hours.
Sam: 2d12?
Matt: So, until about--
Sam: What the fuck is a d12? I've never rolled a d12.
Matt: -- 2PM tomorrow. So mark that down, somebody note that it lasts until 2PM.
Laura: An additional 2d12?
Matt: 2d10?
Marisha: Oh, I'm sorry, 2d10.
Taliesin: Damn it.
Laura: Overall hit points.
Marisha: And, you should have- Ooh! I got two tens!
Laura: Ah, badass!
Matt: Trinket can also benefit from this, by the way, too.
Laura: Yay! Nice.
Taliesin: You also get other bonuses.
Matt: Yep. You are immune to poison, and diseases, and being frightened, and all wisdom saving throws are made with advantage. Feast is awesome.
Sam: Why don't we do that right before we go see the Briarwoods, also?
Laura: We have another bowl.
Marisha: We have two more bowls.
Sam: Because that is fucking awesome.
Marisha: Doing that right now, just in case the Briarwoods decide to come say hello.
Taliesin: Or any of the other terrible people who live in this town because there are terrible people in this town.
Travis: That was a delicious feast.
Sam: The tikka masala was tangy!
Marisha: So, we're immune to poison--
Matt: And disease and frightened. So, feast consumed, you now take your next eight hours--
Marisha: I'm going to go meditate. I'll be back in eight hours.
Matt: --to work on this. As she sits down to begin the ritual of cleansing, or bringing plant vitality enhancement to the vicinity of Whitestone. We're going to go ahead and end today's session there. Pick up at the end of that spell at the beginning of next week.
Taliesin: I love you all so much. I love you so much.
Matt: This is getting real interesting.
Marisha: What time is it?
Liam: It was like eight in the morning-ish when we found that building, yeah?
Matt: What?
Liam: Was it around eight in the morning when we got to that house?
Matt: You guys got to town around nine, 9 30.
Laura: So the spell probably started around 11.
Matt: Walking around, seeing things, finding the tavern. And then getting in there and cleaning it out. I'd say you're getting close to one, two o'clock now. You've also taken it slow, you're also being stealthy and not trying to be conspicuous as you move through.
Laura: Right, so we'll start the fight in the morning the next day.
Marisha: Well, I'm meditating now. I dropped into my meditation--
Sam: We're not starting any fight, we're forming an insurgency.
Marisha: Hopefully nothing happens and y'all don't have to defend me while I'm doing this shit. That's what I'm hoping for.
Taliesin: I have stuff to give you, too, 'cause, yeah.
Sam: Wow.
Laura: Man.
Taliesin: Thank you for letting me roll with that, by the way.
Matt: Of course. It fit right into my--
Taliesin: I had a funny feeling it would.
Matt: All right, guys. So we'll pick up from there next week, right in the center of the--
Marisha: A tree full of dead us? That's fucked up.
Laura: That's mean, Matt.
Taliesin: That was some mean shit, man.
Liam: That's what you call a giving tree.
Matt: It's a friendly place, Whitestone.
Sam: And the tree was happy. But not really.
Taliesin: Yeah, no, so that was it.
Matt: All righty. Well, I guess we have the announcements.
Zac: We have some donations.
Matt: Yeah, you guys are awesome.
Zac: And I wanna thank the chatroom for being on their best behavior tonight.
Laura: Thanks, guys.
Zac: Avoided the banhammer.
Sam: The what?
Zac: They avoided the banhammer.
Taliesin: There was no banhammer?
Zac: Not by me, anyway. There's always a couple trolls that find their way.

Zac: Another big charity cause tomorrow. Where you're on drums. So tomorrow the Battle of the Bands from 5-7PM. Your team, in case you don't know, is you, Felicia Day, Tom Lenk, and Josephine, one of our mods. See, Felicia was doing this thing where she was like, what team could I put together that will immediately win fan-favorite without doing any actual work? So we saw your plan, Felicia, and we came back with our team of Lucas, Mr. Spoopy in the back, running the tech board.
Matt: Heck yeah.
Zac: Augie, who is a professional drummer, Hector, and Amy Dallen, and we know, between Amy and Josephine, our chat room is definitely going to be split on who's the chat room favorite, so.
Matt: So is the professional drummer on bass?
Zac: No. Definitely not. He is not on bass.
Taliesin: You dropped Whitestone.
Zac: He is not on bass. Lucas is able to play all songs on Expert on guitar, I think you guys are gonna have your work cut out for you. For sure.
Matt: It's all good.
Zac: For sure. They also work here almost all week, and practice after all the shows. (laughs)
Matt: That's cool.
Taliesin: Is that what you do?
Matt: I prefer to light my opponents on fire while they're drumming, 'cause I find that's a good challenge for their skillset.
Zac: Oh, that would make sure a good show. I'm very okay with it. Like, let's go for it. It's for charity, let's just do it.
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: I wanna say, we had a studio audience for this show as well, which we're very thankful for.

Taliesin: Thanks for just stopping by. That was cool.
Marisha: Yeah. Yeah.
Matt: Seriously, man. Thank you so much.
Alec: Thanks for having me.
Matt: Of course, buddy. And guys, thank you all so much for tuning in. Hope you enjoyed it. We'll be back next week, Thursday. I guess we'll end here with a is it Thursday yet? Have a good night, guys.

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voi-- (gibberish) voice actors. It's been a long year, a lot of us voice actors-- Look, there's very high nerves in the studio right now 'cause tonight's going to be crazy. A bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons & Dragons. Tonight's going to be an intense episode but before we get to that, let's go ahead and get through our announcements for the evening. First and foremost, we have an amazing sponsor tonight. We have Backblaze. (cheering)
Laura: We love you, Yev!
Matt: Our final episode of the year. So Sam, you have a few words on that?
Sam: Yeah well, you know Backblaze is unlimited cloud backup for Macs and PCs for just $5 a month. You can go to backblaze.com/criticalrole for a full 15-day free trial, and I was going through my library. You know I have a whole library?
Matt: It's pretty impressive, actually.
Sam: Yeah and I dug up an old poetry book and buried inside there was a very curious poem by a young Dr. Seuss.
Travis: Oh really?
Sam: Yeah.
Matt: That's worth a lot of money.
Sam: I know, I know. I thought I would read it for you all today.
Travis: Doesn't even look yellowed or anything.
Sam: He printed it on his laser printer.
Travis: Oh good. (laughter)
Sam: But it happens to concern Backblaze. The drive did not spin. It just clacked and it clicked. I rebooted and prayed and gave it a swift kick. But my data was gone, poof, every byte and bit. And I cried, "How I wish I had backed up my shit!" But who should appear in a car that he revved? A zingity zangity furry red Yev. The Yev jumped through my window, he pounced on my mouse and said, "You must have wished Backblaze to your house." But I looked at him cross, shouting, "What do you mean? My files are corrupt. This is one dead machine." He just laughed and said, "You daft binkle blot, Backblaze works whether you remember or not. Your pics of your kids and the food that they eated, all stored on the cloud. Nothing's ever deleted. Your docs, Firefox, alarm clocks, and your socks will all be restored from our miracle box." The Yev yelled, "Don't worry from midnight to morn, we save all your stuff, your taxes and porn. Your music and apps are safe on Backblaze." And with that, the Yev tipped his hat, "Good day." So remember, go visit backblaze.com and find the red Yev sing-singing his song. Let them take care of you heart and soul and tell him you're sent there by Critical Role.
Travis: Damn! Man, I don't know if that was Dr. Seuss or Lin-Manuel but that was great.
Liam: It was sweet and offensive. By the way, Sam, that's a very handsome hoodie you're wearing. I can't wait to open you up like an advent calendar later.
Sam: Oh! There's nothing offensive to Matt Mercer under this shirt. It's just another shirt progression to inspire us. This one goes four deep. (yelling)
Laura: It looks like your tiny little weenus is--
Travis: You're shirt-cocking your own mouth!
Matt: I am so happy!
Sam: It's to inspire us in our final fights. It might be the last time I'm ever on this show, so I wanted it to be five of me.
Matt: For the power of five Sams. Thank you, Sam, and thank you, Backblaze, for being our awesome sponsor for our episode tonight. You guys are awesome. We have a great video for you to watch from them at the break.
Laura: Wait. Can I say, Yev, about the stuff? All the little pictures you see in the different videos, he's giving some of those away tonight? Giving some away! If you sign up for Backblaze or if you have signed up for Backblaze already, you're entered into the competition. And then you can win them, and we've signed them, and it's wonderful. Did I say it right?
Sam: Yep, you did great.
Laura: Okay. Cool.
Matt: It was pretty bad. As a quick addendum, while they're not officially sponsoring the show tonight, our friends at Loot Crate, who sponsored us for a large portion of the year as well, wanted us to give you a heads up about their current Halo Legendary crate. It's filled with a bunch of exclusive Halo figures, collectibles and in-game items. If you're a Halo fan, this has some exclusive stuff that comes through Loot Crate in that specific crate. You can go to lootcrate.com/LDNHalo to check it out. You can use the code "LDNHalo," all one word, for a discount to that. The cutoff for orders is tonight, so if you plan to do that, you might want to check it out in the next couple of hours. Now's your chance to do it, go. Do it, it's awesome. Right. That's our sponsorship. Couple of other things to mention. We will be returning January 5th, will be our returning episode in 2017. The new year. We'll pick up wherever tonight leaves off.
Liam: Those characters are going to be awesome.
Matt: You have so much faith in yourselves! It's very possible. No. So yeah, we'll be back January 5th. We wish you guys a very very merry holiday, in all your celebrations, and your families, and your New Year's, and all that crazy stuff. We'll have more of that at the end of the episode, but we'll see you back then. We have a merch shout-out, actually. Laura, if you want to talk about what we have up on the store for them?
Laura: That's a good question. I have no idea what's in the store tonight. I have no sheet in front of me, and I have no idea what's there. I think there's some hats left, I know there are some hats--
Travis: The dice got restocked.
Laura: No, they did not. No, the dice did not get restocked, the dice are coming back in, like, January, so there's a lot more coming in January, so that's good. I have no idea what else is in the store though. A hat? There's a hat.
Matt: There you go.
Laura: Shit, I got nothing.
Sam: You are the best.
Laura: You guys, I'm focused on spells, and I'm focused on arrows, and hit points and-- (gasps) And the patches! And our mugs!
Matt: If you go to the Geek and Sundry store under Critical Role, you'll see merch! That's our announcement for the evening!
Laura: There's still patches left, you guys! That's pretty cool! Yeah, the hats are still there. There's only a few left, though! There's only a few hats left, I know that for sure.
Marisha: Only a few hats left.
Marisha: And they're gone.
Taliesin: And they're gone.
Laura: Sorry. I'm stressed!
Marisha: Yes, tomorrow we have a last-minute special edition Signal Boost episode that is a stocking stuffer edition. Yeah, coming out tomorrow, and it's got, like, coupons in it, so you should watch it. And also: everyone likes coupons!
Taliesin: That's true.
Marisha: End of statement. Also, there was a playlist that we put out that is a collection of all of the artists that we have boosted over the year.
Taliesin: Except one.
Marisha: Except for one because they're not on Spotify and it's not my fault. But yeah, go check it out and I also wrote a little thing giving some insight into the background of the show.
Matt: It's a great write-up, I recommend you guys check it out. Even if you haven't watched Signal Boost, it's a great write-up. I recommend it. Thank you, Marisha.
Marisha: You're welcome. I'll be here all week. Yeah, not really, it's Christmas time.
Matt: This is a pretty cool announcement. After a back and forth for the past year, we just got approval from Blizzard Entertainment to incorporate their music from their game projects into our Critical Role soundtrack.
Sam: For the final fight?
Matt: I've incorporated a few tracks for tonight's battle, as well as a couple of community-made tracks that have been submitted over time, so we'll have some fresh tracks for the evening. But, Blizzard, thank you so much, thank you to Woody Day, and a bunch of the guys who have helped out over there to make this happen. We're excited to include those amazing soundtracks into our atmospheric background tracks in future episodes.
Liam: I was not prepared. Oh! I'm fired, aren't I?
Matt: Yeah, you are. Anything else anyone wants to mention real fast?
Brian: (distantly) Critmas!
Matt: Oh yes. (laughing) Thank you, disembodied voice of Brian Wayne Foster, ghost of Christmas Tuesday. Next Tuesday we have a special Critmas episode of Talks Machina. A bunch of us are opening your awesome Critmas presents, and we'll be showing the videos the community submitted about what Critical Role means to them, to you, and to us! So check it out next Tuesday in the usual spot. I think that's it. All right, cool! Then let us go ahead and bring the tension up as you guys wander into the flaming core of Emon to show down with Thordak, the Cinder King, on tonight's episode of Critical Role. [dramatic music]
Matt: Welcome back. So! Last we left off, Vox Machina, after spending the better part of a number of months traversing the Prime Material Plane and planes beyond in search of ancient relics known as the Vestiges of Divergence, they finally increased their abilities, they've made allies, and they've begun their trek to tear down the collection of evil chromatic dragons known as the Chroma Conclave that destroyed your city of Emon and took over most of the continent of Tal'Dorei and beyond. You've defeated and you've slain three members of the Conclave, allied with a fourth, and you've made your way, along with an army combined with the powers of Fort Daxio and Syngorn, to the central city of Emon. Utilizing aid from the Ashari people to cover the skies as the armies began to assault the outer walls, you, along with Zahra, Kashaw, Jarett, Gilmore, the whole party, everyone's there, Kima--
Travis: Britney Spears, NSYNC--
Sam: My other brother.
Matt: Drake's staying back with the army to help them with the assault. You guys made your way underneath through the sewer system, made a brief alliance with some wayward Clasp who led you to the center of town where the volcanic essence of Thordak's mutated draconic form has been pulling volcanic activity up beneath the city. You climbed out on top and there, at the walled gates to the central Cloudtop District, which Thordak now calls his home and his lair, you saw two fire giants guarding the entrance. Kashaw and Zahra, in a heroic display, bound the giants to place and decided to take care of them while you rushed into the fray, bursting through the door due to the strength of your Titanstone Gauntlets. You rushed into the cloud, smoke, and ember-filled Cloudtop District ruins, jumping from ruined building to wreck of rubble and stone. The air itself is dense and black with dark fume and it's hard to see anything. You all carefully, gingerly, stealthily made your way into the alcove of one ruined building, where across the way, you see a giant raised central cavern, a hole, a burrow, if you will, that is close to 40 feet across. Apparently, your approach was somewhat sensed by the red dragon himself, as you watch Thordak emerge from this burrow and climb out saying to itself, "It appears we have visitors." (sound of liquid pouring)
Sam: I'm really nervous. (laughter)
Matt: So, as Ashley unfortunately can not be with us, Pike's control and duty will be taken care of by the twins for the evening. You guys will be dual cleric-ing tonight.
Laura: We're Jaegering.
Matt: Indeed. At this point in time, you guys are all keeping as still and as quiet as you can while figuring out your circumstances. You can hear the low growling voice of Thordak as he begins to scan the vicinity. (growling)
Marisha: Potions! Potions!
Sam: Oh, good idea, good idea.
Laura: I take fire resistance.
Matt: Fire resistance? Fire resistance, fire resistance--
Liam: Am I able to make a jello shot of invulnerability and haste at the same time?
Laura: But you know they only last for one minute each. Just wait for like a second. Just wait. Fire resistance lasts for a while, I passed them out, so if you've got them, take them.
Matt: Okay, so we have Scanlan, Keyleth, Vex, Grog, all with fire resistance? And Percy? All right. That's pretty much everyone but you, I believe, right?
Laura: Oh, but he's got the armor--
Matt: So yeah, the entire party, thank god, is set to resist fire. That may help your chances here. As you all guys quietly begin to drink and figure out your circumstances--
Travis: Why are you laughing? Why'd you laugh?
Matt: Because I was rolling Thordak's perception check to see if he noticed any of your presences as you were drinking the potions. I got a natural one.
Laura: Wow, just drinking a potion would make him notice us?
Liam: "I guess I'll go back to sleep now."
Matt: He's still scanning, and he's still like, "We can sense you here. Where are you?" And you hear (heavy footsteps).
Sam: Should I cause a distraction?
Laura: I cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us.
Matt: Okay. What are the components of that spell? Let's take a look here.
Laura: It can't be vocal because it's Pass Without a Trace-- oh no, it's verbal.
Matt: Yep!
Laura: No, I don't do that! I don't know what those things mean!
Travis: You better get your shit in gear.
Laura: It's a whisper. Tell me it's a one! Tell me it's a one!
Matt: That was not a one.
Travis: I mean, let's be clear, what are we really going to hide from? Look where his fucking head is. He's like the sun. We ain't hiding from that shit.
Laura: He may have heard us, but now we've got plus ten stealth.
Matt: So, as you guys are all quietly huddled over in this broken space there, Vex'ahlia begins to do her incantation beneath her breath and as you feel the shadows cling to you, you hear in the distance, "Ah. There you are."
Travis: I just want to pee on myself and run.
Matt: He has currently moved out to this area, and began to asses the scenery. I need all of you to roll initiative. (screaming)
Laura: Already!? Take your potions!
Liam: I can't, we're into initiative, right? It's too late for potions.
Matt: You took your fire resistance potions. That's all you had time to do.
Marisha: That's not too bad, not too bad.
Taliesin: That will do.
Laura: Who's rolling for Pike?
Liam: I'll do it. I got 11, plus what?
Laura: I don't think she has anything, so--
Matt: Pike has no bonus.
Travis: 14. Oh wait, you ask them, in order.
Laura: I'm freaking out, shit, I'm sorry, I thought I was helping.
Matt: Vex, what did you get?
Laura: 13.
Matt: 13 for you? All right.
Liam: 12, and Pike got 11.
Taliesin: Pretty good for Pike.
Laura: That is pretty good for Pike.
Marisha: That is pretty good for Pike.
Matt: Keyleth?
Marisha: 17.
Laura: Good.
Marisha: Yeah, it's pretty good for Keyleth. Oh god.
Matt: Percy?
Taliesin: 25. Fast, fast.
Sam: Eight. I'll be bringing up the rear. That's how I like it anyway.
Liam: While we're cowering here, Pike says, "Guys, I think I could really help you out if you wait a second. Okay?"
Laura: Oh, Pike didn't even get a chance to--
Travis: Were we supposed to have a Heroes' Feast?
Laura: We did, we did have a Heroes' Feast.
Travis: I'm so glad, I was totally here last week.
Laura: We're all immune to fear and poison still, we all have advantage on wisdom.
Matt: You do indeed.
Taliesin: And extra hit points.
Matt: All righty. So! With that, beginning of the round, at the very top: Percival. You glance around the corner and you see sifting through the large columns of smoke that are billowing off each one of these destroyed, burning buildings, you see the gargantuan form of Thordak (heavy footsteps) and looks right over. You see all of a sudden as his eyes pass in your direction, almost like a cat caught in a light beam, as his eyes flare up with bright white light as it sees your presence.
Taliesin: Okay.
Travis: What do you see?
Taliesin: It's coming. Is there room, can I get even vaguely a shot in that room?
Matt: From here, at his size, you could get a shot if you moved a little bit.
Taliesin: I'll move a little bit.
Matt: Jump between these folks there.
Taliesin: I have Spider Climb on right now, so actually I'll climb up on the wall and then climb back down when I'm done.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: I'm going to-- Ignore that, I've been drinking. First of all, I'm going to cast Hex on him. Because that's really going to make a difference.
Travis: No, it is! Stay positive!
Taliesin: What kind of checks should I-- I'm going to down him for--
Marisha: I feel like he's real good at everything.
Laura: Like, wisdom, or something.
Taliesin: I'm going to give him a disadvantage on dexterity checks. Because fuck it. All right, I'm going to take out Bad News, and I'm going to take two shots, which is my way, with Hex and Bad News, and hopefully everything's going to go just fine. I'm going to use Sharpshooter, and I'm going to use Deadeye on the first one. I'm going to drop a point on Deadeye. So, Deadeye roll-- That should have counted, damn it, I shouldn't have picked it up. Oh, thank god. That's-- sorry, I'm blanking. 26 to hit.
Matt: That hits.
Travis: That's a good sign.
Taliesin: Yeah, let's not start saying that now. And that's-- wow, I'm nervous!
Sam: Wow!
Taliesin: That's actually really good. First shot is 21, 37 points of damage plus five points of necrotic damage.
Matt: In addition to 37? That's nice.
Taliesin: That's really nice. I rolled really high, and I have Sharpshooter running.
Matt: Good opening shot.
Taliesin: Next one, I'm going to shoot Sharpshooter, but no Deadshot. Is an 18 to hit?
Matt: Nope.
Taliesin: Okay, second one misses. I'm going to crawl back and hide again and get a little bit of-- yeah, I got up on top, took two shots, and crawled back down to hide.
Matt: All right, as you climb up to the top, you slam Bad News over the top of the stonework, and as soon as the barrel catches a little bit of the light through the smoke, you watch as Thordak's face whips over in your direction. (gunshot) The first shot smashes across the crest on the front of the dragon's face. You see sparks fly, and bits of flame, red crystal get shattered in the distance. The head spins back towards you, and immediately you start shaking, and you fire the second shot and it ricochets off of its angry, thick hide. You immediately duck back behind the wall.
Taliesin: I'm regretting so many things right now! Not you! Oh god! I shouldn't avoid my family. It leads to dragons.
Matt: In all of your focus, and all of your attention into the arrival, and the crawl into this, and Thordak, none of you noticed that Larkin is not with you.
Laura: No surprise there.
Matt: Keyleth, you're up.
Laura: Piece of shit.
Marisha: Piece of shit. Okay, I don't know what to do here? What are we trying to do? Do we have a plan? Should I try and burn a big spell?
Sam: Do whatever you do! We've been practicing for this our whole lives.
Marisha: Okay, before I do something crazy, based off of Percy saying that, I turn to Vex and I go, by the way, I've been meaning to ask you about that, if he ever followed through, so stay alive, we can talk later! Okay! And I pop over the corner and I'm going to cast Tsunami?
Sam: I've never heard you say those words.
Liam: No, it's not.
Matt: So you're casting Tsunami.
Liam: She did this once and wrecked our enemies.
Marisha: That was Tidal Wave, this is like a big daddy version of that.
Liam: It's worse than that?
Marisha: This is my 8th-level spell. So I create a wall 300 feet high, 300 feet long, and 50 feet thick of water.
Matt: You watch as the smoke is instantly replaced with steam in the vicinity, completely filling the area with fog, as this giant wall of water is conjured out of the broken, cracked, dry earth and begins curling over towards Thordak's front side. All right, so, strength saving throw-- Wait, any Huge or smaller creature.
Laura: Is he bigger than Huge?
Matt: He is bigger than Huge.
Laura: So it doesn't have any effect on him? Is he bigger than 300 feet?
Marisha: Yeah, he's not bigger than 300 feet, is he?
Matt: It's big, but the sheer mass size-- You watch as the tidal wave smashes into Thordak and splits and falls around him, no effect. His form is too big--
Marisha: None at all?
Matt: The water crashes against him, he's too big for it to actually have an impact on him.
Liam: Are there any fires left burning in the vicinity?
Matt: Actually, this fire is out now, this fire goes out, and water spills down into the tunnel and you watch a bunch of steam (whoosh) rise out of it.
Marisha: Well, it's also a six-round spell, and he's supposed to get stuck in it. Nothing? No.
Matt: He's too big.
Laura: He doesn't even get damaged at all, though?
Travis: Does he question his choices in life?
Marisha: Because I'm questioning mine.
Matt: It says any Huge or smaller creature inside the wall has to make a saving throw or take damage, creature caught in the wall can move, but yeah, it only seems to have an effect on--
Sam: Well, that was a valiant effort.
Matt: I was with you. But, hey, 8th-level spell!
Sam: You got tons of 8th-level spells, you'll be fine.
Marisha: "But, hey, 8th-level spell?" Did you just say that to me?
Matt: Sorry! I'm sorry! I didn't mean to.
Marisha: Holy fuck.
Sam: No problem.
Taliesin: I would get back behind the wall if I were you.
Matt: So Keyleth, do you want to use the rest of your movement?
Sam: Don't get back behind the fucking wall, don't get back behind the wall, we're all bunched up. Go somewhere else.
Travis: Scatter.
Laura: I know how painful this is right now, Keyleth, but it looked really cool. Just run.
Liam: Our pores are cleared-- the steam--
Taliesin: The wall will at least take some damage at this point, most things he's going to do are going to be a giant area effect anyway that you're not going to be able to outrun, you might as well have cover--
Matt: Oh, wait, hold on--
Sam: Judges weighing in.
Matt: Sorry, I scrolled past that part there-- Each creature has to make a saving throw, so it does affect him the first round. It does.
Marisha: Just on the first round, though?
Laura: Still, that's something!
Matt: Each turn after that-- so, yeah, basically as it gets smaller it affects less and less creatures. Sorry, I scrolled past that one.
Marisha: So it just doesn't keep him restrained?
Matt: That is a 21.
Sam: What's your spell DC?
Marisha: 20.
Matt: So it takes half-- so roll 6d10 and it takes half damage.
Sam: Oh, that's something!
Laura: That's better than zero!
Marisha: It's better than-- yay, 8th-level spell, to quote Matt Mercer.
Taliesin: That will be our next t-shirt, "Yay, 8th-level spell."
Matt: It's fine. keep digging. This is my battle against you guys.
Marisha: I'm not digging!
Laura: No, no, not at all! We're very happy with that!
Marisha: 26, 35, halved.
Matt: Okay, half of the 35--
Marisha: But it's not going to do anything to him on subsequent rounds?
Sam: 17 points, that's something!
Laura: Is there water all over the ground, though?
Matt: It says here that at the start of each of your turns after the wall appears, the wall along with any creatures in it move 50 feet away from you. So it will move him 50 feet back, unless he gets out of it.
Marisha: Yeah, it says any Huge or smaller creatures must make a strength saving throw in order to move.
Matt: Correct. He can move through it fine, he's too big now, he doesn't take the additional damage in following rounds.
Marisha: So he gets to move out of it no problem? Is that essentially the deal?
Taliesin: But he is picked up for 50 feet, though.
Marisha: Yeah, but is he moved back?
Matt: It still has to try and make an athletics check against your spell DC to move at all, but it doesn't take any additional damage.
Marisha: All right, I'll take that.
Matt: It's her first time using this spell, guys, so be patient, we're figuring this out as we go.
Taliesin: I would say also just because Pike was going to do a thing, so come back for Pike's thing that she was going to do.
Marisha: Pike's going to do a thing?
Liam: So is he.
Laura: I feel like, run, Marisha, 'cause the thing that Pike's going to do is--
Marisha: Is that an AOE thing that she's going to do?
Laura: Yeah, but just go.
Marisha: All right, here's what I'm going to do, I'm going to move in this area over here. Kind of poke into this building?
Matt: That's as far as you can get with your full movement.
Marisha: No, no, I don't want to go that way, I want to go behind-- sorry, this isn't very--
Matt: Over here?
Marisha: Yes, that way. Thank you.
Matt: That right there is as far as you can get with your full movement.
Marisha: Yeah, sure. Yeah.
Sam: It's going to be great.
Marisha: It's going to be so great, it's going to be great.
Matt: All right, that ends Keyleth's turn. Jarett is going to go ahead and rush around here. Pulling out his heavy crossbow, he's going to go ahead, as he runs past, releasing a bolt towards Thordak-- two bolts, actually, that is a-- nope, that misses. That also misses. Well, they both hit, but they both splinter across his hide. All right, Jarett's going to make the full move behind this wall and begin loading another bolt. "It's all right, we got this!"
Sam: He's dead.
Matt: It is now Gilmore's turn.
Sam: Shaun Gilmore!
Laura: I'm sorry. I don't know how I just stole two pencils.
Liam: I do.
Matt: Gilmore is going to-- As he watches Jarett rush off and Keyleth rush back around the wall, watching the wall of water crash past the dragon, goes, "All right. It's been a while since I've had to do this." And he points his finger up towards the dragon's head, and you watch as this green spark shoots this single green beam in the direction of the dragon's face.
Travis: Please hit his face. Please hit his face. Please hit his face.
Laura: Hit him, Gilmore!
Matt: Let's see if it makes its dexterity saving throw. That is-- yeah, he succeeds. Against the spell DC, yeah, he succeeds with a 19. He goes and fires and you watch as Thordak sees the beam glimmer out of the fingers and he ducks down and it fires past, dodging between the side of the head and the beam goes casting out that way, no effect.
Travis: Shit hammer.
Laura: What level spell was that, Gilmore?
Matt: "6th."
Marisha: I look at him and I go, yeah, 8th, I feel you, man.
Matt: "It's okay, we've got this."
Marisha: Fucking sucks, bro, all right, let's do this.
Matt: And he's going to go ahead and--
Liam: I don't understand all this arcane terminology.
Matt: "Scatter, right?" He pushes past and goes running this way. All right, that's going to end his turn. Grog!
Travis: Yeah, I see Gilmore take off running, and being there's a giant T-Rex on the map, I'm going to go, "Must go faster, must go faster--" And I would like to run as fast as balls this way towards this cover as far as I can for 50 feet.
Matt: Okay. You get right about there, as Thordak has the same initiative as you.
Travis: Oh!
Matt: Thordak, who has dodged the beam, and is seeing the ants begin to scatter in front, goes, "Moving targets--"
Travis: Glad I joined Gilmore!
Matt: "We love moving targets." And he's going to step forward--
Laura: No! Don't move!
Matt: --and is going to rear back and (inhales) (whoosh) and unleash Flame Breath.
Sam: Oh, Kiki, you're okay!
Laura: You made it!
Matt: I need Vex, Percy, Vax, Pike, Scanlan, Trinket, Grog, and Gilmore to all make dexterity saving throws. Hold on to that number.
Taliesin: Does partial cover help at all?
Matt: No. The flame is like napalm.
Taliesin: I'm rerolling that.
Matt: Kima fails. Gilmore rolls a one! Are you serious?
Laura: Did you roll for Pike?
Taliesin: That's a little better.
Sam: Can I Cutting Words to do anything?
Travis: The Ancient Dragon?
Matt: Cutting Words actually can reduce the damage.
Sam: Just the damage, not his attack?
Travis: We'll take the damage reduction.
Sam: Will it reduce the damage for everybody?
Matt: I'm double-checking that. I'm pretty sure it does.
Sam: If so, I will do that.
Taliesin: I just had to use a Resolve.
Laura: What did you roll?
Taliesin: A one. So I had to burn a Resolve, which I have done.
Matt: Yeah, so you can reduce the damage by a certain amount for everybody.
Sam: It won't be much, but I'll do it.
Taliesin: It'll help.
Laura: And then he's got disadvantage on something next, doesn't he? After you use Cutting Words?
Matt: Yes.
Sam: Yes.
Matt: All right, so--
Sam: So as he goes, I will yell at him, oi! What sexual position makes the ugliest children? I don't know, ask your mama! (laughter)
Matt: Wow. That's a thing.
Liam: I like to think of all of Vox Machina nervously laughing.
Matt: She has advantage on her saving throw-- Kima does make her saving throw! All right, so! Go ahead and roll your d12 and it will reduce the damage.
Sam: Guys, you can reduce that damage by five.
Laura: Sweet.
Sam: So instead of 150, it's 145.
Matt: No, instead of 99 points of fire damage, it is 94.
Sam: 94!
Matt: 94 points of fire damage.
Laura: 9d4?
Matt: It was 99, now it's 94.
Taliesin: Does the five get subtracted before we halve it, or after?
Matt: It reduces the damage of the attack.
Laura: And then if we have fire resistance, then it-- But what if we rolled 28, did we make our save?
Matt: Grog, what was your--?
Travis: 17.
Matt: Nope.
Laura: 28?
Matt: Yes.
Liam: 24.
Matt: 24--
Sam: Oh shit. He has to look?
Matt: You just make it.
Taliesin: 24 is a "just made it?"
Liam: So I take zero, because I'm using Evasion.
Matt: Yes you do.
Marisha: I didn't have to roll.
Taliesin: 18.
Matt: 18, nope.
Sam: 21.
Matt: 21, nope.
Laura: And Trinket and Pike both fail as well.
Matt: Okay. Thankfully, that's half damage. So that would be, at half of 94, 37-- I'm sorry, no, 47. 47 points of fire damage to Grog, to Percy, to Scanlan--
Laura: Pike and Trinket.
Matt: Well, Trinket does not take half.
Sam: Wait, I thought you said I didn't save.
Laura: Takes the full 90-- Trinket is in my necklace. Again, already.
Matt: Trinket goes right into your necklace.
Sam: Wait, wait, so I get 94 or 47?
Matt: You didn't succeed, so you would take 94, but because you have fire resistance, you take 47.
Sam: Oh, okay! That's not bad!
Matt: You take half of 47, because you have fire resistance and you made the save.
Laura: So 23. 24.
Travis: Tell me he has only one of those per day.
Matt: Nope, that regenerates.
Laura: 23 or 24?
Matt: It would be 23.
Sam: And Matthew DM, do our temporary hit points go away first? Or last?
Taliesin: They're technically not temporary, it's actually your max increases, so they can come back.
Matt: Correct, they can come back, yeah.
Taliesin: You can heal into them.
Travis: Did somebody get temporary hit points?
Sam: We all did. 17, from our feast.
Laura: Oh, that's right, Pike has-- I need to--
Taliesin: You're 17 up. You can go 17 up even if you lose them.
Travis: Right, well I'm going to add them now.
Taliesin: Your max is now much higher.
Travis: Oh, thank you, that's much better.
Matt: Okay. Kima's doing okay, but Gilmore is looking rough. As the flames burn through, hyper white, red, orange, blazing fire, you haven't felt heat like this before. You instinctively close your eyes, but it doesn't seem to help. As the flames pass by you, Keyleth, you can even feel the impact from here, singeing your eyebrows, and you have to cover your face for fear of being disfigured by the proximity. As the fire eventually burns away, Gilmore is like stumbling right now, burned all around. The rest of the party is already smoking, bits of your outfits and edges of clothing are now actually curling up and burning. That was bad. So that ends Thordak's go. Grog?
Travis: Well, being that my run was so rudely interrupted by shit-chest over there, can I change course seeing that he's going to barf fire at all of us and run straight at him in a rage?
Matt: Yes, you may.
Travis: Yeah, can we go ahead and see how we do here, and I will go Reckless Attack, Great Weapon Master.
Matt: Sure.
Laura: Doesn't that mean he gets advantage on his attacks against you?
Travis: Yeah, I mean, let's buy the ticket and take the train, right? Who fucking knows. One! Better. 19.
Matt: 19 misses.
Travis: Shit. Roll better. That's better.
Laura: He's so big, though!
Matt: But his armor is hard.
Travis: That is a 25.
Matt: 25 hits. So the second attack hits. Are you doing--?
Travis: Reckless and Great Weapon.
Matt: Right, but I mean are you doing your frenzy for the third attack? Or are you going regular?
Travis: Yeah, I'm going frenzied!
Matt: All right.
Travis: 21.
Matt: 21 misses. But you did get a hit in.
Travis: I do.
Laura: Oh my god. What was the second attack?
Travis: 25. So somewhere between 21 and 25. Which one is the d12? This one. 11. Two points of necrotic and 36 total.
Matt: 36, nice! As the flames subside from the dragon breath, the flames part and you see, rushing out, flames curling off the edges of the fur, this angry raging goliath (yells) runs and takes one swing. It skids across the scales of the front of Thordak's chest, gleaning past the giant scar in the center. No damage. Thordak (laughs). You look up into the beaming star-like eyes and angrily (yells). This time, the axe sinks in and the laughter stops. You see the slight twinge of pain in the right eye of the dragon as you pull back for a third one, brings its claw up and swings down to try and crush you. As you swing for your attack, you instinctually realize it's probably best to let this go and you duck out of the way in time as the claw (slam) into the ground in front of you.
Travis: Yeah! Yeah! Fuck. That ends my turn.
Matt: Vex! Your turn!
Laura: Cool! I click my Boots of Haste!
Matt: You feel, for the first time, the adrenaline surge through you and you suddenly go, "My brother's been hoarding this this whole time?!" Everything slows down around you ever so slightly, and for a second, your mind's racing faster than it normally does.
Laura: With my full movement, can I get behind the wall up where Keyleth was headed?
Matt: You can move 60 feet.
Laura: I want to stop in a place where I can attack before I finish my move.
Matt: You'll go over there and as you're rushing past, Keyleth--
Liam: As she rushes past, she hears  (slowly) Those are just a loaner!
Laura: (slowly) Go fuck yourself! Okay. All right. I'm going to cast Hunter's Mark. Then, for my first attack, I'm going to try a Bramble Shot.
Matt: Percy, by the way, I need you to make a concentration check. It's a constitution saving throw.
Laura: Yes! 30 on the first.
Matt: That hits.
Taliesin: Ten.
Matt: Your Hex fades.
Laura: I took the bracers off, right? Yes, I did. Okay. 15 plus two lightning damage plus two sneak attack and a Hunter's Mark. Ooh! 12 plus 4d8 for the Bramble Shot.
Matt: Nice! So already at 29 damage plus--?
Laura: 15. No. 13. 17.
Matt: Plus 17. All right! 46 points of damage on the first strike! What's the DC on the strength saving throw?
Laura: Oh. 16.
Matt: Yeah. He makes it.
Laura: That would have been amazing.
Matt: Ten plus 12. That would have been amazing. As you run past and fire the first arrow, it sinks in and jams into the side of where the plates of the chest armor meet the scar. As it hits, you watch it cause a spurt of dragon blood, knowing exactly where the weak points of the armor are, being a person that studied dragons.
Laura: Oh! That's right! And an additional d6 because he's a dragon, right? 2d6?
Matt: You should have the additional damage, I think it was plus two damage against creatures that are--
Laura: Oh, just plus two.
Travis: 2d20 of damage.
Laura: I thought it was a d6. Sorry. You're right, I think.
Matt: Do you want to go look it up?
Laura: No, it's fine. I'll look it up between. My next attack, I want to try one of my poisoned arrows.
Matt: You see the brambles extend out from the arrow and the dragon leans forward, already focused on Grog as you're slamming him in the side. As his body flexes, the brambles shatter.
Laura: 27!
Matt: 27 hits.
Laura: Okay! 14 plus four lightning damage. Plus Hunter's Mark is another four. What is the poison? Do I do anything for the poison? MATT I am going to go ahead and roll a constitution saving throw for him. Which succeeds. So, yeah, he just resists the poison effects of the arrows.
Laura: Okay, and then I'm going to do a third attack, right? Because I am hasted.
Matt: Yep.
Laura: And that hits too! That's 31!
Travis: Damn, girl.
Laura: 16 plus another four lightning damage! Plus Hunter's Mark, plus two plus two, because he is a dragon. But I didn't do plus two on the second one because I--
Matt: So 24 damage that final strike. Nice! You did almost 100 points of damage in a single round. (cheering)
Laura: And then I finish my round of movement and I keep running behind the building. Yeah. Right there. I know.
Matt: As you rush past, looking up into the face of the creature that you know for certain, seeing it there, that this is the creature that brought your mother to her end and half the city of Byroden to the south. And as that anger swells into you and mixes with the surge of adrenaline in your body and you don't even feel the momentum, your hands instinctively go through all training, all the years that have gone by, as each arrow gets loosed, there is just kind of this fuzz, this kind of numbness, around as your hatred is focused so clear on this dragon's head. And then the air rushes back into your lungs and you slam your back into the wall, preparing for your next round. All right, that finishes Vex's go. Vax and Lady Kima go at the same time. What do you want to do?
Liam: I am going to down the potion of healing with a bonus action.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: And then now I have two actions because of the potion--
Matt: The potion of healing?
Liam: No, no. Haste. So that's bonus action, now I have two actions? Because of the potion.
Matt: Correct.
Liam: Second action's used to pump out the wings.
Matt: Okay. Wings are up.
Liam: Then I am going to fly directly towards Thordak's face to-- you don't need that-- to ten feet away from him to his face. you can just hold it for a second, and cast Vow of Enmity at him.
Matt: All righty.
Liam: And then I am going to barrel roll back, fly, and land hard right down next to my sister where she's hiding.
Matt: Okay. At a non-hasted fly speed.
Liam: 120, hasted.
Matt: Oh, because you are hasted with the potion. So yeah, not a problem. Land right next to your sister.
Sam: So you prayed at him? Good job!
Matt: You swoop up, right in front, you cast the Vow of Enmity.
Liam: He could have taken a swipe at me. I'm just glad he didn't.
Matt: Oh, but we are going to get there. As you swoop up within ten feet of his face and cast the Vow, focusing on him, the dragon grins, and as you pull out of his attack space, because he has a reach of 15 feet with his bite, he is going to take a bite attack at you. That is a 32 to hit.
Liam: Can I Uncanny Dodge this?
Matt: You can.
Liam: Yeah. I have to.
Travis: 32 to hit?
Laura: We're fucked.
Matt: That's actually a bad roll. 17 points of piercing damage plus--
Liam: I knew it was going to happen.
Matt: Plus 16 points of fire damage reduced to half.
Liam: No, 17 plus 16 total.
Matt: Well, because you have fire resistance that is reduced.
Liam: Okay. So eight and 17. 25.
Matt: Yes, 25 points of damage to you.
Liam: Gives me advantage on every attack.
Laura: Oh, that's great.
Liam: I will get sneak attack on every attack whether there's someone next to him or not.
Laura: That's good.
Taliesin: Good! That's really good.
Matt: Kima is going to--
Sam: Who that? Who that? Is that Kima?
Matt: That's Kima. Kima can't do too much at this distance, unfortunately. She is going to cast Aura of Vitality on herself.
Sam: On herself?
Matt: Correct. What that does is allows her to heal people as a bonus action for as long as it lasts. Which is pretty damn helpful, right now. Let me pull it up real fast. Let's see, Aura of Vitality. She can use a bonus action to cause a creature in the aura, including herself, to regain hit points. She's doing okay. She looks over at Gilmore, who's hurt on the ground, staggering over in flames. As she rushes up, casts the spell on herself, holding her holy symbol of Bahamut to her chest, she looks up at the dragon. "Remember me?" Without even losing her vision, she puts her hand out like this, and you watch as a beam of divine energy streaks out, slams into Gilmore's side. He almost doubles over as it swirls around his body and heals his wounds for 2d6.
Sam: Okay.
Matt: So he heals four hit points.
Sam: He's looking better.
Matt: All right, that is going to end Kima's turn. Pike's turn.
Sam: By committee.
Laura: Okay, we're going to move to the corner of the building that she's standing in.
Liam: Inside. Squished into the corner.
Matt: Okay. Ten feet of movement to get there.
Laura: Yes. She's going to, as a bonus action, cast Spiritual Weapon. At fifth level.
Liam: Okay. I'll mark that off.
Taliesin: Go nuts with it, yeah.
Matt: What else is she doing this round?
Laura: And then she's also going to cast Beacon of Hope.
Matt: Beacon of Hope is a 3rd-level spell. If you are casting a 3rd-level or higher spell as an action, you can only do a 2nd-level spell as a bonus action. So you can either do Beacon of Hope and then a 2nd-level Spiritual Weapon or--
Laura: So we should do Beacon of Hope and not do Spiritual Weapon because we want to do a higher Spiritual Weapon later?
Liam: So anyone within 30 feet of her is getting some nice things.
Laura: So anybody within 30 feet gets advantage on wisdom, which you already have, but you get advantage on death saving throws as well.
Liam: And the best part--
Laura: --is any time you're healed, you're automatically healed to the max possible amount.
Sam: What do you mean any time you're healed?
Liam: When someone heals you, you don't roll. You calculate the maximum amount you could possibly roll.
Laura: And that's what you're healed for.
Taliesin: So, if it's 3d4, you just get 12. That's amazing!
Sam: Do we get any healing from this as well?
Laura: No, this is a prep spell. This is something that probably we should have done before Thordak started attacking us.
Sam: Yeah, well, you're not Pike. You don't know.
Liam: So, DM. Who all gets that? Looks like Grog is just out of reach of it?
Matt: Within 30 feet of her? Grog is just out of the radius. Gilmore, Kima.
Laura: Should we have run around the corner? If we had run around the corner, would Grog get?
Matt: If you run to there? Okay, yeah. That would get Grog, Gilmore, Scanlan, Percy, Keyleth. It does not get either of you.
Laura: Well, that's fine.
Marisha: This looks bad, but I feel okay about this.
Matt: So that's your action?
Laura: And that gets Pike in that as well.
Sam: You get a bonus action.
Laura: Bonus action?
Sam: You can do a Healing Word.
Laura: Oh, that's right, Healing Word!
Matt: You can do up to a level two.
Laura: Okay, so she should do a Healing Word. Is Healing Word a level two?
Taliesin: You can do it at any level you like.
Liam: Percy needs it? Grog needs it?
Laura: Grog needs it?
Travis: Yeah. I took like 40 points of damage.
Laura: I feel like he's okay still, so Percy?
Taliesin: One of the two of us, I would say.
Marisha: I didn't get hit. I'm good.
Taliesin: Oh, I'll take it. How much do I get back?
Laura: At a level two, that's 2d4.
Matt: 2d4 plus five.
Taliesin: 13.
Marisha: Is that for everybody or just for her?
Laura: Everybody.
Matt: Anyone who is affected by the spell, all healing is maximum. For as long as it lasts, and it's concentration. Okay, that ends Pike's turn. Pike can technically move five more feet from where she is.
Laura: But she can't hide, though.
Matt: No. She's out in the open right now. Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: I'll move ten feet towards that way, still ducking behind that stone there. I will inspire Percy. Wait, should I heal or inspire? I'll inspire Percy. I'll sing him a lovely Christmas song, (singing) You know Raishan and Vorugal, the Frigid Doom, Brimscythe and Umbrasyl, we killed in his room. But do you recall the most fucked-up dragon of all? Thordak the Cinder King had a very shiny gem. And if you ever saw it, run the fuck away from him.
Matt: Take your d12 inspiration die.
Taliesin: All right. d12 is awesome.
Matt: Bards are great. All right, that's your bonus action.
Sam: And for the move, I guess I'll attack him? I don't do that very well. I'll do Bigby's Hand. (sings) Bigby's Hand! At level seven.
Marisha: Oh, shit!
Matt: 7th-level Bigby's Hand!
Taliesin: We're just going to spray-paint Matt's hand purple and he's going to sit there, punch things.
Liam: Check out the big hand on Scan.
Matt: Where do you want Bigby's Hand to appear? Within 120 feet.
Sam: I guess keep it low. Just go for the ball shot, yeah.
Matt: All right, so what are you having the hand do?
Sam: Punch. Just punch.
Matt: So Clenched Fist, and that is with plus 2d6 for each. Sorry, plus 2d8 for each slot above fifth. That is an additional 4d8. That is 8d8. If it hits. Go ahead and roll your spell attack.
Sam: 18.
Matt: 18, no. The fist gleans off of Thordak's chin. The dragon just kind of grins (growls). "Is this all you've got?"
Sam: Actually, yes. That is my biggest thing, so yes.
Matt: "Good." All right. That brings us back to the top of the order. Now at the top of this round, we're going to start doing lair actions.
Laura: No!
Taliesin: Lair actions are the worst.
Matt: It happens after Percy's turn, though.
Taliesin: Oh, good.
Matt: So, Percy, your go.
Taliesin: Fine.
Laura: Make sure he dies before he gets anything else.
Liam: Pull out your dragon gun.
Taliesin: My dragon gun?
Marisha: We're going to be real disappointed if you can't take this all on your own.
Sam: Wait a second, Matt! Doesn't he get a disadvantage on his save because of my Cutting Words?
Matt: That wasn't a save, that was your attack.
Sam: Yeah. That's what I meant.
Matt: On the next saving throw he has to make, he has a disadvantage. Yes.
Sam: Making sure you guys know how spells work.
Travis: Yep, thank you. I was confused.
Sam: Jesus, Sam #3, why didn't you tell me that?!
Matt: Percy, what are you doing?
Taliesin: I'm going to take a deep breath and shoot directly north, or I suppose to you it would be south, down the map towards that building on the far corner. I'm just going to run in that direction.
Matt: As far as you can get with your full move?
Taliesin: That's as far as I can get with my full movement? And he has to recharge his fire probably before he can do that again?
Matt: Yeah, when it comes back to his turn I have to roll to see if he gets it that round.
Taliesin: Okay, that's fine. I'm going to take two shots while I'm running. I'm going to, just because I'm not feeling lucky right now, I'm going to burn another Deadeye on my first run, so let's do that.
Marisha: Are you feeling lucky?
Taliesin: No, no, I am really not. So less so that I'm not even going to do sharpshooter. That's awesome! I take that back.
Marisha: Percy! You should have done it.
Taliesin: It's okay. Actually, that doesn't affect the crit at all. Sharpshooter isn't affected by a crit. I critted, by the way. Sorry. That's nice. So, hey! I get that Deadeye back. That's cool.
Travis: You should have said that first and we'd all go, yay!
Taliesin: This is like bad college theater. No one knows when to applaud. Excellent. That's-- oh my god, that's kind of nice. 1d12, 2d12, 3d12, 4d12.
Liam: Nice. Actually not bad. Pretty good. This makes me happy. This is going to be funny.
Taliesin: Pretty good. That's not great, but it'll do. 24 points of damage. And I'm going to take another shot. You know what? Screw it. Let's put a sharpshooter on this. Actually, no. Never mind. Yes! I'm going to put a sharpshooter on this. I am so nervous. I'm putting a sharpshooter on it. Which is good because I rolled--
Sam: You have an inspiration.
Taliesin: 17, 18, 19, 26.
Matt: 26 hits.
Taliesin: Yay. And that's 2d12. Yay. Boo, but that's okay. 30 points of damage.
Matt: Nice. So both shots as you are running past, you watch as it slams into the sides, causing a little (explosion) out of the side of Thordak's armor, the scales slip for a second. The second shot smashes a small hole in one of the wings, but you watch as the leather seems to be largely unaffected by the impact. It's already tattered at the bottom anyway, but well done.
Taliesin: (high-pitched noises) Okay.
Matt: So, there you are. At the end of your turn, Thordak's going to go ahead and use one of his legendary actions to do a tail attack against Grog right now, because you're within range.
Travis: Yeah, test your might. Oh no, please don't! (sobs)
Matt: That's going to be a 25 to hit.
Travis: It hits.
Matt: Yep. You take 22 points of bludgeoning damage, reduced to half, so 11 points of bludgeoning damage to you, Grog.
Travis: Yeah, it's good.
Matt: All right. That ends that. At this point now, you watch as through the clouds this winged figure comes and (crashing) lands on this distant building, the flames flickering out.
Laura: Moment of truth. Moment of truth.
Matt: As the impact happens, you watch as Thordak turns and grins. "There you are. Oh, you're going to taste so good." Raishan grins from the side. "Not to worry, my king."
Sam: Oh shit. That doesn't sound good.
Laura: I can't tell what she's going to do.
Sam: Is she lying? She's a deceitful one.
Matt: At this point, she will-- let me pull it up. Oh there you go, there's the spell sheet. She's going to go ahead and move right there. Gets right up onto the building that you guys are hiding behind as you feel the rubble and rock tumble around you, you look up and you can see the giant green leathery wings unfurl. She inhales, her chest expanding. (cheering)
Matt: Releasing a giant cloud of poisonous gas in the direction of Thordak. Into his face. Suprise, motherfucker!
Sam: We have the best friends.
Matt: Does not make his-- wait, this is a poison, oh, it's constitution. He does make that. He takes 38 points of poison.
Travis: 38?
Matt: 38 points of poison damage on that one. As Thordak rears from the attack. "Oh, you'll die especially painfully."
Liam: Is Thordy La Forge poisoned there?
Matt: No, he just takes poison damage.
Liam: No disadvantage. I really just wanted to say Thordy La Forge.
Taliesin: Of course you did.
Matt: All righty. So, that ends Raishan's turn. Raishan's like, "Now, get in, circle and finish this!"
Marisha: Wait, Raishan said that?
Matt: Yes.
Travis: No, that was Lady Kima's voice. (laughter)
Liam: Clarota, is that you? On a flying steed.
Marisha: I turn to Raishan and say, I don't take orders from you, I'm only doing this because it's a good plan. And then I run in. If I run my full movement, can I get into touch range with him?
Matt: You can, yes.
Marisha: Okay, angry at what happened before and realizing that not a lot is probably going to work unless I get ballsy, I run in guns blazing, and I am going to do Contagion on him.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: I'm going to attempt Slimy Doom.
All: Ooh.
Marisha: In honor of Zahra! And her teaching us about hentai!
Travis: Yup. I saw that hentai.
Sam: We hear Zahra in the distance, "I'm still alive!"
Matt: Okay. So make a melee spell attack against him. So roll a d20, add your spell attack bonus.
Marisha: I know, I'm picking the right one.
Laura: It should probably be like a black or a green or something that's like slimy.
Marisha: I'll do a green one. Green's good.
Travis: Or just any dice.
Marisha: Shut up, Travis. Ooh, that's not too bad. That's not too bad, plus 12? So that's 28!
Matt: 28 hits.
Marisha: (laughs) Redemption!
Liam: Keyleth is on The Price is Right.
Matt: Contagion, we'll put that blue there. So at the end of each of the target's turns it has to make a constitution saving throw. After failing three, the disease takes effect.
Sam: After failing three?
Marisha: He has to fail three.
Matt: So as you're rushing up, running past the tumbling rocks and boulders of the barely standing ceiling that Raishan's stepping on, you rush towards Thordak, and getting closer you see the immense size towering above you. And getting this close, there is a heated presence around him, like an aura of superheated air that burns you as you get close enough to touch him. You reach out and grab as you cast the spell under your breath. And as you touch the edge of his scales, it's like touching a hot iron (sizzles). Your fingers singe upon contact, but you feel the burst of druidic energy pierce through the scales and you watch as a little bit of black power seeps into the body and curls in between the scales and has taken root.
Travis: (whispered) Yes.
Marisha: That's all I got, right? I'm going to turn. Grog, you're still down, right?
Travis: (weakly) Yeah.
Marisha: I'm going to do a bonus Healing Word on Grog. I'm going to go ahead and do it at third--
Matt: Can't do third level because you cast a 5th-level spell.
Marisha: Second level.
Matt: All right. So 2d4 plus six.
Marisha: But it's max. Eight plus six.
Matt: 14. You heal 14.
Travis: Woohoo! 14 points. 194.
Matt: All right. At the end of your turn, Thordak's going to go ahead and use his next two legendary actions to use his wing attack. Thordak, now being surrounded by everything, goes (wing flapping). He begins beating his wings. You watch as the flames on the ground begin to curl up into these small tornadoes in the presence from the sheer vacuum of wind up under the wings. I need Grog and Keyleth and Raishan to make dexterity saving throws.
Travis: I think I have advantage on those, (singing) because I got Danger Sense!
Marisha: 12.
Travis: Natural 20.
All: Ooh.
Matt: So you stay put, hunkering down for this. Keyleth, you suffer 13 points of bludgeoning damage. 13 points of bludgeoning damage and six points of fire damage.
Marisha: To three, so 16 total.
Matt: Yes, and you are knocked prone as the wind blows you to the ground. And the dragon can move up to half its movement speed. So it's going to pull back to there.
Sam: Do you get an attack, Grog?
Matt: You do. As you get hit by that, by the way, you can do retaliation or you can do your attack of opportunity, either works right now.
Travis: Yeah, yeah. Reckless and Great Weapon Master.
Matt: Go for it.
Travis: Eight and that's a natural 20.
Matt: Go ahead and roll your brutal damage there.
Sam: Wow. That's a hit.
Travis: 19, 20, plus ten is 30 points of damage, including the one point of necrotic, and then I double that?
Liam: Double all the dice.
Travis: Double all the dice. Right so, 60.
Laura: No. Double the dice.
Travis: Oh, sorry. Okay. 12, so 25, 35, 37.
Matt: 37, nice.
Travis: Thanks. Two points necrotic.
Matt: Yes. Okay. So, as the wind beats up and the dragon begins to back up--
Laura: Did you add your plus ten, because it was Reckless?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: --hovering off the ground, you strike out with the-- technically, yeah, it was Reckless, you cannot do Great Weapon Master on the-- well, I guess you can on any attack you make. I'll double check on that real fast. So we'll say that's right there.
Travis: Yeah, if it's a reaction I'm not quite sure.
Matt: I'm going to double check just to make sure.
Travis: That could have been better.
Laura: That's okay, that was a six.
Matt: On your turn, so no, you cannot do that, so 26, yes.
Sam: That's great! That's extra! That's just bonus.
Matt: You reach out with the axe amongst the heat and the wind blowing in your face (wind blows) and strike across the front of Thordak's chest as he begins to swing back with his wings beating out. All right, at the end of that turn, as Thordak does that, at the end of that turn, Raishan's going to use two legendary actions to cast Blight on Thordak.
Travis: There's some shit going down on this map.
Laura: Oh my God, Matt. I'm impressed and terrified of you for having to keep track of this.
Liam: They should really just do it already.
Laura: I honestly had no idea what my hands were going to do.
Matt: Constitution saving throw from Thordak.
Sam: At disadvantage!
Matt: At disadvantage. That's a natural one. He is going to use one of his legendary resistances.
Laura: Get rid of them.
Marisha: Burn it, burn it! Burn that shit.
Sam: He might have five of those.
Taliesin: Yeah and now he's got four.
Marisha: He has three, right?
Laura: He's probably got more than three. He's Thordak.
Taliesin: Thordak, he's got like 12.
Matt: He takes 18 points of necrotic damage. All right. And because I initially forgot it, lair action!
Sam: Oh shit. Lair action.
Matt: Lair action, indeed.
Laura: Isn't that like if you forget to move or something, you don't get to do it later, if you forgot about it?
Sam: Everyone with knees dies.
Matt: For that, we're going to choose--
Laura: No no no no, I was just joshing you!
Taliesin: Don't make him look things up, it's always going to be worse.
Matt: The two twins that have currently ducked around the way, you feel the ground nearby begin to shake, and down below you the earth cracks open and a giant column of magma (explosion) shoots out and sprays in the vicinity.
Liam: Evasion!
Matt: You've already used Evasion.
Liam: On this round? It's once a round. This is a whole new round.
Matt: Actually, you're right, you're right. You haven't gone since then. All right. Dexterity saving throw from both of you.
Liam: Okay. At advantage, because of those boots, man!
Laura: That's good. (whispers) Okay, that's good, that's good.
Liam: 23.
Laura: 27.
Matt: Okay. You both take--
Liam: Did we fail the save?
Matt: You succeeded on the save.
Liam: So I take zero.
Matt: So you take zero. You, however, take what would be 12 points of fire damage reduced to half, so six.
Sam: (scoffs) You call this a lair?
Matt: All right. That ends Keyleth's go, it's now Jarett. Jarett, who's loaded up his crossbow, is going to go ahead and spin around, take two shots at Thordak. That's a cocked die. That's good. 18 plus seven hits, and the second one just barely hits, actually. There's two hits on him. Five points. Two ones in a row for damage, are you serious? Okay.
Marisha: Goddamn it, Jarett.
Laura: It's okay, I'm happy that he's here.
Liam: Happens to everybody.
Matt: And then he is going to try and move back this way to keep everyone scattered and use the space to his advantage. That's going to end Jarett's turn.
Taliesin: Is there a little hole in the ground where the magma came out or no?
Matt: No, it burst and then it cooled and covered the space. All righty. That brings us to Gilmore's turn. Gilmore, who's in a bad place, is going to go ahead and take his superior healing potion.
Taliesin: Gets max healing, because he was in the spell.
Matt: That's true. Yeah, so he takes 16, 20, 24 plus eight is 32. Nice.
Marisha: That's awesome! Good spell!
Liam: Thanks Pike. We're so glad you're here.
Matt: Gilmore, who currently drinks the potion. "This is already not the best start to this, but let's see what else I can do here."
Liam: Come on, Shaun.
Matt: He's going to try a Hold Monster. From where he is right there. That's a wisdom saving throw for Thordak. Yeah, that succeeds. That's a nine plus-- but he tried.
Sam: And looked good doing it.
Laura: That's right. Those robes are fabulous, Gilmore!
Matt: "Thank you!" He goes darting behind the other building off the opposite side. Yeah, that actually doesn't help in this circumstance. That ends his turn. Grog.
Travis: Yes?
Matt: It's you and the dragon's go.
Travis: (giggles) Now, who's going first this time?
Matt: You both are going at the same time, so what are you going to do?
Travis: Ah, you want to know what I'm going to do, do you? Intimidated by my presence, eh? Whack the Titanstone Knuckles!
Sam: You're now 1/16 his size.
Travis: Yeah, yeah. I now come up to his ankle bone. Life is a thrill.
Matt: Basically.
Travis: Can I use my full-- oh, he's far away. Shit.
Matt: Yeah, he moved away from you.
Travis: Balls and ass. I would like to run straight forward and then veer off to this side, I'm flanking him.
Matt: This side over here?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: Yeah. You can get over to there.
Travis: Great. Am I now within striking range?
Matt: You are.
Travis: I would like to make all three attack Great Weapon Master, Reckless!
Matt: Go for it.
Travis: 12, oh, so close. Damn it, covering up the wrong page. That's, damn it, 19.
Matt: 19. The first strike, you slam the axe as your form grows, rushing up next to the dragon, grinning, feeling the foam gathering at the corner of your mouth. You swing with the axe and carves a small line, but doesn't actually penetrate the armor of Thordak.
Travis: (Scottish accent) Great. That's better. That is a 26.
Matt: That hits.
Travis: Good.
Taliesin: You beat the Scottish into him.
Travis: 27 minus five is 22.
Matt: 22 misses.
Taliesin: Good to know. We're learning. 22 misses.
Matt: Roll damage on that strike.
Travis: I got to get rid of that fucking Great Weapon Master, that thing's killing me.
Laura: Oh yeah.
Liam: His AC is high, so ditch the handicap.
Travis: Hey, that's a six! Six points of necrotic for a total of 36 points of damage.
Matt: 36 points of damage. Nice. So, as two blows are deflected from the armor, one does sink in pretty hard, carving a piece of dragon flesh that's dangling off now in the torso region. Thordak's like (snarls).
Travis: 'Ello, poppet.
Matt: "Insect."
Travis: Sect?
Matt: Is that your turn?
Travis: Oh, insect. Yeah, that's my turn.
Matt: Yeah, okay. Thordak begins laughing, (deep laugh).
Laura: Oh no, this is the laughter we heard about. It drives you crazy. I cover my ears!
Matt: The fire breath does not come back, it's a two.
Sam: Oh, whew.
Travis: The fire breath does not recharge?
Matt: Nope.
Marisha: That's good, that's good.
Matt: However, he does make a full multiattack and that's four attacks against you.
Travis: On me? I'm trying to keep him warm! Like, I'm trying to give him a little touch, little feel, let him know that we love him.
Matt: And it's with advantage against you?
Travis: Yeah, that's right.
Matt: Okay, that's a 34.
Travis: I think that'll hit.
Matt: Natural one and a 15, that is a 32. Natural 20.
Sam: On the last one, I'm going to Cutting Words.
Travis: There's three. There's one more.
Sam: Then on the last one.
Matt: Okay. Natural 20! (laughs)
Sam: Well then, maybe that won't help.
Travis: (singing) Happy trails to... shit.
Matt: Okay, so a bite, two claw attacks, and a tail attack against you, as its tail swings down and whips towards you. So, first, the bite attack. You suffer 16 plus a 12. 28 points of piercing damage reduced to 14 as well as--
Marisha: Come on, this is what you're built for. This is why we trained you.
Matt: 19 points of fire damage, reduced that to nine.
Travis: Cool.
Matt: So that's the first, that's the bite attack. The two claw attacks against you. That is 18 points of slashing damage reduced to nine. And then the critical on the claw attack. That is--
Travis: Was there no fire damage on the second one?
Matt: No, that's just the bite attack. That is 32 points of slashing damage, reduced to 16. And the tail attack, that is also a crit. 24. 36 points of bludgeoning damage.
Sam: Can I Cutting Words that?
Matt: You can, yes.
Sam: So I yell at him, "You're so ugly, you scared the shit out of an outhouse!"
Matt: Go ahead and roll your d12. 36.
Sam: Make that a 33.
Matt: So 16 points of bludgeoning damage. And as part of his multiattack, he also uses his Frightful Presence, so everyone, as you see it clawing at Grog, it's like (roars), the tail whips down and slams the ground. The entire ground quakes and you feel all the flames grow brighter in the vicinity. While Thordak is large in this moment, it's like staring at a fire god. I need everybody--
Taliesin: Who is not immune to fear?
Laura: We're all immune to fear.
Matt: Everyone, yeah, all of you are immune to fear.
Laura: Yeah. Except for Jarett.
Matt: Except for Jarett. Jarett does not succeed! Jarett is pissing himself right now behind. He almost ran into the wall and is like, "Oh, this is not good!" (yells)
Liam: Hey, Thordy, eat a dick.
Matt: Raishan does make her save.
Sam: Does not?
Matt: Does.
Laura: Oh, good.
Travis: Legendary? Did he do his legendary thingy? Or he just made it?
Marisha: Yeah, he also has to save against my Contagion.
Matt: His turn's not done yet. Raishan uses her legendary resistance to resist the-- Oh sorry, she doesn't have to because she made it. From the shaking and the quaking you watch as the flames that brighten up leap out of the sides in the form of two fire elementals.
Laura: Damn it!
Matt: That leap out of the sides of the cavern.
Laura: Can they fly?
Travis: Can we bring all the alcohol on set right now?
Taliesin: There's a lot of alcohol on the set right now. A lot of it's hiding.
Liam: How about acknowledge it?
Taliesin: There's a mini fridge built into Trinket.
Liam: Ancient dragon wasn't enough, huh, Matt?
Matt: Thordak is going to move around Grog to this side.
Travis: Yeah, move around me, bitch. I'm going to get my insults in while I'm still breathing.
Marisha: He accidentally stepped on one of his elemental friends.
Matt: He moved around it. It's fine. The elementals are now going the same turn as Thordak. 50 feet. Ten, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50. This elemental. 35, 40, 45, 50. Right there. They're going to rush up and get into base to base with you guys, and up to Keyleth, who's currently on the ground prone as the elemental (roar) and comes up against you. You hear the familiar sound of the flickering flame of its elemental form rush up towards you.
Marisha: I feel like I saw you, in like the fire plane! 'Sup, man?
Matt: All righty. At this time, you also hear a distant sound in the sky. A (sharp whooshes), but you make no visual. Everyone roll a perception check.
Sam: 21.
Marisha: 24.
Taliesin: 12.
Laura: Do I get advantage because it's dragon-related?
Matt: This is not dragon-related.
Liam: 25.
Travis: Six.
Laura: 16.
Matt: All right. Scanlan, you rolled a 21, you said?
Sam: 21.
Matt: So, Scanlan, Keyleth, and Vax. You guys see a shape in the darkness of clouds and the smoke ahead. In between the sounds of thunder and lightning in the distance, you see the bow of the skyship Deera.
Laura: Yes, the skyship!
Taliesin: Fucking Teddy Ruxpin.
Matt: (laughs) Vex, it's your turn.
Laura: Me? Okay. Where can I go to where I can hit him?
Travis: Pretty much anywhere.
Matt: With your bow, you have quite a few options. So you'd have to move around this way or this way.
Laura: Is the fire elemental right next to me?
Matt: It is. It'll get a swipe at you if you try to move away from it.
Laura: Asshole. If I'm a third level rogue, do I get disengage?
Matt: As a bonus action, yeah.
Laura: Okay, so for my bonus action I'll disengage. And then I'll move so I can hit Thordak. So can I move towards-- back towards the very back building? Can I get all the way there?
Matt: With Haste, yes, you can.
Laura: Okay. So then I'm going to shoot him! Before I duck in around a corner or whatever. And I want to-- oh, that's 18.
Matt: 18 does not hit. So you rush past, disengaging. You hit up against the edge of the wall with your arrow out (arrow whoosh). It arcs past and misses.
Laura: Yeah, it's pretty far. Okay. This next one. I'm going to use another poison arrow. Oh my God, I miss him again. Dice jail!
Matt: That one hits the hide but ricochets off.
Laura: Okay okay. Third attack. 25.
Matt: 25 hits.
Laura: Yay! One, that's one lightning, at 17 plus, Grog is standing next to him? Yeah, it's good. That's nine, 13. Plus 13.
Sam: Hey, that's many points.
Matt: So a total of--?
Laura: 14, 15, 16, 17 plus 13.
Matt: So 30. Nice. All righty. So the final arrow releases and (whoosh) gets stuck up under one of the scales on the side of where its shoulder and body hits and the dragon, Thordak, turns and (roars and laughs).
Laura: Oh no, I hide behind that building.
Sam: Oh, God. What was that?
Travis: Those faces are-- wow!
Taliesin: Yeah, way too many emotions happening there.
Matt: You hear the voice ring out, "Don't worry, we'll take them down. All of them. Each and every one."
Laura: He's crazy as fuck.
Sam: He's straight-up crazy.
Taliesin: No, he's not.
Matt: That ends your turn, Vex?
Laura: I guess so, I mean, I don't know what else I can do.
Matt: All right. Vax and Kima.
Sam: When I was younger, I had an imaginary friend, too.
Liam: Should I go, or should Kima go?
Matt: (chuckles) Kima, frustratingly so, being a short-ranged lady that she is, is first off going to glance over and see Keyleth on the ground. How are you doing, Keyleth?
Marisha: I'm okay. I'm on the ground, but I'm not super low. I'm still full on hit points. Well.
Matt: Yeah, she's going to go full double move on this one. She wants to get into the fray and is so frustrated that she's too far out of the way. Kima is going to go ahead and rush out and do a 2d6 heal to Gilmore again. So that's seven to Gilmore.
Sam: No, well he gets full healing.
Matt: Oh that's right. 2d6, so it's a full 12.
Taliesin: That's so clutch. We should do that every time from now on.
Matt: Kima is now taking a full 50 foot move. 50. Okay, she's charging in. "We've done this before and we can do it again!" as she has her Holy Avenger arcing over her shoulder, running screaming. (yells) Vax, what are you doing?
Liam: Bonus action, I'm taking the potion of invulnerability.
Sam: Oh, shit.
Travis: Time to get crunk.
Liam: Next action, I cast Hunter's Mark on Thordak.
Laura: Yeah!
Matt: Okay.
Sam: You can do that?
Liam: Then I fly at Thordak's face and strike at him with the dragon-slayer sword. (cheering)
Liam: Face. Face.
Matt: Right, so you're up in the air now.
Liam: At advantage. Good. 26 hits.
Matt: Yes, it does.
Liam: So this is dragon-slayer sword plus Sneak Attack, I'm going to Smite and Hunter's Mark.
Sam: That's all the attacks.
Liam: Yes, all the attacks.
Taliesin: Every die.
Liam: Okay, nine plus six is 17, plus-- 18, 19, 21, balls. 21, okay plus the Sneak Attack. 27, 29, 33, 39, 40, 42, 44, plus the Hunter's Mark, 45 total.
Matt: That includes the Smite damage as well?
Liam: No, no.
Matt: It's 2d8.
Liam: Now we're at 50.
Sam: What about the dragon sword? Did you do that?
Liam: That's done. So I don't know exactly how far it was to his face and I know I'm all out of moves and I'm open to getting bitten again, but I want to fly away from his face as far as I can and land opposite everybody. Maybe near the lip. No, behind the building behind him.
Matt: I'm currently working out how much movement you've done, because you're crazy.
Liam: 120 feet of movement.
Matt: It's about 65 to get up to his face.
Laura: Oh, sweet.
Matt: All right, and you're going to pull back from him?
Liam: Curve over his, oh, no-- sword's in his head? My friends are going to fucking kill you today, you fuck! Arc over his head.
Matt: The blade, which has jammed itself right in the cheekbone under the eye of the dragon, as you draw it out, there's a streak of dragon blood (roar, unhinged laughter). You arc over. As you do, he reaches up with his face, his jaws (snarl) reach out to try and bite you. That is a 21 to hit.
Liam: No.
Matt: The jaws snap in the air, just as you coast through with your wings.
Liam: I'll slam down, if I can, behind the building behind his big fat ass.
Matt: Sure.
Laura: I whisper on the earring, that was my brother! That was my brother.
Matt: You are going to have an attack of opportunity from-- oh, no, you disengaged from the--
Liam: I didn't disengage.
Matt: Oh, sorry, so the Fire Elemental actually would have gotten an attack of opportunity on you as you ran past.
Laura: Before all that, he knocks you unconscious.
Matt: That's a 20-- yeah, misses.
Taliesin: Vax, it might be worth taking a peek in that crater when you get a second.
Liam: Working on it, working on it.
Matt: All righty, that ends your turn, Kima's turn. Pike's up. However! At the end of Vax's turn, Thordak is going to go ahead and use a tail attack against Grog.
Marisha: Did he ever make that save, by the way?
Sam: Not yet.
Matt: Disadvantage, which is good because it was a natural 20. And a six, plus 16, 22. Makes it.
Laura: 22. He's got to roll under a four or lower to get--
Sam: There's no way, it's not going to happen.
Laura: It's possible! It's possible!
Marisha: It keeps going. It still goes.
Matt: It keeps going. It lasts for seven days.
Marisha: Yeah, it's a seven-day thing.
Travis: After we're all dead, he'll get very sick.
Taliesin: If we die today, he's going to get the flu later in his life.
Travis: Let's reason with him! You can die now, wait for later--
Liam: "That doesn't look normal."
Travis: "Why does it burn when I pee?"
Matt: However, it lasts for seven days, but remember, that's if the spell succeeds. If he succeeds three saving throws, it goes away.
Marisha: If he succeeds three?
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: I thought he just had to fail.
Matt: Fail three to take effect, succeed three to just get rid of the disease.
Liam: Just dish out damage.
Laura: These damn spells.
Taliesin: He has disadvantage.
Matt: So, anyway, that brings us to Pike. Oh, he was doing the tail attack to you. So, using one of the Legendary Actions to make a tail strike against--
Liam: So Legendaries can fall whenever they want?
Matt: At the end of someone else's turn.
Travis: This is against me.
Matt: Yeah, because you're right there. With advantage. That would be 31. So yeah, that hits you.
Taliesin: I pray for a single-digit number.
Travis: Almost double my AC.
Matt: 20 points of bludgeoning damage, reduced to ten.
Taliesin: Man, you are a tank.
Travis: Not much longer.
Taliesin: We're working on it.
Matt: All righty. So, Pike, what's Pike doing?
Laura: Okay, Pike is going to run forward--
Liam: "Oh, Grog!"
Laura: "Oh, Grog!" And she runs as far forward as she can.
Matt: That's as far as she can get.
Laura: We're trying to get a little diagonal, she wants to be 60 feet away from him.
Matt: He's within 60 feet.
Laura: Okay. Can she be at a diagonal so she's not lined up with Keyleth and Bigby?
Matt: I mean, that's as far as she can get.
Laura: Okay. Then she casts Heal on Grog, which gives him 70 hit points, automatically healed.
Travis: That's amazing!
Matt: Yeah. So you're up 70 hit points, Grog.
Laura: And that's a 6th-level spell, so she's going to cast Spiritual Weapon as a 5th-level spell as her bonus action.
Matt: She can't, because she already cast a 6th-level spell. If you do a spell that's higher than 2nd-level, you can only do a 2nd-level spell as your bonus action.
Laura: Oh, that's how it works. I thought it just had to be lower than--
Matt: Technically, rules as written, you can't do that, but as we've been playing, for the sake of having so many players, I allow bonus action spells as long as they're level two or lower.
Laura: Should we just do it?
Taliesin: No, no.
Laura: If she does it at a 2nd-level, then--
Liam: And it'll keep going.
Laura: Yeah.
Taliesin: But what happens if you do it at a higher level?
Marisha: More damage.
Laura: Well yeah, but she's always going to be at a higher level than 2nd-level spells, so it doesn't matter.
Taliesin: Well, I mean, like, next round though, if she does that at a 5th-level, just the damage it'll add will be more than double the damage it'll do now.
Liam: I say wait, because she's doing her job. She's keeping Grog alive.
Marisha: So you might want to do that at a lower spell level, and keep the higher levels for healing.
Laura: Okay, okay, okay. Wait-- okay, she can also do Mass Healing Word as a bonus action at-- never mind, that's a 3rd-level spell, so fuck it.
Matt: Yeah, sorry.
Laura: She can do Healing Word, though! At second level.
Matt: She can.
Laura: Should we do that? Who needs healing?
Sam: I mean, everybody.
Laura: She's going to do Healing Word on Grog again.
Liam: At max.
Matt: Okay. So at second level, that means that's 2d4 plus five. So 13, you heal 13 hit points.
Travis: Nice!
Taliesin: Which is like another attack you absorb. That's great. It's like one more attack to absorb.
Matt: All right, that ends Pike's turn, then. Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: I'm up?
Matt: Yes.
Sam: For my attack, I will punch the fire elemental currently menacing Kiki with my fist of fury.
Matt: All righty, go ahead and roll a spell attack.
Sam: Okay, 24.
Matt: That hits.
Liam: It would have hit the fucking dragon.
Matt: It would've. So 8d8 points of damage to the fire elemental.
Sam: 8d8. I need all the d8s.
Travis: All the d8s.
Marisha: Here, I've got d8s, how many do you need?
Laura: Hey, Scanlan. (mimes playing a flute)
Taliesin: That's seven.
Sam: Four... I need one more. That's a d12. (laughs) Oh man, these are all good, though.
Taliesin: So you want one more, though.
Sam: I do. Oh my God! Okay. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 30, 41.
Matt: 41 points of damage, nice! It slams into his form and you watch as his body kind of tears open for a second, the flames dissipating and then form back in, but they're starting to flicker.
Sam: He's not dead?
Matt: No.
Sam: As my bonus action, I'll punch him again.
Matt: No bonus.
Sam: That was my action, as a bonus action, I can do something else with Bigby, no?
Matt: Let me double check.
Sam: Every subsequent action I can do something as a bonus action, does that also negate the action?
Matt: When you cast a spell as a bonus action, it says here you can move the hand and cause the effects. It's your bonus action to move the spell. So your action is there, I'll say-- it says specifically bonus action.
Sam: So I can't do it as my action?
Laura: So you can do something else!
Sam: So that was my bonus action, then.
Matt: Correct, to do that is your bonus.
Sam: So I can do something else, then?
Matt: I'll let you do it again if you want to.
Sam: No, no, no, I'll do something else. Oh! By the way, I can't use my movement to drink a potion, right?
Matt: No.
Sam: Okay (laughs).
Travis: (laughing) I'd like to drink a potion.
Sam: Can I lean over the wall there? And I'll Lightning Bolt the same guy.
Matt: Okay. So it would be over the edge of that wall there and (blasting noise). All right, go for it. So that's a no. That is a 12 for its dexterity saving throw, so it takes full damage.
Sam: All right, so.
Taliesin: Oh!
Sam: Oh!
Sam: Four ones in a row so far, so-- (laughter)
Sam: So I made up for some of them. 15.
Matt: 15 points of lightning damage against the fire elemental. Okay, the bolt hits it and the fire elemental goes (sizzling), not terribly damaged by the impact.
Travis: At least it didn't point and laugh at you.
Matt: Okay, do you want to stay where you are?
Sam: Yeah, absolutely.
Matt: Okay, that ends Scanlan's turn. Up to the top: Percival.
Travis: He used your full first name.
Taliesin: Yeah, okay, that's fine.
Marisha: It's like when you're in trouble.
Taliesin: I am in trouble. I have a whole bunch of your d8s over here, by the way. Feel free to pull them out whenever you like. I'm going to try a couple things. I'm going to do a piercing shot on the fire elemental, which I think I can do. I'm going to start moving in a northerly direction, so I guess I'll take like one or two steps southwest, I suppose it would be to you. Yeah, there you go.
Matt: There?
Taliesin: Yeah, that'll do it. And I'm going to do a piercing shot. That burns a grit, okay. That'll do! That's 25 to hit the elemental.
Matt: 25 hits.
Taliesin: And now I have to roll again for Thordak?
Matt: Well, you have to decide whether your-- if it's a piercing shot affecting also Kima or Grog. Because it's a straight line, and it hits-- depending on how you angle it, you're either hitting Kima or you're hitting Grog.
Sam: Oh shit.
Taliesin: Really?
Matt: Yep.
Travis: I'm saying Kima's not actually attached to a human being, just saying.
Taliesin: Kima's not short enough that it'll go right over her head?
Matt: Nope. As per the rules as designed, no.
Travis: I totally love Kima, I got nothing against her. Just looking out for myself right now.
Matt: She's parkouring off of the damaged wall, trying to get into the fray with the dragon, and happens to catch where the bullet would be going.
Taliesin: Okay, that's happening, apparently.
Marisha: Are you shooting Kima?
Taliesin: It's either Kima or Grog. Although Grog takes half damage.
Matt: This is true.
Travis: Yeah, okay, come on.
Taliesin: You take half damage.
Travis: All right. I'll remember this later.
Matt: So Grog it is? Roll for attack against Grog.
Laura: I know, his head is so high. How are you hitting Grog?
Travis: It's in the rules.
Taliesin: It's in the rules.
Matt: In theory, from this angle, in to hit the fire elemental and Thordak, he has to aim up.
Taliesin: 20.
Matt: 20? Against Grog hits?
Travis: Yeah, it hits.
Matt: And roll against Thordak.
Taliesin: And, no. I can't have a misfire once I've already hit the first?
Matt: Correct, only the additional attack can misfire.
Taliesin: Okay. That's 15, that doesn't hit.
Sam: So you only hit Grog.
Taliesin: I only hit Grog. No, I also hit the fire elemental.
Matt: Roll damage once.
Taliesin: Yeah, I hit the fire elemental, though.
Marisha: Maybe you'll kill it.
Taliesin: Maybe I will. Maybe it's Maybelline. Where are my d12s, they seem to have all vanished.
Marisha: Kill it! Oh, jeez. Come on, man.
Taliesin: That's awful. 13 points of damage.
Matt: Okay. Grog, you take 13 points of piercing damage, halved to six. Round it down. Six.
Taliesin: Sorry! And the bullet gets lodged in you.
Matt: Yeah, basically.
Liam: It's there for 50 years.
Taliesin: Sorry! And then, is the fire elemental still standing?
Matt: Yes, it is.
Taliesin: I'm irritated. I'm burning another grit, and I'm going to do a pushback on the elemental. That's actually no save, that's just a pushback. I just have to hit. And that hits, I should have done a-- that's a 29, 32 to hit.
Matt: 32 to hit. That'll hit, go ahead and roll damage. And it just gets pushed back ten feet?
Taliesin: No, I'm saving you.
Marisha: I mean, I could have handled it.
Taliesin: 14. I want you to be able to get up without that thing on you. 20 points of damage. And it gets pushed back ten feet. Thank you.
Matt: Its form gets knocked back, coalesces again as a flickering flame creature. It's looking hurt, it's barely keeping its form together at this point, it's still standing.
Taliesin: I'm going to use my bonus action for a healing surge to add 22 points to my hit points. Then I'm going to keep running, use spider to run over that wall into that little house beneath the green dragon.
Matt: All right.
Liam: Spider-climb is cool.
Sam: Little house on the prairie, with the dragon on it.
Taliesin: There we go.
Matt: All right. That finishes your turn, Percy. Now you watch as the skyship Deera pushes through some of the clouds, and you can now see a series of small shapes as it looks like a half-dozen wyverns are currently harrying it from the sky, attacking it. You can see some sort of combat going on on the bow of the ship, but you also watch as two of its arballists are set up, and fire towards Thordak. That actually hits. That's cocked. And, yeah. A 16 and a 15. With bonus, it hits both.
Laura: That's Captain Damon, right? To the rescue!
Matt: So, they're both super-heated, they are flaming arballists, fire doesn't have an effect, but they still do piercing damage, for a total of 22 points of piercing damage. You watch these two large, thick heavy metallic piercing bolts come arcing through, slamming into Thordak's hide. The flames flicker on the edge where it impacted, though it has little effect, and Thordak is (insane growling).
Travis: Crazy motherfucker.
Laura: He's so fucking crazy.
Matt: (insane growling) (maniacal laughter)
Sam: Oh, god.
Matt: Two of the wyverns apparently, noticing the fray, and peel off, beginning to make their way down to where this struggle is happening.
Sam: No problem. (whispered) Big problem!
Liam: This is a busy battlefield.
Matt: At this point in time, I'm going to do--
Taliesin: You're having way too much fun.
Matt: Yeah. Okay.
Sam: Matt has been waiting a year for this.
Liam: Don't worry, sir, we didn't see you playing with your dolls.
Matt: (laughs) Grog and Kima. Suddenly the ground quakes beneath you, and it splits open, and a very thick, yellowish-green sulfurous gas just spills out in the vicinity, immediately filling your lungs and causing your chest to seize just from breathing the air in. I need both you and her to make a... The area is now heavily obscured, so now there is a heavy smoke all in this area right now.
Laura: Does his head peek up above that?
Matt: Yes, it does.
Laura: He's so tall.
Matt: You don't do anything yet.
Travis: Nothing yet?
Matt: You don't do anything yet.
Travis: On my turn.
Matt: On your turn, you'll do it.
Sam: Does that affect the fire elemental, too?
Matt: It may.
Laura: You don't know.
Sam: I don't. Sam Five has his theories, though.
Matt: For Raishan's turn, as smoke has filled the area, (coughing) you're having a hard time-- Raishan sees this, picks up off the ground as the wyvern begins to strike. First I'm going to see if her breath comes back. It does not. Seeing the new creatures in the fray, is going to rush up and interfere with this one immediately, and just do a full round of attacks against the wyvern.
Travis: (singing) Eat the little pterodactyl.
Matt: That'll hit. That'll hit. That'll hit. Bite and two claws. Yep. That wyvern is looking really hurt, as you watch as Raishan reaches up and just tears into its side, and claws into its belly, they're both wrestling in the air, almost in a momentary freefall, then catch themselves again. Raishan just clings on. The wyvern is already in a really, really bad place.
Sam: Oh, that's great.
Matt: That ends Raishan's turn. At the end of Raishan's turn, Thordak is going to do another wing attack.
Liam: Man, Groggy. 17 displacer beasts just appear.
Laura: Like, why would he add wyverns? For his own sake!
Matt: He's going to do another wing attack, at the cost of two of its actions. Picking up the wind around it once more, I need Grog... Kima's just out of the range, thankfully. Grog, I need you to make a dexterity saving throw.
Travis: I have advantage because of--
Matt: You do.
Laura: Would the wings disperse the gas on the ground?
Matt: Nope! But it does push it.
Laura: Damn it.
Marisha: Oh, boy.
Travis: 17.
Matt: 17, nope. You take--
Laura: Oh, no!
Matt: 16 points of bludgeoning damage, reduced to eight.
Travis: Okay.
Matt: And you take eight points of fire damage, reduced to four, from the impact, and you are knocked prone. So you are now prone on the ground. And this gets pushed ever-so-slightly this way.
Travis: Off of me?
Matt: Off of you, onto Keyleth, Pike, Kima, currently. The dragon does shift.
Taliesin: Oh! No, Grog's down, so there's no attack of opportunity.
Matt: Keyleth, you're up. Initially, I need you to make a constitution saving throw.
Marisha: Yeah, all right. Not that one, not that one. Gil! Don't fuck me, Gil. All right, that's not too bad. 19.
Matt: 19, you succeed. You manage to just hold your breath, and the poison doesn't makes its way and fit into your lungs.
Marisha: So, I still have this asshole in front of me, right?
Matt: Yes, you do.
Marisha: But he's been pushed back?
Matt: It's pushed back, yeah, so it's not in contact with you.
Taliesin: Yeah, you got to see if you can get up and walk away.
Marisha: Yeah, that's cool. I will stand up.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Rise up! This guy in front of me is almost dead, right?
Matt: He's looking pretty rough, yeah.
Sam: Focus on the dragon.
Travis: What was that?
Sam: "Focus on the dragon."
Travis: "Focus on the dragon."
Marisha: How far away is Thordak from me?
Matt: Quite a ways away. I'd say close to 65, 70 feet from you.
Marisha: Okay. I am going to-- Can I move up one square closer to Thordak, but not get near the--
Matt: Yeah, right there, you can.
Marisha: But I'm in this cloud, too! Shit.
Sam: You have resistance to poison clouds, remember?
Marisha: I don't, but that's nice. And now I'm going to--
Matt: You are immune to poison, just so you're aware.
Marisha: Am I?
Matt: Because of the Heroes' Feast.
Marisha: Oh, because of the Heroes' Feast! Oh, that's right. Oh, well, fine.
Matt: Thordak doesn't know that.
Marisha: Right. And then I'm going to cast Blight on Thordak.
Matt: Okay. Thordak's going to make a saving throw. This is constitution?
Marisha: I think so?
Matt: Success. So half damage.
Sam: Success. Half damage. Hey, you caused damage! That's great!
Marisha: I did! I did a thing! Not too bad. 11, 17, 21, 23, 25, 31, 35. 35, halved.
Matt: Half of 35, all right. As the Blight spell takes hold, you watch as the tendrils of black necrotic energy begin to carve between the scales of Thordak's body. You watch as portions of the scar in the chest split, almost like a fresh wound. A little bit of pus begins to pour forth. It's nasty.
Marisha: I take a few steps back. Can I tuck into that little broken building, a little bit? Just inside the doorway?
Matt: Sure. You are just inside the doorway right now with Percy.
Marisha: Perfect.
Matt: Actually, you can't quite get that far because you were knocked prone, so you're just barely... No, you can just get in there, so you're good.
Marisha: How are you doing?
Taliesin: I am just-- I am regretting so many things right now.
Marisha: I don't know how we got here.
Taliesin: Neither do I. I should have saved him--
Matt: Well, it is a 30-foot range.
Marisha: What?
Matt: Blight has a 30-foot range.
Marisha: Oh. Hm. Yeah.
Matt: So we're going to take that damage off.
Marisha: Okay. Well...
Sam: Can we say that she walked 30 feet closer to--
Matt: No, because she was prone at the start of her round, she can only move 15 feet.
Marisha: Okay. Well, then instead, (reverse words), take me back. I can only do 15 feet. All right. How many feet am I from the elemental?
Matt: He is 15 feet from you. Ten feet.
Sam: You could have cast it on the--
Marisha: No, I'm not going to blow a 4th-level spell on his ass. I'm going to do a 1st-level spell, though, and do a Thunderwave.
Matt: Okay. So in that right there. What level, you're going to do first level?
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: Okay. That is a, what save? Constitution?
Marisha: Yes.
Matt: That is a 17, so it does not succeed, I don't think.
Marisha: It does not. It takes 2d8. Ooh, that's good! Ten damage! Please kill it, please kill it!
Sam: Does my hand need to make a save, as well?
Matt: No, because she aimed the-- It's a cone, right?
Marisha: It's a radius.
Matt: Radius? So yeah, your hand would have to--
Marisha: Oh, no, sorry. It's a cube. It's a cube, 15-foot cube.
Matt: Yeah, so you can just go right there. You're fine. As you get up off the ground, the smoke, you slam your staff into the ground. The smoke around you dissipates momentarily as the shockwave hits the fire elemental. It just turns into ash, and vanishes.
Marisha: Got rid of that fucking asshole. All right. And that's all I can do.
Matt: You have 15 feet you can move.
Marisha: Okay, now I'll tuck into there.
Matt: Now you can tuck in, yeah. Since you did move that time. There you go.
Travis: There you go!
Marisha: There you go!
Matt: At the end of Keyleth's turn, Raishan's going to use a legendary action to make another attack against the wyvern. That will hit. And that will do it. With that, the wyvern gets its head ripped off by Raishan. The body plummets, the lizardman that was riding it ends up falling off. Slams into the ground.
Travis: Wilhelm scream!
Marisha: (half-hearted Wilhelm scream)
Taliesin: (half-hearted Wilhelm scream)
Taliesin: I've got shit to do in the morning, I'm not going to do it for real.
Travis: All right, fair enough.
Matt: Nine points of bludgeoning damage, as it hits the ground. It's still alive, but it's looking up at this green dragon. That ends Keyleth's turn. Jarett is currently afraid as shit.
Travis: (laughs) Because he rolled not very good.
Matt: He's going to reload, and look over. He has to roll with disadvantage against Thordak from that distance, can't get closer. Even with disadvantage, hits, on the first attack. With 16 and 18. Misses with the second one.
Travis: Crossbow?
Matt: Yeah, with the crossbow. Still manages to do 13 points of piercing damage. To Thordak, which is nice. Jarett is then going to finish moving out of visual sight of this, like, "Nope, nope, nope!" Behind the wall, (panting) "This is, uh. This is a terrible idea. They're not paying me enough for this."
Taliesin: He's not going to take a shot at the elemental while he's running away?
Matt: No, he was focused on Thordak. He was just like, (yells). That ends Jarett's turn. Gilmore's turn. Gilmore is dodging out of the outside of the cloud, and goes, "All right. Let's see if we can try this again." He's going to go ahead and move up into the building just outside of the radius.
Travis: Come on, buddy.
Matt: Looking behind where the window is busted open, he's going to blow his one 7th-level spell as a lower-level spell of Disintegrate once more up towards the chest, where it's kind of cracked open. That is a 24, 13 plus 11, that hits.
Travis: Boom! Nobody else is excited about this?
Laura: I am. I am very excited.
Taliesin: Once I hear a number, I'll be excited. I'm not saying anything until I hear a number. It's going to be, like, 11 points of damage.
Travis: 7th-level Disintegrate.
Matt: That's an additional 3d6 to that. That's 13d6
All: Oh!
Matt: Plus 40 points of force damage.
All: Whoa!
Laura: 13d6.
Travis: Now y'all are excited!
Taliesin: Now we're on board.
Travis: I'm with you, Gilmore, I'm a true fan, OG!
Matt: So it deals 88 points of damage to Thordak. (cheering)
Matt: You watch as the beam slams right into the side of Thordak's shoulder and torso area, the beam firing out from behind the broken wall. The wings extend as he's bearing down on Vax, and as it hits, the flesh kind of peels away and turns to dust in the vicinity. (pained roar) You can see he's just reeling from the pain, the mouth opens wide, the eyes go wide, as it begins to curl across. As it does, you see it. There's a bit of bone exposed there where the flesh once was. You can see scar removed and pulled back. You can see on the inside of the ribcage, just barely exposed, the outside of a glistening red crystal that is embedded in Thordak's chest.
Sam: He does have it.
Laura: It was just covered.
Travis: The skin's grown over it.
Laura: And it's being absorbed, so I'm not going to get it.
Matt: That is the end of Gilmore's turn. That brings us to Grog and Thordak.
Travis: Would you like to go first?
Matt: First let me see-- This roll is going to-- Yes. I would like to go first.
Laura: Oh, no.
Sam: Oh, no.
Laura: He just got his fire breath back.
Matt: After getting disintegrated, Thordak, who was focused on you, his attention keeps shifting from place to place. He's not focused in his current mental state. (enraged roar) And you watch as he heaves, you see the flames flickering brighter and brighter across him. (fwoosh)
Sam: Oh, god. No.
Matt: Or actually, he'd be right there.
Laura: No!
Sam: No!
Taliesin: No!
Matt: You do get an attack of opportunity against him.
Liam: Yeah. Sneak attack, on top of that.
Matt: Yeah, because you have advantage, if you hit. So go ahead and roll twice.
Liam: Got him, got him. That's 26 plus... is 27.
Matt: 27 hits. Go ahead and roll damage with the sneak attack.
Taliesin: Are you using the sword?
Liam: Yep. Yes, I am using the sword.
Taliesin: Yes, you are. Love it.
Liam: Yes, where is my ten-sided die? Ten plus six is 16. Plus all of this shit. 16, 17, 23, 29, 33, 34, 38, 42, plus Hunter's Mark. 43.
Laura: Plus 3d6 for your dragon.
Liam: I already did that.
Laura: No, you didn't.
Liam: Correct. 43, thank you. 49. 50. 51.
Matt: 51 points of damage as Thordak rushes away from you. (pained roar) As you cleave across his underside, you watch as the blood just spills out. (wings flapping, hard landing) Actually, no, he's not going to land, he's staying up in the air.
Laura: There's no plastic big enough to support him!
Travis: Yeah, he ate too much, he can't get up in the air!
Laura: He's too fat to fly!
Liam: Too many Krispy Kremes.
Matt: Thordak is currently up--
Laura: Oh shit, he's high.
Travis: You just hit Grog.
Matt: I did, yeah. Hold on a sec.
Travis: He does not appreciate that.
Matt: Grog will calm down.
Liam: Here's Jenga, right here, that dragon's coming down. Holy cow.
Laura: Oh, my. There's rocks, it's on the rocks.
Liam: It's like Mousetrap. Holy cow.
Laura: Oh my god. Grog!
Liam: Oh my gosh!
Laura: He's too big to fly, we told you!
Liam: We'll use the theater of the mind, Matt!
Travis: One little bump of that table, and it's falling down.
Laura: It's all coming down. It's like he's going to knock over everything when comes down.
Matt: He's going to fire breath. That's going to be Grog, Kima, Pike, and Gilmore.
Sam: And the hand.
Matt: And the hand.
Travis: I really don't want that to fall. It's going to break.
Matt: So I need Grog and Pike to roll a dexterity saving throw.
Travis: All right. Come on, come on, Gil. Yes. Even better! 21.
Matt: That's still not enough.
Laura: Pike rolled a ten.
Travis: That was a 19.
Sam: The hand rolled a nine.
Laura: Oh, wait, does she get-- Wait. No.
Matt: That's 102 points of fire damage. Halved, for both of you, so 51 points of fire damage. No, no, to both of you! So 51 points of fire damage to Grog, and Pike. Pike needs to make a constitution saving throw to try and maintain concentration.
Liam: 19.
Matt: What's her constitution save?
Liam: Her modifier, so, a total of 20.
Matt: Not enough. So-- It's half the damage you take. She had to roll a natural 20. She probably couldn't have made it, yeah. So Beacon of Hope is gone. Beacon of Hope is gone. You took 51 points.
Travis: I took the 51.
Laura: Right when she needs it the most! (shriek)
Matt: Kima rolls a natural 20 on her save, so she takes half damage, at least, so Kima's still up!
Laura: If we hadn't had that Heroes' Feast, Pike would be unconscious.
Matt: Kima does not maintain her spell, unfortunately.
Laura: Pike is way low.
Liam: Pike is going to be looking out for Pike on her next turn.
Taliesin: That's cool.
Liam: Got to have that ray of sunshine, man.
Matt: Gilmore rolls a natural 20 on his reflex save.
All: Yes!
Matt: That's awesome. And thank god, so he's still unconscious. Gilmore is down and in flames right now.
Sam: Oh, god.
Travis: Wait, Gilmore is down, and is unconscious?
Matt: Unconscious.
Sam: Oh shit. I got him.
Travis: How high is Thordak in the air?
Matt: Thordak is 50 feet up.
Travis: Sam. What are you going to do?
Sam: I'm going to not let him die?
Travis: Okay. Is somebody planning to go into the fucking tunnel, on the earring?
Laura: Wha-- why?
Travis: Because I can't hit him. He's too high.
Laura: But he's-- There's crystals in his belly.
Travis: But wasn't there a tunnel that we wanted? I attach the Bloodaxe to the Chain of Returning and I throw it at his feet.
Matt: Okay. So you stand up.
Travis: Let me move 20 feet to his right rear, over here. Just in case he decides to do the Cone of Fuck Everything again. (laughter)
Travis: Then I'll throw the axe.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: Reckless! 29.
Matt: 29 hits.
Travis: Hey, that's a 12, that's great. Sorry, I'm blanking out. 25, 27, plus the 1d4 because I'm enlarged, which I didn't do last time. That's 30.
Matt: 30 points of damage. Good.
Travis: And I need to roll a DC of 14 to bring it back in, but it's strength.
Matt: Go ahead and roll.
Travis: That's too wild. That's off the wall. That's a 12. That's off the wall. God, nipples on a horse! Wait, do I have advantage?
Matt: While you're raging, you have advantage on strength rolls. Was it athletics or strength?
Travis: Strength. Advantage on strength checks, strength saves.
Matt: So, roll again.
Travis: 19.
Matt: You yank the axe back down, catch it in your hands. You did the extra 1d4 damage from being enlarged, right?
Travis: I did. It's that little tiny one.
Matt: That is going to end Thordak's turn. Now it is the elemental over here. It's going to (flame crackling) over next to Percy.
Travis: Ooh! Is the Second Wind a bonus action? Second Wind, the fighter thing?
Matt: That's a bonus action.
Travis: Can I do that?
Matt: Yeah. Go for it.
Travis: 1d10 plus fighter level, which is one.
Matt: 1d10 plus one.
Travis: Nine. Ten! Ten hit points.
Matt: Ten hit points, all right. All righty. Let's see. Vex, you're up.
Laura: Okay. I'm going to shoot him. I'm going to reach back and I'm going to get a poison arrow.
Matt: It's your third and final poison arrow?
Laura: No, I've got six poison arrows. That one missed.
Matt: It just barely misses Raishan on the way.
Laura: Sorry! Poison arrow. No, it's okay, it's good. That is a 27.
Matt: That hits.
Laura: 15 plus four lightning. Does he have anybody near him? Does he see me? Am I sneak attacking?
Travis: He's in the middle of the motherfucking sky.
Matt: You're not sneak attacking because nobody nearby can hit him.
Laura: Plus four because that's two for being a dragon. Okay, so you know. And then the poison arrow thing.
Matt: Right. He makes his save.
Laura: My last attack. I'm going to try using my last dragon-slaying arrow that I have.
Matt: Okay! This is the one you've had. This is the one you've kept this whole time, right?
Laura: It's got Thordak's name on it.
Matt: You reach back and you pull and there's two.
Laura: There's two?
Matt: There's two in there.
Liam: Do it.
Laura: Why do I have two?
Matt: You pull one out, look, and there's a small piece of paper attached to it.
Laura: Ooh! I rip it off and tuck it in my shirt. Pull. 21? No!
Matt: It arcs into the darkness, past the clouds and out of the Cloudtop.
Laura: Goddamn it.
Travis: It's okay!
Matt: You still have movement if you want to do something else.
Laura: Is the building on fire?
Matt: There's small flames here and there, but there is a wyvern up above the wall now that seems to have noticed you as you went around the corner and fired a few arrows.
Laura: Can I use my bonus to hide? From him?
Matt: You don't have anything to hide behind. It notices you over the side. You can move, if you want to, and try to do that.
Laura: The building is on fire? Can I move and try to duck into the building? I see a hole that's not on fire.
Matt: You could move around here and duck inside there.
Laura: Yeah. I'll try to hide in the building because wyverns, he's so dumb.
Matt: Go ahead and roll stealth.
Laura: How about that? That is a 14.
Matt: That's a 14? All righty. I forgot to do the fire elemental attacks against you, Percival, from earlier.
Taliesin: I had an environmental attack?
Matt: Fire elemental attack that came over there and attacked you. It was during Thordak's turn; I forgot to do that. It gets two touch attacks against you. That is 13.
Taliesin: That does not hit.
Matt: That's cocked. Natural 20.
Taliesin: That hits.
Travis: Yes! Oh. Not your natural 20.
Taliesin: Yeah, not mine.
Matt: 17 points of fire damage, halved to eight, and you are on fire.
Taliesin: Yeah, oh.
Travis: And you are on fire.
Taliesin: Does stop, drop and roll work in--
Matt: You have to use an action to get rid of it. So yes. And every turn, you'll take 1d10 fire damage until you get rid of it. All right, so, finishing Vex's turn, it is now Vax and Kima's. Kima's going to make a constitution saving throw. Kima makes it and is unaffected. Well, she's unaffected by the poison anyway because she was part of the Heroes' Feast.
Laura: Oh, right, that's poison. So she's immune.
Matt: Yeah, Kima is angrily going to rush over to Gilmore.
Sam: (pouring drink)
Marisha: It's never not weird.
Sam: (contented sigh)
Liam: It's really on Matt for there being no pee break.
Matt: It's true. It's true. Kima is going to go ahead and Lay Hands on Gilmore.
Marisha: Oh yeah, Kima.
Matt: She's going to heal him for 35. All righty, so as Kima rushes over, still staring at Thordak up in the air, (wing flapping) she hand vaults over the destroyed wall, runs over to Gilmore's unconscious burning form and, moving her hand out of the way to put the flames out, pats him down and as her hand glows and she slams onto his chest and you watch (gasping) the breath come to him. As his eyes flicker open, she goes, "It's not your time yet, buddy." Picks up her sword and angrily looks over towards Thordak again. She can move five more feet that way, that's as much as she can get this turn. But that's her action. Pike's turn.
Liam: Vax's turn.
Matt: Sorry, Vax's turn.
Liam: I'm going to fly straight at Thordak's flank. You can put me, well, don't actually put me there, because he'll topple.
Matt: Yeah, but you're up there.
Liam: But I'm going to attack twice, once with the dragonslayer sword, once with Whisper, so here's the dragonslayer sword. Natural 20! (cheering)
Liam: Sneak attack damage!
Matt: Okay. So you have the sword and Whisper both attuned?
Liam: Yeah. But this is the sword.
Matt: Yeah, go for it.
Laura: He's going to use a legendary. I can see it on his damn face.
Liam: He can't against damage, can he?
Liam: All right, well, here we go.
Matt: Can't legendary resist against damage.
Laura: You can't?
Matt: No, it's only against saving throws.
Liam: Yeah. So seven. I'll save the bonus for later. Seven plus the three.
Sam: Roll high. Roll strong.
Liam: Seven, eight, 14, 18, 18 plus all of this. And I'm smiting, by the way. 18, 21, 24, 26, 30, 32, 35, 39 plus Hunter's Mark is 42, plus Divine Smite-- 46. 48 times two is 96.
Matt: Without the bonus.
Liam: Without the bonus, so a hundred and... two.
Matt: 102 points of damage against Thordak.
Laura: On your first attack!
Liam: For the second attack-- good, this is, yeah, it hits, 16 plus, 20, 20, 25. This is Whisper, so that is one plus-- is nine plus psychic damage...
Laura: Can't you just attack twice with the dragon sword?
Liam: No.
Laura: Why not?
Liam: Hand, hand.
Laura: Oh.
Liam: 16 for Whisper.
Matt: All righty.
Liam: And I will use my last action, so that was action, bonus action-- last action to disengage and fly down and land by Kima and Gilmore, this side of the building. Closest to me.
Matt: Right here?
Liam: On the ground, even, if I can, yeah. Behind the column in the corner by Gilmore's head, I think.
Matt: Okay. So as you rush up, sword at the side, jam it to the hilt to the side of Thordak's haunch and upper torso area, using the momentum behind you, you continue to push forward and yank the blade around like a can opener. Just cutting through the scales and hide. (pained yelling) And as you tear through, the blade, it comes out the other side, cutting through the flesh as you spin around with your wings still out in front, you spin with Whisper and slam it into the open wound with the exposed crystal, hitting the crystal with the Vestige. (shattering) There's a flash of light, and you continue downward, landing off to that side. As you turn around and look up, you watch as the crystal begins to crack. (shattering) (gasping)
Sam: It's got a weak spot. Weak spot.
Marisha: Oh shit.
Liam: Pretty sure I just had an orgasm. (laughter)
Sam: In game, or right here?
Taliesin: Could be both now, actually. (laughter)
Matt: All right. That's your turn.
Sam: You've done your thing.
Liam: Take it, take it. Pike cheat sheet, here we are.
Laura: Pike cheat sheet.
Matt: All righty, that brings us to Pike's turn.
Laura: Pike.
Matt: Pike has to make-- nothing because of the poison.
Laura: Heroes' Feast?
Matt: Yeah, so, what's Pike doing?
Laura: Pike is going to cast Heal on herself at seventh level. So she's going to heal herself for 80 points.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: So she's got 84 points now.
Liam: She was low.
Laura: She was super low.
Taliesin: She can take a death, remember. She can actually take a death. But yeah.
Laura: Okay, but then she can't heal people. And then is anybody injured around her?
Sam: Everybody's injured around her.
Laura: Gilmore's still pretty low, right?
Matt: Gilmore's not too great.
Laura: Okay, then she's going to run, she's going to cast Healing Word on Gilmore.
Matt: Okay, he's within range.
Laura: At second level that she can do it at?
Matt: Right, so that's 2d4 plus five.
Laura: So that's, oh, right, because now shit's gone.
Matt: Yeah, Beacon of Hope is gone.
Laura: Ten.
Matt: All right.
Laura: And she's going to use her movement to run back into the building with Scanlan.
Matt: That's as far as she can get, right there. Okay, that ends Pike's turn. Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: Oh. I'll, through the earring, say, Grog, you want to go for a ride, or no?
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: Okay, action, I will arc around and Lightning Bolt the dragon real quick. With the hand cone, I don't know if that makes any difference. No, it doesn't. It might.
Marisha: It can't hurt. It's got to save against that shit.
Matt: Yeah, you can see it from there. It's high enough in the sky. You don't have to arc around, you can go (magic shooting noise). Okay, makes his save.
Sam: Yeah, great, so what, I still roll damage and he takes half?
Matt: Yeah. He takes half.
Sam: Okay. That's fine. 23. So, 12, 11, something like that.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Great.
Matt: 11 points of lightning damage.
Marisha: Good job, buddy. Man, good thing we gave you that flute.
Laura: I know, right, fucking A, Scanlan!
Sam: We're doing great, guys, nobody's dead yet.
Taliesin: It's so great that you did that 11 points.
Marisha: Yeah, wait until we're-- he's on the other side of the continent. It could like--
Sam: And as the bonus action-- The Hand, who is still alive. He took 102 points of damage, but is still alive.
Travis: Bigby's Hand is?
Sam: Yes, because he has my hit points. So he'll go over and lift up Grog by the scruff of his neck and go as high and mighty as he can. He can move like 120 feet, I think.
Travis: Like a fucking puppy.
Matt: You can move him up to 60 feet per turn.
Sam: What? 120! Wait.
Matt: No, the spell's range is 120. Per turn, as a bonus action, it can move at 60 feet. (laughter)
Sam: Well, knowing that, I'll just punch the dragon.
Matt: Okay. So the hand (whoosh) goes up. Punch him. Roll a spell attack.
Sam: Nope.
Matt: Whiffs.
Laura: Wait, you're close to Pike. She uses War God's Blessing to increase your attack by-- can she do that? Is it technically an attack that she could add?
Matt: Let me check real fast. Let me see here.
Laura: Was it really low?
Sam: I mean, you don't know.
Matt: Makes an attack roll.
Laura: So yeah? So, do I roll the ten, or is it just a plus ten bonus?
Matt: Plus ten bonus.
Sam: Yeah, 23.
Matt: 23 just hits. (cheering)
Sam: It does hit! 6d8.
Matt: 8d8.
Sam: No, it's usually 4d8, I think.
Matt: 4d8, and you cast it, it's usually fifth level, you cast it as a seventh level.
Sam: So it's 4d8, so now it's 6d8.
Matt: It goes up by 2d8 every level higher.
Sam: Oh, shit!
Laura: Oh my god. 4d8?
Sam: No, 8d8.
Laura: 8d8?!
Matt: Yes. Just punched the dragon in the face with Bigby's Hand.
Sam: Pike happened. Oh my god, Ashley is the MVP tonight. (laughter)
Sam: Okay. Not huge, but okay. It's okay. 36.
Laura: That's great!
Travis: That's great!
Marisha: That's better than 11.
Sam: Yeah. Hey, I just dealt 47 points of damage! That's respectable! (approving murmurs)
Travis: How's that Vestige treating you?
Matt: Top of the next round, Percy. First you take... You take ten, five points of fire damage.
Sam: (whispering) Laura.
Matt: That is terrifying. Oh my god.
Laura: Thanks for getting my attention for that. (laughter)
Matt: Goddamn it.
Sam: That will inspire you.
Liam: Somebody gets an inspiration die. (laughter)
Taliesin: I'm going to spider-climb-- I'm going to stay within striking distance, I'm not going to disengage from the jerk, but I'm going to climb up on the wall above him, if that's okay.
Matt: I'd say yeah, you can do that. The wall next to him, there's nothing above him.
Taliesin: Like, oh, I'm shooting at the television. Here.
Matt: Here? So you can move around and get on the wall.
Taliesin: Yeah, like climb up there and be sideways. I'm going to pull out Bad News, I'm going to try something new. I'm seeing that big spike, there's a big metal spike stuck in his chest right now?
Matt: No, there's no spike. There's a crack in the crystal that's exposed.
Taliesin: Is there still not a metal pole?
Matt: There's no metal pole.
Taliesin: I thought he got hit by a thing.
Matt: No, he got hit by a Vax.
Taliesin: Okay, I thought he also got hit by a thing. But that's okay. I'm going to try something weird. I'm going to spend a grit for advantage on this shot, because--
Sam: "Constructing a pole vault."
Taliesin: I'm going to add two points of Cabal's Ruin to this.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: What does that do? What? You have a thing?
Taliesin: I'm going to spend two points of Cabal's Ruin. I have a thing.
Matt: You can spend them once you roll to hit.
Taliesin: Oh, I can wait until after?
Matt: Wait until you see you hit it, then you can spend the points.
Taliesin: Well, that's even better. So first shot is a 27 to hit.
Matt: That hits.
Taliesin: So I'm going to drop two-- I've got the little thing running through my glove, I've got the wire. I'm just going to let go of the little grounding wire and see what happens. I'll hold onto the barrel and pray. Let's add 2d6 to that. Is that right? Yeah.
Liam: I really like this spider-climb guy.
Taliesin: I know, I'm digging this-- augh, it's okay. Yeah, this is okay. 22 points of damage plus two points of electrical damage.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Did you roll your Cabal's Ruin thing?
Taliesin: I did, yeah, I did, I'm going to do that again.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: I'm going to burn two more points-- Well, I'm going to wait. That's really cool, that I can wait.
Laura: That was the softest little roll.
Taliesin: I hate it when that happens. I know, that was the worst roll I've ever done. That's okay. It's 22. Just hits?
Matt: 22 misses.
Taliesin: 22 misses?! That's fine. I'm not going to burn any Cabal. So that's fine.
Matt: The first blast fires off... It impacts the side of Thordak. You watch the little charge of energy shoot through. Second shot, however, goes a little wide, as you feel the fire still burning up the front of your torso. It's enough to distract you from your actual aiming.
Taliesin: That was very cool, though.
Marisha: You can do that.
Taliesin: Once I set it up, I can arc a charge to the bullet.
Matt: Okay, that ends your turn, Percy?
Taliesin: That ends my turn. I may drop back behind-- No, I'm good, I'm good.
Matt: At this point, the ground quakes beneath--
Taliesin: That was a terrible roll. Terrible roll.
Marisha: Yes, it was.
Taliesin: Snake eyes was not cool.
Matt: No, he can't do the same twice in a row, so it's going to do another magma erupt. (laughs) Beneath where Gilmore is, the ground splits open-- (groans)
Matt: --and another burst of magma billows out from underneath. Going against Kima, Vax, that's where most of them are clustered. Kima, Vax, and Gilmore. I need you to roll a dexterity saving throw.
Liam: Yeah, evasion for me.
Taliesin: Walls hate NPCs.
Liam: With advantage. 18 for me.
Matt: 18 for you. All right, that's okay. Gilmore rolls a--
Laura: Natural 20?
Matt: 15, which is enough. Kima rolls a natural 20-- (cheering)
Matt: So half as much damage to each of you guys. You take none.
Liam: I'm sitting pretty. I mean, I'm really rough.
Laura: Don't say that out loud.
Sam: Have you taken any damage?
Matt: That's 21, that's ten points of fire damage to both Kima and Gilmore.
Taliesin: Halved?
Matt: That was halved.
Liam: I am Borishnakoffing all over this battlefield.
Taliesin: Somebody's going to dive into that hole.
Matt: As that bursts off, you also watch as the airship Deera coasts around this way and takes three shots. (cheering)
Matt: Misses. Hits! And misses. So three of them shoot past. The third one impacts for seven points of piercing damage to Thordak. You watch as two other wyverns get cut down from the edges of the ship, slamming into the ground near you. Their arms curl up, and the wings fall limply to the side. You also hear a slamming sound as from a nearby wall, you watch as a fire giant that has climbed over the edge of the wall.
Laura: Why would you bring more things onto the battlefield?!
Matt: It charges into the fray, this way.
Marisha: Wait, over what wall, over what wall?
Matt: On the outside of the side of the Cloudtop.
Sam: Is this one of the fire giants we've seen?
Marisha: Yeah, is this one that Zahra and Kash were guarding?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Marisha: Can I do it?
Matt: You barely have a view of it, so yes, you can.
Laura: Do I have a view of it?
Matt: No, you're inside the room.
Marisha: Ooh, yeah, 25.
Matt: You see it, this one does not appear to be coming from the direction they were.
Laura: That's good, that's good. That's not a damn it, that's a good.
Marisha: Means they're still alive. Hopefully?
Matt: With that, it is Raishan's turn. Raishan gets her breath back.
Travis: (singing) Girl, get your breath back.
Matt: Raishan rears back, (hissing roar) releases the same poisonous torrent toward Thordak.
Travis: Halitosis is a bitch.
Sam: We have exactly one ally dragon in this fight right now.
Travis: I will fucking-- I will pop all your knuckles.
Sam: We do! She's great.
Liam: The last thing we'll do in this fight is all turn on you.
Marisha: The last thing we do is die as we see a bronze dragon show up.
Laura: Yeah, we're all dead on the ground, and Scanlan's like, yay!
Matt: He takes half damage as the poison cloud billows up, (cough, sinister growl).
Sam: Aw, he's still crazy.
Matt: "You're still around us? That's okay. There's still time... to eat." Raishan is going to fly past and land on the top of the roof, which nearly crumbles. Nearly crumbles above you, Keyleth, you feel stones (crash) around you, and you see Raishan landing on the ceiling of this damaged building as parts of it begin to collapse.
Laura: Look how little she is.
Matt: That ends Raishan's turn. Keyleth, you're up.
Liam: Go, girl.
Marisha: So she's on top of me, more or less? I'm going to turn around and Tidal Wave this elemental behind me.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: I was going to say, if I'm caught in the corner of this, will this extinguish me?
Marisha: Extinguishes all flames.
Matt: It does. Wait, so what spell are you doing? You're doing--
Travis: Tidal Wave.
Laura: Is that one, like, still up or something? Is it like a concentration that just lasts?
Marisha: No, the other one was Tsunami. That one is like the big daddy version of this one. Yeah.
Matt: So, Percy, I need you to make a dexterity saving throw.
Taliesin: Can I autofail if I just want to be-- Oh, that's right, for half damage.
Matt: Yes.
Taliesin: All right. Dex saving throw. That's an 11.
Matt: So roll 4d8 bludgeoning damage. Percy takes, and Percy is knocked prone, but is no longer on fire.
Taliesin: I just fall on the ground, I assume.
Marisha: Sorry, Percy. I'm saving your life, man!
Matt: However, the unscathed fire elemental is turned to mist. Water pushing past and doing way too much damage for him to--
Marisha: Is this damage for Percy? 21.
Travis: Thanks, Keyleth. (laughter)
Liam: Legitimately though!
Matt: But a full health fire elemental is turned to mist and is immediately destroyed. Actually, the force of it blows out the rocks from this side of the wall. And the wall, the wall here actually gets knocked open to that side as the tidal wave pushes out. Keyleth, do you want to move or stay where you are?
Marisha: I'll pop myself out of the door a little bit.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: What's that other thing that you've been doing to him? That he has to save on every once in a while?
Laura: Oh, Contagion?
Marisha: Contagion, he has to do that at the end of his turn. Did he do it at the last...?
Matt: He did, yes. It was a 13 plus...
Marisha: So he's saved against two or one?
Matt: He's only done two, so far, since you cast it.
Marisha: He's only done-- I know about one.
Matt: No, because you didn't do it your first turn, you did it your second turn, so yeah, twice.
Laura: Yeah, he's definitely done it twice.
Marisha: And he's saved against both? Are you sure?
Matt: Yes.
Marisha: All right.
Sam: But are you sure?
Matt: Yes. (laughter)
Matt: Is that the end of your turn?
Marisha: Do I see Gilmore?
Matt: You, from your current perspective, you do not.
Marisha: Then, yeah.
Matt: Okay. Jarett, who is currently scared out of his wits.
Travis: Get your shit together, man.
Sam: Jarett, do you need some suude?
Travis: Spice?
Matt: Ha, He's like, "What? No, why would you..."
Sam: Well, you look crazy right now.
Matt: "Look at that!"
Sam: It's like a Thursday.
Matt: And he goes and takes two more shots, with disadvantage against. That's a miss. Second shot, disadvantage. Is a miss. Both shots firing off.
Travis: We'll remember this. Your annual review's coming up.
Sam: Needs improvement.
Matt: Gilmore, who's now conscious, doesn't have a whole lot else as far as attack spells go, is going to attempt to stand up. "All right, that was--" (groaning)
Liam: Matt, why would you!
Sam: He flew 30 feet.
Matt: I can count that.
Travis: No!
Taliesin: No!
Matt: Then stop giving me shit.
Liam: Why would you!
Matt: As he gets up, he leans back and backs out of the rubble, takes in his surroundings, sees the magma receding from the crack in the ground. "This is... You guys bring me to the greatest places. Oh, he's not looking too good." And releases a Lightning Bolt.
Marisha: He's not looking too good?
Matt: He's not looking too good. And he's going to release a Lightning Bolt at fifth level. A 5th-level Lightning Bolt. A 5th-level Lightning Bolt. Thordak makes his save. And that will be, come on, dice. 49. Half that will be 24 points of lightning damage against Thordak. That ends Gilmore's turn. Grog and Thordak.
Travis: Oh God. I'm going first.
Matt: All right, what are you doing?
Travis: Because it's so insignificant. I'm going to attach the Bloodaxe to the Chain of Returning and throw it at his foot.
Taliesin: You could go in the hole, just saying.
Travis: I thought we didn't care about the hole?
Taliesin: I care about the hole.
Travis: Grog loves going in holes.
Laura: Just do what you're going to do.
Travis: All right, I throw the Bloodaxe.
Sam: You can also hold your attack until he's closer or something?
Travis: Reckless! Yeah, that's not going to happen. 31.
Matt: 31.
Travis: It's not Great Weapon Master. That's a 12. That's good. Two points of necrotic for 27 and I'm enlarged! And that's another one.
Sam: Hey, 28 is great!
Travis: Hey, matzoh ball in your face.
Matt: That's awesome.
Travis: And then I've got to pull it back.
Taliesin: With advantage.
Travis: Seven plus 14, woo! Got it.
Matt: Yeah. You pull the axe back.
Sam: You got a bonus action or something?
Laura: You could attack again?
Travis: No I can't, I can only throw it once.
Matt: Thordak is going to swoop in.
Sam: You could heal or something? You've got potions and shit, don't you?
Laura: Can't you hold your other attack until he moves?
Travis: I don't have another attack.
Matt: Let's see here.
Liam: He's hesitating.
Travis: It takes my whole action. I get two attacks in an action.
Sam: He's hovering. God, he's going to his other Dungeons & Dragons game! (laughter)
Laura: He's like, welp, I'm over this.
Sam: Oh God! That's dangerously close.
Matt: I know.
Laura: Oh god.
Matt: Right there, Gilmore just behind.
Laura: Gilmore is up his butt.
Matt: Raishan right there. Lands right up next to Pike.
Laura: No!
Matt: Everyone else in that vicinity.
Laura: Oh no, that's Pike and Scanlan isn't it?
Sam: Oh boy.
Matt: Yup. And (inhales).
Laura: What? Why would you do that to Pike?!
Matt: Rolled a five on that. Because Pike keeps healing everybody. That'll be towards Jarett, Scanlan and Pike. I need you guys to make dex saves.
Sam: I'll Cutting Words this.
Matt: How many more bardic inspiration dice do you have by the way?
Sam: I have used only three. That means I have three left.
Matt: You've inspired one and you've Cutting Words twice? Correct, all right, cool. This is your fourth?
Sam: Yep. So I will Cutting Words that up with a poem I will make up on the spot. Roses are red, Violets are blue, I'm a gnome, and you're an asshole. (laughter)
Matt: Roll a d12. What was Pike's dexterity save again?
Liam: Oh no, it's this die.
Sam: Oh, you can reduce that by one point, Matt Mercer.
Matt: (laughing) Oh no. What did you get? Nah, roll your dexterity saving throw.
Sam: My dexterity saving throw. Terrible, 15.
Matt: Jarett does not make it either.
Liam: Big eight, big eight.
Matt: All right, well.
Laura: One of our Jaeger controllers did worse than our other--
Liam: You shut your pie hole! Hear me, half-elf?
Matt: Well, with the damage reduction from Scanlan that's only 100 points of fire damage.
Taliesin: Cut in half.
Matt: Cut in half, so that's 50 to each of you. Jarett is practically immolated. His unconscious body hits the ground, crisp, smoking. He's currently going into shock and is in a really bad place right now.
Sam: Where's Pike? What's Pike doing?
Laura: Pike is-- Wait, minus 50. She's at 50 minus--she's at 34 points right now.
Taliesin: In combat range of a dragon.
Travis: I never finished my turn, so can I use my movement now? Since we're on the same, can I chase him back to where he landed? 50 feet and how far does that get me?
Matt: Yeah, you can get right up behind him right there.
Laura: Can you attack him now?
Travis: Nah. Nah. Actually, my bonus action is still there and I am frenzied.
Matt: Yes, you are.
Travis: Can I attack?
Matt: Sure.
Travis: I'll do it Reckless.
Matt: I'll let you do it. It all happened at once.
Travis: 29?
Matt: 29 hits.
Travis: Yeah, not Great Weapon Master. Nine plus two, 26, 29. 29.
Matt: 29? All righty. That ends your turn.
Travis: That does.
Sam: Matt, in the interest of honor, should I roll a concentration saving throw?
Matt: Oh yes, you should. Sorry, thank you.
Sam: I rolled a-- what do I add to it?
Matt: It's a constitution saving throw, so you add your constitution save.
Sam: Constitution? So 18.
Matt: With that, Bigby's Hand fades, the spell knocked asunder. Thank you for reminding me of that. So that comes to end that turn.
Marisha: He has to roll a save.
Matt: Yes, he does. And that is a seven plus 16.
Marisha: Does he still have disadvantage on these?
Matt: No, he doesn't have disadvantage on every save, just the one. He was Cutting Words'd, you're right.
Marisha: Yeah. He has to roll under a five.
Matt: Same thing. So with that, the third save is made, Contagion.
Sam: At least it won't eat up my Cutting Words any more.
Marisha: It's resting in peace with my 8th-level spell and her dragon-slaying arrow. They're in a puddle somewhere.
Matt: It's a rough couple rounds.
Laura: Did I see where that dragon-slaying arrow sailed off to?
Matt: With the sheer amount of clouds of ash and blackness in the air, you have no idea where it went, I'm afraid. At the end of Thordak's turn, the wyvern that had seen you, it did spot you. Your stealth was not very good. It leaps down into the back of the building and (growls) coming towards you. The wyvern's going to make a multi-attack. The first is a bite attack against you. That's a natural one. Does not hit you. The stinger, however, is a natural 20. Wow! So that is for 12 points of piercing damage to you and I need you to make a constitution saving throw.
Liam: Poison immunity.
Taliesin: Poison immunity.
Matt: That's right. So no effect.
Laura: 12 points of damage.
Matt: The rider is going to swing at you with a heavy club and then a javelin. That is a 16. What's your AC?
Laura: 21.
Matt: Nope. And no. Misses you with both. You're just too quick for him. The giant sees Percy lying on the ground and goes (yells). With its giant two-handed sword, it's going to make two attacks against Percy with advantage. 19, so that's 30 for the first one.
Taliesin: Oh, that just hits.
Matt: And a 22 with the second.
Taliesin: That also just hits.
Matt: All right. So you take 28 points of slashing damage from each hit.
Taliesin: So that's 28 times two.
Laura: 56.
Taliesin: 56. All right, that's fine. I blame you for all of this.
Sam: We're getting in flute range soon.
Taliesin: I'll be hearing about it from the kitchen. It'll be great. I'll be working on my new character.
Matt: All right. That brings us to--
Sam: Raishan?
Matt: No. That brings us to Vex's turn.
Laura: I can't see anything about where I am.
Matt: You're back here right now.
Laura: Yeah, I can't see that on the screen, so I don't know.
Liam: Other side of that building.
Laura: Can I use disengage to get away from the wyvern?
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: I'm going to do that and I'll run out somewhere. Where's the laser pointer?
Liam: I can't see where Vex is at all.
Laura: I just have no clue where I am.
Matt: Well, I have you right here because you actually fell and your base came off and I glued it together when you were talking.
Laura: No way! Oh, I thought you said the face.
Sam: He has crazy glue on his person?
Matt: Like any good dungeon master should. So you're inside this building right now.
Laura: If I'm hasted, does that affect my broom?
Matt: No.
Laura: So I just run out.
Matt: So you just run out this way. You have a lot of movement speed, so you're still out here at half movement.
Laura: Okay. Then I'm going to run through the building and under Raishan and shoot up at Thordak from through the building.
Liam: Ditch the broom.
Matt: Go for it. Make your shots.
Laura: Okay. Oh no, that one doesn't hit. Okay, second one. Okay, that hits. That's 29.
Matt: 29. All right.
Laura: Can I do that with a poison arrow? I should have said that before.
Matt: You should have said that before.
Laura: Never mind. 18, that's with four lightning. I do get sneak attack right now. 15 more.
Matt: Okay. That was the first roll. Second attack?
Laura: Yeah. Should I do the second dragon attack? I'm so scared to use the dragon arrow.
Travis: There is no tomorrow. There's a giant fucking dragon and a fire giant.
Liam: Pop his head off in one shot. Go.
Laura: I'm going to use my dragon arrow. My last one. Oh, good! That was so close but it definitely hit.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Oh God. Okay. 17 with one lightning.
Matt: One lightning damage. All right.
Laura: So three more. And how many do I add for the dragon arrow?
Matt: I'm looking it up right now, actually.
Sam: Ooh!
Laura: I think it's 10d6. I think.
Sam: Is it really?
Laura: Or 6d10. It's one of those two.
Sam: 10d20.
Laura: 10d20. 12d12.
Travis: 100d100s. And the universe implodes.
Matt: DC 17 constitution saving throw.
Laura: He gets to save?
Matt: Yes, he does. Which he makes. So he takes half damage. So it's 6d10.
Laura: Oh! Whoa. That's okay, I'll just roll this, 'cause this is easier.
Liam: 6d10.
Laura: Oh, that was just 6d10. 32 halved.
Matt: 32 halved. All right.
Sam: Worth it.
Matt: You release the first arrow, which goes and strikes Thordak in the upper shoulder wing area. (growls) He turns around and goes to face you, the arms and wings open angrily. As you release the dragon-slaying arrow, it goes and hits the side where the chest is currently disintegrated and exposed. As the arrow, using the power of Fenthras behind it, slams into the crystal, the crystal shatters. As it breaks, you watch as Thordak goes (crazed laughter) and the form begins to slowly shrink.
Travis: Oh shit!
Matt: (growling) He seems to be grinning and laughing through the pain as the swollen, primordial dragon form of Thordak begins to slowly wither and wither.
Sam: You have another model?
Laura: What?!
Sam: And it's even bigger.
Laura: Look at the puny little fuck.
Sam: He's a little puny baby.
Matt: That's still a pretty fucking huge dragon. (laughter)
Sam: He's so sad.
Matt: Now there are hanging folds of dragon hide skin. The form shrunk, but portions still are sagging off of it.
Laura: Can I duck around the side so I'm in the building? So I'm not in the opening. Yeah.
Marisha: Are we going to try and take Raishan out as well?
Matt: At the end of your turn, he's going to use two legendary actions to wing attack. Trying to whip the wings much faster now due to the somewhat dire circumstances. I need Pike, and currently just Pike, to make a dexterity saving throw.
Sam: Come on, Pike. For all the marbles.
Laura: 17.
Matt: Nope. Pike takes 20 points of bludgeoning damage and eight points of fire damage reduced to four.
Laura: So she's got ten points left.
Sam: She's a perfect ten. Always was.
Matt: He's going to fly up--
Sam: Does Pike get an attack of opportunity?
Travis: I do!
Laura: And Pike does!
Matt: There we go. You both do.
Travis: Has his AC changed with his different size? You don't know? Reckless, Great Weapon Master. Natural 20.
Matt: Really?
Travis: Yeah, on the first roll.
Laura: And Pike rolled a 32.
Sam: Jesus. What is she attacking with?
Laura: Her Mace of Disruption.
Sam: Yes, she is.
Matt: So go ahead and roll damage for both of them.
Travis: I also have brutal critical which at thirteenth level, you roll two additional damage dice.
Matt: Yes, you do.
Taliesin: Which you then double, don't you?
Matt: No. You add those two. So roll the damage first, and then double the dice.
Laura: And then she gets Divine Strike, right? On her attack.
Matt: Correct.
Travis: 28. So I double that?
Matt: You double the dice. Including the d4 and d6 from your weapon and your enlarged status.
Travis: Right. So that's 16 doubled, 32. So then, that's an 11. So 47.
Matt: Nice, and Pike's?
Laura: Pike rolled-- fuck. 18. 19! It was 19.
Matt: Okay. Perfect. You both strike, as the now-diminished form of Thordak begins to pull backward, eyes looking around. The piercing star-like white light of the eyes seems to have slowly recoiled into a glowing reddish-orange. And you can now see where the crystal once was in the chest, there is just a gaping hole where bits of flesh and dragon muscle are hanging out, occasionally slopping out of the wound. He's pulling back. All right.
Liam: I'm up.
Matt: Yep.
Liam: I'm going to arc up and land on his head. I'm just going to unload all three: action, action, bonus action, into his head.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: First attack probably misses, that's 17?
Matt: Misses.
Liam: Second attack hits. That's 24.
Matt: Hits.
Liam: Third attack with the dragon sword is a 22.
Matt: 22 hits.
Liam: So, with Whisper. (counting) That's 45 with Whisper. And then with the dragonslayer sword. Eight plus six plus 3d6. So 21. What did I say before that?
Laura: 45.
Travis: 45.
Liam: So 21 plus 45 is-- So 66.
Laura: It's 45 for the first attack, 21 for the second.
Matt: Yeah. Okay.
Liam: And I will stay there.
Matt: You're going to stay there? All right. So you are currently up here, in Thordak's face.
Laura: This is going to be bad if we have to take Raishan out.
Matt: Cool, so that ends Vax's turn. Kima--
Sam: Oh yeah, the wyvern.
Matt: That wyvern just can't seem to keep itself standing.
Sam: That was really good handwork, I didn't catch any of it. That I got.
Matt: She's just going to move towards Raishan. She's going to move over to this wall.
Liam: Sorry. Also, four for Hunter's Mark on the second attack as well.
Matt: Okay. That's ends Kima's turn, going over there. Pike's turn. Pike is knocked prone from the spell earlier.
Laura: She's still alive. She gets up.
Liam: Girl.
Laura: (singing) She's going to Guiding Bolt up the butt! At what level do we have left?
Liam: So many levels. All the levels. Pike cheat sheet. Five!
Laura: She's going to cast it at a five.
Liam: Plus 1d6 every level above second level. So 3d6.
Laura: 4d6. Plus 4d6. So 8d6. She has to roll the attack first, or just straight-up?
Matt: Well, she has to roll to attack with her spell bonus, her spell attack bonus.
Laura: 24.
Matt: 24 hits.
Laura: All right. So 8d6.
Liam: You can do it, Pike. All the way from New York City.
Laura: Five. Seven. Eight. Ten. 16. 18. Another two. 26.
Matt: 26? Nice. As the guiding bolt slams into the side of Thordak's side, you can see this glimmering beacon of light. The next attack against Thordak has advantage.
Laura: Oh good. And then she's going to Healing Word again? Yeah, she's pretty fucked, so she'll Healing Word at second level, that's her last 2nd-level...
Matt: So 2d4 plus five. To herself?
Laura: And that's just to one person? Yeah, so she'll... so she's going to do that to Jarett.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: She would heal Jarett over herself?
Laura: It's Pike. I'm being honest, she would heal Jarett.
Travis: I don't know why we're wasting that on Jarett.
Matt: Jarett went and got you illicit drugs, Scanlan!
Travis: I mean, he had a great accent, but fuck. You remember the cryptkeeper? Jarett's going to those auditions tomorrow.
Laura: So that's eight.
Matt: Eight? Okay, so Jarett is healed up eight points.
Liam: He is Groot.
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: Where the terrible burns are, most of them seem to heal, or at least scar to a point where he comes to consciousness. He's like, "What happened?"
Laura: "Jarett, you need to get up and fight."
Matt: "Right." Grabs the crossbow to the side, leans up. So was that Pike's turn?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: All right, was that Pike's turn? Scanlan, you're up.
Taliesin: Like slap the charred skin off his face. Get back in there!
Liam: The whole face comes off.
Sam: Shit. I will use my action to pour my superior healing potion into Pike's mouth.
Liam: That's love.
Laura: "Scanlan, I can do that myself."
Sam: Oh wait. First, I aerate it. (laughter)
Laura: So that's 8d4?
Sam: I don't know. What is it?
Laura: That is 8d4. Do you do that or do I?
Sam: Do I roll it, or does she?
Matt: You roll it, that's fine.
Sam: It's just a bunch of d4s? 8d4s? Oh my god. This is so many. Six. 13. 16. 20, plus something. Plus six, 26.
Laura: Okay, that's good.
Sam: Who else can I see? Nobody. Jarett's alive, right?
Matt: Correct.
Sam: Now as my bonus action...
Travis: Whether he wants to be when he sees a mirror...
Sam: Well shit, I have an action, I can do anything. I can do anything!
Travis: Yeah, you could play the fucking flute.
Sam: What? What flute?
Liam: What are you saving it for?
Sam: I play a shawm.
Laura: We're going to have to fight Raishan in a second.
Marisha: This is far from over.
Taliesin: And whatever's in that pit. And whatever's in that pit.
Sam: What? How's she doing? Is she okay?
Laura: She's at 36.
Sam: It's not great. All right, I will attack the dragon. Bigby's Hand at level six. Why not?
Matt: So you recast Bigby's Hand?
Matt: All righty.
Liam: Give the people what they want.
Sam: That is not what they want.
Laura: Hey, he's got a hole in the middle of his chest.
Sam: I'll poke it.
Matt: Go ahead and roll a spell attack.
Sam: Nope. Did Pike help me out?
Laura: Yes! She casts her last War God's Blessing. Add a ten to that.
Matt: So plus ten to that.
Sam: 23.
Matt: 23 hits. So that would be?
Sam: 6d8. Gimme.
Liam: Here comes the gnome.
Taliesin: Here's 4d8. 5d8. 6d8.
Sam: 27.
Matt: 27? Nice.
Laura: Every time!
Matt: All right. Percival. Unless you want to move, Scanlan.
Sam: I moved to Pike to pour stuff in her. That's all. I did not mean that in any weird way.
Matt: Percival. Your turn.
Taliesin: Okay. I'm going to, for my bonus action, I'm going to down a greater, which is 4d4, I believe?
Matt: 4d4 plus four, yeah.
Laura: Did you add four to your 26 when you healed her? Or did you just roll--
Taliesin: I'm dying less. I'm going to stand up. I'm technically engaged with this bloody thing, aren't I?
Matt: Correct.
Taliesin: Okay. I'm just going to-- There's little I can do other than just say, please, somebody fix this, and I'm going to take two shots at the red dragon. First shot with Bad News. 23?
Matt: 23 hits.
Taliesin: I'm going to just throw-- forget it, I'll throw four charges of Cabal's Ruin there. Let's just do it.
Matt: That's an additional 4d6 damage.
Liam: Am I electrified, sitting on his head?
Taliesin: Technically speaking, no, the way that this works-- it's like a Tesla arc, so it wouldn't technically-- you'll feel tingly.
Matt: Your hair sticks up a little bit. Your nipples get a little pointy. (laughter)
Matt: Start shaking in the leather armor.
Liam: Do it again, Percy. (laughter)
Taliesin: Bloody fanart. Okay. And let's see what kind of damage we do with this. Eh. That sucks. Stop it! Stop it! I can't count when-- that's (counting) 21 points of damage. Stop saying that, it's 21! You don't know, it's 21.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: Second shot. Can I reroll that, 'cause he? Yeah, it misses. And now I'm going to die. You're like everything I hate about Overwatch.
Sam: You're not going to die.
Matt: One of the fingered claws of Thordak gets blasted off from the impact from Bad News, the energy arcing through the rest of his arm from Cabal's Ruin. The second shot, however, having to aim, manages to just barely miss Vax. He gets in the way of the shot, and you have to shoot wide and it misses entirely. Is that your turn?
Taliesin: Yeah. That's my turn.
Matt: At the end of Percy's turn, Thordak's going to go ahead and use his third legendary action.
Sam: To do what?
Matt: To do a tail attack against Vax. That is a 22 to hit?
Liam: No. Nope. Nope. Hasted, 23, fuck you. Not you.
Sam: 23? Jesus! Where'd you go?
Matt: All right. So that brings us to-- we're going to say this will be... all right. The ground shakes.
Sam: Oh, shit, I forgot about that. Lair actions.
Matt: A 60-foot radius around the dragon, as just the presence of Thordak, the ground just begins quaking beneath. You watch as fissures of small volcanic energy begin to break from underneath. Pretty much everybody--
Sam: Is Jarett in there?
Matt: Yep. Except for you, who's in the air. Need to make a dexterity saving throw.
Taliesin: Nope, rerolling that.
Sam: Natural 20, 25.
Taliesin: I'm rerolling, because that was awful. Oh, never mind.
Sam: Yeah, if he doesn't like it, he gets to reroll.
Matt: It's a fighter ability.
Taliesin: Nine.
Laura: 30 for me.
Matt: Pike?
Laura: Eight for Pike.
Travis: 11.
Liam: Not like this.
Matt: Grog, Keyleth, Percy, Pike, Gilmore, all get knocked prone from the ground quaking as you all fall on your back. You manage to brace yourself against the wall real fast, Vex.
Sam: Does Jarett get knocked to his feet?
Matt: (laughs) No. He just gets shaken on the ground.
Marisha: Popcorn on a trampoline.
Matt: Raishan does not get her breath back. She is, however, going to utilize Chain Lightning.
Marisha: Yeah, I want to see how this works.
Laura: She's going to hit us. No, she decides where it hits.
Sam: She's still on our side, right?
Taliesin: For another round or two.
Matt: All right. Chain Lightning. Dexterity saving throw. That's a success for Thordak. Sorry, I'm trying to get through this. Okay, so that is halved. Halved, that is 18 points of lightning damage. Vax, make a dexterity saving throw.
Liam: I'm going to use Luck. Yeah. Good time to use Luck. 26.
Matt: 26, okay. You suffer 18 points of lightning damage as the bolt of energy that strikes Thordak then arcs into you because you're right next to it.
Liam: Would this be a new round for me to use Evasion? I've lost track.
Laura: No, 'cause Thordak's already gone.
Matt: No, you've already used it. So yeah. That ends that. Going to take off and land right there next to that guy.
Laura: Who is that guy?
Matt: That's the lizardman that fell from the wyvern. Keyleth, you're up.
Laura: Dragon just landed on him, basically.
Sam: I think he's got a shot.
Matt: Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: Oh boy. Okay. I'm going to stand up. Question. Is Thordak within 30 feet of fire giant dude?
Matt: No.
Marisha: Okay. That answers my question, then. I'm going to reach up and do Blight on Thordak, 'cause I think I can, this time.
Matt: What's the range on Blight?
Marisha: 30 feet.
Matt: Nope. Thordak is 50 feet in the air.
Marisha: Fucking shit fuck balls. Okay. Then--
Laura: Maybe you can jump and then cast it.
Matt: You could climb up and cast it, if you wanted to try that.
Marisha: No. I'm in a skirt situation. It's not good.
Sam: I'm not even paying attention, so if that's your concern.
Marisha: No, it's just clumsy. Okay, I'm going to do-- everything's not ideal right now!
Laura: Climb it, climb it, Keyleth! Just do it!
Liam: It's fucking end of the world!
Taliesin: They don't know.
Marisha: You don't know! I'm not good at that. I'm bad at that thing. So I'm not a dextrous person, so instead I'm going to use my Spire of Conflux.
Sam: Oh yeah, that Vestige thing!
Marisha: Look, I haven't forgotten about it, all right?
Travis: Who are you talking to right now?
Marisha: My ancestors. And I'm going to do Chain Lightning on Thordak.
Sam: Oh! Another chain.
Matt: All righty. Thordak's save is 19.
Marisha: Fail, motherfucker!
Matt: Thordak's going to use his second legendary resistance to make it. So go ahead and roll damage.
Marisha: Fine, that's fine. It's how many damage? Like 8d10?
Matt: 8d10.
Taliesin: Want some d10s?
Marisha: Yeah, I do.
Taliesin: Here's three more. How many are you at?
Marisha: I need one more. Oh, and I get to reroll ones, right? That's actually really--
Taliesin: Whoa! Holy fuck.
Sam: Is that a one?
Marisha: No, that's a seven. So that's 29, 34, plus-- that's a seven. And then 34 plus 14 is 48.
Matt: So half that is 24 points of lightning damage.
Marisha: And there's no one else within 30 feet of him, other than Raishan?
Matt: Raishan's not even in that range.
Marisha: No one else? Well. Okay. I do that, and then I turn around and I'm going to cast a Grasping Vine as a bonus action.
Taliesin: Oh, thank you.
Marisha: Right next to me. And then I'm going to use it to whip around and grab Percy and--
Matt: You do not have visual range on Percy right now.
Marisha: I haven't used any movement. Can I shift into that house a little bit?
Matt: Sure, you move into the house?
Marisha: Uh-huh. And once again cast Grasping Vine from out of that corner and drag Percy to me.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Around the ankles.
Matt: Still prone, but better.
Marisha: Hi.
Taliesin: Hi. That was really good. Ow.
Matt: That end your turn? All right. Jarett's turn. Jarett gets up. Jarett still only has a view of the dragon and is like, "What happened to-- that's weird." Missed the whole exchange. But gets the gist of it. Disadvantage. Misses. Natural 20, disadvantage. 15, still hits. Not a critical, unfortunately. But a ten on damage, that's 13 piercing damage.
Laura: It didn't drop fear when he died?
Matt: No, I think that would instill more fear.
Laura: Okay, just checking. (laughter)
Laura: Just checking.
Matt: Logistically.
Laura: I didn't know if it was a reset when you wake up.
Matt: Right. Gilmore gets up from the ground.
Taliesin: I'm so distracted right now. There's too much happening.
Matt: So he's going to cast another 4th-level Lightning Bolt. Thordak fails his save. Is going to use his last resistance to get that, 'cause he's doing real rough.
Laura: You've got big-level spells, don't you, still?
Sam: Yeah, one.
Matt: He's rolling shit tonight. 14 points of lightning damage. No, 16. Okay. All righty. That's Gilmore's turn. It's Grog and Thordak's turn.
Travis: Oh, yes? I would like to stand up.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: How high is Thordak?
Matt: Thordak is 40 feet up.
Travis: Son of a bitch on a stick. Could I just attach the bloodaxe and throw it at his much smaller foot, now?
Matt: Sure.
Travis: Yeah, but I can only jump 20 feet in the air. 15 feet in the air.
Liam: That'll do it, won't it?
Travis: He's 40 feet in the air.
Sam: You don't know numbers. Maybe it'll work.
Travis: These hieroglyphs seem to indicate that he's too high. Yeah, 'cause I'm only like 14 feet high, right?
Matt: Right now? Yeah.
Travis: I'm reckless throwing the bushwhacker.
Laura: (gasps) He got another natural 20!
Sam: Holy shit!
Matt: You have advantage. Roll again.
Travis: Ten.
Laura: That's a really pretty die that he's got, too. Sparkly.
Marisha: She's getting ideas.
Travis: (counting) 34, 37, 38. 38 points of damage.
Matt: 38 points of damage.
Taliesin: That with your bonus? I just said that randomly, I don't actually know any of your bonuses, I just thought maybe it would jog something.
Travis: With my movement, can I run nuts towards where the fire giant is?
Matt: Sure. You can get right there.
Travis: That'll work. I need a new plaything that'll actually stay.
Matt: Thordak, who is physically falling apart at this point, sections just sloughing off, and just the whole experience has been sending his physical-- his whole physical form is wrecked right now. The word escapes me that I was looking for. He's going to go ahead and turn and go into a full flight.
Liam: I'm riding him.
Matt: You're riding him?
Liam: Yeah. Shit yeah, I'm riding him.
Marisha: Oh, no. No, Vax, no.
Taliesin: Vax is good.
Laura: No!
Matt: Dash into the dark hole within.
Taliesin: This is good.
Laura: Why is this good?
Sam: A dark hole?
Laura: Vax, be careful!
Travis: We don't care about the tunnel, huh? (laughter)
Matt: You need to go ahead and roll a strength saving throw to try and maintain grip as the dragon goes into a full dive.
Liam: I'll use my last Luck. So it's a 15.
Matt: 15. You do manage to make it inside the tunnel, but you lose your grip and then go into a full tumble, hitting the ground. It's a decline, it's a 45-degree angle downward.
Liam: So I'm in there with him.
Matt: Yes. Roll an acrobatics check to stop yourself.
Liam: That is a 25.
Matt: 25, okay. So you do tumble and come to a stop. You don't take any damage from the fall, and you stop yourself from doing a tumble, but it is still a decline into darkness below, and you just watch as the back end of Thordak's barely flying form slams into the side of the tunnel and continues swooping away.
Liam: Do I still see him with darkvision at this point?
Matt: He just begins to leave outside of your darkvision.
Liam: Are we still in the same chain of initiative?
Matt: As of right now, we are, yes. So. Finishing, that is Thordak's go. Vex, you're up.
Laura: Okay. I run after him and dive after him, because I saw that. And at the edge of my movement, I want to hop out on my broom and get ready to fly down the hole after.
Matt: Okay. So you are hasted, so you get down and you basically have just enough movement to catch up to your brother. And you get the broom out. You're both down there in the darkness by yourselves. You guys watch as the rest of them dive into the hole. Vax, you're up.
Liam: How far away from me is he?
Matt: How far does your darkvision go for?
Liam: 60 feet.
Matt: He's outside of your darkvision.
Liam: Then I am going to use my movement and go 120 feet, or until I see him.
Laura: Can I cast-- 'cause I didn't do an attack, right?
Matt: This is happening after your turn. So you begin to dart forward?
Liam: This is just my movement. 120 feet or until I'm on him.
Matt: Well, your movement is not 120 feet. You're still flying through there?
Liam: Yes, I'm flying.
Matt: Right, so your wings are still out there. Okay. Okay. So yeah, you begin to come in, you see him just begin to come into your visual range.
Liam: Still away from me?
Matt: Still away from you.
Liam: Then I'm going to use a bonus action to dash and hit his back, and land on his back.
Matt: Okay. You land on his back.
Liam: Attack, attack. First attack is a-- scheisse. 24.
Matt: I would say you have disadvantage on these strikes, as you're currently gripping onto a flying dragon underneath a cavern ripping through. You have advantage on them automatically, which means you don't have disadvantage on these strikes, but you do not get the automatic sneak attack.
Liam: I don't remember-- oh, I don't get the automatic sneak attack?
Matt: No.
Liam: But I got advantage?
Matt: No. Essentially, you would have advantage, and then trying to grip onto him and through the middle of this tunnel and slamming into him, you would have disadvantage, and so they both cancel to just a regular attack.
Liam: All right, so 24 for the first.
Matt: What was the first one?
Liam: 24.
Matt: 24 hits.
Liam: Second one is a natural 20.
Matt: Second one was a natural 20? All right.
Liam: So the first one's the dragon-slaying. Three, eight, 14, 19, plus Hunter's Mark. So there's no sneak attack on this, right, you said?
Matt: Correct.
Liam: 21 with the dragon-slayer.
Matt: 21, nice.
Liam: And then Whisper, which is a natural 20, is one plus that is nine, plus the-- six is 15, plus Hunter's Mark. 17.
Laura: Times two?
Liam: Oh. 15 times two is 30.
Laura: It's all times two, 'cause that's all-- well, 15 times two is 30.
Liam: 30 plus eight. 38.
Matt: Okay. How do you want to do this? (yelling)
Laura: In the dark. Alone.
Sam: In a dark pit.
Liam: With Whisper, I'm going to shove it in so that my hand disappears from view, so I'm up to my forearm, and stab as far in as I can reach. I hear the voice of my mother in the morning. Fuck you.
Matt: As the blade plunges into Thordak's now-sloughing and soft flesh, exposed through a series of wounds and gashes left behind by your allies, and his form just slowly shriveling into its diminutive space, the dagger cuts cleanly through, and with that force you go all the way up to the shoulder as you reach inside. As you finish saying your phrase, your eyes narrow and you clench your teeth, and as you pull back and yank, there's this strange series of low whispers that come into your ears, and as you pull back, you watch as these bits of greyish energy begin to pour out of the air, coalescing around the blade, fitting into the body where you're currently plunged within. As you yank outward, you watch as the blade almost has an extended edge about ten, 15 feet beyond Whisper's actual-- and this blade edge just leaves a giant wound on the side of Thordak's body. You don't even hear an exclamation of pain as Thordak just slowly slams into the ground of this low, barely glowing tunnel. Roll an acrobatics check with disadvantage.
Liam: 25.
Matt: 25.
Sam: Jesus.
Matt: So with the speed and impact of tumbling, you manage to reduce the damage by half, so you--
Liam: Which is also halved by the potion.
Matt: Right. That is 17 points of bludgeoning damage.
Liam: Is that the quarter?
Matt: No, that's halved. So that would bring it to 8. As you watch Thordak's form sputter, roll, and then tumble, grinding to a halt, gathering a bunch of stone, broken rock, and part of the cavern that's on the verge of collapsing from the impact of Thordak's body, now lifeless, still in the darkness, subterranean tunnel. And we're going to take a break. (yelling)
Travis: We don't even know it's happened, though, yet! It's all underground!
Taliesin: She would know.
Laura: I do know. Can I fly forward before we take the break?
Matt: You want to?
Laura: I just want to fly forward and hug my brother as he's just covered in dragon guts.
Taliesin: He's way down in there. That's a long flight.
Matt: And now we'll take a break. So we'll be back here in a few minutes.
Sam: Don't forget, Backblaze is hosting a Critical Role giveaway. Anyone who signs up for a free trial with Backblaze at backblaze.com/criticalrole through January 8th will be eligible to win items signed by the Critical Role team that killed a dragon.
Matt: Check out the video here during the break, and we'll be back in a few minutes, guys. [break]
Matt: Welcome back, everybody. First and foremost, we have our winner in the chat for the Wyrmwood dice tray. It is DetectiveKane! (cheering)
Matt: You'll receive this awesome dice tray signed by us. Half of us at the break, and the other half will sign before the night is out. But it's coming your way real soon. Congratulations, DetectiveKane! Get this out of my fucking face!
Laura: Nobody's there.
Matt: Somebody take it from me!
Sam: I don't even know that guy!
Taliesin: I think I see half a dozen people on their phones behind us.
Matt: It feels so good to be able to do that, but it feels better when it's immediate. Otherwise, it feels, like, kinda good. All right, so. Picking up where we left off. The rest of you watch as Thordak swooped into the hole that he emerged from, quickly followed by Vex and Vax. There is still on the field-- Raishan just tore into this lizard man. We have a fire giant that is unscathed currently, bearing down on the rest of the party, and a wyvern rider back around this wall section here. That being the case, they end that turn there. First up is Lady Kima. Who is pissed that she hasn't had a chance to really do anything tonight against flying dragons.
Travis: There's a big fire giant.
Matt: That's what she's going to do. Paladins that don't fly and have haste have a hard time getting around. Just so you know.
Laura: Vestige!
Matt: Watching this giant whale upon Percy pisses her off, and she cracks her neck. "You're first." And she leaps down.
Travis: Open him up!
Matt: And she's going to multi-attack against him. That is-- that hits. And the other also hits. Even with a minus five on each for her Great Weapon Master. She's also going to Divine Smite on that at a level three.
Travis: Yeah, get it!
Matt: First strike is a 14, plus ten, 24. Plus 11, 35. 42 points of damage on her first strike against the giant.
Travis: Boom!
Matt: And the second strike is 24 points of damage. So that fire giant's already had a big chunk taken out of its-- Kima rushes up and double strikes with her Holy Avenger, one cleaving off a piece of its armor, the second one cuts through, leaving a giant flash of divine energy as it bursts out the side. She looks up in the eyes and says, "Bahamut says hi." That ends Kima's turn. Pike is up now.
Sam: Oh, how's Pike doing?
Laura: Pike-- oh, Pike's turn! Jesus.
Liam: She's doing great.
Travis: Head out of ass.
Laura: I'm sorry! Okay.
Liam: She's in Manhattan.
Laura: She stands up.
Matt: Technically-- I was going to say, the giant was going on Thordak's turn order. So I technically skipped the giant's turn. That's fine. I'll do the giant's turn now.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: The giant, who has watched Percy get pulled away, steps in to get into melee range with both Kima and Grog.
Travis: That's such a mistake.
Matt: And is going to take a strike on each. Takes an attack on Kima and rolls-- that's a 20, that hits. And then roll Grog-- that is a 29.
Travis: That hits.
Matt: That's 28 points of damage to Kima and-- it's fun to roll against the players. 33 points of slashing damage against you, Grog.
Travis: So halved to, math?
Matt: 16.
Travis: Thank you. I will use my Retaliation. The old chin turned back. Reckless. Great Weapon Master. That's better. 21.
Matt: 21. That hits.
Travis: Nice. 21, that was crap. And 22. Both ones. 22 plus ten is 32.
Matt: 32 points of damage, nice. The giant already in that round of attacks and your retaliation is-- it has its giant greatsword on the ground, it's rearing up for its next round of arcing attacks. That brings us to Pike. What's Pike doing now?
Laura: Okay, Pike stands up. She's going to run forward and say, "You can't have all the fun, Grog!" And she's going to Guiding Bolt, level four, at the fire giant.
Matt: All right, go ahead and roll a melee spell attack.
Laura: Okay, okay. Okay, that's 18.
Matt: 18 just hits.
Laura: Okay. Oh, wait. 17.
Matt: Nope.
Liam: 17 sounds like 18.
Matt: It does, but it's not the same. The giant sees the flash of light as the bolt comes towards it, out the corner of its eye. As it has its blade down, it instead ducks underneath, using Grog for cover briefly as it arcs past its shoulder and shoots off through the cloud, out of sight.
Marisha: What if it was 17.99? That's basically like 18.
Matt: It's not.
Liam: Crazy Eddie prices?
Travis: Taco Bell logic right there.
Laura: She says, "So, sorry! I guess you do have all the fun. How are you on hit points, Grog? You okay?"
Travis: Yep.
Laura: Okay, then she's going to Healing Word herself at first level.
Matt: Okay. d4 plus five.
Laura: Okay, that's six points.
Matt: There you go. Six points to Pike. Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: We're fighting this fucking giant thing?
Liam: Yeah, man.
Sam: Jesus. I'm going to move out from my hidey hole. Oh god, there's a giant there. I think my Bigby's is still on the field, yeah. So I'll Bigby's Punch. Bigby Punch!
Matt: Yeah, Bigby could just get into range melee there for it.
Sam: A 24?
Matt: That hits. Go ahead and roll your 6d8.
Sam: 6d8, oh man. I only have one d8. I'll roll it six times.
Marisha: Do you want some d8s?
Sam: I'll roll it six times.
Marisha: No, that's-- oh, he's already committed.
Travis: Mad d8's. Oh, he's stroking out.
Marisha: Should we do what he does to us? 15!
Sam: That was four.
Travis: Flirted with the edge.
Laura: 15. 15.
Taliesin: 23.
Marisha: 15.
Sam: You fuckers!
Taliesin: This doesn't feel good on the other end, does it?
Sam: Oh, shit, that was a lot! It's either 33 or 34, they fucked me up. But it was a lot! It was mostly sevens and eights!
Matt: We'll go with 34 on that. Cool. So, as the giant ducks out of the way of the Guiding Bolt streaking past, it snickers and grins, says something in Giant which you hear, which is--
Travis: (gasps)
Matt: You didn't even hear what he said yet!
Travis: Oh. I will hold my reaction.
Matt: "Insolents, bow to your king!"
Travis: No.
Matt: And then, as it brings the sword up, while it saw the glimmer of the Guiding Bolt, it didn't see the purple glimmer of the shining fist as it comes up and whack right across the jaw, dislocating it briefly as the fist comes back up and is ready for another round. Still standing, but looking pretty rough. That brings us to--
Sam: That was my bonus action. As my action, I will swig a Greater Healing Potion.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: What is that, four?
Matt: Greater Healing Potion is 4d4 plus four, yeah.
Taliesin: Oh, 4d4 plus six!
Sam: Yeah, the potion doesn't do that for me, does it? Plus four? Four, three, two, one is ten, right?
Matt: Yes. So 14 hit points you heal.
Laura: When you were healing Pike with the superior, did you add--
Sam: You're right, it's two less than I thought.
Laura: Oh, okay. So she's at 40 healed points now, not 42.
Sam: I get a plus six when I cast it, because of my awesomeness.
Matt: Correct.
Sam: But not when I use a potion.
Matt: Correct.
Sam: Got it.
Matt: All righty. Scanlan, that finish your turn?
Sam: Yeah, I think I'm done.
Matt: Percival.
Taliesin: I'm going to put Bad News away, pull out Animus and take three shots at this asshole.
Matt: Okay. So are you getting up?
Taliesin: I'm getting up. Pulling out the gun, putting three sharpshooter shots in this guy.
Matt: Go for it.
Taliesin: That's a 26. That hits. I'm going to roll that one until he drops, so that I can-- 1d8 plus 1d6. 1d10 plus 1d6. That's 18, 19, 20, 21. 21 points of damage plus four points of psychic damage, so 25 points of damage.
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: Second shot. That's 21 to hit.
Matt: Hits.
Sam: Right? Plus three plus two plus one...
Taliesin: That's... Not right now, you bastard! I hate you! That's 27 plus... 27 points of damage plus one point of psychic damage to me because I can't think!
Marisha: He needs horse blinders! Horse blinders!
Taliesin: So 27 points of damage plus one... I'm so sorry.
Sam: What goes around comes around!
Matt: So as the fist clocks him across the face, dislocating the jaw, it stands up and grabs the jaw and snaps it back into place. Looks up just in time for you to come up out of the shadow and (gunshots), turning the barrels, you fire, and the first shot hits in the side of the throat and blows open the neck. And you see as the blood begins to gout out, reaches up with a hand and it (gasps) but it's to no use as the other shot takes out the right eye, blowing out the back of the giant's head as it falls backward.
Sam: Violence, violence! Who would've thought a fire giant would be so easy?
Taliesin: I am now going to start making my way to the-- I'm going to start running my way to the pit. With what little movement I have because I got up.
Matt: Okay. All right, that ends Percy's turn. Top of the round, the lair actions do not function. However, you watch as the skyship Deera, still rotating around, there's still wyverns attacking. You hear the distant sounds of lightning cracks as well. And you hear very, very distantly what sounds like a-- sorry, internet-- a cacophony of voices. Because there's no other word to describe it. Hundreds and hundreds of voices, all shouting combat war cries simultaneously. You have no idea how far away it is, it's very, very faint, you just pick it up. You hear the sound of impacts, of crumbling stone in the distance. There is a battle happening all throughout the city that is slowly making its way towards your current location. Deera's turned around and is going to take two shots at Raishan, because it's going to fire at whatever dragons are there. Damon was not notified of anything otherwise.
Laura: You know what, if Raishan gets hit, she gets hit.
Matt: Rolled an eight, and an eight. No, it does not hit. Oh, she gets three attacks, because the--
Travis: What?
Matt: Three eights in a row. That's ridiculous. Yeah! That's not a three, that's an eight. Absurd. So yeah, (boom, boom, boom) all on the ground, and Raishan spins in place (growls), "Call off your dogs! We still have a deal!"
Travis: We literally have no power over them.
Taliesin: I'll respond. To the pit! Now!
Matt: Which, Raishan at this point is now leaping (whoosh) and disappears into the portal-- or down into the hole in the ground.
Taliesin: She was already going that way, she doesn't get into shit with that.
Laura: I want her to get hit.
Taliesin: She's not going to get-- She's going in the tunnel.
Matt: All right. At this point, full speed, that is-- 60 feet, yeah. You guys, as you're having this moment hugging each other--
Laura: Hugs!
Matt: You hear (wings flapping) (smash) The ground shakes nearby as you turn and see, you watch as Raishan skids to a halt right next to you and the currently smashed corpse of Thordak within the tunnel.
Marisha: Can I say over like a headpiece thing-- Be like, twins, if you're still alive, I think Raishan's coming in your direction.
Liam: Thanks for that.
Matt: Raishan is watching both of you as she begins to walk towards Thordak's corpse and goes, "You've done well."
Liam: Yeah, what now?
Taliesin: Every six seconds, we get to move.
Marisha: Yeah, we're heading ass-- Hauling ass that way!
Taliesin: Booking with my spider walk.
Laura: I'm heading ass-wherever!
Taliesin: Running down the ceiling upside-down.
Travis: Not me, I'm putting out that last fire on the map.
Laura: Stomp, stomp, stomp!
Sam: He's volunteer fire department, yeah.
Matt: 80 foot flying, this wyvern swoops in.
Sam: Ah, there's a fucking wyvern?
Liam: Keyleth.
Matt: The one that was left earlier, that was after you, is going to swoop in and attempt to make two strikes at Kima. Miss. And a three. Miss. And the rider's going to go ahead and make two strikes at her as well. Miss with a 17. And a two! Kima's like deflecting, getting against the wall as the spear shoots by and as the blade comes down from the rider, she strikes it with the sword and stops it mid-air, and she starts laughing in his face. That ends its go.
Travis: Trinity.
Matt: Keyleth, you're up.
Sam: Keyleth! There's a wyvern on the field. Or you can ignore and go into the hole.
Marisha: Fuck that wyvern. I say, everyone in the hole! And I head towards the hole.
Taliesin: We're going to need light down here.
Sam: (singing) Head to the hole!
Matt: Are you doing a double move?
Marisha: (singing) Black as your soul! What?
Matt: Double move? Are you doing a dash action?
Sam: You've got nothing else to do.
Marisha: Yeah, I'll dash.
Matt: Okay. So you begin to make it into the hole. That brings us to Jarett's turn. Jarett is going to turn the corner, he's like, "So it's gone? Okay, good." Loads the crossbow, sees the wyvern, and goes, "Are you-- no, are you-- seriously?" and takes his shots. Nice, 19. Yeah, two shots against the wyvern.
Laura: Nice. This is his level, this is what Jarett needs at a time.
Liam: This is the Jarett we know.
Matt: 14 points of damage. He's not the heroic individual you guys are necessarily.
Marisha: Look, he's a great security guard.
Laura: He is bad-ass.
Matt: He is, in his own field.
Liam: He caught my sister's attention, anyone that does that has got to have a lot of spunk.
Matt: All righty. So that ends his turn there, those two shots. Both sink into the wyvern, both bolt stuns (snarling). That will end his go. Gilmore, recognizing the circumstance here and everyone's rushing in there, he's going to go ahead and... okay, he'll go, "Actually, me first." And he Dimension Doors to the edge, and begins to charge in after you guys. That brings us to Grog.
Travis: I want to kill all the things that are alive.
Matt: Okay. So you move into melee with the wyvern and the rider.
Travis: Yeah. Great Weapon Master, Reckless. Eight, 15, 19.
Matt: Hits.
Marisha: Kill it real hard.
Travis: 16. 22. Ooh! 26. 36. For the first hit.
Matt: We'll say for the sake of brevity, you're going to wipe out the wyvern.
Travis: Yay!
Matt: Because you're giant Grog.
Travis: Is the lizard man left?
Matt: The lizard man is left, yes.
Travis: Can I give him the option to run?
Matt: If you want to.
Travis: Nah, fuck that. I kill him, too.
Matt: Well, all three of your attacks would be what it would take to take out the wyvern.
Travis: Hey! Oh, cool.
Matt: So as you finish cleaving the wyvern down, it falls over and the lizard man's like (snarls).
Travis: Yeah, I do this.
Matt: (reptilian whimper) It looks conflicted.
Travis: You're at a crossroads, bro. Crossroads.
Matt: Vex. It's your go.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: You have Raishan like (booming footsteps) stepping over to Thordak's body, watching you closely.
Laura: What are you doing?
Matt: "Exactly what we talked about. Learning his secret."
Laura: I'm going to keep my hand ready to attack and hold my action until anything gets aggressive with Raishan.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: What do you see down there? What's happening, what's in the room?
Laura: Thordak is dead.
Taliesin: What's in the room?
Laura: Oh, what do I see around me?
Matt: The tunnel that you're in, it's been a steady decline. It's rounded off a little bit and it begins to open up maybe 70 feet ahead of you. Actually, with your darkvision, you would just barely start to see it begin to open, it looks like there's an actual chamber ahead of all of you guys, but you haven't reached it yet.
Travis: The shitter.
Laura: Okay, I'm going to use my movement to back away from Raishan towards the chamber. But I'm going to hold my attack until I think it's aggressive.
Matt: Okay. So as you move in, you can see there's a very, very faint glow of orange and red in the room, and the whole tunnel here has a very, very, very concentrated natural burning chemical smell to it. A lot of sulfur-type, very putrid, pungent smells. And the glow you can now see, there is a lava flow that is coalescing in the center of this room, or at least is pouring through, and it looks like it's bisecting this room. You don't make out much more detail than that at this distance, but you do see this chamber does have an actual flow of liquid rock.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: Vax.
Liam: Keyleth? You tell me.
Marisha: What's going on? Whatcha doing?
Liam: You tell me.
Marisha: Just describe the scene.
Liam: Hit or wait?
Marisha: Wait till I'm there! Wait till I'm there!
Liam: What?
Marisha: Wait till I'm there!
Liam: I'm going to hold my turn until Keyleth acts.
Matt: Okay. Pike, Scanlan, you guys all follow suit?
Sam: Yeah.
Matt: Okay, at a full run you guys can get, at your tiny feet you can get up towards the edge there.
Taliesin: I'm at a full run on the roof.
Matt: Right, Percival. Yeah, you do, you get up there and inside. Raishan comes up to the body of Thordak and you see that she reaches up under one of her scales and pulls out a small leather case.
Travis: Oh shit.
Matt: Pops open the case.
Marisha: Don't let her touch him.
Matt: And sits back and pulls open a somewhat weathered scroll. And starts reading off of it. (magical language)
Laura: Oh, no, what is this?
Marisha: No no no! Don't go, don't go--
Liam: Attack. I'm attacking her. She acted, she said don't touch, I said I'll base it off of Keyleth, so I'm attacking. I'm going to interrupt that.
Travis: Don't you want to see what happens?
Liam: No.
Matt: Okay. Hold on. You say attack based on-- Because you don't see this yet.
Marisha: I said don't let her touch him.
Travis: She's reading that scroll, man.
Matt: She hasn't touched him yet. But you're attacking on your own instinct.
Liam: If I've heard don't let her touch him, and she's doing that, those two things mean the same thing to me. She's doing something. Yes.
Matt: All right. I will say, for this, go ahead and make a dexterity check.
Liam: Dexterity check? All right. And I'll use my last Luck of the day.
Sam: I thought you did that already.
Liam: I had two. So that's a 28.
Matt: 28, okay. So you can make your attack. This with the dagger?
Liam: This is everything. How far away is she from me?
Matt: She's maybe like 20 feet, so you can--
Liam: All three attacks.
Matt: Well, you held your action, which means you can only take your action, you can't move as well.
Liam: Okay. Move? I don't need to move. How far away is she, you said--
Matt: 20 feet.
Liam: 20 feet. So I can throw daggers at her, right?
Laura: Yeah, but you can't throw your sword
Liam: No, but I have lots of daggers. I still have the Flametongue Dagger, which is not attuned, it's just a lame old dagger.
Matt: That's true, you can do that, yeah. So yeah, you can do that.
Taliesin: Oh boy.
Liam: First one is a 23.
Matt: A 23?
Liam: Second one is a 19. Third one is a 29.
Matt: Okay. So it was-- 29 hits. The first one...
Liam: God. I don't remember.
Laura: A 23.
Liam: 23 sounds familiar.
Matt: Right. The 19 was the one that didn't hit.
Liam: So two of the three hit? So it was hit-miss-hit, right? I think so. All right, so the first one is Whisper. Four plus eight is 12, plus psychic damage is 15, but there's no sneak attack, because there's nobody near her, and the Hunter's Mark-- Oh! Can I move Hunter's Mark to her at this point? I have no idea.
Matt: No, because you've used all your attacks.
Liam: It's a bonus? Okay. Got it. Okay. So 15 for the first and the second one. Oh, I don't need that. Is nine.
Matt: Okay, so what was the first attack? It was--
Liam: 15 plus nine.
Matt: 15? 15 plus nine. So the first attack was 15. Okay, maintains concentration. Maintains concentration.
Liam: And I'll use my movement to move between my sister and Raishan.
Laura: You can't do movement, because you were holding your action.
Liam: Okay.
Matt: Okay. So as both daggers come, you watch as it's muttering from the scroll, not both of her eyes, but one of the eyes turns to face you.
Laura: Like a chameleon.
Matt: Yeah. And narrows. The scroll finishes and (poof) turns to ash. And similar to something you've seen before, you watch as Thordak's corpse, which is currently buried into the rock with the face to the side, the breath filters into the mouth. The body still motionless, you recognize this similar or adjacent magic to the Speak With Dead--
Liam: We've seen Pike do it.
Matt: Yes.
Sam: She's just trying to ask a question, Vax. I mean, Jesus.
Liam: You're not here.
Matt: So as soon as that finishes, Raishan-- the other eye flickers over. Now both eyes are on you. And says, "Know what you're doing."
Liam: You're not walking away from this field. You're going to die. Maybe I will too, but you are going to die.
Matt: (chuckles) Okay.
Sam: We're men of our word. We're men of honor.
Matt: Raishan is going to...
Laura: She did attack our home.
Sam: I'm not saying she's great.
Matt: Hmm. Let me check one thing real fast.
Sam: Hmm. Oh boy. You stumped the chump.
Matt: Well, I'm trying to see what her reaction's going to be. Oh, okay. She feels comfortable with that. She goes, "Well, then. Come claim me!" And just steps away from Thordak. And with one big push of the wings, turns around and coasts into the chamber beyond you.
Liam: Out of sight?
Matt: Beyond, you can see her form disappear into the darkness. There's a little bit of an orange glow in there, but given that circumstance, yeah, she disappears into the shadows of the room.
Laura: Should I have taken my shots when things got aggressive?
Marisha: So she's coming towards us.
Matt: No, she's going the opposite direction.
Laura: I mean, did that look aggressive?
Matt: She flew away from your brother. But your brother did throw three daggers into her, and then said she was going to die.
Travis: Did she ask her questions of Thordak?
Laura: It might not have been the same fucking spell. It could have been something like it.
Travis: He said it looked very similar.
Laura: Yeah, adjacent.
Liam: I'm sure she was just going to ask about cooking recipes. It's fine.
Matt: So what are you going to do, attack or not? You watched your brother throw three daggers into Raishan, and tell her that she's going to die, and then Raishan basically abandoned Thordak's body and fled.
Laura: Said, "Come and claim me," and flew toward me?
Matt: Flew over you, and past, into the chamber.
Laura: Yeah, I'm going to attack.
Matt: Go for it. Roll your attacks!
Laura: Oh no.
Travis: Do it, Tiny Toon!
Liam: Go for it.
Sam: You got this, Bailes.
Marisha: I mean, she kind of released Thordak. She's totally Little Finger.
Laura: This isn't about vengeance, though, you guys.
Sam: What is it about?
Matt: Roll your attacks.
Liam: Five, four, three, two...
Laura: I don't know. (sad noise) That one doesn't hit. Probably. 18.
Matt: Nope.
Laura: That one probably hits. 27?
Matt: Yeah. (laughter)
Sam: Saddest attack ever.
Laura: And a natural fucking one. Fenthras can sense my trepidation.
Matt: Hah, apparently! So roll damage on one arrow strike. And it is, your hand's shaking at this moment, you're trying to figure out what to do. When she flies overhead, you release one arrow, pull back and pull another, and the second one is right as she's over and above, sinks in. And the third one, you fire after, and it hits the rock ceiling.
Laura: Just 15 damage.
Matt: 15 points of damage. All righty. Raishan just swoops into the darkness of the chamber beyond. Keyleth. You just manage to catch up at this point now, at a full run, this will be your full turn, catching up to Vex and Vax. Or Vax specifically, Vex is a little beyond, aggressive stance, Raishan nowhere to be seen, Thordak's corpse ground into the dirt.
Marisha: Where is she?
Liam: Forward.
Marisha: Are we going after her? I mean--
Taliesin: I'm not there.
Liam: Yes.
Marisha: I run deeper into the hole.
Matt: Okay. Jarett and Gilmore, at this point, manage to catch up to you guys, as well. It'll take a while for Grog and Kima to catch up to you guys.
Travis: Oh, I didn't say I was leaving.
Sam: Looting the giant's body?
Travis: No, there's a lizardfolk right there.
Matt: It's true, actually, yeah.
Travis: I want to see how many licks it takes to get to the center of a Tootsie Roll Pop.
Sam: One. It takes one lick.
Matt: Well, Grog, it's staring at you, going like (growl).
Travis: I reach out and go like (head crushing sound).
Matt: Make a strength check.
Travis: I have advantage on those. (laughter)
Travis: 18. 18 plus seven. 25.
Matt: 25? There's this moment where you're grabbing its head, and it reaches up and (frantic snarl).
Travis: Can't hear you, can't hear you. (laughter)
Matt: A very Riki-oh type moment. The head just pops outward in a smear of purple gore.
Travis: Oh, no. That's the show, folks. All right. Well. Anybody see that? Who's here?
Sam: My hand is near you.
Travis: Kima's there, right?
Matt: (chuckles) Bigby's Hand claps the wall, applause. (laughter)
Travis: Ha, fuck Bigby's Hand.
Matt: You look over at Kima, and Kima's kind of spattered with it, and she goes, "Well done!"
Travis: Smooth, right? Let's join everybody else.
Matt: "All right, all right." You're going your movement, about there, full speed. Kima's a little slower behind. She'll catch up at a full double-dash speed, there. Jarett and everybody else has kind of moved in. We'll say at this point, the rest of you--
Laura: (laughs) Jarett is just like--
Matt: He can't do anything, he's having a bad day, man.
Marisha: Poor Jarett.
Matt: So you guys all charge in after?
Taliesin: I'm doing the best I can, I can't see a damn thing.
Matt: No, you guys are far behind. So it's currently you three in the lead.
Travis: Should anybody stay out here in case she wants to come back out? You want me to stay out?
Matt: Do you want to move Bigby's Hand?
Sam: Yeah, for the rest of the one minute it works for. Which is not very long?
Matt: Nah.
Taliesin: If she makes her way out, that means we're all dead. Come on in. It'll be fun. Let's all die together.
Marisha: We'll go to the spa afterwards.
Matt: So you guys kind of rush into this chamber now, and the heat in here is more immense than anything you felt on the surface. This is kind of the core of the volcanic surge that Thordak's presence was pulling upward. You see within, there's this flow of lava. I want the three of you to roll perception checks, if you can.
Sam: Who's the three, Vax, Vex, and--
Liam: 31. 31.
Laura: This is at advantage because it's a dragon-related thing?
Matt: Well, are you looking for Raishan, or are you inspecting the room for details?
Laura: I don't know, what am I rolling for?
Matt: I was rolling to see just the general vicinity of the room.
Laura: Okay, 27.
Liam: 31.
Marisha: 25.
Matt: You guys, the first thing you notice as you glance around, is there are some kind of alcoves inside this chamber where the rock formations pull inward. You see kind of set into the stone and various bits of fallen rock and earth, a handful, somewhat spread out throughout the room, a handful of large nine-foot-tall dark, deep crimson red with crystalline elements to the outside, ovoid structures. These are what appear to be larger than normal, elementally altered dragon eggs. Five of them in the chamber.
Laura: Five bebes?!
Sam: (singing) Muppet Babies...
Laura: Can I look back at Thordak? What does it look like-- I know Raishan, like, (gasps) made him do that. Does it look like there's anything around him, or is he just dead-dead still?
Matt: He's a ways back. If you want to try and move back to him, you can. But, with your high perception, you glance up and see in the ceiling portion of this chamber where there are a number of these small caverns that are pressed up to the side, you see out of the top just the slight peeking of Raishan's face, kind of looking down into the chamber above you. And you watch as the teeth, something muttering in the mouth, the teeth grin as the ceiling of the room, you watch distortion in the air above you. Almost like these small portals kind of (multiple fwooshes) open, and coming flying out of them, you see four large, flaming rocks. Rocks. These are massive, fiery, meteorite-like boulders, that come firing out of the ceiling of the room (crashing sounds). Slamming into the ground around you, exploding in a massive explosions, rocking you. All you see is white, and ringing in your ears as your bodies are thrown from explosion to explosion. I need the three of you to make dexterity saving throws.
Liam: 25.
Marisha: I rolled a natural 19, so 22.
Laura: 29.
Sam: Wow, guys! That's really good rolling!
Matt: You guys take half damage. Well, here, let's do the first part. So, there's the fire damage. Which is 20d6.
Liam: What did we have to beat?
Matt: You had to beat 22.
Liam: Zero.
Matt: Right, so you take zero damage from this. Both of you take 63 points of fire damage. Halved, to 31. And then you each take 70 points of bludgeoning damage.
Marisha: 70?
Travis: That's 130-something total points.
Matt: As these flaming arcane meteors crash into the ground, detonating and destroying a portion of the cavern floor, lava spatters everywhere, and you watch as you duck out of the way as, Keyleth, what are your hit points at?
Marisha: I'm actually still up at-- What's 101 minus 119? 18 points.
Matt: 18 points. Set your hit points to that. You watch as your sister is thrown, her body unconscious, flung in the air like a ragdoll as it scatters to one end of the cavern. You can see the volcanic activity billowing up from the recent shaking of the room, as bits of the molten rock are flung across, as the green dragon face kind of withdraws in the cave. And I think that's where we're going to pick up next year. (yelling)
Matt: It's 11 22, guys! We gotta get home!
Sam: Next year?! We have to wait a year?!
Laura: I have to find out if I'm for sure dead.
Liam: I got you, I got you.
Laura: I'm across the fucking room.
Liam: Doesn't matter, I can fly 500 feet, I got you.
Taliesin: You're going to get the conclusion of this before the next season of Westworld.
Liam: Lay on Hands, dude.
Sam: No, she's dead.
Liam: No, shut up. I will kill you in the parking lot.
Matt: We will pick this up in January.
Travis: What was that called, those four flaming rocks?
Matt: That's called Meteor Swarm. That's a 9th-level spell.
Travis: Is that a spell? What level is that?
All: 9th-level.
Liam: She just blew her wad, she's done, we got a dragon and a flute.
Laura: She's not done.
Matt: You're right. She has nothing else up her sleeve. So. On that note.
Sam: Matt Mercer.
Matt: This could possibly be a whole different encounter, I don't want to keep you guys here until 1 AM. I know Laura has to record in the morning.
Laura: I do, I have to film all day.
Sam: I have an 8 AM session.
Matt: Well. Guys. This will be interesting. (groaning)
Matt: Yeah, it's going to take a few rounds for the rest of the party to get here.
Travis: She didn't get to ask any of the questions?
Laura: She might not have even needed to ask questions.
Sam: Of course she did, she cast a big spell to do it!
Marisha: Yeah, maybe she was doing it telepathically.
Sam: What are you talking about? She read a scroll!
Laura: Maybe it was just taking his soul into herself.
Sam: Information!
Matt: Regardless. (laugh) We are out for the evening, thank you all for sticking with us for this longer episode.
Liam: We should have just let her do what she wants, summon the most powerful thing in the universe.
Travis: I like that idea.
Marisha: Team Rowdy Half-Elves, what's up!
Matt: Yeah, the half-elves are down here in this chamber, with the Thordak eggs.
Marisha: Half-elves, running in, recklessly, yeah! Like we do!
Taliesin: I've got nothin'. Yeah.
Matt: (laughs) Anyway, guys. Thank you so much for watching, thank you guys for kicking ass in that battle.
Travis: Talks Machina next week?
Matt: Talks Machina on Tuesday. It's the Critmas episode, check it out.
Laura: Check out Backblaze.
Matt: Indeed, indeed. And I guess have a wonderful New Year to all of you guys, very happy holidays to everyone. All viewers, Critters, Team Hooman, and everyone who decides to spend their Thursdays with us. We really appreciate it. Love you very much, and we'll see you in the new year. Is it 2017 yet? [music]
