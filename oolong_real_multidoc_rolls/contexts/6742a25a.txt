[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello everyone and welcome to this evening's episode of Critical Role. Before we kick things off we're going to do the videos in just a moment to intro as we're waiting for a member to arrive. But before we get started tonight we have a couple special giveaways getting all the subscriber counts we can get. First off if we hit 3500 subscribers tonight we're going to be giving away a player's handbook signed by the cast of Critical Role, a dicebox, and one of these fantastically reconstructed horns of Orcus torn recently from forehead of the mad beholder K'varn. We actually have two of these available tonight as part of the giveaways. The first one will be at 3500 the next one at 3550 with the same package: The player's handbook signed by everybody the dice box and one of these horn props which were made for us by the incredible KommissarProps. This is Kai Norman. Kai, want to come in and say hello to everyone?
Kai: Yeah!
Matt: Show off your good work here.
Kai: Thank you.
Matt: Show off your good work here.
Kai: Hey guys!
Kai: I guess I should show you a little bit about how they're built. They're resin. They're cast resin so they've got a little bit of rigid foam in the back so they've got this nice kind of bone marrow look and they're all hand painted by me and hopefully you guys will --
Marisha: He's super awesome.
Matt: It's a good start.
Marisha: You should totally go follow him at KommissarProps. It's kind of hard so I printed this out for you guys. Follow him on Instagram and on Facebook. That's where you see the most about this guy. And go check it out. It's good for the giveaway.
Matt: He's a talented guy. He's providing these for us for the giveaway tonight totally on his own and he's also going to be helping us with future possible prop stuff for the game as it progresses.
Marisha: You definitely want to go follow him. I actually tweeted a picture from your Instagram account, so for those of you who are following me, there's a direct link to his Instagram account. Or just search this on Facebook or Instagram.
Matt: Indeed.
Marisha: Do it. Do it now.
Matt: So we have those at 3500 and 3550. If we get to 3600 tonight, you'll get the t-shirt signed, a dice box, a starter kit and we'll stay after and play some more Just Dance. (cheers)
Matt: Yeah! Great!
Matt: Also want to give a big shoutout to -- we might have a bunch of new folks from imgur today -- someone put up a really cool post about us on imgur and a lot of people saw it, so those who came through that, hello, welcome, you're gonna sit in and watch a bunch of us silly folk play Dungeons & Dragons, so it should be fun hopefully. Welcome. In the meantime we'll go ahead and roll the videos, we'll get some history on some of the characters and we'll be back here in a few minutes.
Marisha: We'll be back. Go follow. And then we'll pull winners.
Travis: Right, Listen up! If you have ale, then you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw! A goliath of towering height and size, this barbarian has an appetite for the two great loves in his life: combat, women, and ale! (record scratch) Wait. Easily the brains of the group, Grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes, colors, and shiny things! ...also ale. In his early years, armed with his two handed great axe, Grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst (brawling sounds) Grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst the ranks of his family's wandering herd. (brawling sounds) the ranks of his family's wandering herd. But after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly gnome in the woods, he objected to the killing such an innocent life. A creature of impulse, Grog felt only pity for this... well, this terrified little thing. And his disobedience cost him dearly. (weapon crack) Beaten bloody, and banished by the herd leader, Beaten bloody, and banished by the herd leader, his uncle Kevdak, Grog was abandoned and left to die. Exiled from his herd, it was then that the relative of the very gnome he fought to save, saved him. It was the kindness of a gnome cleric named Pike, that healed Grog, bringing him back from death's edge. And they have remained close friends ever since. Most nights, Grog can be found challenging entire taverns to wrestling matches! Ha! ...or accompanying Scanlan to the nearest house, where you pay for... lady favors. Also ale!
Marisha: A first Impression of Keyleth would leave you with little information on the half-elven druid. You might even think that her social awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is kind of sweet. (chuckle) Of course, it would be unwise to underestimate her based on first impressions. (thunder crack) based on first impressions. Under that unintimidating petite frame is a vicious beast waiting to be unleashed, whose natural powers have made even the fiercest of champions pee their pants, literally! (soft chuckle) Born to the Air Tribe of the Ashari people, Keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and the elemental magics. It is her people’s inherent duty to protect the delicate areas in Tal'Dorei where the four elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm. Since she was a little girl, she had quite a knack for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities. Well, if you consider kittens and flying squirrels to be little beasts. Which, I do. (clears throat) Anyways, it wasn't long before the headmaster of the tribe, her father, Kohren, realized her true prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster. Just like that, her jovial childhood was stripped and replaced with endless spell memorization, teachings from ancient traditions, and exceedingly high expectations. Every druid leader to be must embark on a journey to seek out the sister tribes in order to introduce and establish respect amongst the fellow headmasters. They call this the Aramente, or Noble Odyssey. When her father felt she was ready, he set her on the path to truly discovering herself. Not knowing when, or if she will ever return. As she hiked down the mountain towards Stillben, she meditated on the task ahead. Part of the Aramente is proving yourself a strong warrior, a valiant protector, and a wise and compassionate leader. With this knowledge, one thought plays in repeat in her mind: Is she even worthy?
Taliesin: Percy was the third child of seven children, born to a noble family who lived far to the north in the ancient castle of Whitestone. With so many siblings to share the burdens of lordship, Percy turned his attention to the sciences, engineering, and naturalism. One day, a mysterious couple, named Lord and Lady Briarwood, came to court. During a feast held in their honour, the Briarwoods violently took control of the castle, killing or imprisoning everyone who would stand in their way. Percy awoke chained in the dungeon, only to be freed by his younger sister. Together they fled, chased by the Briarwoods’ men. As they ran, Percy’s sister took several arrows to the chest and fell. Percy kept running, eventually jumping into a freezing river and floating unconscious to freedom. He did not remember waking up on a fishing boat. He barely remembered the next two years, as he slowly made his way as far south as possible. Then one night, Percy had a dream. A roaring cloud of smoke offered him vengeance against those who destroyed his family. When he awoke, Percy began to design his first gun. (gun cocks and fires)
Ashley: Pike grew up in the outskirts of town, near the Bramblewood. Her ancestors were a family of deep gnomes with quite an unfavorable reputation. Thievery, destruction, and trickery left them with the curse of the last name Trickfoot. Sarenrae, the goddess of healing and redemption, had other plans for Pike's great-great-grandfather, Wilhand, who left his family at a young age after a dream. A dream that changed the course of the Trickfoot family. Wilhand devoted his life to Sarenrae and pledged from then on that him and his family would live a life of service and devotion. As a child, Pike seemed to have an affinity to heal. Whether it was animals, people, or even flowers, she felt she had a purpose in making things whole that had once been broken. She studied and learned the ways to heal though divine magic. She lived a peaceful life, quiet and simple, until one day, Wilhand was captured and almost killed by a group of goliath barbarians. One of the goliaths took a stand against the murder of the innocent gnome and he himself was beaten, bloodied, and left for dead, abandoned by his herd. Wilhand went to Pike for help. She prayed and healed this barbarian as best she could, bringing him back to life. When he awoke, she discovered his name was Grog Strongjaw. After that, they were best of friends, a rather unlikely pair. Little did she know that in a few years' time Grog would soon return the favor and bring her back from the clutches of death. (creature growl and snapping) After being killed in battle, Pike felt angry. She wanted to be stronger so that it would never happen again. She spent four months at sea training with the men and women aboard a ship called the Broken Howl. Gripping her holy symbol in one hand, and her morningstar in the other, this time, Pike is ready.
Sam: Oh, you haven’t heard of Scanlan Shorthalt? Well, gird your loins, ladies, because he has his eye on you. A talented musician, master of disguise, and dashingly handsome in his own mind, Scanlan sings songs almost as much as he sings his own praises. Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used his endless charm and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and support his single mother. One day he was discovered by a half-orc promoter, and joined Dr. Dranzel’s Spectacular Traveling Troupe where he learned the ways of the world and honed his skills as a bard extraordinaire. A loner much of his life, Scanlan has never quite come to terms with the violent death of his mother at the hands of a goblin invasion. While his years on the road provided many, shall we say, educational experiences with the opposite sex, deep down Scanlan yearns for the one thing he’s never known: the true love of a fellow Gnome. Still, Scanlan considers himself a lover first, performer second, and fighter distant third. On the battlefield, he’ll support his allies, but rarely draws blood unless it’s to protect fellow gnome, Pike. Count on Scanlan for a hearty laugh, a rollicking song, and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts and makes the females swoon.
Orion: Greetings and salutations. I am Tiberius Stormwind. I hail from a town called Ty'rex, located in the heart of Draconia, born from a politically respected family. At the age of 15, I succeeded in passing the Sorcerer’s Rite, showing prodigy-like control of my magic. The judges and the Draconian high council were amazed at how powerful my spells were for how long I had been training. At 20 years old, I was the youngest appointed member of the magic guild in Draconian history. For the next few years, I almost went mad from the malaise of being a guild member, as it’s rather boring. However, one day I happened upon a chamber, unused for quite some time. In the room were stacks of books and maps of the surrounding cities and areas around the known world. For months, I would frequent the chamber and learned of artifacts from legend. After a long period of research, I made a list of artifacts that caught my eye. I brought these findings to the high council and was told that all of the information in the chamber I had stumbled upon was either believed to be fiction, or unsolvable mysteries, and hence were lost forever. I found those answers to be unacceptable. A year later I devised a ruse and managed to convince the city council to lend support in me leaving Draconia on a mission of peace and diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms. Going from town to town and making friends and allies, in and for the name of Draconia. Being a red dragonborn, I had quite the task on my hands in that respect, but it was exactly what I needed so I could explore the world and find these artifacts, as I felt the truth was out there. Some may describe me as buffoonish, but I say poppycock to all that. I am much sharper than most give me credit for. I just don’t pay attention to things sometimes. I’ve also been known to be rather cunning, loyal, happy-go-lucky, and well, dangerous. I can’t help but show my true scales every now and then. But overall, I think I’m quite friendly for a Dragonborn.
Liam: Never entirely welcome in the company of elves or men, Vax'ildan learned at a young age to skip past formality, preferring instead to invite himself in your door. Along with twin sister Vex'ahlia, Vax was born by a chance encounter between elven royalty and human peasantry. Raised by their mother in their early years, the twins were eventually sent off to their father in the Elven capital of Singorn. But their cool reception among the elves there never warmed, and their time in the capital didn’t last. The siblings stole away one autumn night and set out on the open road. After a few years of wandering, they eventually decided to return to their mother, and journeyed back to the lands of their youth. But instead of finding their childhood home, they returned to a pile of rubble. Their mother was gone, their home burned to ash. Pressing the townspeople for answers, they learned of the day the dragon came. (roaring) With their ties all severed, Vax'ildan and his sister set out to find their fortune together in Tal'Dorei. An outsider since birth, Vax quickly learned to solve life’s challenges in his own particular way, often by sidestepping them entirely. And when his knack for circumventing adversity isn’t enough, (sword unsheathing and slashing) the way of blades the elves schooled him in more than makes up the difference.
Laura: Like so many half-elves, Vex'ahlia has spent most of her life suffering the cool reception of a people who don’t fully accept her. Born of a human mother and an elven father who only later in life took an interest in their existence, Vex'ahlia and her twin brother Vax'ildan quickly realized the only people they could truly rely on in this world were each other. It was at the age of 10 when the two were taken from their mother, and brought to live in Singorn, the isolated Elven city for which their father was an ambassador. He quietly took them in, but always kept an icy distance, and after too many years of disdainful looks, the pair decided to leave his indifference behind and set out on their own. Vax took to the cities, stealing small trinkets and learning the ways of the thief, while Vex kept to the woods. She preferred the isolation. Always the keen observer, she learned to hunt and to track, to spy and to shoot. And through a series of fateful events, earned herself a companion in the form of a bear -- her own stolen Trinket -- to fight alongside her and protect her fiercely. Also he is adorable and gives expert massages.
Matt: Welcome back guys! We have some interesting aspects of playing tonight Orion Acaba will be here shortly, he's currently stuck in traffic. Unfortunately we will not have a Sam Riegel tonight, due to his schedule.
Ashley: Scanlan?!
Marisha: No Scanlan.
Matt: Laura Bailey and Travis Willingham, our loving Grog and Vex, are out of town in Florida but are Skyping in via modern technology.
Laura: Technology? What's it all about?
Marisha: We can actually see you guys pretty good.
Matt: We're going to try and make this work.
Marisha: It's pretty cool.
Zac: We're getting audio set up right now.
Matt: So we're getting this figured out. They'll stay in play as long as they can. They are three hours ahead of us. To be fair, we have friends across the coast that get up at 4am to watch this
Laura: That's true.
Matt: You should hang around long as you can. (strange monkey noises)
Matt: You should hang around long as you can.
Matt: We can't hear you right now. (strange monkey noises) (more monkey noises)
Matt: It's even better.
Matt: So as they're figuring this out guys. We'll let you know, we've already hit our first milestone for subs.
Matt: So we have a winner. The winner of our first package, which includes the player's handbook signed by everybody, the dice, and one horn of Orcus torn from the forehead of K'varn... Is the esteemed RhymesWithOrange! Congratulations RhymesWithOrange, you are the first winner of the horn. (everyone claps)
Matt: Well done. So we'll get that sent out --
Taliesin: Are you taking a selfie with the iPad?
Marisha: (laughs)
Taliesin: Sorry.
Matt: (sighs)
Taliesin: Sorry.
Matt: It's alright. So --
Marisha: Thank you again to our friend Kai Norman at KommissarProps for making the horn, go follow him. It's awesome. KommisarProps on Instagram and Facebook
Matt: Our next giveaway is at 3550. And we will give away the second and only other horn, as well as the rest of that package. And at 3600 we're going to do t-shirt signed, dice box, starter kit and we're going to be dancing for you afterwards. Let's see if we can get that by tonight. Also, want to give you guys a heads up, we've wanted to get some confirmation to you guys about the episode releases after the live show. Because we have a lot of people who watch the show who can't watch it live.
Matt: The episodes are available immediately afterward on Twitch if you're a subscriber. So the morning after the show, if you're a subscriber, you get to watch the episodes immediately afterward. Plus you're helping us keep this channel going. All the subscription money goes toward maintaining the channel, all the people that work here throughout the week, all the other amazing hosts and people that actually run the programs here. So you help make this channel function.
Marisha: Only subscribers get access to the archives.
Matt: -- archives immediately. However --
Laura: (coughs) However --
Matt: -- volume.
Matt: To finish this thought, for those who aren't subscribers, episodes do go up now every Monday, that's going to be the confirmed time period of release.
Matt: So you can look forward to episodes up on the Geek & Sundry website every Monday. That's the scenario.
Matt: So, given that case, whenever Orion gets here he'll hop in, in the meantime, let's go ahead and start this game up.
Matt: So.
Ashley: All right here we go.
Matt: So, for those of us who --
Matt: Just a little heads up here, the party has just returned after a long arduous trek through The Underdark, beneath the Dwarven city of Kraghammer.
Matt: They were sent to retrieve a paladin named Lady Kima of Vord, who was on a vision quest to stop some dark evil that her deity Bahamut told her was existing beneath this mountain range, and needed to be squelched.
Matt: The party managed to salvage her from insidious torture, and through her aid as well as a Mind Flayer who had been outcast from the society and the colony nearby.
Matt: They managed to convince to help them as well, fought their way through the tunnels, past the Duergar army, eventually to the underground Mindflayer colony of Yogg Voril where they found that this entity called K'varn. This was then eventually revealed to be a mad beholder, K'varn, who had been pseudo possessed and given additional power by the Horn of Orcus, a great and evil artifact long forgotten, which had been found by this entity. So they managed to make their way into the temple, kill K'varn, tear the horn from it's forehead, however found themselves swarmed immediately by an entire colony of mind flayers heading toward the top of this temple. They managed to battle and battle, nearly losing a few party members, and through some ingenuity, escape through the top, glide over the city of Yogg Voril through this underground chasm to a distant embankment along the beachside of this underground lake. And teleport their way back to their base city of Emon. So they've come back to Emon, they've come to their keep, Greyskull Keep, and they've had an evening of rest. Upon waking the next morning, they've managed to get some breakfast, they've freed Lady Kima from her stone entrapment as she was turned to stone during the battle with the beholder, and had a conversation based around what should or could be done about this Horn of Orcus evil artifact. So here we will pick up again from that point. So the rest of you guys have eaten your meal, Kima hungrily doing so. All of you guys both sore and exhausted having barely seen sunlight for a little over a week and being probably the first or second good meal you've had since leaving Kraghammer proper. You all finish your food, Grog hungrily so, double the size of his normal intake of delicious meats and starches. Tiberius has not seemed to have woken up or found his way down from his room as of yet. However, you guys did recently receive a rolled up piece of parchment. A notification from the council of Tal’Dorei, saying that you have been requested to the council chambers at some point this afternoon, around the mid-day sun, to discuss your return and the situation and conditions about it. And that was all it said.
Liam: I can't remember is Lady Kima with us at this point? Is she unstoned?
Matt: She's unstoned, you've already had the conversation with her last week talking about the horn, basically interrogating her.
Liam: And we said that we had it somewhere safe, but weren't we playing coy with that?
Matt: You were playing coy with it but you --
Ashley: I had gone downstairs to go get Grog.
Matt: Yes, Grog returned with it and you guys had the conversation basically saying ‘Oh, it's safe, don't worry. It's fine’. Grog at which currently has it in the bag of holding.
Marisha: But we haven't told her that it's in the bag of holding right?
Matt: No you just said you have it somewhere safe.
Marisha: We just said we have it somewhere safe.
Matt: Correct.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: Turn them up a little bit.
Taliesin: I am highly entertained.
Liam: I think we're getting feedback.
Matt: Oh, I see.
Marisha: Oh yeah, that's us.
Laura: Right! That would be us.
Matt: Yes.
Laura: Sorry about that.
Ashley: We'll figure this out guys.
Marisha: That wasn't too bad.
Matt: This is the new attempt at technology with our out-of-towners.
Taliesin: It's amazing.
Marisha: It's working pretty well.
Taliesin: It is working pretty well.
Marisha: I'm kind of impressed.
Taliesin: Have we actually opened up the parchment and read it yet?
Matt: Yes, you have received it and you've inspected it.
Ashley: It's Tiberius.
Orion: Hey everybody.
Marisha: Yes.
Laura: Hey boo.
Taliesin: I don't know what's going to happen.
Matt: He's going to crawl under the table. There you have it.
Liam: Good morning sleepyhead.
Orion: Hi guys.
Matt: As a couple hours have passed --
Marisha: Good morning Tiberius.
Orion: Hi. Right.
Orion: Hello.
Orion: Am I here?
Liam: Yes you've just come down the stairs.
Matt: You've just now come down after many hours of breakfast have passed. It's now pushing around 11:00 in the afternoon comparatively, and Tiberius comes storming into the main dining hall of your keep.
Orion: Morning everyone.
Marisha: What is that?
Orion: This is my own bag of holding.
Orion: And I walk over to Grog and I open their bag of holding and take out my wheel of mending and I put it in here.
Laura: You got your own bag of holding?!
Orion: That's what I needed the extra gold for before I left.
Marisha: Where did you go to get that?
Orion: We're face-timing?
Marisha: Where did you go to get that?
Orion: Hey! Hi Guys!
Taliesin: Science.
Liam: We are the coolest.
Orion: I was like that's, "That's Laura's voice, where the hell is that coming from?"
Ashley: At least we think we're cool.
Marisha: At least we think we're cool.
Orion: Travis is there too! Sorry!
Orion: I mean.. Yes.
Liam: So Tiberius we're just waiting for you to awake. I think we should probably go and see the emperor, like you do. Talk about the little problem we have.
Marisha: Wait. Where did you go and get a bag of holding in the time of us sleeping and you waking up.
Orion: If you recall, I actually went to Draconia... when we all woke up to begin with.
Marisha: You didn't tell us that.
Orion: Why would I have to tell you?
Marisha: I didn't say you didn't have to, I'm just saying you acted like I should know and I'm saying I had no idea.
Orion: I could have sworn I cast that and said that last game.
Matt: No, you just stayed in your room and did it on your own.
Orion: Oh shit. (all laugh)
Marisha: Yeah. So right now you're crazy to me.
Orion: Right. Okay.
Taliesin: I'm also a little disturbed that it looks like that bag of holding is made of you.
Marisha: Yes it does look like it's made of drag -- that seems cruel.
Orion: Actually this is wyvern skin. We use it in the air force of the Draconian army. And when the --
Ashley: Air force?
Orion: Yes. Draconia has an army, 500 standing, 200 are airborne.
Marisha: But they have an air force?
Orion: Yes. Keyleth: Do they fly-- nevermind.
Taliesin: No, they just blow, they force air.
Marisha: (laughs)
Orion: We have trained and tamed wyverns which we have utilized and they are part of our culture.
Taliesin: I've never seen a skinned one.
Orion: Yes. And so I went to the local "shoppe" and purchased a bag of holding because I realized that I did not hold my own wheel of mending for a long time.
Taliesin: That was frustrating you, wasn't it?
Orion: It was extremely frustrating. Especially because it's my artifact.
Orion: Yes.
Marisha: Well that's good. It's probably good to have a second one of those.
Marisha: And it comes with water, how handy.
Orion: It holds a lot of things!
Marisha: How fantastic.
Taliesin: We should probably get off to see what the emperor wants.
Orion: Before we do that --
Orion: Where's Scanlan now?
Marisha: Not here.
Matt: Scanlan is currently in the room eating breakfast
Orion: We're all eating breakfast still right?
Matt: Yeah.
Orion: Hi everybody.
Liam: Not you, you've apparently been globe shopping.
Orion: Right. Scanlan? I was thinking about our last encounter.
Orion: I'm going to take off my ion stone that's kinda chilling.
Orion: This is a particular thing that you've seen me use several times. And I notice in the last couple of battles you've actually literally run out of spells to cast. I propose a friendly trade. The crown on your head allows you to do certain things which you have not utilized the last several rounds you've owned it. It seems you've actually complained about not having extra spells to cast.
Liam: Rounds of what?
Orion: --rounds of battle, Vax.
Liam: Oh.
Orion: I don't know. (all laugh)
Orion: So I assume that you could probably actually use this more. I have a tool that allows me to do it to begin with and it's come in rather handy as you've seen. What say you, Scanlan?
Matt: Scanlan looks to you and thinks for a second and goes
Sam: You know what. I'm going to think on that.
Marisha: (laughs)
Sam: Wait untill I'm more rested and solid and sound mind before I can make any sort of arrangements or trades here. It would be unfair, given our current state of -- (all laugh)
Liam: It's true Scanlan, you should probably wait until you're feeling a little more present.
Ashley: Wonderful plan Scanlan.
Sam: Agreed, agreed.
Sam: A couple hours at the local brothel and all should be fine.
Matt: He cracks his fingers, expectantly.
Liam: Welcome back, even though we didn't know you were gone. I've eaten. The rest of us have eaten --
Ashley: Were you gone all night?
Orion: No, just for about an hour.
Marisha: Oh.
Orion: It was a good trip. I needed it.
Ashley: Just saying hello to family and that?
Orion: No I just literally went to a shop I knew in Draconia and picked up the item. I wasn't sure if they had any in Emon and didn't really want to waste any time looking for one.
Ashley: Well...
Liam: Good on you, shall we go to meet the emperor?
Taliesin: I've eaten, let's politic.
Liam: I think so.
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: This is so --
Matt: Can you guys hear us fine?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Just making sure.
Laura: Too scared to talk is all.
Marisha: Scared to talk?
Liam: Chime in, please.
Matt: Feel free to chime in whenever.
Liam: One of us, one of us.
Travis: Balls. Taint. Ale. Nipples.
Matt: That's our Grog.
Ashley: Hey, there's Grog.
Marisha: Grog!
Matt: As our wonderful giant, now filled with various forms of delicious food matter warm in his belly, gives a string of various curse words in enjoyment, and sits up from the table with a loud fart and you guys make your way out of Greyskull Keep.
Matt: Towards the outer wall of Emon, in towards the entrance to Abedar's Promenade, making your way towards the Cloudtop District where the palace itself resides. Is there any place --
Laura: Is Lady Kima with us?
Matt: Lady Kima is with you, yes.
Taliesin: Good.
Matt: Is there anything else you want to do or are you guys making a beeline for the palace?
Orion: I would like to take another 500 gold from the treasury before we do that. And I do.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Wait, what?
Liam: From the treasury.
Liam: You have to ask the treasurer.
Laura: How much do you want?
Orion: Five hundred to replenish the 500 that I initially took. I don’t know if I will have to spend it at all, and if I do, I will completely share my plan with all of you. But I would like to see how what we do plays out next.
Laura: Another 500?
Orion: Yes.
Orion: That's all I do. That's all I want to do.
Matt: Anything else?
Liam: Have we had contact with Allura? Since returning?
Matt: Nuh uh.
Liam: Not yet?
Liam: I feel good about her being at this meeting.
Ashley: Someone just got really excited when we mentioned the name Allura.
Orion: I cast prestidigitation on myself and make robes are all super clean and nice.
Matt: Got you.
Matt: As you guys walk into the center of the Cloudtop District, you can see that her ivory tower, which once collapsed around you, is now standing in it's previous location, seemingly untouched and back to it's original esteemed visual.
Taliesin: That is the question, do we stop in first or do we go straight to --
Liam: Was there a time requested on there?
Matt: It said around the noon day sun. It's probably about 30 minutes give or take.
Liam: Allura's really the only person I trust.
Taliesin: Perhaps we should not walk into the palace with this on us, so to speak.
Liam: We don't have anything on us.
Taliesin: No, we don't, but if we did we should probably deal with it.
Taliesin: What.
Liam: Yes.
Taliesin: No. Yes. (laughs)
Liam: Tibbsy. Let's go ring Allura's bell.
Travis: I'd like to ring her bell.
Taliesin: It's like having the internet right there.
Liam: So I just start walking off towards Allura's tower.
Orion: I'll follow Vax.
Matt: Okay. Everyone else go with them?
Taliesin: Yeah.
Ashley: Yeah.
Matt: So you guys trek your way towards the northern edge of the Cloudtop District. You round about the series of very nice, fine marbled houses, finely crafted stone. This is the affluent area of Emon proper. It's in the secondary city wall, which of course the upper echelon of merchants and those who have money are offered the secondary form of defense against the town being sieged at all.
Matt: You come around the corner on the fine kind of yellowish cobblestone road, turn, and you get to the point where you can see to the left of you is the giant courtyard that surrounds the outskirts of the palace proper. With the giant steps that lead up to the darkened purple marble that the entire structure is made out of. To your right, there's a few buildings and the white ivory tower that Allura lives in. You approach, the front door is closed. It still remains that giant iron knocker on the front that hangs loosely, like a giant wishbone that you slam into the front of the wooden doorway.
Matt: Give it a couple hits? (Vax nods)
Matt: You can hear it echo throughout the interior of the tall standing tower. A few moments pass, you hear the movement of chain. A creaking of metal and then a -- some sort of large shifting of a wood platform or plank. The door then creaks open and there standing, a little bleary eyed, slept-in a bit, but in the process of getting ready, you see before you Arcanist Allura. Her long blonde hair is half braided. She's in her darkened blue robes. You're used to seeing her in and see -- She opens the door, the sunlight hitting her eye. She protects her vision for a second before they focus on the rest of the group and she goes,
Matt: "My lord, you've all arrived! You've all arrived!"
Matt: And she swings the door opens and runs forward immediately to you, the first person that's there and she gives you a big hug.
Matt: She holds back and gives you a look over.
Matt: Her eyes are opened. You can see how honestly eager and happy to see that everyone's here safe.
Liam: I look over at Tiberius and just short of sheepishly shrug.
Orion: I'm used to it, it's fine.
Matt: She turns over to give Pike a big hug. She makes her way around the rest of the group.
Matt: "You're all... I'm so glad to see you're all back. I've heard there was some difficulties happening in Kraghammer at the time you arrived."
Matt: She turns around and takes your hands, Keyleth, into her own and gives you a nod and a small hug. Goes to Percy and gives you a hug. Goes to Tiberius and gives you a big warm hug.
Matt: She slowly pulls away. She acquiesces to your longer hug... And then... pushes away.
Orion: It is nice to see you again.
Matt: "The pleasure is mine."
Laura: (sings) Awkward. Everyone: (laughs)
Matt: "The pleasure is mine, Tiberius."
Matt: And as she turns around, she sees standing behind the rest of you, there's Kima. There in her now freshly cleaned golden armor that she polished over the evening so she doesn't smell of Duergar sweat and blood anymore.
Liam: We've brought you a present.
Matt: There's this moment where they both look at each other quietly. And then Allura steps forward and says,
Matt: "Kima. Welcome back."
Matt: And they both just run and give this big embracing bear hug. She lifts Kima up and there's a slow spin. You can see this very very strong bond of friendship before she eventually puts Kima down and takes a little bit, she holds her hands for a second. You can see a tear running down Allura's cheek.
Matt: "I was so worried about you."
Matt: And Kima sheepishly turns her eyes to the side and says,
Matt: "Sorry for the all the trouble."
Orion: Story of my life. (all laugh)
Orion: Seriously Matthew?! Come on!
Matt: What?! (all laugh)
Matt: They're good friends.
Liam: Friends! Friends!
Marisha: (laughs)
Orion: Friends.
Matt: Your assumptions, dragonborn. (all laugh)
Liam: Don't mug yourself.
Taliesin: That's great.
Liam: Come correct. Don't mug yourself.
Matt: (laughs)
Matt: They take a moment to just nod at each other. She reaches her hand out in front of Kima's head and rustles her hair for a second and says,
Matt: "You had many of us worried sick you can't keep running off like that."
Matt: And Kima says,
Matt: "I know, I know."
Matt: Then Allura turns to the rest of the group and says,
Matt: "Thank you all so, so very much. You've done the realm and myself a great service in bringing her back."
Matt: At which point, Kima says,
Matt: "Bring me back? They helped me complete my quest! You've made some strong allies, Allie."
Matt: And Allura starts heading back into her tower and says,
Marisha: Allie?
Matt: And Allura starts heading back into her tower and says,
Matt: "Well? Come. Enter. I have tea ready."
Laura: I like it.
Matt: "Well? Come. Enter. I have tea ready."
Matt: "Well? Come. Enter. I have tea ready. You all look like you could use it to be honest."
Ashley: Yeah.
Matt: "Come. Please."
Taliesin: Well, all right.
Orion: I love tea.
Taliesin: We have a moment we can spend.
Liam: Long story.
Matt: So as you guys all walk into her tower, you remember it untouched from your previous entry here. It's a weird moment to step into a tower that you were once in as it crumbled and folded on itself, to see it as if nothing had ever happened.
Taliesin: Is there a new rug?
Matt: There is not.
Taliesin: Ah-hah!
Laura: Hmm..
Marisha: We're not giving it back.
Laura: We shouldn't tell her about the rug.
Marisha: Don't tell her about the rug.
Matt: You guys step into the center of the room and she's talking to herself for a moment, saying
Matt: "Things have been a bit crazy here, obviously. Now that the floodgates have opened as far as discussions with the council and people who have maintained a backlog for a while. It's been a bit busy. But, this is a wonderful moment to respite. I'm greatly enjoying the company to be honest. Come."
Matt: She guides you all to the center of the chamber. Once again, there's that large stone platform in the center that has a number of the inert runes carved into the stonework. As you all step onto it, she taps her heel against the bottom of it for a second. As she does, all the runes glow with a bright flash of blue and a familiar sensation as that circular platform begins to lift like an arcane elevator, up the center of the tower, going up one, two, three stories. And as you're going up you're seeing certain sections of wooden library shelves set up at odd angles along the top of the arcane tower itself. You can see there are small stairways that lead off into doorways that seem to almost exit into the sky.
Matt: You've gotten into the idea that a lot of these powerful mage-built towers, the inner workings don't really match the outer exterior look. And there are rooms that shouldn't exist at certain points as you lift up.
Liam: I'd like to make a perfunctory insight check just to see if there's anything hinky.
Orion: I'd like to google perfunctory real quick.
Matt: You can do that. Go for it.
Liam: Okay.
Matt: On Allura?
Liam: Yeah, everything's probably fine. That's an 18.
Matt: Best that you can gather, she looks like she's a bit groggy, having slept in recently. But she seems extremely excited you've all returned and seems eager to catch up as far as what has transpired since last you met her.
Matt: The platform continues before it reaches the topmost floor of the tower before the slowing of the stone platform eventually comes to a halt with a slight jostling. The runes fade and you're all on the top floor of the tower once again. This is her main chamber. You can see across the way there is her large cush canopy bed in the far corner. There are a number of desks. There's a small arcane laboratory on the far side. Looks like it's in a bit of disarray, as she's probably in the middle of a project.
Matt: You do hear, as soon as you arrive, it sounds like the whistle of a tea kettle in the distance. At which point, she says,
Matt: "Ah! Allow me."
Matt: And she begins to walk over. She lifts her hand and you see a small drift of arcane energy as her mage hand goes and lifts, takes the water off of it's burner, and begins to absent mindedly mage-hand various teacups out of a large cabinet above the little kitchenette area.
Ashley: That's awesome. (all laugh)
Matt: At which point, everyone's looking around, Kima, amongst the rest of you guys, says,
Matt: "It's been awhile since I've been here. Everything's as grandiose and unnecessarily dressed as it always is. I'm glad you got rid of that old rug though."
Laura: (laughs) (scattered coughing)
Liam: Sorry.
Liam: (coughs)
Ashley: Was there a rug?
Liam: I'm fine.
Taliesin: I don't remember that.
Marisha: Stay cool. Come on.
Travis: This rug?
Laura: Nope.
Taliesin: Nope.
Ashley: Nope.
Taliesin: Not here.
Matt: Allura, who is now in the process of pulling chairs over and setting up a small sitting arrangement, a semi-circle, and says,
Marisha: It’s so cute.
Matt: "The last time the tower collapsed and I was so rudely assaulted in my living quarters, it appears my rug went missing. It's all right. I've kept my eye out for a new one for some time."
Orion: That was unfortunate.
Liam: Magic, it's tricky.
Orion: I had no idea. I jumped out when that happened.
Taliesin: Speaking of tricky magic.
Matt: She gives a slow, knowing look about the group. And gives a nod like, 'I acquiesce to this, that's fine'.
Marisha: You should have some potted plants, Allura. Like some nice greenery.
Taliesin: You're going to try and feng shui the tower, is that what you--
Marisha: Well, why not.
Taliesin: I don't know.
Matt: "That's not a bad idea. Perhaps we'll discuss this."
Liam: This is silly.
Liam: Allura, it's a long story. Lot of deurgar, lot of mindflayer, lot of mindflayers, and an evil god?
Taliesin: A beholder.
Orion: Yes, moreover, a beholder.
Liam: Yes, but who was pulling the strings behind the beholder.
Marisha: He thought he was an evil god. A beholder with a god complex?
Matt: "Curious."
Matt: At which point, as you say that, she does this with her fingers, and all the chairs rush in underneath you guys. And you're put into a sitting position. As you all sit, she begins to slowly mage-hand over each one of you a freshly poured cup of tea.
Matt: A look of concern comes across her face.
Matt: "So you found your way beneath the city, I assume based on the denizens you've mentioned, into the underdark proper. A beholder you say? Mindflayers you say?"
Taliesin: Yes.
Matt: "I first off must apologize, I was not aware I was putting you into such dangerous territory."
Orion: Ha! It was really dangerous! It was nothing, filled with just buttholes everywhere. Terrible.
Matt: "That sounds like a terrible city."
Orion: Mhm..
Marisha: (laughs)
Matt: "Well, first and foremost, I apologize for that. I am incredibly grateful you're all seemingly healthy and still here. And you've brought Kima back to us which is very important."
Matt: "Well, I guess this is in order."
Matt: And she sits up for a second and walks over. And you can see she looks back at the rest of you and brushes her hand for a second. A sphere of darkness appears in the corner of the room where you can not see an entire part of the room. And she sits there and hovers. Just a little pocket of darkness.
Marisha: Aw, man.
Ashley: What's that?
Matt: You hear some rustling.
Marisha: We've been in darkness so long.
Matt: You hear some rustling.
Matt: You hear some rustling.
Matt: The sphere of darkness finishes and you see she's holding a sack of coins, that you don't know where she picked them up from.
Marisha: Oh!
Matt: She steps back over to her chair, sits down, and says,
Matt: "Just a precaution, I like to keep my private things private. But, a deal is a deal and you've done as you've asked. So as we've discussed, 10,000 gold pieces, to the lot of you, and my greatest thanks."
Laura: I take that. "to the lot of you, and my greatest thanks." (all laugh)
Matt: She hands it out to Vex's eager palm. It's very heavy.
Laura: Good thing I'm strong then, huh?
Matt: With her 9 strength, it sags.
Laura: Sorry about the hand gesture there, stop it. (all laugh)
Matt: Internet.
Matt: She sits back down, says,
Matt: "You tell me what else if anything has transpired, and I'll let you know what you've missed."
Ashley: Well.
Orion: We have Orcus's horn. So that's a thing.
Matt: There's a slight pause before the actual sound of breaking glass hits your ears as the teacup that she's holding shatters across the stonework on the floor.
Matt: Allura, still sitting in her chair, hands in place and says
Matt: "I'm sorry, what did you say?"
Orion: Yes, that beholder butthole that we had to fight, that we had no idea we had to fight, had this Orcus horn on his head. So we took it off and we kept it safe. That's what you wanted I'm assuming, to destroy it.
Laura: But we haven't touched it though.
Orion: No.
Matt: "All right."
Matt: She looks over to Kima, who does this with her shoulders up. Kima gives her a nod and says,
Matt: "To be honest, I wasn't sure that was the end of my journey. But it seems that great evil I talked about before, we killed it and took its source of power. Now we're figuring out what to do with it."
Matt: She gives a sheepish grin and a slight shrug in her armor. Allura looks to the ground for a moment and says,
Matt: "I don't know much of this object you say, but if it was the source of the creature's power, and it carries with it the connotations of Orcus, then this is a very, very ill omen indeed."
Orion: Yes.
Matt: "This must be brought before the council immediately."
Orion: Wait.
Marisha: The council?
Orion: The council?
Matt: "The council of Tal'Dorei, the council you are part of."
Orion: That helps.
Ashley: Are you going there, right now, also?
Matt: "Yes, I was summoned to it."
Ashley: We were as well.
Orion: Here's the thing.
Orion: Sorry, Pike. The thing with this particular item is, the more people know about it, the more dangerous it actually becomes. The fact that we even share this information with Kima and with you is a very dangerous thing to begin with.
Matt: "I agree."
Orion: Are the council trustworthy?
Matt: "Those who currently reside on the council are trustworthy, I assure you this. I've done my work with them for many years, and those that have passed have been replaced with equally trustworthy individuals. And, rest assured, I have my checks and balances in place as well."
Liam: I think what we're worried about most is the corrupting nature of this thing. And while the council may have good intentions, I think more than a few of us are somewhat nervous. What effect it might have on them, on us.
Matt: "Can you assess what the mistrust would be to not bring this before the sovereign and the council?"
Orion: Namely, if the immediate want is for it to be immediately destroyed, because that's what needs to happen with anything from Orcus, as you very well know.
Matt: "I understand, and I don't think you'll find anyone who disagrees. But I also don't think you should sow mistrust with the council by keeping any of this information from them."
Marisha: It's not about trust.
Laura: Uriel has been corrupted once already.
Marisha: Exactly.
Matt: "This is true, and was it not by your hand that he was freed and his family kept safe? Understand, that this is a man that owes you him and his family's life. I think he would take in to you, his ear bent in your direction quite strongly."
Marisha: Correct, but couldn't you also safely say that he is therefore fairly easy corruptible? If he had been corrupted before, even not if subconsciously, I'm not saying intentionally, but he clearly...
Matt: "You would know best what was responsible for corrupting our sovereign, as you did fight and one was felled, by it's own strength."
Marisha: I'm saying Lady Allura, that there is essences, there seems to be magical properties to this horn that corrupt even some of the strongest willed individuals.
Matt: "Then we must be rid of it quickly. And I think we need to at least discuss this with the council, if not present it. Bring it to their attention. There are ways, arcane... not very approved ways, of nullifying targeted memories." "The rest of the arcana pentsafocal have banned the use of such magics but if we could have approval, understanding the safety concerns of this object from the council we could override the arcana pentsafocal and I could employ some of these magics to make sure that once this artifact is destroyed or taken somewhere to never be found again, we ourselves perhaps would not recall it ever existed. And that itself is the safest course of action."
Orion: I agree.
Liam: I think that we trust you. And you trust the council. That's enough for me.
Taliesin: That's enough for me as well.
Marisha: Pike? Where do you stand.
Orion: That's definitely enough for me.
Marisha: Pike? Where do you stand.
Orion: Just so you know Allura --
Orion: I might have a solution as well for actually destroying it, so I will follow your lead.
Taliesin: I think the best course of action is to trust people.
Liam: And we're incapable of destroying the thing on our own.
Orion: Oh, that's not true at all. I might have a solution which I just shared with Allura. I'm letting her take the lead on this, and when the situation presents itself I might have a solution to destroy it outright.
Laura: Why don't you share that with us now Tiberius, instead of keeping it secret?
Liam: Just give us a rough sketch, maybe? instead of keeping it secret?
Orion: Very well.
Orion: I'll pull out my bag of holding.
Orion: This.
Marisha: The mending wheel?
Orion: No, the bag.
Laura: An empty fist?
Liam: He pulled out the bag.
Marisha: Okay. Would you care to elaborate, Tiberius?
Orion: I'm sorry. This part of the thing I wanted to tell all of you at breakfast. The idea is, with some research I've come to find that if anything is in a bag of holding, and the bag of holding itself is destroyed, the items or whatever go into a somewhat void, that cannot be retrieved by any one particular thing. If we are to have our memories erased, as you say, then it would guarantee that when we place the thing in a bag of holding and destroy that bag, it will then be dissipated into that void.
Matt: At which point, Allura raises her hand and says,
Matt: "Tiberius. You, as a very trained sorcerer, have some knowledge in this regard. I've been crafting bags of holding since I was a child as a way of keeping my weekends busy. I have to notify you that should such a pocket of interdimensional arcane space is disrupted in this way, it doesn't send it into a void. It jettisons the contents into the Astral Sea. The Astral Sea which has many denizens that could come across this object. Githyanki themselves and their great ships."
Orion: I hate yankees.
Matt: "Gith --nevermind."
Ashley: So it could be bad.
Orion: There are things --
Matt: "There are many things that exist in the Astral Sea that could recover this item. I'm not saying there isn't merit to this, but I think it would be best we put it somewhere where at least we know for certain no one will find it, as opposed to just hoping it disappears somewhere."
Orion: But the memory thing is crucial.
Marisha: What about those who might be uncomfortable with toying around with my memories and tramping along around in my head, I don't really want --
Liam: Why don't you think about it for a while?
Travis: My head's pretty fragile as it is.
Liam: We're talking about erasing the path back to this thing, we're not talking about removing your adolescent years from your memory. Just this one thing.
Travis: All right.
Marisha: How many lessons have we learned in just the time. Wouldn't we have to erase all memories surrounding it? We wouldn't even remember our trip into the underdark?
Taliesin: I think we could perhaps just erase the memory of where we put it.
Orion: That is what I assume will happen.
Matt: "That is possible. Like I've said, these magics have not been tampered with in nearly 200 years."
Marisha: So we're gonna break the seal on some untampered-with magics and just experiment.
Matt: "I am part of a group that oversees civilization. I can't go into too much detail but they are responsible for keeping such ancient magics, long forgotten magics such as this. I would have to meet with and discuss and gain approval for its use. But for an item as dangerous as what you say, perhaps this is one of those special occasions."
Liam: She's working for the Illuminati and we're basically the A-team, so I think she might know a little better.
Taliesin: The A-team?
Marisha: What do you think, Pike?
Ashley: I feel like at this point we don't really have another option.
Ashley: And I do trust Allura.
Orion: I'm all tapped out.
Ashley: And I do trust Allura.
Ashley: So I feel like if we just go check it out. I don't really know what our other option is.
Ashley: That was a good one.
Liam: And if we don't like it we can step.
Taliesin: And if we don't like it we can keep thinking of something else. We have time.
Matt: "This is true. And who knows what wisdom the rest of the council might have in their midst as well."
Matt: "They have members from all across the world. We'll see which resources they have at their disposal."
Taliesin: I'm sure they're waiting for us.
Matt: "I am glad to be free of my usual business. Are you guys familiar with the Wilder Fens?"
Liam: Sorry? The Wilder Fens?
Matt: "The Wilder Fens? They're a bloody merchant guild. They've left our chambers in shambles. Look, since you've been gone and the council map has been brought brought up to speed once more, we've had to deal with the backlog of all the various council meetings that have been pushed back and pushed back for months and months. It's been rather nightmarish. So this, all dangerous as it is, I'm taking it as a nice change from the usual, pardon my speaking, political bullshit I've been dragged into on a weekly basis. Between Wilder Fens, and there was the Cortigian League from Wildmount, and they just tore through Emon with a caravan of partying gypsies that destroyed everything in their path."
Marisha: Who?
Orion: Damn gypsies.
Matt: "The Cortian League."
Marisha: The Cortian League.
Matt: "From Wildmount, the north."
Taliesin: We fought stitch monsters, that was mostly what we... it was guns and swords and...
Matt: "It's far more interesting. Most of our guests have been a bit rough around the edges. Although I would say we did manage to meet with Syldor of Syngorn. We have some business there getting Syngorn situated."
Laura: Oh, Syldor!
Matt: "And Lord and Lady Briarwood were rather nice to us when they came into the town. So, business has been... fair."
Taliesin: Shall we take this to the council then?
Liam: Yes, we have pressing matters. We'll get to that later.
Matt: "All right. Let's go to the council then."
Matt: As you guys make your way back down through the tower, you eventually venture through the castletop district in front of the palace. The guards stand there with their long, red, velvet cloaks and their brass breastplates. They recognize both Allura and you as you approach. They step aside, put their spears toward the steps, and give you a grand entrance to the front of the palace.
Matt: As you step up, the front doors open on their own with a large heavy shaking of the wood. As the palace doors open, you are led into the central chambers of the main palace walkway which splits to the right and left, and then across leads into the main throne room. However, you guys are meeting in the council room which is to the left. You've been there twice before.
Matt: So you're led over to the council chambers, which, as you enter the main circular room, you're brought into the nice hardwood floors, the dark forest green colored walls, these long tapestries which recall various battles of history and broad mountainous landscapes showing settlers making their way across dangerous terrain. You can see various weapons from different civilizations that were brought up as gifts to Emon that have been mounted on the walls as presentory atmospheric decor. And in the central room, you can see what currently stands, the entirety of the Tal'Dorei council, in a hushed discussion. The council, of course, has at the center, across the table from you, Sovereign Uriel Tal'Dorei the Second himself. The leader of Emon and the current Sovereign of all of Tal'Dorei, this section of the continent. You see him with his characteristic dark hair, with greying sides, cut shorter than you recall. Looks like he recently got a trim and some very well kept facial hair. He's wearing his ceremonial robes which are the same gold and red color as the armored soldiers that greeted you at the front of the palace. Next to him, you see Lord Riskell Daxio, the elven male who helped you guys handle the purchasing of the keep when you were awarded that at the end of your last journey. He's the Master of Trade currently within Emon. You can see he has long strawberry blonde hair that is pulled into a tight ponytail to the back. He wears darker clothing, more for decoration than actual use. His armor seems to be loose and more decorative. Next to him is Guardian Tofor Brotorus, which you've heard of but have not met before. A female dragonborn paladin.
Marisha: Say that one more time? Guardian who's a what now?
Matt: Guardian Tofor Bratoras.
Marisha: To-for?
Matt: T-O-F-O-R. Bratoras. Her name's been mentioned before but this is the first time you guys have actually seen her in person.
Ashley: It's a girl?
Matt: It's a female dragonborn paladin. She is adorned in full, silvered platinum plate. That has currently carved multiple symbols of Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon. As she looks up and notices, you can see she gives a hand up, a symbol of greetings towards Kima. As Kima also gives her hand up and they both touch the front of their armor in a symbolic holy way, they both being followers of Bahamut. You immediately make that religious connection between the two of them. She looks across at the rest of the group there that she doesn't seem to notice, eyes meeting with Tiberius. This is strange. You haven't seen very many dragonborn at all within Emon, and as soon as she meets your gaze, she gives you a look of deep, deep stinkeye.
Orion: Hello. My name is Tiberius Stormwind. Of House Stormwind, from Draconia. Tofor: "From Draconia, you say?"
Orion: Yes. I'm sure you've heard of my father Kravanas, my mother Penelope? Tofor: "And perhaps you should close that trap and sit across the table as far from me as possible. "
Matt: She seems to spit the words almost, and sits back in her chair.
Orion: Mind your tongue.
Matt: The rest of the council's talking amongst themselves and hearing this slight discussion. Next to her there is a halfling male, in a ranger-ish garb, wearing what looks like some really fine chain shirt, with a thick dark black cloak. He is shaved bald with tattoos on one side of his face, and he introduces himself.
Matt: "I'm terribly, sorry. I did not mean for there to be any sort of misunderstanding here."
Matt: He gives a slight nudge to Tofor.
Matt: "I do not believe we've met at this time. My name is Seeker Asum Emring. I am the master of secrets here within the council."
Matt: He extends his hand towards you, almost like alleviating the tension.
Orion: Hi. Stormwind here. Seeker Asum: "I assume you're the ones we're waiting for, please have a seat."
Matt: At which the sovereign finishes discussion with another human which you have not met. He is a built and armored individual, stands probably the tallest of the entire group, thick square jaw, unshaven. At which point he puts his hand on the sovereign's shoulder and says,
Matt: "I suppose I should introduce myself as well. I've heard much about you, Vox Machina. I am Arbiter Braum Goldhand. I have recently taken up as of three months ago the position that General Kreig once held within the city. Since he was unfortunately lost to us, there was a need for a new master of law. As since I've had a lot to keep up on. Unable to meet you personally until now, but it is a pleasure. I've heard nothing but great things."
Matt: He sits down in his chair. Allura finds her side of the table and gestures the rest of you.
Matt: "Please, have a seat."
Orion: I stand. I don't sit.
Matt: All right.
Matt: The overeign finishes writing some papers, rolls them up, snaps twice, and a gentleman comes by. He hands him the papers and says,
Matt: "Get this to Lady and Lord Briarwood as soon as possible, thank you."
Matt: "All right. First of all, I want to welcome you all back. It's been a few weeks since we've seen each other. I've been recently given word that you unceremoniously appeared in the center of the Lyceum not but twelve hours ago, worse for wear. So I would like to know, first off, why you've returned in the center of our city. And I want to see how you've all been these past few weeks. I apologize if I'm a bit scattered I’ve had a few things on my mind as of late. But yes, how is Vox Machina."
Liam: If I may. We didn't choose to dump ourselves right in the middle of the city. That was born out of necessity, not out of choice. The task we set out to finish proved a lot more complicated than originally perceived. Frankly, I worry about the safety of the city of Kraghammer. Underneath their home down in the bowels of the earth, I'm don't know how much the council knows about the race of the illithid. We stumbled into a veritable hornets' nest of them below the city.
Matt: Most faces are blank. Allura has her hands on the table, listening intently. As you say illithid, you do notice that Seeker Asum Emring, the halfling, immediately sits back in his chair with a look of 'oh, snap'.
Liam: I see a lot of blank stares at this table. I wasn't very familiar with them either. There is an entire city in the underdark beneath Kraghammer. And... ... in their midst was a beholder that was controlling the entire city. We ended up destroying it, barely escaping with our lives. Fleeing the city... destroying a god? I think.
Laura: I don't think we destroyed the god.
Orion: The beholder is merely a demi-demon.
Laura: Yes, it was something he had possessed, but the god still lives.
Liam: Yes, but Orcus was behind the beholder.
Marisha: We just have the horn.
Liam: We killed K'varn and then he got back up again. He didn't get himself back up.
Marisha: Because Orcus is a god of necromancy and undeath.
Orion: That's what the horn did. It brought him back to life when he would die. That's why I ripped it out when we did it because I knew that's what was going on. That's what the horn does.
Liam: I just worry that it's not just an appliance. It's got hidden in it something --
Orion: It absolutely has -- Remember, it laughed at me when I tried to crush it --
Liam: --is what I'm saying.
Matt: Allura looks at you strangely.
Matt: "Tiberius, you sound different."
Orion: I was talking to --
Matt: I know.
Liam: Be that as it may we riled up a city of --
Taliesin: Mind flayers.
Liam: Buttholes as Tiberius would call them. -- very unhappy race of things below the surface of the earth. Now, we're here today because Tiberius, crafty as he is, was able to flee ahead of us and create a portal back here. We ended up falling ass over tea kettle in the Lyceum, so here we are.
Matt: "Well, welcome back."
Liam: Thank you.
Matt: "It's glad to see you're safe."
Liam: We've brought a little bit of the evil with us.
Matt: At which point the table gets extremely uncomfortable, suddenly. As everyone steps back, Kima steps forward. She's kept to the back at this point, and says,
Matt: "It's all right. I will speak for this group as you also know of their exploits and their abilities. They saved me from what was probably certain death and torture and aided me in stopping what darkness was beneath Kraghammer. At least what we could. But, listen to what they have to say and understand they are as trustworthy as they come."
Matt: At which point the sovereign lifts a hand up to her and says,
Matt: "Well Kima, your word is trusted and I appreciate you also have returned to us healthy. So. What is this evil you bring with you?"
Liam: We have it stored safely away.
Marisha: Yes.
Liam: But this beholder... ... was using an artifact, a horn. Emanating darkness and shit. And Tiberius, in the heat of the battle, ripped it from its pate. And we brought it back with us.
Marisha: It is one of the two horns of Orcus.
Matt: At that notification, you say the name Orcus, and you can see there's a whole energy shift in the room at which point. A lot of furrowed brows drop to intense. The actual air of the room seems to go still for a moment. From what you can see, Seeker Asum and Tofor both grit their teeth and lean forward as you say this. Tofor says, Tofor: "You said Orcus?"
Taliesin: Yes.
Orion: Are you deaf?
Marisha: Tiberius.
Taliesin: Manners.
Liam: We see the apprehension written on your faces and we are nervous as well. But the alternative was leaving the horn with these illithid. Hundreds if not thousands of illithid. We had to make a judgement call rather quickly, and... ... frankly leaving it there with them seemed like it wasn't an option. Tofor: "You've done right in bringing it here. This has to be destroyed. Sent as far away-- If this is indeed an artifact of Orcus, it cannot exist on this plane."
Taliesin: Plans must be drawn up.
Marisha: That's kind of what we thought.
Orion: Yes we knew this already.
Matt: At which point Kima steps forward and says
Matt: "Now, understand this is not something you can lock in a box, or put some guards around it. There was a reason this was forgotten and needs to be again. With the proper surrounding strength and formidable individuals, I can take it to the grand chantry in Osthania where the High Paladin Archibald will reseal it. Far away from the eyes and minds of the world. Lest we can come up with some sort of way to destroy this item."
Matt: At which point the Arbiter, Braum, steps forward. Arbiter Braum: "If you think there's possibly a way to destroy this, we need to discover this here. We cannot allow it outside of the midst of this, to some chaotic winds and whim of the world around us. We have the walls of Emon to keep it safe. Why not take it to the Lyceum."
Liam: I want to make an insight check on the whole table.
Travis: Dang.
Taliesin: I want to also double-check, who was it that handed off the letter to the Briarwoods?
Matt: That was the sovereign.
Taliesin: Sovereign? Thank you.
Matt: So which individual, the Arbiter?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: Okay, Arbiter Braum. What'd you roll?
Liam: Just a ten.
Matt: Ten?
Ashley: Can I insight the seeker?
Matt: Sure.
Matt: What's your insight roll?
Ashley: Thirteen.
Matt: Thirteen? Okay.
Taliesin: I would like to insight the sovereign just because, reasons.
Ashley: Yeah, we do.
Taliesin: One.
Matt: Starting the game off strong guys.
Laura: I think you need some Florida rolling.
Taliesin: I'm just an idiot thinking.
Laura: I think you need some Florida rolling.
Liam: Yeah, I think so too. You're awfully quiet.
Laura: I'm going to insight check as well!
Laura: Because Matt can totally whisper to me if I get this good.
Liam: He'll text you.
Matt: I'll text it to you.
Liam: Roll high.
Laura: Hold on, I'm looking.
Travis: She's rolling.
Laura: Seventeen.
Matt: Eleventeen?
Travis: Seventeen!
Laura: Seventeen!
Matt: A total of 17?
Liam: Eleventy-seven.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: On which individual?
Liam: Which person at the table, sis?
Laura: You.
Liam: Your brother?
Laura: Oh no! On the deep voiced guy!
Ashley: The Arbiter.
Matt: Okay. Arbiter Braum.
Laura: Yes, the arbiter. (all laugh)
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: You!
Liam: Why you gotta be like that, huh?
Matt: I'll say in a general feel about the room, but the arbiter specifically, There is definitely a very quick rising in tension, fear, and adrenaline in the room at this conversation. Fear is the main thing you're getting. I wouldn't say that you sense any deception. You just sense that the stakes have just suddenly jumped from what they were expecting their morning to be. They're trying to wrap their head around it. So nothing too particular catches your shit radar.
Laura: All right.
Travis: We are not leaving the horn here.
Laura: No..
Taliesin: We would have to leave you here.
Matt: As Grog speaks up for the Arbiter, he says, Arbiter Braum: "I'm not saying we leave it here. I'm saying that while we have it here, we have it studied. Bring it to the Lyceum. The headmaster and his entire research facility could possibly find a way to destroy it. There is no finer arcane focus than that lyceum in the city. They're responsible for the construction of our sky ships. And the crystals that keep them elevated."
Orion: I love skyships.
Laura: I believe the power would be too great. It will corrupt. People will want to take it for themselves. Arbiter Braum: "Then it has to be taken elsewhere and sealed. Like Kima was requesting."
Marisha: So you're saying essentially our two options are we can either keep it here and study it to try and figure out a way to destroy it and have all of the risks of this horn being inside the city or we take the other massive risks of trying to ship it off somewhere and hope that it gets sealed away?
Matt: At which point, Tofor the female dragonborn sits up in her chair and says, Tofor: "Regardless. It should not stay here in my opinion. Understand the longer it resides within Emon, the more word will spread. And more despots will be drawn to our city to claim it. Do you wish to have all the darkness of this land slowly swarm in on the city?"
Liam: I think we're of a like mind.
Orion: Yes.
Liam: I think we should take it from the city.
Marisha: I think it's a giant target on our backs right now.
Orion: I turn to the Arbiter.
Orion: There is something that you should know. During our battle with K'varn, which was the name of the beholder, which the horn resided upon its head. When I ripped it from its head, I held it in the telekinesis state. I attempted to crush it for not knowing what it was at first. Just knowing it was bringing creatures back to life. When I attempted to do so, I heard somewhat of a laughter in the back of my mind. I fear whatever this is attached to might be aware, or if anything, more aware than it was previously. I'm not sure if it was alerted by being placed on the beholder's head to begin with, but I heard something.
Orion: Looking at Tofor.
Orion: I agree with the peasant. That we should get it out of here immediately.
Matt: At which point the sovereign who's been kinda quiet this moment, says,
Matt: "Well. Best I can tell at this point, it should not stay in Emon. We've had enough trouble in this city and enough issues here that we're having to deal with in the aftermath of the attack on my family. We do not have the mental will nor the ability to withstand any sort of assault either from the inside or the outside of the city. If we are to take it elsewhere I trust the opinion of you, of Kima, and Allura."
Matt: At which point Allura takes a moment and says,
Matt: "Just the knowledge of such a thing existing, let alone two, in this world is dangerous. Who knows what horrors an individual could achieve should they find both horns. Now, wherever this gets taken, the knowledge that all of us know that these exist now, and anyone else beyond this, means that that's a leak. That's a weakness. Now I've heard of some magics that can erase selective memories permanently. Ancient magics."
Matt: At which point as she starts saying this, the rest of the room shifts uncomfortably. You can see Tofor begins to raise her hand to protest. Allura shuts her down and says,
Matt: "But, I'd not employ these unless they were absolutely necessary. I need to speak with the Arcana Pentsafocal and see if this is such a strange and necessary circumstance to allow the use of such magics. That will take me some time to get the entire conclave to agree, but I think it's possible. It may be the only way, if we can not destroy this, to make sure that the rest of this world never knows that it existed. I think that's the safest route. As for getting it out of the city I feel that we have two individuals here, two followers of Bahamut, both the deity that saw the deity, brought the vision to Kima, and presented, whether in a roundabout way, the power and strength of these individuals to eventually retrieve it and prevent it from being an artifact that instrumentally destroyed the dwarven city and quite possibly all of Tal'Dorei. So I think if there was a god whose guidance we can look into, I would put my trust in the clergy of Bahamut."
Matt: She looks to Kima. Kima nods her head.
Orion: Of course we'd agree with such sentiments as well.
Matt: Kima raises her maul and says,
Matt: Well then, if that's to be the case, "I'll send word over to the rest of my temple. We'll send over our finest paladins, clerics, and guardians. Prepare a box for travel. We'll take it across the sea. Then we shall seal this bastard."
Orion: Kima.
Travis: Yeah! Oh. Sorry. (all laugh)
Orion: Kima, when you do approach your king, propose because Orcus's horn is pure black evil, perhaps the side of light can help as well. The blessing of Sarenrae and other light sources, divine powers, could be helpful as well.
Matt: "The horn will remain here until the vessel is brought over. But we have holy vessels specifically designed for the keeping of remains or things that are of great evil. We would gladly welcome the blessing of something from Sarenrae as well. After all, there is nothing wrong with more positive energy instilled to maintain such a negative force."
Marisha: I personally don't trust this horn travelling anywhere without at least one of our supervision.
Matt: At which point the sovereign speaks up and says,
Matt: "And to be completely honest, we are very grateful you've brought the horn here. But you are a motley crew. Who is to say any of you are also immune to this corruption as well? Who's to say you eight carry the mental willpower to withstand this darkness any better than a group of paladins designed and trained their entire lives to withstand and destroy this evil. What assurance do I have that your attachment to nature will not become some dark, brambled, twisted, thing in the proximity of this artifact? None. Just keep that in mind."
Orion: I look to the group and do this to Scanlan. (all laugh)
Taliesin: Taking quite advantage of his current state of mind.
Orion: You have no idea what I'm going to do for the rest of this game.
Travis: You literally do that to Scanlan. Like you... to Scanlan?
Orion: No, I was pointing at him.
Liam: Right in the ear.
Matt: Wet willy. To our little gnome bard.
Orion: (laughs)
Matt: We miss you Sam.
Matt: Uriel looks around.
Matt: "Well, given the circumstance I would say that our best bet now is to have Kima and Tofor reach out to the grand chambers of Bahamut. Have them bring a vessel and seal it somewhere that they find fit for an object of this dark presence. Is the council in agreement of this? Unless some other, better means arises. How long will it take for this vessel to arrive?"
Matt: At which point, Kima scratches her chin for a second.
Matt: "By the fastest ships, especially if we're using some of your fancy sky dinghies. I can't imagine more than two weeks?"
Marisha: Two weeks?!
Matt: At which point --
Orion: That's 14 days, your highness.
Marisha: (sighs)
Laura: That was adorable.
Ashley: A fortnight?
Matt: At which point Allura stands forward and says,
Matt: "It's in the means of --"
Marisha: You guys don't have any holy ships here. You don't have like a ship dock?
Orion: I'm sure if they did they would probably use that one.
Taliesin: But I'm using it. (all laugh)
Matt: At this point Allura sits forward and to the rest of the group, says,
Matt: "To be fair Kima, in my experience and knowledge, ships function well for the movement of goods and large objects. The speed of this requires some expediting and I happen to have a friend who is over in Osthania, probably not far from your clergy. Perhaps we can facilitate a two-day travel?"
Matt: At which point the group leans back for a second and Kima goes,
Matt: "Well fine. Yeah, I guess."
Matt: Shoots a dirty look a little bit to --
Marisha: Can I do an insight check on Allura really quick?
Matt: Sure.
Liam: She's saying a ship will be ready in two days or take two days to travel?
Matt: Allura's saying,
Matt: "Depending on the size of this vessel, why do we even need a ship? We have the ability to transport between the cities. If we can pool our resources, there's no reason why we can't bring them here nearly instantaneously."
Marisha: Thirteen.
Matt: Thirteen? Best you can tell, Allura's really hard to read. She keeps up her smile but she definitely has her intense face on. She's deep in the moment. No real gives one way or the other. The rest of the group looks around and Arcanist in the silence goes,
Matt: "Well then, I think that me and Kima and Tofor, if you'd like, we can designate a way of bringing this relic container as fast as possible so we can get this going. I wish not to keep this within our presence much longer. Do we agree to that?"
Orion: Yes.
Taliesin: Yes.
Liam: I think we would feel comfortable going along for the ride and seeing this thing through to the end.
Matt: She glances over to the sovereign. The sovereign nods.
Matt: "Very well. Very well, I'll allow it. I may have some business for you coming soon so try not to be gone too long. Although this is much more important business, I do agree."
Matt: Then he gives a laugh and smile to raise a bit of levity in the room that nobody seems to respond to.
Matt: "But nevertheless if you wish to travel and see this through I don't see there would be any complaint."
Matt: He looks to Lady Kima and Kima says,
Matt: "No, not at all. We've gotten along swimmingly so far. Mostly. Very well. I'm bad at this political stuff."
Matt: Kima steps back a little bit, Kima: "I defer to the rest of you."
Matt: Puts her maul on the ground and awkwardly looks away. The sovereign goes,
Matt: "Very well. It is settled. Reach out to your clergy. Bring the vessel. Allura, facilitate its arrival. We will get this artifact as far away from Emon as possible. This is adjourned. Thank you all very much for coming to this council meeting."
Marisha: Okay.
Taliesin: I'm going to catch the sovereign on his way out.
Matt: All right. At which point everyone gathers the rest of their papers, their parchments, they're rolling up scrolls. The Arbiter gets up and lumbers his way out of the room. The seeker, Asum, steps up to the rest of you with a final handshake.
Matt: "A pleasure to meet you all, once again, I've heard so much. You're doing fine work."
Matt: He seems strangely nervous. But in a weird way, he's a gentle hint of fanboy.
Travis: Oh.
Laura: I wink at him. (all laugh)
Matt: He slyly winks back on his way out.
Matt: As he exits, Tofor stands up. You've only seen her sitting since you arrived. As Tofor stands in her female dragonborn form, she is probably a good solid foot taller than Tiberius. And is a thick musclebound dragonborn paladin of Bahamut. Her armor shifts as she stands, she begins to make her way towards the door, not even with a glance in your direction.
Orion: That means she's as tall as you, Grog.
Travis: What?
Orion: She's as tall as you.
Marisha: I just whisper to Tiberius and say,
Marisha: Are all the ladies that big in Draconia?
Orion: It all depends. Not really.
Matt: She's bigger than usual.
Orion: She's a wretched peasant so I can not.
Marisha: That's so mean.
Liam: That's a little harsh.
Matt: Allura stands up and begins to leave. The sovereign stands up and as he stands up the guards come out and they come to his side.
Taliesin: Good Sovereign, if I can have a moment? Did I hear correctly that Lord and Lady Briarwood were in town?
Matt: "They were but a week ago."
Taliesin: They were but a week ago? And they've left, have they?
Matt: "Yes. Do you know of Lord and Lady Briarwood?"
Taliesin: Just in passing. Did they have business in town? Was there something in particular? I'm just curious. It doesn't really matter. I mean it does matter but not particularly.
Matt: "It was relatively routine, we're establishing an official trade route through the northeast. Spanning the Boreal Plane to Whitestone."
Taliesin: Oh.
Matt: "They inherited the region after the unfortunate demise of the Derolo family."
Taliesin: Yes.
Matt: "However our ambassador has noted that they've rebuilt rather well and honored the memory of the family and they're really committed to reestablishing the foothold of Whitestone in the north. So they came here on a diplomatic mission to open trade."
Taliesin: That's nice. I would love to. Please, keep it quiet, but if I could be notified if they're coming through again. I would like very much to surprise them, if that would be possible.
Orion: Am I standing next to Percy? Am I hearing this?
Matt: Yes.
Orion: Good.
Taliesin: It's just old business. It would be very interesting to see them again.
Matt: For the sake of this conversation, I'm going to ask you to roll a deception check.
Taliesin: Okay. Natural 20.
Marisha: (cheers)
Orion: (claps)
Marisha: On the new pretty die.
Taliesin: Don't fuck with me.
Matt: The Sovereign gives you a look and says,
Matt: "Certainly. Very well, I will notify you should they come through again."
Taliesin: Deeply honored by your thought, sir. Thank you.
Orion: At the end of this conversation I'm going to rip off a piece of the scroll of telescription and I'm going to approach.
Orion: When you do, all you do is write the message to this and we will receive it. It's an enchanted parchment. I will receive the message.
Matt: He tells you,
Matt: "I know how these work. Yes, thank you."
Matt: As you present it, he walks by and one of his guards takes it from you and gives you a nod.
Matt: They exit the chambers. You guys are escorted out into the main hallway of the palace.
Ashley: Bye!
Matt: The rest of the council
Matt: The rest of the council scatters amongst the palace proper. You are all left. The doors close behind you and the echoing hallways towards the central left side of the palace.
Taliesin: (sighs)
Marisha: Percy.
Taliesin: I'm fine.
Ashley: Are you okay?
Marisha: You're sweating.
Taliesin: I know.
Ashley: Are you okay?
Marisha: Why are you sweating?
Taliesin: It's hot.
Marisha: What happened?
Taliesin: Nothing. The sun comes up and it gets very hot. I'll tell you later.
Orion: Very good.
Taliesin: This is discussion for later. There's more important things.
Matt: Kima and Allura are near you. At which point, Kima looks at the rest of you and says,
Matt: "I apologize, I have to figure this out now. So I'm going to head to the nearest temple of Bahamut and see if we could reach out quickly."
Marisha: What should we do?
Matt: That's up to you.
Matt: She looks to Allura, questioning Allura.
Matt: "In the event of this blessed chamber arriving, you will be notified. We will request your presence to bring the artifact in question, seal it, and then we will begin our journey over to its place of hopeful destruction and/or proper banishment."
Ashley: Would you like anyone to go with you or you just want to go alone?
Matt: "To?"
Ashley: To work out the details of all of this?
Matt: Allura says,
Matt: "For me, it's just preparation of the arcane transference ritual. I'm going to go meet with a friend of mine over in Ostania."
Taliesin: I will say we haven't replenished our potions yet. And we could go --
Ashley: Should we go to visit our old friend?
Marisha: Gilmore?
Taliesin: We could go to Gilmore's.
Marisha: Gilmore?
Ashley: Gilmore?
Taliesin: We could go to Gilmore's.
Ashley: Gilmore's Glorious Goods?
Marisha: You essentially want us to wait?
Matt: "Whatever business you need to get done. It should take no more than two days to get this taken care of."
Marisha: You guys, we have a weekend! (all laugh)
Liam: This is Allura and Kima who are here?
Matt: Yeah, they're the only two who have stayed behind with you guys outside of the council chambers.
Liam: I take Pike by the hand and I walk over to Kima. And they're short so I kneel down. I say to the both of them.
Liam: I've never pretended to be a man of the cloth, I know little of the gods. But the brush we had down below has left me shaken. What can the gods tell us? The gods stick their noses into our doings whenever it pleases them. Are they not here? Have they anything to say for what is happening now?
Marisha: I'm with this guy! High five Vax.
Matt: At which point-- did you wish to respond in any way?
Ashley: Well, I just know that I tried to have a response from my god down below and she didn't really respond the way I would have liked for her to. But maybe things will be different. What were you going to say?
Matt: At which point Kima looks to you, at what you just said with curious worry.
Matt: "Well, if what you say is your faith has been shaken, there is always room at the temple of Bahamut to find redemption, strength, and guidance. You realize the platinum --"
Marisha: She's trying to get you to come to her church.
Matt: (laughs)
Ashley: She's trying to convert.
Marisha: She's trying to convert! Get the leaflet.
Matt: "The platinum dragon has guided much of civilization's growth, expansion, and survival for thousands of years. The eternal battle between him and the darkness that is Tiamat and the chaos beyond that --"
Marisha: With all due respect, Kima, I don't think that was Vax's question.
Matt: "To get to the point, I apologize. The gods are many and the gods have been at war for as long as we exist. There are some that believe we are nothing but the aftermath of their squabbles. But nevertheless, there is much good in this world that guides us to our ultimate destiny. And if you yourself ever feel that you are lost amongst this chaos, don't ever be afraid to stop in and ask a few questions."
Liam: I was just wondering if I could ask you to ask them, to maybe help. I would never think to ask the gods for help if I wanted a shiny new sword or pile of riches, but this is something different.
Travis: Unless they could get us a pile of riches.
Laura: Or a shining sword.
Liam: Good boy. (all laugh)
Matt: At which point Kima laughs to herself.
Matt: "There are benefits to being of the order."
Matt: Kima who does not have an accent and did not say it that way. Too many NPCs in my head right now. She says,
Matt: "But, understand. Whenever I felt lost, which was often. It's good to have that guiding warmth to turn to. And sometimes it brings you into a subterranean mountain being tortured by dwarves. Sometimes it guides you to new friends and allies. Strange the way the gods work. But, when you put your all into it, they've kept me alive so far."
Ashley: That's a really good point. I guess that's a positive way to look at it.
Marisha: I really like long walks in the forest when I'm feeling disconnected.
Ashley: That works too, you know.
Travis: Lady Kima, do the gods allow you to have relationships?
Matt: Kima, you ask this and she gives you a look of confusion, and then… She already a darker complexion for a halfling but her cheeks grow noticeably ruddier. She averts her gaze and says,
Matt: "Well..."
Travis: I start trying to do my best Vax wink.
Laura: I'm Vex.
Travis: --Vex wink. (all laugh)
Matt: She averts her gaze and goes,
Matt: "Well, as far as I know it is not a vow of chastity within the order."
Travis: So you're saying there's a chance.
Matt: She still is looking away. She looks away and looks to the rest of you. Looks to Allura. Looks to you again. And then goes,
Matt: "I really have to get to work on this."
Taliesin: You did this.
Matt: "I really have to get to work on this."
Matt: She leaves the group and continues down the hallway. Quick steps.
Ashley: Bye, Kima! Quick steps.
Liam: A lot of math involved in that equation.
Marisha: Yeah...
Matt: Allura chuckles to herself and steps into the place where she was and goes,
Orion: I care not to solve the puzzle.
Matt: "Oh, as a note. Be careful who you ask those questions to, you may get an earful."
Matt: And Allura smiles and motions towards Kima.
Matt: "Don't get me wrong, you're more than welcome to explore as you like, but that's a rabbit hole my friend."
Travis: A rabbit hole, is that what we're calling it these days?
Matt: You feel a gentle slap from some unknown arcane force across your cheek Grog. And Allura gives you a stern glare.
Marisha: Oh, don't talk about her girl that way.
Liam: Don't make me take my earrings off.
Matt: Anyway.
Matt: "So two days. We'll call for you when the item is to be transferred and properly brought to its destination. In the meantime, prepare as you see fit, enjoy this well-earned rest, and we'll take it from there. I have much travel to do myself. See you all very soon."
Matt: She begins to step up the hallway. As she steps up the hallway, you can see there's a light yellowish glow about her form. Then with a sudden flash of white light, Allura's just gone.
Marisha: So guys. I'm thinking we take a local tour of all the historical highlights of Emon. We've never really gone sightseeing, Then maybe we can catch a nice dinner in the city tonight.
Laura: Oh, look at the time.
Travis: Oh, it's getting so late.
Marisha: It's 1pm. We've got the whole day
Taliesin: It feels like eight. It really feels so late.
Marisha: I picked up one of these pamphlets while we were in the palace and apparently there's a nice natural history museum.
Taliesin: Gilmore's? Gilmore's?
Orion: Your highness, what is a pam-phlet?
Taliesin: Gilmore's?
Orion: Oh, a lot of paper.
Taliesin: I'll be at Gilmore's.
Orion: Oh, it's like a mini book!
Marisha: It's like a tiny scroll.
Orion: It has pictures!
Marisha: Yes!
Orion: Look, Percy!
Taliesin: I'm already heading towards Gilmore's.
Liam: I'm following Percy.
Travis: We're going to Gilmore's, too.
Matt: All right. You guys exit and find your way, exiting the palace and the cloudtop district to make your way to Abedar's Promenade to enter and reunite with your good friend Gilmore.
Matt: We're going to take this moment to take a break, use the restroom, get some food.
Taliesin: We're at two? Are we at two more?
Zac: Giveaway time!
Matt: Oh, it's giveaway time. (Background: Snuggle Lord, Snuggle Lord) All right, we hit our next giveaway so we'll do that first. All right, we hit our next giveaway so we'll do that first. (Background: Snuggle Lord, Snuggle Lord) All right, so we have --
Matt: Oh no.
Marisha: Snuggle Lord?!
Marisha: It's a Snuggle Lord variant!
Taliesin: Snuggle Lord, Snuggle Lord.
Liam: There he is. (all cheer)
Marisha: Snuggle Lord has returned!
Matt: There you go, there is Snuggle Lord in his glory.
Marisha: No, not the horns of Orcus!
Orion: No, now he has the power! (all laugh)
Zac: We hit our second giveaway. (all cheer)
Zac: We're going to give one of these away. All you have to do is be active in the chat room, guys. So, if you're watching full screen, get out of full screen, be active. She can't see it, can she?
Matt: No, she can see it though.
Marisha: Can't see.
Marisha: Can you see it? Gotta tilt it down a bit.
Laura: There we go, it's so cute.
Zac: All right guys be active in the chat room. We're going to let these guys take a break. When we come back from the break, we'll announce the winner.
Marisha: Do we have a word?
Zac: Oh yeah, go for it.
Marisha: Here we'll use the word KommissarProps in the chat room.
Zac: I'll have to go set it up. Okay, I gotta run.
Matt: Go set it up. So hold that thought, until he starts it. The word will be KommissarProps.
Marisha: Say KommissarProps and definitely go follow Kai on Instagram and on Facebook
Matt: These horns will be yours. and definitely go follow Kai on Instagram and on Facebook and definitely go follow Kai on Instagram and on Facebook because he was awesome enough to make these horns for us. So Instagram and Facebook, that's where all the pretty pictures are.
Matt: You yourself can be corrupted by the evil of Orcus.
Marisha: You yourself can be corrupted if you go and find him.
Taliesin: Watch him while he sleeps.
Matt: You and RhymesWithOrange can be the two keepers of the two horns of Orcus and bring ruin to the entire world of Exandria. So that could be you. Anyway, we're taking a break. We'll see you guys back here in a little over ten minutes and we'll continue as they head towards… Gilmore's Glorious Goods.
Taliesin: Gilmore's!
Matt: All right, I gotta prepare. See you soon guys.
Matt: Hey guys, welcome back. We’re about to get in some game time again here in a second, but first we have our second winner to win the second horn of Orcus for the evening’s giveaway. We’re really excited to announce the winner of the second player’s handbook signed by the group, the dice kit, as well as this horn, is Ember72.
Matt: Ember72, congratulations.
Travis: Ember72!
Matt: You get to have this one. It’s awesome, really stoked. We now have both of these horns given away. And while these are the only horns of Orcus that’ll be out there, our fantastic propmaster over here, Kai, Kommissar Props, will be working with us in the future to do more Critical Role-based prop giveaways. And once again, definitely check out his work, he’s an amazing fabricator and propmaster.
Ashley: Those are the only two? he’s an amazing fabricator and propmaster.
Matt: These are the only two that’re gonna go out.
Taliesin: They’re the only two in the world.
Ashley: That’s really special.
Taliesin: They’re the only two in the world.
Zac: At 3600 we’ll do the starter kit, t-shirt --
Ashley: That sounded insincere, but I really meant it.
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: That did sound insincere.
Matt: We’ll see somewhere down the road. If we want to put out more stuff, we’ll see. But right now these are just an exclusive giveaway. Excited for those two guys. So everyone once again for Rhymeswithorange and Ember72, congratulations on those bits.
Marisha: Or maybe if you follow Kommissar Props, we’ll do another giveaway to the people who follow him.
Matt: Helping friends out because they do awesome work. Congratulations on that. If we can get to 3600 we’re gonna be doing some dance after the show, so hopefully we can hit that subscriber number tonight.
Zac: Plus giveaway.
Matt: Plus giveaway. Plus the signed t-shirt, the dice box, starter kit, so.
Matt: Good stuff. All right, bringing us back to the game.
Ashley: Gilmore!
Matt: So you guys, you make your way outside of the Castletop District into the center of Emon proper. Returning to Abedar’s Promenade, which is the largest central section of the city, where most of the merchantile itself seems to have gathered and been a serious conglomerate where all business in this city happens. Those who would like a quick little visual idea of the city, this is Emon.
Matt: Right there. It’s a small little -- --there is an amazing printout of this that they’ve, actually Laura and Travis, have framed and put up in their room sometime. We’ll have to go ahead and bring on the show and show you guys.
Laura: We’re gonna bring it to put on the set. At some point.
Matt: Yeah, we’ll have it too. Anyway, the Castletop District is here, the inner portion. You guys have made your way out south to the Central District and then towards Abedar’s Promenade, which is right over here. So you guys would’ve gone this way, actually. So you’re out to Abedar’s Promenade in the far eastern side of Emon, where you eventually find your way to the outskirts of your favorite purveyor of arcane mystical artifacts.
Marisha: Gilmore!
Matt: Shaun Gilmore himself.
Marisha: Shaun Gilmore.
Matt: So as you guys --
Ashley: Is that his first name?
Marisha: I didn’t know Shaun was his first name either.
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: I didn’t know Shaun was his first name either.
Taliesin: You’ve not been paying attention.
Matt: Shaun Gilmore, but you’ve always called him Gilmore.
Marisha: We’re on a first-name basis now, guys.
Matt: No one’s on a first-name basis with Gilmore.
Marisha: We are.
Matt: Gilmore is Gilmore.
Marisha: Except for maybe Vax over there.
Matt: Except for maybe, maybe Vax.
Matt: So at this point now you’re pushing about two in the afternoon. It’s extremely busy, you can hear the clopping of horse hooves on the ground, people are walking past. You’d swear as you’re stepping through the city, maybe a handful of people tend to stop and watch you guys walk through, stunned. Almost like they’d seen a celebrity on the street, as the most recent makeup of the Winter’s Crest festival was a celebration of you being the heroes who saved the city of Emon and the sovereign and his family. Apparently you are now recognizable within the city of Emon.
Liam: My sister winks.
Travis: Yeah we are.
Matt: All right, so Vax wills Vex to wink. Vex, do you accept this wink from your brother?
Laura: I do.
Matt: All right.
Laura: Other way.
Matt: Perfect, there you go.
Laura: Just a little more.
Matt: Perfect. We’ve lined it up. As you walk across the main thoroughfare, you make your way to the wide but single-story building that is Gilmore’s Glorious Goods. Of all the various shades of brown and red and brick that makes up all these buildings, Gilmore’s Glorious Goods is presented in fine, deep blue and purple fabric and a paint scheme that would look like the worst funhouse to enter. Worst or best, depending on your opinion. The entranceway is not a door but a series of hanging beads and large cloth drapes that are gently falling to be brushed aside as you enter. It’s not as big as you remember, or recall, seemingly. But as you step through the front door you remember why. Much like the TARDIS, the interior of Gilmore’s Goods is bigger on the inside. There is a magical enchantment based within this building where the interior is actually a two-story and much larger place of business. Immediately the smells of incense and fine perfumes assault your nose --
Travis: Ugh! fine perfumes assault your nose --
Matt: Like a terrible medieval Sephora.
Liam: Like coming home.
Ashley: Medieval Sephora.
Matt: A series of magically flickering ever-burning candles adorn sconces along the walls. You can see there are glass cases set out in the center of the room, there is the long wooden bar on the far end which has itself its own beaded curtain that is closed, and there are three employees of Gilmore’s Glorious Goods in their ceremonial blue and purple robes that match the exterior, staring about while there a number of other possible customers that are looking about. There are numerous bookshelves along the walls. You can see there is, next to the stairway on the far left side of this floor, there is an herbalist who specializes in dried herbs and sales in that regard. You haven't been to the upstairs yet in this complex. But you now are standing back in the comfortable, although slightly offensive to your senses, interior of Gilmore's Glorious Goods.
Liam: I'm scanning the entire store for him. I want to find him.
Matt: He's not currently visible.
Liam: Oh! He's not here?
Matt: He's not visible. Not in the main room.
Liam: All right.
Ashley: He has his private office.
Laura: Brother.
Ashley: He has his private office.
Liam: Yes?
Laura: You should get that evil Clarota helmet checked out and see what all good it does us.
Liam: What, this one?
Laura: Yep. That one.
Liam: Yes.
Marisha: Vax.
Liam: Yes?
Marisha: I say you'd be the point man here.
Liam: I think so.
Orion: I would agree.
Ashley: I think that's a really good plan.
Taliesin: I second that notion. Quintuple it.
Marisha: Yeah. The twinsies should go.
Liam: Start looking around. Start shopping. Don't pay for anything yet, because I have an arrangement.
Ashley: He can get a little discount.
Laura: He can get a little wink, wink, nudge, nudge discount.
Marisha: I go up to Vax. I put my hands on his shoulders, and I say,
Marisha: You got this.
Marisha: And I cast Enhance Ability on him.
Ashley: Yeah.
Marisha: For charisma? I'm assuming?
Liam: Let's make my hair even glossier than it already is.
Marisha: And I give him a little bit of the dad thumb.
Liam: I know that thumb.
Marisha: Yeah.
Travis: The dad thumb?
Marisha: Wipe the morning breakfast off of him before I send him on to school.
Matt: (laughs quietly)
Marisha: And I give him a little love tap on his behind and send him on his way.
Ashley: Send him on his merry way.
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: Shoulder massage.
Matt: All righty. So?
Marisha: So you have advantage rolls on all charisma rolls.
Liam: Is there a front desk?
Orion: (package crinkling)
Liam: Is there a front desk?
Matt: On the far back side, there is a very long, well-crafted dark wood desk that is adorned with what looks like small alchemical components, (package crinkling) with what looks like small alchemical components, glass tubing and -- (package crinkling) Be a little louder with those Red Vines.
Orion: Sorry. Do you want one?
Matt: I'm good, thank you.
Ashley: (laughs)
Matt: We're good. You can see there are a number of glass containers and small corked vials --
Liam: I'm sorry, he's looking for Gilmore.
Marisha: (laughs)
Liam: They're going to flirt together.
Matt: (laughs)
Orion: It's like watching a movie.
Marisha: (giggles)
Liam: Sorry.
Matt: It's all right. There are some books stacked up. There is a small, embedded glass case that seems to have a couple of items that are under a purplish-maroon, velvet piece of material that's currently covering them. There is that beaded curtain with strips of material that block the back room.
Liam: Okay, and there's a person manning the --
Matt: No, not currently. It is just an empty desk.
Liam: Is there a bell or anything?
Matt: There is a bell.
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: As you hit the bell, one of the employees who is helping somebody looks around and goes,
Matt: "I'm sorry."
Matt: What you see is a half-elven woman with thick spectacles who is currently stepping over to try and stop you. However, the beaded curtain swishes open with the grandiose gesture of one slightly meaty hand. Stepping out in his fine, gold-trimmed, purple robes, his longish thick, black, coarse hair pulled into a nice ponytail. Smoothly-shaved face with a slight hint of a braided goatee that dangles about three inches from his chin.
Liam: Will you remind me because it's been a while. Gilmore's a good-looking man, though, isn't he?
Matt: Yeah. He's handsome.
Liam: Yeah.
Marisha: Is the braid new? Is that a new addition?
Laura: He's so handsome, Vax.
Marisha: The braid's new. He decided to rock the braid. Go for it!
Matt: Gilmore's a very handsome gentleman. I would say he's not fit and muscular. He is a handsome, comfortably jovial gentleman.
Liam: I'm picturing Jeremy Irons in a wizard robe.
Matt: Kind of. Imagine him with a little more paunch.
Liam: Okay.
Matt: But very charismatic. Open chest to his vest, with a number of gold chains and medallions that dangle around.
Liam: I feel you.
Matt: It's almost like a wizard's track suit. (all laugh)
Liam: You ruined it for me, man!
Taliesin: And it's dead.
Marisha: Please tell me it says "arcane" on the butt?
Matt: No. (all laugh)
Matt: He's very well-dressed, but his presentation is definitely a presentation. As the hand swishes open, he goes,
Matt: "I'm sorry, was I being summoned?"
Orion: Yes.
Matt: He immediately looks and goes,
Matt: "Oh. You've returned."
Liam: Gilmore, you glorious bastard. How have you been?
Matt: He immediately rushes to the edge and leans over the counter to give you a grandiose hug and actually lifts you off your feet. Much stronger than you anticipated. He goes,
Matt: "Oh, Vax'ahlia. It's been far too long."
Matt: He sets you down next to him behind the counter and gives you a big hug, his strong wizard arms around you. A scent of what's almost like fine herbs with a hint of patchouli enters your nose.
Taliesin: (laughs)
Liam: You naughty man. You just called me by my sister's name. That is going to cost you.
Marisha: (gasps)
Matt: "I said Vax! What do you mean?"
Liam: I heard "Vex'ahlia." That's ridiculous. Preposterous. Can we go to the videotape? Anyone?
Marisha: Instant replay!
Orion: Actually, Vax, he was correct. He said your name correctly. I believe you owe him a little something now.
Marisha: I think it was a little bit of combination. A little bit of column A, a little bit of column B. I think he called you Vex'ahlia.
Liam: Water under the bridge.
Marisha: Or Vax'ahlia, is what he called you.
Orion: He called you Vax'ahlia, which I call you in my sleep.
Liam: Shut up, you.
Liam: I lean in.
Matt: He looks genuinely perturbed and embarrassed by the whole circumstance.
Matt: "I --"
Liam: I lean in. I pat him on the hand.
Liam: Don't you worry. We have come from far and away. You would not believe the shit we have been through, but I don't want to talk about me. I want to talk about you. What has been going on in this city since we've been gone?
Matt: "Well."
Matt: And he looks about the rest of you and says,
Matt: "Obviously you've brought the rest of your friends here. Come, sit! Story time, story time!" (all laugh)
Matt: "Please sit around."
Orion: Fantastic.
Matt: "We have been doing marvelously. Trade has opened up wide in Emon. We've had travelers from all over Tal'Dorei and beyond. It's incredible." (all giggle)
Matt: "I'm in the process of planning an expansion to another town. Perhaps even --"
Laura: Oh, my.
Matt: "--perhaps even opening a second store in Westruun."
Marisha: You're going to own a chain?
Orion: Congratulations!
Matt: "Perhaps."
Orion: This is a big step for any businessman.
Taliesin: Spectacular.
Matt: "But yes. No, I have been able to take on two more arcanists. We've been in the process of designing some more interesting, wondrous items. We have stocked many of our recent possible and available items. We are doing quite well for ourselves."
Orion: Are you looking for investors, Gilmore?
Matt: "I technically am your investor, in a way."
Orion: Oh.
Laura: He is.
Marisha: True, we are sponsored by him.
Matt: "But. If you have the money in which to sponsor our business, that's a whole other discussion."
Orion: I just wanted you to talk to me for a little bit. Vax, take it away.
Matt: "Dragonborn. But yes! How about yourselves? You look like you've --"
Matt: He gives you all a look over.
Matt: "--like you've maybe not slept in a fortnight."
Liam: Well. We're lucky we're not dead. It came close a couple of times. We were off on official business for the emperor. We've been underground for weeks and weeks. We've only seen the sun for a couple of days.
Matt: "Oh. That kind of a weekend. I know how that goes."
Liam: Needless to say, our stores are terribly depleted. We are going to need to stock up a bit before we head out of town again. I don't want to rush things, though. I think my friends probably want to shop about. My sister can probably handle things for me. I would love to take a stroll with you around the city. Get a bit of lunch, a bite, and hear about what's been happening. Hear the rumors of town. We all know nobody matches your shrewdness in business. That's no surprise.
Matt: (chuckles)
Liam: But I'm wondering what you've heard. What's on the wind? Can you take the afternoon off?
Matt: He looks over at the same half-elven woman who was trying to stop you earlier. She gives a look like, 'what's he going to say?' No one's ever asked him this question. He goes,
Matt: "For you? Of course." (all laugh)
Marisha: Man date. Go for it!
Laura: Don't worry, Gilmore. We'll take wonderful care of your employees.
Matt: "Well if you wish to do business, why not do that now?"
Laura: We need to shop around first, of course.
Matt: "Very well."
Taliesin: And we're so curious as to any of these interesting and fascinating things that you've developed in the several weeks it's been since we've been here. We'd love to see what you've been working on.
Matt: "Very well. Sherri!"
Matt: The same woman, her shoulders droop.
Matt: "Yes, Gilmore?" (all laugh)
Matt: "Would you be so kind as to see to whatever our friends need? These are Vox Machina, by the way. They are currently sponsored by Gilmore's Glorious Goods, Inc, and I would very much like to make sure that they are taken care of."
Matt: "Yes, sir. I'll make sure that happens."
Matt: (laugh)
Taliesin: (laugh)
Matt: "So. Shall we?"
Liam: I think this will take a while. Let's.
Laura: Have a wonderful time, brother.
Liam: I look to my sister as we go.
Liam: Just get what I need, will you?
Laura: Of course.
Liam: Thank you.
Liam: And stroll out the door with Gilmore. Have at it, ladies and gentlemen.
Travis: Yes!
Marisha: We'll leave dinner on the stove for you.
Matt: So Sherri looks at the rest of you as they leave and goes,
Matt: "So you're all friends of Gilmore, then?"
Marisha: Yes.
Ashley: Business friends.
Matt: Business friends. All right.
Marisha: We're mutual fans of one another, if you will.
Matt: She adjusts her glasses.
Matt: "Then let's continue with the business. What are you seeking? What do you need? What are you looking for?"
Orion: I don't know. We like all kinds of things.
Marisha: Well, we definitely need potions.
Matt: "Potions. Those we can provide."
Marisha: Health potions.
Matt: "Health potions, yes. Potions of healing can be provided."
Marisha: What do you have right now?
Matt: She goes behind the counter for a second and ruffles through some stuff. Goes in the back room and comes back out with a wooden crate, pretty much. You hear the glass jangling inside as she moves it and sets it on the counter with a ting. They all eventually come to rest. She goes,
Matt: "All right, looking through here, it looks like we have about 12 regular potions of healing. We have six of greater healing. And it looks like three of superior healing."
Ashley: What's the price on the superior healing, again?
Orion: We'll take the lot.
Ashley: What's the price on the superior healing, again?
Ashley: What's the price on the superior healing, again?
Matt: "Superior healing? Let's see, currently those go for about --"
Matt: She looks at the price book, going through.
Matt: "Those will run you --"
Matt: As I go through my price book.
Ashley: We are sponsored.
Taliesin: We do keep getting turned to stone. This has been a problem, and it's been sticking around a bit. I feel like we should maybe take some precautions for the inevitable next time this happens.
Matt: "That will be 1500 gold pieces per superior."
Marisha: Is that with our sponsorship prices?
Matt: "Right, you mentioned you're sponsored. That would be a 10% discount. That would bring it to about 1350, should you wish to purchase them individually."
Ashley: Okay.
Travis: I definitely need one of those.
Laura: Wait. How much if we're purchasing them individually?
Matt: "1350 gold pieces per superior healing potion."
Orion: How much for the lot?
Laura: And if we buy in bulk, what can you bring it down to?
Matt: "If you buy all three?"
Laura: A thousand each?
Matt: "I'm sorry. You've already been given the discount via Gilmore. That price stands as it is. Let's say you buy the three remaining items, I'll give you 1200 apiece. And even that I'll probably get in trouble for, but he seems to like you."
Laura: 1200 apiece? Yes?
Travis: We'll take that.
Taliesin: Sounds good.
Laura: Three superior.
Matt: "Very well. So 3600 gold pieces. Three superior are yours."
Matt: She pulls them out of the crate and slides them across. They are thick, very heavily-made glass vials with these small glass handles on the side. You can see the interior. The liquid itself is a reddish purple, almost blood color, but there's a gold sheen as you shake it in the light. You can see there's a spark of divine glow to it.
Marisha: Like Goldschlager.
Taliesin: Classy.
Matt: Kind of. It's the worst of healing Goldschlager.
Marisha: (laughs)
Matt: "Is that all you require?"
Travis: Do you sell any love potions?
Matt: She gives you the blank stare and goes,
Matt: "No." (all laugh)
Travis: Right. Sorry for asking. Jeez.
Taliesin: I would also say we should take the six superior healing potions, as well.
Orion: Absolutely.
Matt: "The greater ones."
Taliesin: Greater.
Laura: What did we just buy? We didn't buy superior?
Taliesin: We bought the three superior. We should also get the six greater.
Laura: Six greater. All right. How much is that?
Matt: "Those are 500 apiece. With your discount, that would be 450 apiece."
Laura: But if we're buying all six, 400 apiece is a very good price.
Orion: Now, this is the Vex I miss.
Matt: Roll a persuasion check.
Marisha: Persuasion check, persuasion check!
Orion: Persuasion check, persuasion check!
Taliesin: Persuasion check, persuasion check!
Liam: Vex hasn't had a chance to haggle since the show started.
Marisha: Yep.
Liam: All she used to do before this show was haggle.
Marisha: We used to take food breaks.
Marisha: No!
Laura: Fourteen.
Matt: Fourteen? She goes,
Matt: "Let's call it an even 425 gold pieces each."
Laura: I like this. I'm comfortable with that.
Matt: "All right."
Taliesin: 425 times 6...
Matt: She brings out her arcane calculator.
Marisha: Her arcane calculator? Once again, our charity.
Matt: "That’ll be 2550 gold pieces."
Laura: All right.
Matt: And she pulls out the six that are there and she kinda slides them over the counter to you. One tips over but she catches it, leaves it there at the far end.
Travis: Careful with those.
Matt: "They’re fine, they can take a beating, they’re designed that way."
Travis: So can I.
Matt: She pushes her glasses up and looks vastly unimpressed at the presentation.
Laura: How much were the superiors again?
Matt: "The superiors were 1500 brought down to 1200 apiece, yes."
Laura: 1200. Which came to 36?
Taliesin: Thirty-six.
Taliesin: So do you have anything, we keep getting turned into stone, it’s been sort of a running theme. We were hoping you might have something to help alleviate stone skin or any --
Matt: "We do have potions of petrification removal."
Taliesin: Yes! Petrification removal.
Matt: I think. Let me check.
Matt: And she goes in the back room, rummages around for a minute, comes out and she presents two of them. They have a clear liquid that looks almost like dirty water, and they’re like thin little vials, she goes,
Matt: "These potions, when applied to the flesh, will, more of an oil I guess you would say, removes the affliction of petrification. These do cost 750 gold apiece."
Laura: We have greater restoration from Pike, and she can cure --
Matt: "Then you’re fine."
Matt: And she takes them --
Orion: How many potions are there?
Matt: "Two."
Liam: But in the heat of the moment.
Orion: Get them.
Taliesin: In the heat of the moment, it might come quite in handy.
Liam: A stone Grog in the middle of a fight?
Travis: I agree.
Orion: It takes her a day to learn that and she can only do it like once or twice at the most.
Travis: I think we need to get it.
Taliesin: I’d rather have the potions than the gold, to be fair.
Marisha: Let’s just get one.
Taliesin: And we haven’t discussed our discount.
Marisha: I should learn how to make potions. I should learn this.
Liam: Money is meant for spending.
Laura: Do we want to take one?
Orion: Take both.
Taliesin: I’d actually say we take both.
Liam: Not that I’m here.
Laura: Take both. 750 was not the discounted price.
Orion: No.
Matt: She gives you another look of like, ugh. She adjusts her glasses.
Orion: To be fair, we are spending a lot, right? Overall, so.
Ashley: Overall.
Matt: "That would come to 1350."
Taliesin: Thirteen fifty.
Travis: We’ll take it.
Laura: 1300. Remember, we’re very good friends of Gilmore’s, he said to treat us well.
Matt: Make another persuasion roll. This is my new fan dice.
Matt: It’s awesome, thank you.
Laura: That was really good.
Matt: It’s awesome, thank you.
Laura: That would be 21.
Matt: It’s a good thing. She gives you a look and goes,
Matt: "I don’t like you." (all laugh)
Matt: "Thirteen hundred."
Laura: Thirteen hundred, lovely, thank you.
Marisha: Sherri? It was Sherri, right?
Matt: "Yes?"
Marisha: Do you have any books on how to learn how to start making your own potions? Or do you know of any classes in town where maybe I could sign up for like a potion workshop?
Matt: "Nothing here, but that’s not a bad idea, might run that past Gilmore."
Taliesin: You should offer a workshop.
Marisha: You should absolutely offer a workshop.
Matt: "That’s a good idea,"
Marisha: You should absolutely offer a workshop. "otherwise the Lyceum would be the place to look."
Marisha: The Lyceum?
Matt: "Yes."
Marisha: Okay.
Orion: Do you have any potions of strength or any ability potions?
Matt: She leaves for a second, then comes back and goes,
Matt: "No, I’m afraid those were all purchased. However, we may have more in a few weeks or so. They take some time to create and the ingredients are a little bit scarce. However, trade is opening, perhaps --"
Marisha: Someone purchased all of your potion of strength potions?
Matt: "Yes."
Marisha: Oh. How many did you have?
Matt: "We had four, I believe. Varying giant strength types."
Ashley: One person did or it was just a bunch of people just buying.
Matt: "It was a handful over the period of time."
Marisha: Oh.
Orion: I’m gonna hand her also a ticket, a scroll of telescription and be like,
Orion: When it comes in, please write that it has and I will be notified via this parchment.
Matt: "Very well."
Matt: She folds it and places it in a little cubby on the side.
Orion: Thank you.
Matt: "Is there anything else you require? We have many magical, various armaments and/or protective items."
Travis: Armaments, what kind of armaments you got?
Matt: "Well, if you’ll follow me."
Matt: She leads you up the stairway to the second floor. The second floor itself is just a series of glass cases that are leaned at an angle. In these cases you can see there are different items just laid out, small labels at the bottom with
Travis: Oh. a brief description of the enchantment.
Matt: She leads you across, she goes,
Matt: "Well, first we’ll start here with the ring section."
Matt: You can see there’s a small case that has along this purplish velvet pillow, a bunch of different rings set out. She goes,
Matt: "We have varying degrees of rings of protection. These rings are designed to protect the individual who wears, we have one I believe with the basic enchantment, and one with one step higher above that."
Matt: The equivalent of a ring of protection +2.
Matt: "That ring runs 6500 gold. We have a ring of psychic resistance that does protect yourself from various mental intrusions. We have a ring of evasion that can be utilized three times a day, or one to three times a day. Should one of you not be quite quick enough to avoid any sort of incoming danger. You could allow yourself a successful escape. That runs 4500. We also have a ring of water walking. This one has been popular in the past for some various traveling troupes that wish to do various performances that require defying the surface of water. It gets a bit shifty now that I think about it, but you know, whatever folks will enjoy. Peasantry is easily pleased. So those are our rings at the moment. Should any of those tickle your fancy, please do let me know. Here --"
Matt: And she points over where there is a thick leather belt with like three straps across that looks highly well made with what looks like square runic carvings on the side.
Matt: "--this is what is referred to, and this was import from Kraghammer, but we’ve had it in here for quite some time, a belt of dwarvenkind. This belt, when adorned, does increase the physical heartiness of the individual as well as giving them positive interaction with other dwarves. And we haven’t fully tested it yet, but apparently it also seems to resist against poison intrusion in one’s body, allows you to see better in dark places, and apparently grants you the ability of speaking, reading, and writing Dwarvish."
Laura: Oh wow.
Marisha: I need that.
Matt: It is 5000 gold.
Laura: I bet that’s very expensive...
Liam: One month ago you needed that.
Marisha: Yeah.
Ashley: What was the first ring?
Travis: Ring of protection.
Matt: "The first ring was the ring of protection."
Marisha: Plus two, right?
Matt: It gives a plus two bonus to AC and saving throws.
Marisha: That’s really good.
Ashley: What was the evasion one?
Matt: "That one, that’s the ring of evasion."
Ashley: Yes, what was that?
Matt: It has three charges and it regains 1d3 charges per day. When you fail a dexterity saving throw while wearing it, you can use your reaction to expend a charge and auto-succeed on the saving throw instead. Good for people who have low dexterity.
Travis: The one that protects you psychically, could you repeat that one on the menu, please?
Matt: "The ring of psychic resistance --"
Taliesin: Oh god.
Matt: It gives you resistance to psychic damage, so anyone does damage that is psychic-based, you take half damage.
Laura: That’s not quite it.
Travis: It’s not good?
Laura: No, it’s not quite the same.
Travis: Not even for me?
Laura: Do you have anything to make Grog smarter?
Travis: Well, fuck off. (all laugh)
Matt: She looks over at him for a moment and goes,
Matt: No. No we don’t.
Laura: Any crayons so he could be occupied?
Travis: Do you have crayons?
Matt: "We have colored writing implements for children, if you’d like."
Orion: Yes, please.
Travis: I saw a few children in town. Maybe they would like them.
Matt: She goes back downstairs and comes back in a moment. She presents two small boxes that contain small colored wax things. You can see on the outside it has a picture of Gilmore, and he’s doing this, and it says Gilmore’s Glorious Colored Sticks.
Orion: Of course.
Matt: "These are usually reserved for the children of our customers, so if the children will enjoy it, enjoy."
Travis: I’ll take one of those, please.
Marisha: Yes, trust me --
Travis: The colors are quite nice.
Marisha: --the children will.
Matt: "Five gold pieces apiece."
Marisha: Five gold pieces apiece? I thought they were free, like when you go to an O’Charley’s or an Applebee’s.
Matt: "What’s an Applebee’s?"
Orion: It’s a hellhole, apparently near where you used to live.
Matt: It’s one of the layers of the Abyss, it’s like around --
Marisha: One of the infernal layers of the Abyss.
Matt: About layer 943.
Marisha: It’s getting pretty low, yeah.
Ashley: So I’ve been talking with Scanlan and I know he was interested in the plus two AC ring.
Marisha: I think we should pick that up for sure.
Ashley: What’s the price on that?
Matt: "Sixty five hundredd gold pieces for that."
Ashley: Okay.
Matt: "With your discount, that would bring it --"
Matt: Goes back and looks again at her magic calculator, I’m an actor not --
Liam: It’s an abacus.
Matt: Exactly.
Matt: "That brings it to 5850."
Ashley: Well, he does have this amazing ruby gem. He was maybe thinking of trading that for maybe bringing down the price?
Matt: Do we know how much that was worth?
Liam: Uh.
Matt: Has Scanlan looked at his sheet and found what it’s worth?
Liam: Scanlan? Speak up,
Ashley: Scanlan,
Liam: Scanlan? Speak up,
Liam: Do you know how much it’s worth?
Liam: I think you wrote it down. He’s talking quietly.
Matt: There was the diamond also that was repaired in the mending wheel.
Matt: He can look that up as well.
Marisha: There was a diamond.
Liam: Vex, do you remember how much that diamond was worth, we got that diamond --
Matt: Oh no, we lost them.
Taliesin: We lost them.
Marisha: Oh no!
Matt: Redial, redial!
Marisha: This is important!
Liam: I got it.
Marisha: How much is the diamond worth?
Matt: "Regardless. Other things of interest, nothing that would make him smarter, that would make him quicker."
Liam: This is so period. It’s just like Lord of the Rings. Beep beep beep.
Matt: Magical sending stone.
Liam: God damn it!
Marisha: Answer!
Matt: Answer your Facetime.
Marisha: Answer, bitches.
Matt: Vex!
Orion: I hate when you call and you know that they’re there and they don’t pick up.
Liam: All right, well I’m not here anyway, so I’m just gonna keep doing this, as you were.
Matt: We’ll come to it. so I’m just gonna keep doing this, as you were.
Matt: "Regardless."
Marisha: We know you’re there!
Matt: She continues on, showing you through, she goes,
Matt: "Well, I don’t necessarily have anything that would make him smarter. We do have something that would make anyone quicker."
Matt: She goes a second, there is a big, thick leather tome.
Matt: "This is an ancient tome that was enchanted many, many generations back. Upon properly reading and studying this tome, one would increase their physical dexterity permanently."
Marisha: Oh, I like that.
Matt: "It only has its abilities and power once a century, so it does come quite pricey."
Marisha: What is that price?
Matt: "Fifteen hundred gold pieces."
Marisha: We should buy that.
Ashley: We should probably buy it.
Marisha: A tome that increases your dexterity plus one.
Laura: It’s on my phone now. We switched.
Matt: That’s okay.
Matt: "So there is the manual of quickness of action, we also have the hat of disguise --"
Matt: And she produces this like -- (Facetime noises)
Matt: And she produces this like --
Matt: She produces this fine brass cap that has intricate swirling runes on it and what looks like a small set of ears that are pushed on the sides so when it fits on the head it looks almost like a smaller head on top of yours. She says,
Matt: "This cap when worn, however, one can alter their appearance however they see fit. We also have --"
Matt: She pulls out this thick, leather armor that has a brownish-blue trimmed hue to it and goes,
Matt: "This is what we refer to as coldsnap leather armor. It has an enchantment to improve one’s armor class by two. While wearing it, you have resistance to cold damage."
Marisha: Is it leather armor, you said?
Matt: "Leather armor, yes."
Marisha: How much is that?
Matt: "That is 7500 gold pieces. We also have the cape of Mountebank. It is a cape that when triggered --"
Matt: She takes it and shifts it for a second, you can see a little bit of smoke plumes off of it, smells sulfurish. She goes,
Matt: "While wearing it, you can use it to teleport yourself a short distance instantaneously, once per day. We have this --"
Matt: She pulls another dark cloak off the wall. This one looks like it’s made of dark fur, but as she shakes it you can see these two little tendrils are on it. They like wiggle about, these little spiked edges to the tendrils.
Matt: "This is a cloak of displacement, enchanted and taken from the body of a displacer beast. While wearing it, it makes it so your body projects an illusion. Anyone attempting to cause you harm has difficulty actually finding purchase on your physical form, not knowing where you truly stand."
Orion: I will take that cape.
Matt: "It is 4500 gold pieces."
Orion: Wonderful. Vex?
Orion: Oh, shit. She’s not here.
Matt: "I’ll put this aside as a possibility. We have a pearl of power."
Matt: She pulls up from this small box, she opens up the top lid.
Matt: "This enchanted pearl, you can use it to speak a command word and regain one expended spell slot, up to third level, that you’ve already used. Once you’ve used the pearl, it can’t be used until the next dawn, so once per day you can just return. It’s for your caster-types."
Marisha: A third-level spell?
Matt: "Yes, up to third level, one spell slot, you can immediately restore it. It does require attunement, however, and you can’t have more than three items attuned to you, so be aware of your limitations."
Ashley: What’s the price on that one?
Matt: "This is 550 gold pieces."
Ashley: Okay.
Orion: Pike, do you have any 3rd-level healing spells?
Ashley: Do I have 3rd-level healing spells? I do.
Matt: "We’ll put it aside as a possibility. I also have --"
Matt: And you move to the side, going through the armor section as well, she goes --
Matt: "I have a mithral chain shirt, as well as an enchanted mithral chain shirt, there is a plus one enchantment on it as well. They are flexible and can be worn under normal clothing, does not impose disadvantage on dexterity or stealth checks. It is considered light armor. There is golden chainmail, it’s a plus one enchantment."
Matt: Then she goes to what looks to be a series of weapons. She brings forth a very fine-looking dagger, that has --
Liam: Everyone hears from the back, Scanlan’s voice piping up saying, "Just buy all this shit!"
Marisha: Just buy all this shit.
Ashley: Buy everything.
Marisha: How much money did we have? Didn’t we have like at least --
Liam: Thirty... thirty-ish. I mean, I’m not here, but --
Matt: And you still have money you haven’t collected in Kraghammer, too.
Marisha: Huh?
Matt: There’s money you still haven’t collected in Kraghammer. Lord Nostoc Greyspine, you guys made a deal with him before you went down in the pits.
Liam: So maybe we could open up a line -- I’m sure you guys could open up a line of credit with my buddy Gilmore.
Marisha: A line of credit?
Liam: Yeah, an I.O.U. Once we’re back from our day.
Marisha: So we’ve got like roughly 30k?
Liam: In our possession now. Thirty-one.
Orion: We have over that. Because Vex and Grog are with us. And they have --
Matt: She has all the money. So we’ll just keep track of what you guys spend and bring it back to Vex, your treasurer. And she’ll be really angry that you guys spent all that money.
Liam: She’s trying, she’s trying, it’s coming up on my phone.
Orion: The trick is, we don’t know how much the total is.
Marisha: We generally would if our party’s here. She just can’t tell us at this moment.
Orion: It’s well over thirty. I think we have closer to fifty. ... maybe forty.
Matt: So she presents this dagger to you guys --
Marisha: We don’t want to deplete all of our funds.
Matt: So she presents this dagger to you guys --
Matt: "This is a fine dagger,"
Marisha: We don’t want to deplete all of our funds.
Matt: "This is a fine dagger, the blood runs themselves are enchanted --"
Marisha: We also spent a lot on the keep, "the blood runs themselves are enchanted --" don’t forget that, we dumped a lot of money into the keep.
Matt: Yep, you did.
Marisha: So we might have more like thirty.
Matt: You guys spent quite a bit on the keep. All right.
Ashley: What’s this dagger?
Matt: "This dagger actually can take the lifeforce from an enemy when delivering a very strong blow."
Matt: Essentially, on a critical hit on the attack roll -- (all cheer)
Ashley: We got it. (all cheer)
Orion: Here they are. (all cheer)
Marisha: How much money do we have?
Laura: We have --hold on, let me look.
Travis: Twenty-four thousand --
Laura: No. I normally don’t,
Laura: We have about 20,000, all right?
Orion: So we have 50,000 total. Because we just had 30, we just got paid 30 grand, right?
Matt: Yeah, ten.
Marisha: No.
Marisha: Ten grand.
Matt: You got ten grand from Allura and you currently have a floating --
Marisha: And she added that.
Orion: That’s added?
Laura: I already added that, we’re at 20,000.
Orion: I thought we were at 30 --
Marisha: We spent almost 50,000 dollars on our keep.
Orion: Right, but --
Travis: Plus those fucks in Kraghammer owe us a fortune.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Yeah, 25,000 gold is still owed by Lord Nostoc Greyspine.
Orion: That’s who owed us.
Marisha: Yes, that’s what we’re saying.
Orion: What?
Marisha: That’s why we’re saying we only have 20 or 30 --
Taliesin: No, we haven’t gone back there.
Orion: So we’ll have to go back and get it.
Taliesin: Eventually, yeah.
Matt: "So while you --"
Laura: Will you point us a little bit out so we can see --
Matt: "As I was saying, this dagger, upon a very impactful wound on a foe, steals a bit of its life force, dealing an additional ten necrotic damage, and then gives the wielder ten temporary hitpoints."
Laura: Whoa, that’s major.
Matt: "So there’s that. We also have an enchanted heavy maul, and we have --this is quite a find here."
Matt: As she pulls out this wooden case, she pulls back the wooden top to it. As she does, you can see there’s a little bit of ice crystal that’s gathered along the interior of the wooden case. There inside sits a short sword, a relatively thick short blade, but the blade itself is like a blue, almost glimmering metal, and there’s actually a rising frozen mist that drifts off the blade.
Matt: "This is an enchanted frostbrand. It acts as a shortsword. Whenever it does damage to an enemy, it does an additional 1d6 cold damage. And while you hold the weapon you have resistance to any fire damage you would take. At freezing temperatures, it sheds a ten foot radius of dim light, and when you draw the weapon, you extinguish all magical flames within 30 feet of you."
Taliesin: Fancy.
Matt: "And those are currently all the things we have at the moment. We’re working on a few more things that will be ready in the next couple of weeks, but those are the current haul for our above-the-average consumer. Magical creations."
Ashley: I have a question.
Matt: "Yes."
Ashley: Do you have anything that can make armor... ... quieter? (all laugh)
Ashley: Maybe like a really heavy armor, that’s really quiet.
Liam: That oil from the Wizard of Oz.
Matt: "We don’t have anything for that, but we could have it commissioned for you if you’d like."
Ashley: I would like to see about that.
Matt: "All right. I’ll have to talk to Gilmore. That’s more in his realm of enchantment, but that is a possibility."
Matt: She adjusts her glasses again.
Matt: "When he returns, whenever that is, we can discuss with him what you’d like, yes."
Ashley: That would be great.
Matt: "All right, well."
Ashley: Thank you.
Orion: I will take the enchanted mithral shirt
Orion: I will take the enchanted mithral shirt and the cape, thank you very much.
Matt: "All right."
Matt: And she grabs the --
Orion: But that’s not the total yet. Vex has to talk about the rest of what we want.
Ashley: What’s the price on the dagger and the sword?
Matt: "The sword is 8500 gold pieces. The dagger is 7800 gold pieces. This is without your discount. The mithral chain shirt, it is medium armor, I lied. It is 5250 gold pieces."
Orion: Wait, I can’t --
Matt: You can’t wear armor.
Matt: "And you were looking at the pearl of power, which is 550 gold, and there is the cloak of displacement, which is 4500 gold pieces."
Travis: Would you be interested in a trade?
Matt: "What do you have to trade?"
Travis: We’ve got lots of bits from dragons, lots of bits from umber hulks, and we’ve got basilisk eggs.
Marisha: We also have that diamond and the ruby. Do we know how much that is?
Orion: Yes. Do we know how much that is?
Laura: We also have some jewels.
Marisha: I definitely say we pick up that ring with the AC and I wouldn’t mind having that leather --
Laura: The ring of protection?
Marisha: That ring of protection that gives you plus two to your AC. That we need for somebody. And I wouldn’t mind having that leather armor. That adds a plus two to my AC.
Matt: "Cold snap?"
Marisha: Yup.
Matt: "All right. There are the things we are looking at currently on this table, we have the belt of dwarvenkind, the manual of quickness of action --"
Marisha: We should get that too.
Matt: "--cold snap leather armor --"
Marisha: Get that manual.
Matt: "--cloak of displacement, ring of protection plus two --"
Ashley: Put the dagger and sword on the table also.
Ashley: Just in case.
Matt: "All right."
Ashley: Throwing it out there to see, I don’t know.
Matt: "They are there on the table."
Laura: We have nowhere near enough for all of this.
Laura: We have nowhere near enough for all of this.
Orion: Let’s see what the total is.
Marisha: We could trade,
Orion: Let’s see what the total is.
Marisha: Let’s see what we can trade around maybe.
Matt: "So the total for all of these items, including --"
Matt: She starts going through her --
Marisha: I want new stuff. I haven’t gotten new armor since we started.
Taliesin: I haven’t either.
Orion: You should get the mithral shirt, it adds something to your --
Marisha: Do you wear light armor or medium armor?
Taliesin: I would guess light armor, I imagine.
Matt: "With the discount, this entire haul would come to 49,815 gold pieces."
Ashley: What’s that, how much?
Marisha: 50k.
Matt: "49,815 gold pieces with your discount for this entire sum. Now, would you like to pay in gold? Would you like to pay in--"
Liam: Get the dragon armor out.
Orion: Twenty-four total, before the dwarven--
Ashley: Maybe we can see how much we can trade of what we have, maybe we can get a little--
Laura: How much is a pound of dragon scales worth to you?
Matt: "What dragon? Show me the scales."
Laura: Blue dragon scales.
Travis: Blue dragon scales, here you go.
Matt: You pull them out of the bag of holding. She takes a few and she takes her glasses off and then pulls out from a pocket this intricate-looking, multi-lensed tinkering viewing device and inspects it very closely.
Laura: It was a very powerful dragon.
Matt: "Apparently not powerful enough if you have these."
Travis: Hey Pike, don’t take this shit.
Marisha: I don’t know if that was a compliment or an insult.
Travis: Hey Pike, don’t take this shit.
Matt: Puts it away in her pocket and goes,
Marisha: Taking it as a compliment.
Matt: Puts it away in her pocket and goes,
Matt: "These are legitimate. I won’t question how you came about them, but they are definitely legitimate. A pound, you say?"
Laura: How much is a pound worth to you?
Travis: We have several pounds.
Laura: And I’ll tell you how much we have.
Laura: And I’ll tell you how much we have.
Matt: "Say a pound of dragon scales --"
Matt: And the dragon scales themselves are about that big each, they’re about the size of a peach.
Travis: Oh, shit.
Matt: Dragons are big, especially this one.
Matt: "Blue dragon scales, I’d say a pound is maybe, guessing close to eight to ten scales. That would be worth about, I’d put that at 1,000 gold credit for each pound provided."
Travis: I have at least 11 pounds.
Laura: Yeah.
Orion: Perfect.
Laura: So that’s another, at least, what? Eleven thousand?
Liam: Five hundred thousand gold right there.
Laura: That’s like another 10,000 we have in dragon scales.
Travis: We have 11 pounds of dragon scales.
Marisha: And how about that diamond that we put in the mending wheel?
Orion: No, ruby.
Laura: It’s flawless and beautiful and so sparkly.
Marisha: How much?
Matt: Pulls that again, looks over it.
Marisha: Catch.
Matt: "This ruby, probably about 500 gold pieces."
Laura: That’s it?
Travis: We also have three dragon teeth, fangs from the beast’s mouth.
Matt: Make a perception roll.
Orion: Oh sweet, and they froze there.
Matt: Or not that, a persuasion roll.
Orion: Oh no, they --
Marisha: Oh no, they didn’t!
Liam: I’m gonna tell them. Oh my gosh.
Marisha: Persuasion roll. Oh no!
Liam: You have to make a persuasion roll, quick.
Taliesin: That’s hilarious.
Matt: Timing is everything, folks. Timing is everything.
Taliesin: Timing is everything.
Ashley: I have one dragon fang around my neck.
Matt: That’s a keepsake for actually slaying a dragon. You’re welcome to trade that. It’s worth quite a bit.
Marisha: No.
Taliesin: No.
Ashley: That was the white dragon?
Matt: That was the white dragon.
Orion: Yeah, it was the white dragon you killed.
Matt: That’s the one that you got the final blow on.
Marisha: What was your persuasion?
Matt: That’s the one that you got the final blow on.
Taliesin: Not worth the memory of killing a white dragon.
Marisha: What was your persuasion?
Taliesin: Not worth the memory of killing a white dragon.
Ashley: I know, I gotta keep it.
Matt: Anyway.
Taliesin: Gotta keep it.
Ashley: Keepsake, can’t put a price on it.
Liam: Ten. Ten, they rolled a ten.
Matt: They rolled a ten. She says,
Matt: "Dragons’ teeth actually, strangely enough, are a little easier to find. I would put, each dragon’s tooth available would probably add about 250 gold pieces to the exchange."
Travis: We’ve got three.
Marisha: And how about the basilisk eggs? While we’re --
Liam: Get it out out.
Marisha: --cleaning our bag out, exactly.
Travis: We have two basilisk eggs we’re willing to part with.
Matt: As you pull out the basilisk eggs, you pull it out and immediately there is a stench that is emanating from these eggs that have been in your bag of holding for probably close to eight or nine months.
Travis: No, the smell means they’re good.
Matt: This is now the fourth time she’s looked at you with a deadpan glance and adjusted her glasses.
Matt: "We’re not interested in the eggs, but thank you anyway."
Travis: All right, we do have three pints of dragon’s blood.
Laura: This is super, super powerful.
Travis: It might’ve congealed a little bit actually, though.
Ashley: No, it’s absolutely just really fresh because we put it in Tupperware.
Matt: "We’ll stick with the scales for now." put it in Tupperware.
Laura: You’ll stick with the scales.
Travis: Right, any chance you’d be interested in claws of an umber hulk?
Liam: I like that the 400,000 people who saw that thing are tuning in to the shopping episode.
Taliesin: To the shopping episode! are tuning in to the shopping episode.
Marisha: To the shopping episode! are tuning in to the shopping episode.
Orion: Hi everybody.
Liam: We’ve been fighting and killing for weeks,
Liam: We’ve been fighting and killing for weeks, and now we’re haggling over prices.
Orion: But we do need new gear.
Matt: Timing is everything.
Marisha: We do need new gear.
Matt: This has now turned into the flea-market episode. Hey, you guys guide the story. It’s fun though.
Marisha: You guys guide the story. Hey, you guys guide the story. It’s fun though.
Matt: "We’d say with the credit from the dragon scales, that’ll take 10,000, 11,000 away from the current pricing, that would put us at 39,815 for this batch."
Marisha: So can we open that line of credit we were talking about?
Matt: "What line of credit?"
Marisha: That line we’re talking about right now. (all laugh)
Orion: Well said, your majesty.
Marisha: That one that I just said two seconds ago?
Liam: Wait, DM, where am I with Gilmore?
Matt: We’ll get to that right now.
Orion: It takes time to make a --
Laura: We could advertise for Gilmore.
Marisha: Yeah.
Ashley: We could advertise, but maybe we should wait until they get back so if their walk goes really well, whatever that means, we could maybe try to strike a deal.
Marisha: Right, put this on layaway?
Laura: He’ll probably give us everything for free.
Ashley: Because we probably need to talk to Gilmore about the credit.
Orion: True.
Taliesin: Yes, that’s fair.
Marisha: So can we hold this for now?
Ashley: We’ll wait until Gilmore gets back.
Matt: "Certainly."
Ashley: We’ll wait until Gilmore gets back.
Marisha: Oh, good.
Matt: "If you wish."
Matt: Starts putting everything into a small layaway pile in the corner.
Marisha: So you guys. Natural history museum? Pizza and then natural history museum?
Orion: What is pizza?
Matt: In the meantime.
Orion: It sounds wonderful.
Marisha: We’ve got time, we’ve gotta wait for their man-date, we can go see some sights.
Matt: In the meantime. for their man-date, we can go see some sights.
Liam: In-between time.
Matt: Vax.
Liam: In-between time.
Matt: Yes. Gilmore, who has sweeped you out into the middle of Abedar’s Promenade, takes you by the arm and begins to lead you happily up towards the Erudite Quarter of Emon, which has a secondary wall around it as well. As he brings you along, he talks happily and loudly about how,
Matt: "It’s rather wonderful the way that we were presented with this opportunity over in Westruun. It’s magnificent, the team they’ve assembled to build this brand. I’m very excited at how they brought it to my attention. I wanted to keep things very localized, of course, but it seems--"
Liam: Will you trust the folk in Emon to handle your business or will you go between?
Matt: "The folk in Westruun?"
Liam: Yes.
Matt: "The folk in Westruun?"
Matt: "I have a couple of friends there that will oversee the process, but I will be very involved and keeping an eye, so I’m not too terribly worried. Besides, it’s a much smaller business we’re running there and it’ll be fine. Oh, look ahead."
Matt: As you guys step into the Erudite Quarter, he’s now brought you into essentially what is an outdoor botanical garden that is just a very nice walk. Grass across the ground, with fine well-cut bushes. There is a canopy of beautiful trees that are arcane, through arcane means, twisted and sculpted to form this long tunnel. It’s strangely romantic. As Gilmore begins to walk you down, there’s a fountain to the side, and he says,
Matt: "What about you? How’s Vox Machina been? How’ve they been treating you? How are you, Vax?"
Liam: Well, we’re tired, to be sure. I was not kidding before, we really are lucky to be alive. And that’s thanks in large part to a lot of the gear you outfitted us with the last time.
Matt: "Wondrous, I’m happy to help. And have you been keeping up your end of the bargain? Have you been singing the praises of Gilmore’s Glorious Goods across Kraghammer and beyond?"
Liam: You were mentioned in Kraghammer. I regret to inform you, though, that we were forced to travel underground rather quickly and the duergar and the other things that we ran into were not really customers you’d want to deal with. No, our lives were too much in harm’s way. But now that we’re above ground, I’m looking to pick up where I left off.
Matt: "Very well." And do your shop honor.
Liam: Your contribution to what we’ve done --
Liam: And I place my hand on his hand.
Liam: --was no small part in our survival.
Liam: And I give it just a little squeeze.
Liam: And I want to thank you. I don’t know that I would be standing here if not for your help.
Matt: "Had it not been for Gilmore’s Glorious Goods." (all laugh)
Matt: He looks you deep in the eyes, pats the top of your hand, and goes,
Matt: "Vax. This, that moment, that is why I do what I do."
Liam: You’re a unique man, Gilmore. No question. Never met anyone quite like you.
Matt: "Well. Would you care to share a glass of wine with a man not quite like anyone else you’ve met?"
Liam: Indeed. What do you recommend in the area?
Matt: "Oh, please, come, there are casks that pour the finest of honeyed Syngoran wine. I know perhaps you’ve not been home for quite some time?"
Liam: That’s a complicated thing for me, one that I’m not really quite ready to talk about yet.
Matt: "Oh."
Liam: Maybe someday.
Matt: "Maybe with enough wine."
Liam: You old so-and-so.
Marisha: You old so-and-so.
Matt: About an hour and a half, time passes before eventually there’s a loud clattering at the front of Gilmore’s Glorious Goods, where a laughing Vax and Gilmore come stumbling in, flush of face, with emptied goblets, laughing to themselves. Is there anything specific before this moment that you wanted to ask --
Liam: I took the duergar, I was holding her right over the cliff, and I just cut, and she fell! She fell! I didn’t know what I was doing, I just did it!
Matt: "You are ridiculous, Vax'ildan! Oh, it tickles me."
Ashley: Hi! Hello!
Matt: "Oh, good to see your friends."
Ashley: Sounds like you had fun.
Liam: Family. Family, family. I’ve had a couple of drinks. I’m an adult, I can do that.
Liam: What have you found? Have you guys been shopping?
Marisha: Well, we have!
Orion: Yes!
Marisha: Well, we have!
Marisha: We were hoping that you and Gilmore had a wonderful time and that, we just thought we’d wait for you. We didn’t want to make any final decisions without one of our main party members.
Matt: "It was delightful. You travel with the finest companion. We told stories, we cried, we laughed. It was a delight."
Matt: "I’ve had a few."
Matt: He collects himself for a minute.
Liam: I pat him on the back, I do a little circle with my hand.
Marisha: Remember, you have advantage.
Matt: "I’m not as spry as I once was, unfortunately. But yes! Business to attend. What do you need? What can we do?"
Matt: At which point Sherri, waiting in the back, says,
Matt: "Sir, they’ve requested perhaps a few things in bulk. The current amount comes to about roughly 40,000 gold, with your discount."
Matt: "Forty thousand gold, oh, well. Certainly. What seems to be the problem?"
Ashley: Well, I don’t know. We were just talking about, since we’re purchasing so many things, and since we’ve gained some popularity here in Emon, walking around, people are noticing us walking around...
Ashley: I shouldn’t be the one talking right now.
Ashley: Maybe we could open up a line of credit.
Liam: Obviously we’re only shopping with you, Gilmore, at this point.
Matt: He looks about the rest of the group and says,
Matt: "Not everyone seems to be wearing the same patented Gilmore’s Glorious Armor that was given not too long ago. So that’s not true."
Orion: We did find some off of dead things.
Liam: Yes.
Matt: "And those dead things are not under the umbrella of Gilmore’s Glorious Expansion."
Orion: Oh.
Matt: "But should we discuss this, where would this credit be placed against, what do you have that you could ante?"
Liam: What have you guys been talking about? We do have a big pile of dragon’s scales and some gem --
Laura: We do.
Taliesin: We also are owed money.
Liam: And we are owed money in Kraghammer.
Laura: One question that
Liam: And we are owed money in Kraghammer. Grog just whispered to me.
Liam: Yes?
Laura: How much is a platinum worth?
Matt: "What is a platinum? Platinum is worth ten gold pieces."
Liam: Where we at, girl?
Orion: She is displeased.
Laura: We may have a lot more money than I thought we had, because Grog’s been hiding money in the bag of holding. (all laugh)
Travis: It’s really shiny.
Travis: I’m in trouble, Matt. She’s really mad.
Marisha: Wait, is this like when you slapped Trinket on the ass mad?
Laura: No. Not close, not even close. Doesn’t mean as much as Trinket means.
Liam: This is finances, this sounds like a married couple.
Taliesin: How much platinum do we have hiding in the bag of holding?
Travis: I don’t have the number in front of me, but it’s at least 150.
Laura: Yeah.
Liam: Where did we procure that again, Grog? I’m sorry, I’m a little fershnickered.
Travis: I don’t remember, but it’s in the bag of holding.
Laura: I remember getting platinum.
Marisha: I do remember getting platinum, too.
Matt: But you don’t have a number.
Travis: No, I know it’s at least 100, at least 150, I think it’s somewhere up north of 150, I just can’t remember the number.
Liam: Did we get that from the dragon, where did we get that?
Matt: It was a combination of the dragon, the horde you rage-looted --
Laura: Rage-hoarding. the horde you rage-looted --
Laura: Rage-looting.
Liam: I’ll never forget the rage-looting.
Ashley: Rage-looting.
Liam: I’ll never forget the rage-looting.
Travis: It’s my shiny, though, I didn’t want to give it to her, though. She’s evil. You see how she haggles!
Liam: It’s true. She’s my sister, I know, Grog. But right now we need to put that aside and do what’s best for the party.
Travis: Well, we could buy a party with all that. (all laugh)
Liam: Not that kind of party, Grog.
Laura: I think we have enough to buy everything if you guys want.
Liam: Grog, money is meant to be spent.
Travis: I’m going to drink! (all laugh)
Ashley: That solves everything.
Matt: Scanlan goes,
Sam: I agree. Drinks and whoring.
Matt: And smacks Grog in the side. The two of them leave off into the evening to go ahead and make use of their return to Emon properly.
Liam: Vax looks at Gilmore and just shakes his head.
Matt: "There is business to be had, but let’s get business out of the way so we can get to pleasure."
Ashley: Oh, shit.
Liam: Cheers to that.
Marisha: Cheers to that.
Taliesin: I have tinkering to do anyway.
Laura: What did we agree the total for everything we wanted was?
Matt: "Roughly 39,500 gold pieces."
Liam: Pish-posh.
Laura: Roughly. Gilmore.
Matt: "That’s with the discount! I already offered this to you, and you haven’t even kept up your end of the bargain by wearing my emblazoned symbol and my"
Laura: Don’t you want us to advertise in Westruun for you? "immortalized Gilmore’s Glorious Armor."
Liam: We would, Gilmore, we would be wearing that. Again, we nearly died. The armor that you gave me is gone, and I’m lucky to be alive today, and that armor helped me be where I am at the moment.
Matt: "How much credit do you wish to open?"
Liam: Fifty gold.
Ashley: Thousand? Fifty thousand?
Liam: Fifty, ah yes. Fifty thousand.
Matt: "Because 50 gold I can definitely do."
Liam: We’ve been out drinking for two hours, man.
Matt: "This is true. I’m sorry."
Ashley: One million, please.
Matt: "That’s a tough order."
Matt: "You mentioned you had money waiting for you in Kraghammer. How much was --"
Laura: Yes, we do.
Matt: "How much is waiting for you there?"
Liam: Twenty-five, wasn’t it?
Laura: It was 25,000.
Matt: "How about we open a 25,000 gold piece line of credit here with Gilmore’s Glorious Goods that you only need to pay back within the next month."
Liam: That’s fair.
Matt: "Giving you time to arrive. If it’s not paid, you will be hunted. But I’m sure that won’t be a worry, will it?"
Orion: How far is Kraghammer from here?
Taliesin: Not far.
Laura: It’s a week’s ride, isn’t it?
Orion: I can’t teleport everyone.
Marisha: Gilmore, question. Maybe you should consider making little pins that we could just wear on top of our armor? Because wearing your armor, we have our own clothes that we like, so maybe like a pin.
Matt: He steps forward and says,
Matt: "Oh --"
Marisha: Or like a patch?
Matt: "--that’s not even a worry."
Matt: He pulls out a small implement, this wand, and he flicks it over your shoulder. And all of a sudden an arcane swirl around your armor, with a big flash of sparks and glitter almost. You look down and there is, emblazoned upon your current armored form, a symbol of Gilmore’s Glorious Goods now permanently emblazoned on the leather.
Marisha: Ah!
Matt: "Easy enough to fix."
Liam: What a good idea.
Marisha: I was going to put it on that leather.
Taliesin: Yes.
Marisha: I was going to put it on that leather.
Marisha: I was going to put it on that leather. My mom gave this to me.
Matt: "Well, your mother has not provided for you the means of keeping the deal we already made."
Marisha: Can you take this off when we pay you back and put it on that one?
Marisha: Oh, come on.
Taliesin: I think it’ll transfer when you change.
Marisha: Will it transfer when I change armor?
Matt: "I don’t know." (all laugh)
Ashley: We’ll find out.
Matt: "So. Twenty-five thousand gold line of credit, within a month or you’ll be hunted."
Marisha: Wait, do you really have a unicorn as part of your logo?
Matt: "It’s…"
Marisha: What?
Matt: "It’s a creature of my creation, I designed it when I was a child --"
Liam: It’s a phallic thing.
Marisha: Ah.
Laura: So we open the 25,000 line of credit with you and you give us all the things we want?
Matt: "If that is what you want."
Liam: Don’t we have a lot of platinum? What are we dickering prices with?
Laura: Yes! Why don’t we just buy it now, and then we won’t have a line of credit with Gilmore?
Travis: (cries) and then we won’t have a line of credit with Gilmore?
Liam: Yes, we’ll use some of the platinum. One platinum is equal to ten gold. Sorry, Gilmore. Trying to dicker over rates.
Ashley: Not a line of credit?
Liam: No line of credit, we’ll pay for it outright in cold hard platinum.
Matt: You don’t have the amount of platinum with you.
Liam: But Grog’s got it.
Matt: Grog said, because he doesn’t have it in front of him, he has around 150 platinum.
Laura: We can pay him back, it’s true.
Matt: That’s roughly 1500 gold.
Matt: That’s roughly 1500 gold.
Liam: But where is it?
Matt: It’s in the bag of holding, but he doesn’t have the bag of holding information in front of him.
Liam: He doesn’t have the info. And because he doesn’t have the sheet --
Taliesin: --next game.
Liam: --and he can’t read the exact amount?
Matt: Yup. Because he said in memory it’s 150 platinum. That’s only --
Liam: I thought it was a 100,000.
Matt: Oh, no.
Laura: No no no, 150 platinum.
Liam: Oh, 150.
Matt: Hundred thousand you’d be the richest man in the fucking world.
Liam: Okay. in the fucking world.
Matt: So 150 platinum --
Liam: What do you think, sis?
Matt: --based on memory is 11,500,
Liam: Vox Machina treasurer?
Matt: which is a little helpful.
Laura: Right.
Liam: What do you think?
Laura: That would put us at about 30,000 that we have to spend left, which the signal cut out so it doesn’t matter.
Matt: No, we’ve got you.
Marisha: No, we can hear you!
Liam: No, we’ve got you.
Marisha: No, we can hear you!
Laura: Okay.
Liam: So the total tab is what again, Gilmore?
Laura: How much do we have? He does have a picture of it. We have 1,620 platinum.
Marisha: What!
Matt: Is that right? There you go.
Orion: So that’s like--
Matt: 16,000 gold pieces.
Liam: All right. Spend it.
Liam: Spend it.
Marisha: All right. No!
Ashley: So we don’t need to open up a line of credit?
Liam: No.
Matt: Ten gold per platinum.
Orion: We have 1,000.
Matt: A thousand platinum. One thousand six hundred platinum. Move the decimal point. That brings it to 16,000 gold pieces.
Orion: Move two on that.
Matt: No, it’s not 100 gold per platinum, ten gold per platinum.
Matt: I’ve been saying ten gold per platinum this whole time, guys.
Taliesin: No, I’m with you.
Orion: I get it.
Liam: We’re losing our audience. Ring it up.
Matt: We’re getting into math in this.
Marisha: Our charity, 826LA, after-school tutoring.
Taliesin: It could’ve made this all go so much better.
Marisha: Really good to have,
Taliesin: It could’ve made this all go so much better.
Marisha: Your reading and your writing and your arithmetic.
Taliesin: For players who can read good.
Marisha: For players who can read good.
Liam: Ring it up, we’ll take it.
Ashley: We’ll take it all.
Liam: The whole lot.
Ashley: And then, could I commission you, by the way, to maybe make some armor that’s really heavy armor but very quiet?
Matt: "How heavy?"
Ashley: How heavy can you make it?
Matt: "I can work on plate armor if you’d like, but an enchantment of that magnitude would be the only enchantment it would have. So it would be the equivalent of full plate armor and the entire enchantment would enable you to move a little more easily inside it, and that would cost, it would take about, I'd say, a month to enchant on my end and would cost about, not including the cost of the actual armor, materials and time required, I’d put it at about 8,000 gold pieces?"
Liam: Worth it.
Liam: We’ll fund the money.
Ashley: And it’ll just be really quiet?
Matt: "It will enable you to move freer within the armor."
Liam: By a turn. Is 8,000 Vox Machina’s rate, or the general rate?
Matt: "That is through our friendship and our current arrangement."
Liam: Thank you. It’s appreciated.
Matt: "Mm."
Matt: "Business is business, but please don’t take this solemn,"
Liam: Of course. "but please don’t take this solemn, intense face to be anything other than friendship, this is just business and I run a business."
Liam: Understood.
Matt: "Good."
Liam: I’m not taking advantage.
Matt: "All right."
Matt: "So. To take all of these items, with the dragon scales included, bringing it down to 39,000 gold. We’ll call it even, 39,000 gold."
Taliesin: Fair.
Laura: That wasn’t much of a discount, Gilmore.
Liam: Hush up, Vex’ahlia.
Liam: Done, sold, thank you.
Liam: With our thanks.
Matt: "So minus the platinum, that’s 22,000 gold pieces after the platinum and dragon scales."
Marisha: And we have that, right?
Matt: "And you have 25,000 gold credit if you’d like."
Laura: We have, hold on... gotta go away for a minute.
Liam: We’re passing on the credit, Gilmore.
Laura: We have plenty left.
Liam: Yes.
Taliesin: All right.
Liam: You guys are a black screen, what happened?
Taliesin: They paused it.
Laura: I was looking at my calculator.
Liam: All right, we hear you. There you are!
Orion: Abacus!
Liam: You’re so dark sometimes, Vex’ahlia. I swear.
Laura: So the total was 20,000 minus the platinum and the dragon scales?
Matt: "Twenty-two thousand."
Laura: Yes, we still have enough, so.
Matt: "All right. So a deal?"
Marisha: Deal!
Taliesin: Deal.
Laura: My god, all of our money’s gone.
Matt: He snaps his fingers, Sherri comes and presents all the items that she had currently in a little stowaway bin off to the side of the desk. Brings them out to the rest of you and places it on the counter. Gilmore immediately snaps his fingers and a contract shows up. He writes up the numbers exchanged, making note of his business, passes it out.
Matt: "Please sign here. Anyone that represents you and your fine Vox Machina. Sign here and present the money."
Laura: I guess I’ll do that.
Taliesin: You do that.
Matt: "Vex’ahlia."
Matt: He hands you a quill. Takes your coin, slides you, and you now have this entire batch of magical items
Laura: That’s pretty cool.
Matt: to distribute as you see fit.
Matt: to distribute as you see fit.
Marisha: Yes! New armor!
Matt: And from that point --
Laura: Make sure we get some of those things.
Matt: "An absolute pleasure doing business with all of you. Absolutely."
Marisha: Thank you, Gilmore.
Matt: "Thank you."
Marisha: So really though. Will this transfer to that?
Matt: "I have no idea."
Marisha: I was wanting to ask you, Gilmore. Have you considered maybe doing potion-making workshops?
Matt: "Hm. I’ll put some thought to that."
Marisha: Okay. Let me know.
Matt: "All right."
Laura: I feel very uncomfortable and I leave. I go outside to hang out with Trinket.
Matt: Okay.
Matt: As Gilmore takes the change behind the counter, he goes,
Matt: "I’ve got a bit more business to do here. Vax, I greatly appreciate spending the afternoon with you. Where are you staying?"
Liam: I take him by the hand, do one of these clasps, and say,
Liam: We live here now, we’re residents. I haven’t had time to tell you. We have a keep, our own keep. You should come visit. It’s on the outskirts of town. It’s called Greyskull Keep, and you’re welcome any time. Day or night.
Matt: "Good to know. All right. To business I go. I bid you all a fine farewell."
Taliesin: Adieu.
Marisha: Bye, Gilmore.
Matt: He goes back through his beaded exit to the back room and leaves you to the rest of your-- --at which point Sherri goes,
Matt: "I’ll get back to work."
Matt: She goes back up, leaving you guys alone in the main chamber as a couple of other customers start walking around.
Matt: I think we’ll call that the adventure for the evening.
Marisha: Thanks for watching us shop.
Ashley: Thanks for watching us shop!
Laura: All the money’s gone!
Matt: All the money’s gone. You spent it, guys.
Marisha: We have 25 waiting for us in Kraghammer.
Matt: That’s true, you didn’t open the line of credit.
Laura: Yeah, we’d better get that.
Marisha: At least we’re not in debt.
Liam: The world is full of money, Vex'halia.
Travis: We got more money?
Ashley: Who had dibs on what?
Taliesin: I wanted the dexterity boost and I was thinking of the mithral.
Marisha: And I want the leather armor and he wants the cape.
Ashley: I can't use the sword, right? The frostband sword?
Liam: No, clerics can't use swords.
Matt: Check on your class, you might have access to it. Let me check here for you real fast.
Liam: It used to be just blunt weapons for clerics, wasn't it?
Matt: That's the older version, they've changed a few things. They don't do it too often. Let me double-check. Cleric has access to all simple weapons. The sword is a martial weapon so you cannot use that as a weapon.
Ashley: That's okay.
Zac: Oh man. These donations tonight, guys.
Matt: That's great. I'm glad you guys are enjoying watching our--
Laura: Me and Travis are going to cut out.
Matt: -- Laura and Travis are taking off, guys.
Marisha: Bye guys, have fun in Florida!
Liam: We were so glad to have you, sister!
Laura: We were so glad to be here.
Marisha: What con are you guys at?
Laura: We're at MetroCon, down in Tampa.
Matt: MetroCon in Tampa. So if you guys want to go see Vex and Grog in person and you're in the Florida/Tampa area, go to MetroCon this weekend and say hi.
Laura: Let's see how tired we are tomorrow.
Marisha: MetroCon in Tampa.
Liam: Worth it.
Matt: Thank you guys.
Marisha: Have fun!
Matt: Thanks again for the chat that bought us dinner tonight, it was amazing and delicious. Thank you so much guys, you're amazing every week. So we're going to go to donations.
Zac: Let's get through these.
Matt: Yeah, all right. Thank you guys again for -- Once again, this was the recovery episode of a long, twelve-week battle through the underdark. This was interesting to come back to, I hope you enjoyed it. All right, so first, donations.

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors play Dungeons and Dragons. I think this is our 24th episode, which is ridiculous. We've been doing this since March, and it gets more and more ridiculous every week. Glad you guys can join us. The new guys, welcome to our chaos. For all the old folks, glad you could come and join us again. Quick thing I want to mention: last week we were talking about the changes to Critmas, because we had stresses on scheduling and we had crew here, and when things go long, we were talking about possibly moving to Periscope on a different day, separate medium. Well, the fanbase has spoken very loudly and very intently about their reaction to that, and so what we're doing, to still make it so people aren't kept here for ridiculous hours weekly, we're still going to have Critmas on the stream, but it's going to be once a month. It's probably going to be the first Thursday of every month, and we're going to make it an extensive day for that month where we open everything that evening. We still get to experience and share that with you guys, but also not keep these guys here way too late unpaid every Thursday night. So I think that's the plan we're going with forward. Hopefully, that's cool with everyone, because we love it, too, and we want to make sure we still share that with you guys. All right, couple of other announcements. First and foremost, I wanted to mention again-- we mentioned it last week, as well-- there's that Hasbro game design contest, design the next party game. That's still up until end of this month, I believe. So if you want to check it out, you can go ahead and tweet at me, last week's episode or search for the Hasbro game design contest. That's still happening. Also, there's a film series that I'm a part of called Mythica. It's like a high fantasy film series where I play the main villain, the necromancer Zorloc. It's fun times. It's like awesome, fun, fantasy genre film. And they're currently putting up a Kickstarter to finish the post on the third film, so you should check that out. Search Mythica on Kickstarter and you should find it there. Also, WeLoveFine is still running their DND t-shirt contest for their Rage of Demons release for Wizards of the Coast, where you can submit your own t-shirt designs that fit within the Rage of Demons theme. I am one of the judges on that, so if you submit your art to this, there is a cash prize. All the rules are up there on the WeLoveFine contest site. And I'll be able to judge your artwork and hopefully put you through to the end. So there's that. Trying to get through these as fast as possible. Our TeeSpring shirt for Is It Thursday Yet? is still up. It has one more week. So if any of you guys want to get the limited edition Critical Role Is It Thursday Yet? shirt, that is only available for one more week and then it'll be gone forever, so get it while you can. Let's see. I'm doing my best to get through this as fast as possible. No worries. Not everything. Also, Ashley's show Blindspot is premiering this coming Monday. (cheering)
Matt: Which is so exciting. You can check out Ashley on Blindspot where she'll maybe be sneaking Critical Role stuff into the show, hopefully. We're trying to push her to do that. So you should go support her. See it. It's awesome. And all of us lament that's the reason she's away from us. Someone want to handle our other cool--
Laura: But it's not on us yet. Oh look, now you can see us.
Liam: Why don't I go, and then you can go. Hey, you guys. I just want to make sure all of you are aware-- this is going to be so awkward-- I want to make sure you're all aware of a Kickstarter that's out there that is put up by a good friend of mine named Joe Madureira. Now if you don't know who Joe is, he is a comic book rock god and a game developer. When I was a teenager, he made a comic book called Battle Chasers. Look, here's mine. From when I was 16, Joe. I fell in love with it. Nobody does art like Joe Mad does, and I've followed his art for years and years. Even when I fell out of comic books, I was checking in with Hellboy and I was checking in with Joe Mad. And then, years later, I got cast in a game called Darksiders as one of the Horsemen of the Apocalypse. I played War, and I walked into the room and Joe Mad was in the fucking room, and then we became friends. So that game was amazing. Darksiders is a beautiful game. It just reeked of Joe's art style and now he has formed another company called Airship Syndicate and they have a Kickstarter up. They are making a game called Battle Chasers. Oh shoot! I didn't put the thing that comes-- oh, Nightwar! Battle Chasers: Nightwar. They've already hit their goal, but there are stretch goals. They are making an RPG, sort of in the ilk of JRPGs, like Final Fantasy and Chrono Trigger. And it's just going to be bathed in the glory of Joe Mad's amazing art style. So they've hit their goal, but the bigger the budget, the better the game is going to be. I backed it already. And you guys should at least go check it out. A lot of love for Joe Mad.
Orion: Yeah, me too. I'm on the same end. I knew Joe Mad through meeting Liam for a while, and later realizing that this guy I knew as an amazing voice director and an amazing producer has inked some of my favorite issues of Excalibur, and I crapped my pants. I have four of yours, Joe, in my box right now at home. He's an amazing guy and awesome thing to back. Check it out, please.
Liam: And one, the main character from Battle Chasers kind of looks like Pike!
Laura: She does! I thought that, too.
Matt: That's sweet. Wunderbar!
Taliesin: I got something. Next weekend, September 26 and 27, I'm going to be at a con! In Anchorage, Alaska.
Orion: That means "convention".
Taliesin: That means moose. I'm so excited. Senshi Con in Anchorage. I'll be there. I know we at least have, like, three fans at the very least in Alaska. Come on by. I'd love to see you. It'll be awesome.
Matt: Fantastic. Speaking of conventions, guys.
Marisha: Oh man, drop it like it's hot.
Matt: For those of you upper East Coast folks, we've recently been able to announce that we will be at and running some events at New York Comic Con in October. All of us, the entire Critical Role team will be at Comic Con. We're going to have signing, panel and all kinds of fun stuff throughout the weekend. And we'll be there. And if you're in the area, or if it's drivable, or even if it's not, you should come anyway, cause we'd like to see you. If it's trainable, if it's flyable.
Travis: If you steal a horse, steal a horse and ride it.
Laura: If you want to ride a bear there, I wouldn't judge you.
Marisha: And what weekend is New York Comic Con?
Liam: Eight, nine, ten, 11.
Marisha: October 8th, 9th, 10th and 11th. So you've got three weeks to prepare.
Matt: Yeah, so excited to be there. Excited to see you there. And it'll be a lot of fun. A lot of fun.
Liam: Primarily doing stuff Saturday that we know. We're waiting to see what's going on Sunday weekend.
Laura: Saturday is for sure.
Taliesin: With more of us than are even here.
Travis: Bring your swag. Bring your friends.
Marisha: Not even all of us were at San Diego. Well, we were all there, just not all at one point at one time.
Travis: Because we were missing Sam.
Matt: The first full Critical Role con appearance. Boom.
Travis: The unicorn appears.
Orion: I'm going to get a hot dog.
Matt: Orion's going to get a hot dog. Awesome. Any other announcements? Or did you have something, you said?
Laura: No, I was just so excited about New York Comic Con, I wanted to be a part of that announcement.
Orion: I would like to announce that I feel pretty good.
Taliesin: I'm terrified, personally, but--
Orion: I know, but maybe that's why I feel so good.
Taliesin: You were right. It is awful.
Orion: I'll get shunned for it happening, then I'm like, oh, cool. I don't have to worry about me right now.
Marisha: So much pressure.
Laura: Should we say that we have Kit here?
Taliesin: No, we shouldn't tell them that we have Kit here. Let's hold that back.
Matt: Kit Buss is not here.
Marisha: We also have both of our artists here.
Laura: Kit and Wendy.
Matt: Kit and Wendy.
Marisha: Kit and Wendy. Come here! But come here!
Ryan: There's a 30-second lag.
Matt: We'll eventually have them say hello to everyone, but Kit Buss, our official CritRole artist who did all the original character designs, continues to produce amazing art for this show, is here visiting Los Angeles for the next week. So she's here on the set and we'll drag her out in front of the camera and embarrass her shortly.
Taliesin: I've been curious precisely how long the lag is, because--
Laura: It's about 30 seconds.
Marisha: We learned when we killed the carpet.
Laura: Yeah. (muffled yelling)
Marisha: Just time that. Time that.
Matt: I guess also an announcement for all you League players out there: awesome character just got announced called Kindred. Kind of a two-part thing. That wolf that's the part of Kindred sounds pretty cool so you should play it.
Travis: I heard that. It's subtle.
Matt: Real subtle. It's a good one. I think that's it, isn't it? I think we're good on announcements, and we can start.
Taliesin: I feel like we have, do we have an address? Address?
Matt: Oh, the PO Box?
Taliesin: Do we have that?
Travis: It's up. Yeah, he's got it.
Taliesin: It's up and in the chat?
Ryan: The mods are posting it in the chat.
Matt: The mods got that covered. Now diverting all Critmas images and the boxes, and we have arrived. Our nefarious Scanlan--
Sam: Whoa. Were you just talking about me?
Matt: Yeah!
Sam: Whoa, that's crazy. I was just talking about me, too.
Matt: As was the website, because your interview went up today.
Sam: Oh, that's right. I saw. Some of that I had my ghostwriter write for me. I have a biographer and a ghostwriter.
Travis: Is that a ghostwriter on retainer that we can also use?
Sam: Yeah, sure.
Matt: Good to know. Well, fantastic. Do you have any announcements you want to make, Sam, or shall we jump in?
Sam: No. Just that I don't have any dice but I can use Orion's and they're going to be awesome.
Laura: I have so many dice. Take this giant bag and just fish some out.
Sam: Great. Thanks.
Taliesin: The Bag of Disagreeable Dice.
Laura: No, let him find them.
Matt: All righty, then in just a minute, let us begin this next episode of Critical Role. [dramatic music]
Matt: Welcome back. All right, so to give you guys a little heads-up of what has recently transpired in the story. The party, after completing their business in the city of Vasselheim, on the far-off northwest continent. Grog, of course, having an epic battle in the Crucible fight pit against Kern, reclaiming his honor.
Travis: (singing) I am the champion, my friends.
Matt: Pike left back there to finish up the renovation of the temple of Sarenrae that was discovered. The rest of the party moved on back to Emon, the rest of their business complete. Within Emon, they returned to Greyskull Keep, where they encountered a fan, apparently, of Vox Machina, that had been camping for two weeks outside, who was promptly bludgeoned in the temple by Vax to teach him a lesson. Brought back from the brink, and taught that hard lesson-- that this is a dangerous field-- managed to seemingly reach out and touch the heart of this young, intrepid, wannabe adventurer to possibly try and better himself before he throws himself into danger's way. And he ran off to train harder.
Taliesin: Dagger, dagger, hug.
Matt: Indeed. Upon returning to the keep, notice was sent off to one of the other members of the Council of Tal'Dorei, Seeker Asum, who is the halfling head of whispers and all sorts of subterfuge across the countryside, who came to you notifying you that within a week's time, the Briarwoods, Lord and Lady Briarwood, are supposed to be arriving here within Emon for a feast to discuss building a bridge and a more political joining between Emon, the Tal'Dorei royal family, and these up-and-coming lords and ladies, who have a very dark history with Percy's character. You've been asked to join as part of this feast as you previously requested with sovereign Tal'Dorei, that should anything involved the Briarwoods that you be included. You have a week to figure out what you want to do in advance of that. And that is where we left off.
Orion: What time of the day is it?
Matt: Right now, after this discussion, you guys' arrival, I'd say it's probably mid-afternoon. First things first, though, after this discussion with Seeker Asum, who leaves the keep, you do have a brief moment of awkward silence as most of the people that work within your keep turn to you. Laina looks about the rest of you and goes, "By the way, we've been working here for about six weeks on the pay of four. We're coming close to our next pay scheme, and you tend to leave often and for extended periods of time. We would also like to be paid, if possible."
Laura: Most definitely, dear. Yes. We are definitely going to pay you. Does anybody remember how much we are supposed to pay them?
Orion: Pardon, what is the total of the staff's payment?
Matt: She thinks to herself for a moment, at which point you see Erwen, the elderly servant in the back says, "Actually, you had previously said it was both of our services was 50 gold each for the month. And if I recall, the other mercenaries or guardians that you've hired to watch the walls of the keep were at a discussed 100 gold for the month's wages. Each."
Laura: And how many of those guys do we have?
Matt: "You currently have five on your payroll, yes. 600 gold pieces total per month for the services for everyone keeping your keep."
Laura: Tell you what, I will front this from my personal funds for this month. Just because we don't have enough in the party funds to cover that.
Sam: We don't have 600 gold?
Laura: We do not!
Sam: Who's our treasurer?!
Laura: I am, but you bitches keep spending money!
Liam: I'll go halfsies.
Laura: Halfsies? Lovely. Twinsies will pay halfsies. Here you go! 300 for each.
Matt: "Thank you so much. I'll make sure this gets to the appropriate individuals immediately. They'll be very happy to not have to walk away. "
Laura: Yes, don't worry, you will always be paid from Vox Machina.
Matt: Erwen steps in. "And by the way, if you do intend to leave for an extended period of time again, I would recommend perhaps paying that in advance. There was a bit of unrest last time."
Sam: Should we pay another month?
Laura: Not yet. Not just yet.
Orion: I'll pay him in advance right now, just to get it out of the way. 600, out of here, phew, there you go.
Matt: "Very well, sire! I shall disseminate this amongst the others."
Taliesin: Traditionally, the head of the house does dispense out the stipends anyway. That would be appropriate. I'm not even in the room, am I? Never mind! Sorry.
Matt: Yeah, you're down in the workshop.
Laura: Can I go find Percy?
Matt: You can.
Marisha: Actually, we should all go find Percy. We should all talk to Percy.
Matt: "Thank you kindly, Tiberius. Thank you." And he wanders off and begins counting out change into a smaller purse.
Orion: When they start to go, I'd like to go to the temple with the sigils and talk to the guy who runs the place.
Matt: Oh, you mean the Lyceum?
Orion: Yeah.
Matt: Okay, the Alabaster Lyceum.
Orion: Yeah, because I learned something new this week and I was like, I'm dumb. But that's where I would like to head.
Matt: All right. So you make your way towards the Alabaster Lyceum. The rest of you head down into Percy's workshop. So you head around the outskirts of the inner portion of the keep itself, down the stairway that leads to the basement floor, which contains a small cell, like a holding cell that you had constructed for you in case you had somebody to take prisoner at some point. To the right. To the left of you, there's a small turning hallway that leads to the workshop. The workshop contains a series of various tools, workbenches. It actually has a working forge, with anvil and various blacksmithing tools. And as you guys come down, the heat is already blasting from it, and you can see Percy madly diving into work of some kind.
Travis: What are you doing, Percy? You making more mousetraps? Guess not.
Taliesin: I'm a bit busy. I am making more ammo. I'm working on a few projects that have been rolling around in my head for quite some time now.
Orion: (whispers) Don't forget the bolt.
Taliesin: The bolt is on the list, yes.
Laura: Quite the worker.
Taliesin: I've got a lot to do.
Laura: Yes. Darling...
Taliesin: How many of you are down here right now?
Travis: I think we're all here. I'm moving through his stuff.
Laura: I let Trinket forage around the courtyard, so he's not down here at the moment.
Liam: I think we need a little history lesson here--
Taliesin: Grog, don't touch that!
Travis: Why not? But it moves!
Laura: Don't touch anything.
Orion: Matthew, I took some fine meats before I left and I'm feeding them to Lockheed along the way.
Matt: Okay. Lockheed enjoys them thoroughly. They're delicious. Comfort food crafted by the finest of cooks in Greyskull Keep.
Marisha: Percy, it's hard not to clearly notice that you're quite distressed, and we're concerned. And you know, we were talking about it-- not that we were talking about you or anything, behind your back or anything-- but we never really found out why you were in that prison cell when we found you.
Liam: We've never questioned it before. We've never wanted to make you uncomfortable. But we're about to walk into a party, and I feel like we need a bit of a history lesson.
Taliesin: Ugh. I know you're right. (sighs)
Travis: Should we guess? Was it public nudity?
Taliesin: A bit. I've never had to say this out loud before. I've never actually had this discussion with anyone.
Sam: It's okay. It gets better.
Taliesin: Do I get an inspiration die for that?
Matt: I'll give you a d6 inspiration die. (laughter)
Taliesin: The Briarwoods, Lord and Lady Briarwood, are responsible for the death of my entire family. Whitestone was my home. Many years ago-- I don't want to get into the details. I came from a big family. I came from a proud family. One night, they were invited into our home, and over the course of that night, they slaughtered everybody. They are evil. They are corrupting. The few survivors of Castle Whitestone who did survive only survived through deceit and by working for the Briarwoods, turning on their masters. Thankfully, the de Rolo family still has standing elsewhere, and there's other branches of the family other than my father's. (sighs) I was lost for quite a while after that happened. I had nothing else in my life other than my family. I was never really going to inherit anything. I was not going to run anything. I was idle. And at some point, I made the decision that, if nothing else, I survived to, maybe, extract some vengeance. Maybe set something right. Maybe stop whatever it was that they were doing. I don't know. There was one of their party, Dr. Ripley. She was in charge of something during the murder. I don't know what. I chased her. I chased her down. It took a year, and I had my gun, and I discovered where she was and where she was working on some ruins, and I approached her. I never even saw her face. Her guards captured me, beat me up. Didn't even bother taking my things. They just threw me in that dungeon. I never even got close enough to see her face.
Sam: You know her name, but you've never seen her before?
Taliesin: I saw her when she was interrogating me in my home.
Sam: Oh, so you could recognize her.
Taliesin: Oh yes.
Laura: How did you get away when they-- with the rest of your family?
Taliesin: My sister Cassandra, my younger sister. She somehow evaded capture. I don't know how. She set me free. I don't know what became of her. I don't know what became of any of my siblings. Probably nothing reasonable. Nothing good.
Liam: You witnessed none of these deaths?
Taliesin: I saw bodies of a few of them. It's all a bit shady. It's all a bit of a blur.
Sam: How many years ago was this?
Taliesin: (sighs) Four now. Five now.
Laura: If you know that they murdered your family, how are they still part of society?
Taliesin: I don't know. (sighs) I could have gone home. I could have gone home at any point, at this point. I'm scared.
Marisha: Did they take over Whitestone? Are they still there?
Taliesin: I discovered approximately a week ago that they're still at Whitestone.
Laura: Will they recognize you?
Taliesin: I don't know.
Travis: And these pricks are in good standing with the council?
Taliesin: (sighs) I don't know what to do. I'm preparing for anything. When I got thrown into that dungeon, I came to the realization that maybe I wasn't doing this the right way. I wasn't being responsible, and I prayed to whatever it is I pray to that maybe I would have a sign of what I should be doing, and then there you were. I've been trusting that Vox Machina will take me where I need to go, and maybe what I need to do is confront this, but I don't know what this is, and I'm terrified.
Liam: And the remains of your family, were they killed by the sword?
Taliesin: I don't know. There was an interrogation. Dr. Ripley was asking questions. I assumed, for all these years, that that's what became of my family.
Marisha: What was she asking questions about? What did they want? Was it just a political coup?
Taliesin: Asking questions about the castle, about things about the castle. It was a long time ago, and I was not equipped for torture. I don't remember much.
Travis: Do you want them dead?
Taliesin: I think so.
Laura: Should we interrogate them first? Find out more about your family?
Travis: Or just skip ahead to the dead part?
Taliesin: I put down my gun, and I turn the barrel, and of the six barrels, five of them have names, and Lord and Lady Briarwood are two of those names. Dr. Ripley is another.
Sam: What are the other ones?
Taliesin: Sir Stonefell is the other, and Professor Anders is the other, and then there's one blank one.
Laura: Are they all members of the same party? They travel with the Briarwoods?
Taliesin: I don't know.
Marisha: Wait, what were the names? The Briarwoods, Ripley, Sir Kerrion Stonefell. Who is he?
Taliesin: He was the captain of their guard.
Marisha: And Professor Anders? Who's that?
Taliesin: Professor Anders was my teacher. He was my tutor, and he was in collusion with them, and he was the one that I believe allowed them to take the castle in the night.
Marisha: And do you remember why they were invited to Whitestone to begin with?
Taliesin: They were traveling. They were on the road. It was my brother Julius and my sister Vesper who handled matters of court. I was studying. I didn't think.
Marisha: And how many brothers and sisters do you have?
Taliesin: I had six.
Laura: You might have six. We don't know what happened to them.
Marisha: You said you saw a few bodies of family?
Taliesin: It's all very much a blur. (sighs) There's things you just forget.
Sam: Well, this is certainly tragic, but looking forward, what do we know of this meeting? Event? Party? What are we doing?
Laura: Well, I think we need to do some spying.
Sam: Well, do they know Percy's among us?
Laura: That's the thing. I don't know if they do.
Taliesin: You don't have to get involved in this.
Laura: Oh, we are so involved.
Travis: (laughing) Yeah, we do. You said you want them dead.
Laura: We've got your back, darling.
Liam: Percival, you don't really have a choice in the matter. My sister and I know a little piece of your pain. I'm not going to get into it, but there's nothing she and I can do. We can find reparations for you. We will.
Marisha: Percy, is this what you want?
Taliesin: There's only one way to find out.
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: And if we kill them, how much will you pay us? Just kidding. We ask other people that.
Laura: Something I do need to know. Percy. If we see them, and we're not ready to show our faces, will you be able to contain yourself?
Taliesin: I think so.
Marisha: And would they be able to recognize your face?
Taliesin: Which is why I was planning on-- I know we have a cap of disguise.
Travis: Oh! We do.
Laura: Scanlan has it.
Taliesin: I don't even know if they would recognize me. My hair was different.
Laura: Less purple?
Sam: We could go into town, and find you a bushy mustache. It's worked for me many times.
Taliesin: I don't think I wear one as well as you do.
Liam: How does that cap work?
Sam: Well, that cap is more of a hat. While wearing this hat you can use an action to cast Disguise spell. Oh. Cast a Disguise spell? Do you have to be a spellcaster to use it?
Matt: You do not have to, no.
Sam: Okay.
Travis: I see a shiny tool. I don't know what it does.
Matt: You reach over and grab it, and it's a large set of tongs, used for gripping large, heavy pieces of metal, either for the actual forge itself, or to bend and manipulate on the workbench.
Travis: I take it (yawns) and put it in the Bag of Holding.
Matt: Make a sleight of hand check.
Marisha: Stealing from the workshop that you partially own?
Travis: There are lots of cool stuff in there! What was the check?
Matt: Sleight of hand.
Travis: Where's sleight of hand-- 17!
Laura: My passive perception is 21.
Taliesin: No, this could be funny, let this happen.
Laura: I give him the evil eye.
Matt: She gives you the evil eye.
Travis: It hurts. I put it back.
Taliesin: Out of curiosity, what did you pick up, what did it look like?
Travis: It was a big thing of tongs. I didn't know what it did, I just wanted it.
Taliesin: A big thing of tongs? What would I have to roll to find out if it was covered in some basic sulfuric acid? If it was one of the things I was using for casting.
Matt: Ah, interesting. You know your tools very well in your workshop, and yeah, the metal is scarred and pockmarked from use with the various corrosive chemicals.
Taliesin: That'll take about ten minutes to take effect. All right. (gasping)
Orion: Stupid.
Laura: You're not there.
Sam: Well this Hat of Disguise, Percival, it requires some attunement. I don't know how capable you are with magical items.
Taliesin: I can find out.
Liam: We got seven days. I can make you look like anything. I can talk to the right people and get you the right paperwork and you can be anyone and no one will know a fucking difference.
Marisha: Calm down there.
Taliesin: I can forge paperwork, as well.
Laura: Oh yes, he can. He's actually the guy we go to.
Marisha: He is that guy you meet on the corner of Sandy Alley.
Sam: I can make us all into birds.
Travis: Are we supposed to go meet with the council right away?
Taliesin: No, in a week.
Sam: What do we do in the week? Prepare. Recon?
Laura: We can do things. How long of a ride is it to Kraghammer?
Matt: To Kraghammer, on horseback? It's about two and a half days.
Laura: Solo style, if you're fast, and back?
Matt: Fast and back? I'd say just under two days, probably.
Taliesin: How about the giant eagle flies?
Marisha: Yeah, what if you're flying?
Matt: I'd say, well, the horse is probably a little bit faster than the eagle.
Laura: But you don't have to stick to the road as an eagle.
Matt: I'd say it'd put you there about the same pace, about two days on eagle, because you can just go straight through. I mean, you want to take the road because you know that there's a lot of dangerous things that wander the wild that are between there.
Laura: What do you think? Is it stupid to go and ride hard and try to get there and back before--?
Sam: Wait, we're going to get cash and come back?
Laura: We don't all have to go. A couple of us can make a fast ride.
Marisha: Tiberius is working on it, I have a feeling deep down inside.
Orion: (laughs) Why would you say that?
Matt: You know I deduct points for metagaming.
Orion: I didn't do anything!
Taliesin: I agree we should send someone for the money. I agree.
Sam: And it won't take us a whole week to prepare for this party. All we need is a couple disguises.
Marisha: Yeah, but we need to do research. You barely know who the Briarwoods are.
Liam: We don't know if these people are straight up gangster, or if there's something supernatural, seriously supernatural, about them. That hat would probably work on 80% of people, but I don't know. We don't know anything about them.
Marisha: Well, they're not going to recognize any of us, are they?
Sam: We could go do some recon.
Travis: Besides, have we seen all the brothels in Emon? I don't think so.
Sam: We should do some research, some reconnaissance while someone goes for the money.
Laura: Or should we wait? I really want the money.
Taliesin: People get married in my family for money. I think it's perfectly reasonable.
Sam: Listen, we could all go get the money and be back in four days, right?
Laura: No, because some people need to do some work. We need to send some people off.
Sam: Split the party?
Liam: Yes.
Laura: Hopefully be back in time.
Taliesin: There's four days. We can each do our part. Five days.
Liam: Keyleth, can you-- Kiki.
Marisha: Yes? Sorry.
Liam: Can you and Scanlan fly to Kraghammer?
Marisha: Yes. I would like to stop and talk to Gilmore first, though, before I leave. Do I have time for that? I can fly.
Laura: Our illustrious god just told us it's better to stick to the road because there's bad things--
Marisha: In the air? There's air traffic? I have to worry about air traffic?
Matt: By horseback, you want to stick to the road. By air--
Sam: By air, though. Check yourself, Kiki--
Marisha: What?
Sam: You, I would assume, use Polymorph as I do.
Marisha: No, I use my Beast Shaping.
Sam: Ooh. That's so sexy. Does that last for longer than a day?
Marisha: It lasts as long as I want it to last.
Sam: Damn!
Travis: I go up to the kitchen and look for something to eat.
Marisha: It's in my blood.
Sam: You can be an animal as long as you want?
Marisha: Where are you going with this, Scanlan?
Matt: You can stay in Beast Shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level. Five hours right now, you can transform for.
Marisha: So when I mean as long as I want, I mean, long enough to where I've never had to really think about it before now.
Sam: Well then, like me, flying there would not be an option. We'd have to stop, rest, walk, sleep.
Laura: Yeah, that would slow it down a lot.
Marisha: Well, I could get ten hours, because I can use two Beast Shaping abilities.
Laura: But that's still a two days' flight--
Liam: Two days is the horse, riding hard. What about an eagle?
Marisha: No, I get my druid shapes back after a short rest.
Laura: Oh, okay.
Marisha: Because Circle of the Moon, bitch.
Matt: So you could Beast Shape twice, rest 30 minutes, Beast Shape twice.
Marisha: Can I make a stop first, and then I'll run an errand?
Liam: We don't really have a lot of money at the moment.
Laura: She might have some.
Marisha: Yeah, I've got my personal fundsies.
Taliesin: Can you leave me an earpiece so that I can keep in contact? I'm not leaving my workshop.
Marisha: I have an earpiece, right?
Laura: We'll leave you alone, Percy. To work.
Marisha: Is there anything else you need from us, Percy? Is there anything you need while I'm out and about?
Taliesin: Leave me an earpiece, and I'll call if I need anything else.
Travis: Percy, is there anything in this shop that you want in the Bag of Holding for later?
Taliesin: Not yet. Thank you, Grog.
Laura: Do you not have an earpiece?
Travis: I'll give him mine.
Taliesin: How many minutes has it been? I'm wondering if his hands are starting to itch yet.
Matt: About this time, you start to get this weird tingling sensation around your fingers.
Travis: Do they crave blood?
Matt: No, they crave some sort of an agent that will prevent the now slight burning sensation.
Travis: Ow. Quick question. Sorry, I kept something from falling in the shop-- really quick reflexes-- it's making my bits tingle. Do you have anything for that?
Liam: You haven't been scratching yourself, have you?
Travis: No, I had that before. Not the same thing.
Taliesin: There's a bucket of water in the corner. You can try that.
Travis: I go over to the bucket of water and I stick my hands in the water.
Taliesin: It'll make it worse.
Matt: It does. The slight burning sensation now has turned into a very vibrant burning white hot on the skin, and you can see bits of the skin start to peel back a little bit, beginning on the edges.
Taliesin: I hand him a small bag of powder. Now you've learned not to touch things if you don't know what they are.
Travis: What do I do with a bag of powder?
Taliesin: I pour the powder on his hands.
Matt: It foams up a little bit in places, but it is neutralized.
Travis: Yeah.
Taliesin: You're a good friend.
Travis: Can I leave now? I go to the kitchen to eat.
Matt: All righty. You easily get another meal mustered for you.
Marisha: I'm going to go make a trip to Gilmore's. Anybody want to join?
Liam: I should probably tag along.
Sam: I'll come, too.
Matt: You're working in the workshop, you're eating, you guys are going to Gilmore's. All right. So as this is happening, Tiberius, you make your way over to the Alabaster Lyceum. You come up to the front main area of the structure itself. It's an arcane college. You make your way to the front clerk, who looks up to you, a nice young fellow, looks like he's trying to work through his credit in school through his training. He's dressed in the ceremonial robes of somebody who is a student, who is currently stuck with the job of working as a clerk. He's like, "Hi, can I help you?"
Orion: Yes, hi, if you do not remember me, I am Tiberius Stormwind, from Draconia. Moreover, Vox Machina, over at Greyskull Keep.
Matt: "Where have I heard that--"
Orion: Well, we told you multiple times before. We met with you using your sigil of teleport-- it's fine. I've come here on a matter of business anyway, so that's neither here nor there. I was wondering if I may procure an address, or number as it were, for a sigil to Kraghammer. I believe the Thunderbrands would have some facility near theirs or on their own premises where their sigil could be channeled through the Circle of Teleportation spell.
Matt: "If you're talking about sigils for teleportation, you would probably have to discuss that with Gatekeeper Xanthas."
Orion: Where is he? I thought that was you.
Matt: "No. I'm the clerk. I run the front of the-- follow me." And he gets up and leads you further into the structure to the central circular room, the white-marbled room that contains all the doors around, and in the center there is the Traverse Junction. This is the place you guys have stumbled into every single time you've teleported back to Emon. And there you see the elven wizard who you recently bothered naught but maybe five hours ago, who is currently setting up some sheets, comes back. "Oh. Hello, again."
Orion: Hi. I'm Tiberius Stormwind, from Draconia. Moreover, Vox Machina over at Greyskull Keep. I was wondering-- and I asked your clerk here because I thought he did what you actually do here-- if I may procure, for coin or perhaps some kind of favor of sorts, the address or number or code or whatever it is that would work for the Kraghammer sigil of my Circle of Teleportation.
Matt: "I get an understanding here that you're seeking access to one of our many sigil-based rooms of transference. Those rooms are currently under very protected lock and key, approval by the headmaster Thurmond Adalum himself."
Orion: Okay, where is he?
Marisha: Oh my god. It's like calling Time Warner Cable.
Orion: Can you take me to him? Where is he at?
Matt: Glances over at the clerk, who goes, "Right this way, Mr. Stormwind." He leads you back to a long, long hallway with arched ceiling. You can see the marble itself has these carvings and sculptures of various dead-looking faces of long-passed mages that either were built or held in high esteem in the halls of this lyceum. At the very end, it opens up into a pretty well-decorated, almost over-the-top decorated office room for the headmaster himself. The interior is lined with large, large 15, 20-foot-tall bookshelves around this oval room with sliding ladders that are attached to them that slowly glide on their own, like they're on some sort of arcane-based pattern that puts them back and forth. There is a large chandelier of brightly colored orbs that sits 35, 40 feet in the air, that slowly rotates on its own that keeps this slowly fluctuating changing color of the room. And in the center there is a circular desk, and sitting there at the desk you can see is Headmaster Thurmond, who is this extremely elderly human male. Shaved face, very short, curved bald head with a little bit of hair in the back, hunched forward and is currently collecting a series of books into his arms. Looks like he's about to get up. And he turns and looks over. "Can I help you?"
Orion: Hello.
Orion: I'm Tiberius Stormwind from Draconia.
Sam: I'm Tiberius Stormwind from Draconia.
Orion: Moreover, Vox Machina over at Greyskull Keep here in Emon. We are the saviors of this town and whatnot. Anyway, that's neither here nor there. I went through this fellow, who I thought was the job of this fellow, but it wasn't either of those jobs, it was you who I've been needing to talk to, I'm assuming?
Matt: "What do you require from me, then?"
Orion: I'm hoping to procure an address or access to the sigils of Kraghammer through my Circle of Teleportation spell and whatnot using your arcane gates. That's about it. (laughter)
Sam: Well put!
Matt: "If you're asking for access to one of our closely guarded sigils for the Thunderbrands, you say, within Kraghammer?"
Orion: Yes, yes. We'll have to speak with them as well.
Matt: "Well, then I will-- just one moment." And he reaches into a pouch and pulls out this mirror, this oval mirror and sets it onto his desk. Reaches underneath and pulls out a small chest. Opens up the chest, and you can see in this chest that there are probably two dozen of these tiny little marbles, all different colors, some different shapes, and he goes, these little labels you can't really see from your perspective. He takes one out, places it in the top of the mirror, and as he does, the mirror all of a sudden shimmers for a second, and what was originally a normal reflection is now this light, glowing blue, slightly glowing water-like surface. He takes it and lifts it up to himself. "Hello. Hello? Hello!" A moment later, you hear this distant voice echoing with this strange warbling filter over it. "I'm coming, what's taking your time. Yes, Headmaster, what do you require?" "Well, there's a gentleman here, dragonborn, who is requesting use of your sigil of teleportation. Do you know this gentleman?" Turns it around, and you can see in there, this is the same long-bearded dwarven individual that met you at the actual Thunderbrand house, and had a bit of an argument with you early in your travels in Kraghammer.
Orion: We've got things for you, this time, like we said we would get for you. In the Underdark. It's really inconvenient, but we have things that we need to get to you quickly.
Matt: "Now, listen here. Last we spoke, you and your friends stormed into our lair, nearly destroyed our precious arcane defenses of our homestead--"
Orion: He was drinking. He's an alcoholic. He's got help since then.
Matt: Make a deception check.
Orion: What is it?
Matt: This is deception. Well, you are an alcoholic, but that wasn't what he meant.
Orion: 20.
Matt: 20. (laughs) He goes, "Either way, we can't just let anyone willy-nilly knowing how to directly appear in the center of our homestead."
Orion: (in same accent as Matt) Of course. Oh, sorry, I started to sound like you. (laughter)
Taliesin: Bring me another accent, aye.
Orion: Of course. I wouldn't expect you to. I'm Tiberius Stormwind, from Draconia. My father Kruvanis Stormwind has helped the Council for over two generations. We come from a noble house, and I give you my word that I will never abuse-- abuse?-- however you pronounce it in your tongue. The privilege of quickly traveling to your stead to do business with you, and there would be no other intrusion otherwise. I guarantee it as my name as a Stormwind.
Matt: Make a persuasion roll.
Sam: Chief negotiator!
Orion: That's 11.
Matt: 11. His head turns to the side a little bit, peering through you with a slight scowl. "Last we talked, the reason we didn't report you to the guard for breaking through our defenses was you promised to look beneath the city and bring back various artifacts you were in search of."
Orion: Ooh, we found one!
Matt: "Did you, now?"
Orion: A couple, yes. And we killed a bunch of those buttholes.
Matt: "Can I see one of these artifacts?"
Orion: I don't have it on me right now.
Matt: "We're done here, Headmaster." And the mirror shimmers and closes suddenly.
Marisha: Wait. No?
Liam: Good try!
Laura: We can bring-- oh, we're not there.
Matt: The headmaster takes the marble out and says, "I'm sorry that didn't seem to go your way."
Orion: It's fine, Headmaster. I'll be back in about 15 minutes with the proper proof that we did procure the things that the man, that needed to have proof, did. Excuse me! And I get the hell out of there. And as soon as I get out of there, I cast Fly on myself, and I Gandalf (whoosh) right back to the keep.
Matt: All righty. You're eating. You're crafting. Are you going with the rest of them to Gilmore?
Laura: I don't know. I guess so.
Matt: All right. You guys make your way to the outside of Gilmore's Glorious Goods.
Sam: As we walk, do we see Tiberius fly over our heads?
Laura: Actually, I'm staying at the Keep.
Orion: Well, Travis is my target, right? Are you still at the Keep?
Travis: Yeah, I'm eating.
Matt: As far as time goes, you haven't quite gotten to that point yet, for these guys. You get to Gilmore's. You enter the interior. You can see that for the most part, there aren't a lot of people in here. It's getting later in the day, and a lot of the customer business seems to be happening almost earlier, either pre-noon, or around noon. There's no current sign of Gilmore. You do see, across the way-- what's her name, again?
Marisha: Sherri.
Matt: Thank you. Sherri, the mousy helper who runs the shop in Gilmore's absence, or at least runs the first portion of it, with her thick glasses up on her nose, and she's sitting there with her elbows over the top of the main desk. She looks up as you enter, and takes her glasses and pokes them for a second. "Hello? Hi."
Liam: Do you remember us?
Matt: "Right, I do."
Marisha: From Vox Machina? We're sponsored by Gilmore. He put the brand on my armor that my mother gave me.
Matt: "And you should be wearing it proudly, yes? Now, what can I help you with?"
Sam: Well, is Gilmore around?
Liam: Yes, I was hoping to catch up with him. We've been gone a while, and I was hoping to trade news with Glorious Gilmore. Is he not in at the moment?
Matt: "Gilmore's in Westruun, currently setting up the expansion of the Gilmore's Glorious Goods business. If this is important, I can certainly summon him here."
Liam: I'd hate to pull him away from business. I don't want to get in the way of his business. I mean, I am rather sad not to see him, but no, I don't think that would be a course of action we'd want to take. Let him continue to set up.
Matt: "All right, I suppose."
Liam: Can you get a message to him, though?
Matt: "Yes, I can, actually."
Liam: Well, tell him Vax'ildan and friends visited. We're in the city for a week.
Matt: She pulls out a small sheet of what looks like a rough-around-the-edges piece of parchment, and starts the inkwell, scribbling down.
Liam: Vax'ildan. That's with an A, not an E. We're here for a week. I don't know if he's going to be back from Westruun before then, but if he is, tell him to get word to me. I'm very interested in exchanging news for the past few weeks.
Matt: "All right." (foreign words) It flashes and disappears in front of her. "Well then, he'll be receiving the message right about now. We'll pass that on, and whenever he returns, I'm certain he will get back to you and deal with whatever business is necessary."
Liam: Thank you. We're here late in the day; are you still open for business?
Matt: "We are open, yes."
Marisha: I was just curious if you guys had a chance to think about the alchemy workshop that we talked about before, or if you maybe had any alchemy books that came in that I was requesting?
Matt: "It's possible. We haven't completely restocked the shelves, as of late. I know we had some new things come in. I can go check." And as she turns, all of a sudden there's a large, vibrant, white flash of light and a sound from the back room. The beaded curtains shift, for a second, and you hear heavy footsteps. And pushing through the beaded curtain, you see before you, with a bead of sweat on his head, Gilmore! "I'm so glad you came back!"
Sam: Gilmore!
Marisha: Gilmore!
Matt: "I'm sorry. I was out and about, running some business a ways away."
Liam: You didn't have to go to all that trouble to come back here.
Matt: "How could I miss seeing my fine-- there's not as many of you as usual."
Liam: No, we're seeing to different bits of business. I turn back to him, I walk forward with hands out. I walk up to him, take him by the head, give him a good European-style kiss just about here-- right there-- come back, and say, there is so much to talk about. Where can we be alone?
Matt: He looks over at the rest of the group. "Well, I mean--" (laughter) MATT "But of course."
Liam: See to whatever business you need to.
Sam: We'll just peruse, yeah. We'll window shop.
Matt: He walks back through the beaded curtain, giving you this look over his shoulder. As he does, the curtain falls behind him.
Liam: Those beads.
Travis: Oh jeez!
Liam: I walk right in. Follow him in.
Matt: And you can see now, as the glow gently fades, there is a rug that is pushed to the side, and on the floor of his room there is a familiar sigil, similar to the one that you've seen Tiberius scrawl before in some of his spells. That's apparently how he got here so quickly. But he walks in, and he kicks the rug back over it, sits down on the edge of his bed, puts his hands up and goes, "What seems to be troubling you?"
Liam: I walk over and I sit down opposite him, and I say: Before we talk about anything, I feel like I should apologize because although we didn't have any sort of written agreement, you and I are friends, aren't we?
Matt: "Yes."
Liam: And I was supposed to help bring your brand wherever we went. And I thought that would be possible. We came back from the Underdark. We had a very hard time, some of the hardest weeks of my life. I haven't delivered on my promise. And I mean to, but I haven't yet. I apologize wholeheartedly. I'm sorry.
Matt: "That's all right. I understand  people grow busy. There are things you must tend to, and that's all right. And I appreciate you being so honest, I really do."
Liam: In addition to that, I am changed, and promises mean more to me, even more than they did before. And I promise to follow through. In the interest of time for the game, DM, Vax tells the whole story of the Underdark, of the horn, of how close it was.
Marisha: Ugh, what is taking him so long, Scanlan?
Sam: I don't know.
Matt: While that's happening, the rest of you are left there awkwardly staring about.
Marisha: Did Sherri find my book? Sherri?
Matt: A few minutes go by. Sherri comes back. She brings two books over. "Best I can tell, these may be what you're looking for? I can't quite--" She sets them down. One is a book that is the properties of various liquids, chemicals, and things that are found on this plane and otherwise. It's a good way to locate and identify phantom liquids, should you come across any.
Marisha: That would be good for Scanlan.
Taliesin: He is the source of a lot of phantom liquids.
Matt: The other book appears to have a section about alchemy. It's essentially almost a beginner's guide, but it's a very, very easy-to-follow introduction to a number of various low-level sorceries and the creation of low-level spell components preparing them for use with spell-casting, and there is a chapter on a little bit of alchemy.
Marisha: Okay, how much are these, Sherri?
Matt: "They haven't been priced, yet."
Marisha: I mean, they're-- they're all right.
Laura: Good going, Keyleth! I like it!
Matt: "25 gold, each."
Marisha: 25 gold, each? Oh, come on. I know some university student dropped these off and donated these. Don't kid me, Sherri. Am I doing it right? Do I sound like Vex?
Matt: Make a persuasion roll.
Marisha: Damn it!
Taliesin: I was about to say, make her do a persuasion roll, it'd be funny.
Sam: Unforced error.
Taliesin: I'm sorry! (laughter)
Liam: I spoke too soon!
Travis: So perfect! So perfect for you.
Matt: She reaches out and takes the books and slides them back, and says, "Well, if that's how you feel, perhaps these can be returned to those university students that perhaps left them by. I should put these in the lost and found."
Marisha: Sherri!
Sam: Sherri. If I may. What Keyleth was trying to say was that she never got a chance to go to college, and that she wanted to get that university experience.
Matt: "Good luck."
Sam: Well, that didn't work. Hey, can you serve me, now?
Marisha: (whispering) Scanlan. Scanlan! Will you buy those books for me, and I'll reimburse you?
Matt: "I can hear you. I'm right here." (laughter)
Travis: Walk away!
Matt: "Yes, I'm happy to help you."
Sam: I was wondering if you had a small box of some sort that could carry a magical item, and perhaps shield it from detection.
Matt: "That? Yes, we do have a couple of those. Hold on." She darts up the stairway in the other room and goes to the second floor. A few moments later, she comes back down with these two small chests-- they're about that big, each. One's a lighter wood color, the other is painted black all over. "We have both of these. They should shield something of this size from most low-level magical detections. These will run you about 200 gold apiece."
Sam: I just need one. You're a woman of the world, and I'm sure you have fine taste, judging by your appearance. It is quite fine, if I may say so myself. If I were a little taller, I would probably ask you out on a date.
Matt: "If you were a little taller, yes."
Marisha: Sherri is sassy today!
Orion: She's full of sass!
Sam: Which one is the fancier of the two?
Matt: "Well, looking at these, this one--" She points to the one that looks like just a casual, wood chest. "This would be easier to hide in plain sight amongst the rest of your furniture. This one, however, would be difficult to locate in a more shaded, or lightless, circumstance."
Sam: Hm. I want ostentatiousness.
Matt: "Then perhaps this one?"
Sam: Yes, please. That. Thanks. Thank you. 200 to you. Also, I know Gilmore is otherwise entertained. Can you try to identify something for me? Do you have that-- I mean, judging by the glint in your eye and beauty in your heart, I'm sure you have many skills I don't know about, but I'm wondering if you could identify this small, red vial with a floating something in it, that I procured quite some time ago! Do you remember that?
Matt: Yes. This vial, if I recall, it has this small--
Sam: Have I tried this, once before?
Matt: No, this is the one that was found--
Sam: Me and Pike found some stuff in somebody's house? I don't even remember, this was a year ago.
Matt: Right. Yes, okay. There we go. And make a persuasion roll, actually, on this one.
Sam: A lot.
Taliesin: Oh, look  a real roll.
Marisha: Shut up.
Sam: Persuasion? It's 35. Wait, 31. 31.
Travis: Matt just visited his mind palace.
Matt: She looks at you, and goes, "You have been good patrons, and you have been much kinder to me than others. We'll put this one on the house. We'll call this on the house." And as she takes the vial, sets it down, and she pulls out another book that she shuffles through, puts it up, turns through a few pages, until, looking through, "This here would be a Potion of Fire Breath. When imbibed, it should give you a temporary time period of the ability to breathe fire, much like a relatively young dragon. This one in particular is fire. There are many different vials like this that pertain to different colorations of dragon, but this one is specifically for the red."
Sam: Thank you so much. Thank you. Well, thank you so much. Two more questions, then I'll leave you alone. One: where can I go get business cards printed up, in this town? It's a calling card? Never mind! Forget it.
Matt: "Like a flyer?"
Sam: Yes!
Matt: "Those can be printed. There is a-- actually, a pretty well-designed print facility not that far up the road."
Sam: Oh, great! Thank you; I'll go investigate that. And one other thing: you know those books that my friend was asking about? Could we maybe make those happen for her? I know that you had quoted her a low, low price of 25. I'd be prepared to pay even more than that for them. And compose you a little song about yourself.
Matt: At which point, for the first time since the entire time you've been in the shop of Gilmore's Glorious Goods, you see a slight grin creep across her lips. She goes, "How could a lady say no to a song? 25 gold! The price stands."
Sam: So I have to pay you and sing to you?
Matt: "We run a business, here, yes."
Sam: All right.
Matt: She pulls the books out.
Sam: I bring out my-- something. (laughter)
Sam: (sings) Sherri baby, Sherri baby, Sherri, won't you come home tonight? Come home tonight? You better ask your mama. Tell her you're without a gnome! Why don't you come home to my keep!
Matt: "Pay for the books!"
Sam: Okay, here you go!
Matt: You can see, her face is flushed and she, (clears throat).
Marisha: I Druidcraft a flower real quick and slip it to Scanlan to give to her.
Sam: Oh! Here you are.
Matt: "Thank you."
Travis: (gasps) Did she blush?
Matt: She's red in the face. At this point in time, the beaded curtains reopen. Have you finished the conversation, or do you want to keep going?
Liam: No. After ten minutes of finishing all that, of telling every tiny detail, if you mind me backtracking, I briefly place my hand on top of his, and say, it was terrible. I've never seen anything like it. Now we're back. We're in our home, and I'm hoping to learn how Uriel is doing, how the city is faring. Is there any news? Things are ill in Kraghammer; they still haven't seen the last of their troubles, but I'm also concerned for our new home here.
Matt: "As far as I'm aware, this city has been doing rather well. Since Winter's Crest just this previous year, trade has been booming, we're opening up pathways all across the continent, we've improved relations with many other distant kingdoms, and I'm opening a second shop! I mean, that's amazing! And who would've thought?"
Liam: And Westruun, how's it going?
Matt: "So far, so good. We're going through the construction process, and I'm making sure that I have a rather supple income of artifacts and oddities that I have to sell at both locations. I have to widen my input of various items and--"
Liam: You're a busy man.
Matt: "Oh, yes."
Liam: Have you any time for leisure?
Matt: "Eventually." You can see, he's a little more worn than you've seen Gilmore before. He's still Gilmore, and he's excited, but after the tale you told him and opening the second shop has been a little rough on him, and his jovial self is a little more wearied. Though he still looks fabulous.
Liam: You seem a tad weary. Is there anything I can do to help you?
Matt: "Just praise the brand. Praise the brand, young Vax."
Liam: That will happen. I did not even mean to discuss this, coming here, but I noticed, coming in, a sigil under your carpet. I had no intention of this, but we need to get back to Kraghammer in a bit of a hurry, and I certainly have no abilities, but do you remember my friend Tiberius? Dragonborn fellow?
Matt: "Yes! Yes, I remember him."
Liam: He needs to run an errand back in Kraghammer. Is there any way you could hook us up with a favor?
Matt: "What kind of favor?"
Liam: I just want to send the lizard to Dwarf Town. Do you think we could make that happen?
Marisha: "Send the lizard to Dwarf Town?" How many more slurs can you have in one sentence?
Matt: "My sigil here is for returning personal use. Did you hear that? There was some strange noise in the sky. This is for my return. As far as outgoing, most other sigils are-- well, they're up here. Looking for that, you're going to have to go to the Lyceum, I'm afraid."
Liam: Understood. I don't want to push my luck.
Matt: "However, if you're going to the Lyceum... I am owed a favor or two. Let me see what I can do, here." And he goes, and he pulls out another piece of similar paper and he writes a quick little note on the side, sends it up in the air, and it vanishes. He goes, "I've just done you a favor. Keep that in mind. You go to the Lyceum, you should have access to one of these sigils. Make sure you choose properly. You only have one."
Liam: I'm pretty magic-stupid.
Matt: "Then don't be the one that does it. Talk to your friend, this Tiberius fellow. He'll know what to do, I'm sure."
Liam: Correct. One last. It's small or it's boring, it's business. I need a dagger. I don't want one for free or anything; I want to purchase it, but we're a little low on funds. The reason Tiberius needs to go to Kraghammer is because we're owed a large sum of money.
Matt: "Right, you mentioned this last time, when you almost opened a line of Gilmore's Glorious Credit."
Laura: Mm-hm. I'm not there.
Liam: What would the credit entail?
Matt: "Previously, we discussed 25,000 gold pieces, the amount of which you were going to retrieve."
Liam: I was going to-- what was that?
Matt: "Retrieve."
Liam: Retrieve? God, I've been in the Underdark so long. What was the deal?
Matt: "The deal was since you did not have funds, and you had to retrieve this money from this 'Dwarf Town', as you so graciously put it, that you would borrow the money, at the time, and then pay me back within a month. Within a month."
Liam: Understood.
Marisha: Wait, is Gilmore trying to say we owe him money?
Liam: No. We almost did that. Correct, DM? That's what we almost did, but we didn't do it. You offered it.
Matt: Correct. You backed out last minute when you realized there was, apparently, hidden platinum--
Liam: I would be interested-- Gilmore? I really just need a quick favor, and I mean to pay you back quickly. I need a dagger for something. Not your best dagger. Not your shittiest dagger, either. I just need something nice. How much would a fine dagger cost? Something that would be good in a fight. And could I pay you back in a couple of days, once Tiberius returns from Kraghammer?
Matt: "If you want something functional, there are masterwork daggers out there. We do have base-level enchantments that give you a fine, honed edge and a balance that cannot be beaten for its price range. For that, I can easily give you one of our base-level enchanted items for no more than, friend discount included, 400 gold pieces."
Taliesin: That's a pretty good deal.
Liam: Can I please purchase three of those?
Matt: "You may!"
Liam: Done.
Matt: "All right! I'll get these right now!" He stands up, and now that there's some sort of business involved, he's completely renovated and recharged. He comes through the beaded curtain again. You guys see Gilmore burst out, like, (laughs) "We're in business!" And he goes into the next room, and back up the stairs, and takes a few moments. He comes back down with an armful of these daggers, and sets them down on the counter. "Three for you! That'll be 1,200 gold pieces, please."
Liam: I reach out and I give his cheek a little bubby-squeeze, and I clap him on the cheek, and say, I'm good on my word, and you're a good friend. Thank you, Gilmore.
Matt: "The least I could do. Pay me back. I'll find you."
Liam: I know you're good on your word.
Matt: "Indeed."
Liam: Keyleth? Scanlan?
Sam: Oh, yes! How'd it go in there? You're walking straight, so it couldn't have gone too well.
Liam: Very good. Warm in here.
Taliesin: That dagger's so sharp, it could cut the sexual tension.
Orion: Those are masterwork daggers?
Matt: They are plus-one enchanted daggers, yes.
Sam: Well, let's get out of here and go. Did you find us any--?
Liam: I'm good. No, everything's good here. Just not everywhere else.
Sam: Let's get out of here, go back to the keep.
Matt: At this point, now, Tiberius, you have coasted over the air, and as you come careening in, you hear (swishing sounds) and look down. Two crossbow bolts whiz past you.
Orion: It's me, you idiots!
Matt: At which you hear immediately, "Oh, sorry!" "Sorry! We're not used to having you bolt in from the skyline."
Orion: I'm in a hurry, sorry! (whoosh)
Matt: As you sweep past Shayne and Cordell, they both change their bolts, and they're both arguing with each other, like, "You should've seen it was him!" "Sorry." "Sorry, again!" You make your way into the courtyard, inside Greyskull Keep.
Travis: Why'd you miss?
Orion: I go into, I rush in to find him eating. (stammers) Quickly, quickly! And I go into the Bag of Holding and I take the item out that we need. What was it?
Travis: Well, we have a bunch of stuff.
Matt: You're not with him, there.
Laura: I walk into the room to see Tiberius throwing things out of the Bag of Holding, I'm assuming.
Orion: I can't, because I have to visualize what it is to pull it out.
Travis: Yeah, what are you looking for?
Liam: I'm using my earring on the walk home. Does it work? I don't know what the range is. Tiberius, can you hear me? Tibs?
Matt: You're pretty out of range at this point.
Travis: What are you looking for, Tiberius?
Orion: I've taken my hand out. When we were in the Underdark and one of the items that we procured while we were scavenging, and we looted it, and we could give it back to the Thunderbrand.
Travis: Oh! Pieces of the enemy? We get paid for it.
Laura: But there were artifacts that they wanted. I remember.
Marisha: They wanted a necklace, right?
Orion: Yes. And we found one or two of them.
Marisha: Found a necklace, who was supposed to go-- hang on, I'm finding it, I'm looking.
Travis: I've got two gold necklaces, two gold chalices, and two rubies.
Matt: It was actually a magical item, one that you may have equipped. It'll say in the description of the item that it has an inscription on the back.
Orion: I don't have it.
Travis: I don't have that shit.
Sam: Whoa, what? It was a necklace we're talking about?
Matt: Protection of some kind, if I recall. Amulet.
Laura: Oh, I don't have that. (gasps) Oh no! What if we gave it to Kima?
Orion: We didn't give it to them.
Laura: But Kima took some armor we found!
Sam: "Amulet of Natural Armor?"
Matt: Look in the description of the item. It should say underneath the name. It'll have the actual inscription written in the descriptor of the item.
Travis: Everybody look at your stuff. I look inside my Belt of Dwarvenkind, and it says "Badass."
Marisha: It's a sapphire pendant that should say, "To Lorna, my love."
Laura: (gasps) Oh!
Orion: That's what I reach in and grab. There you go! Keyleth. I mean, your highness. I like your hair.
Marisha: Thank you!
Orion: It looks cool.
Marisha: Thanks!
Matt: It is enchanted.
Marisha: It's not the one you're wearing, right, Scanlan?
Laura: No, I remember we found it and nobody equipped it.
Travis: I had it in the bag, yeah.
Orion: I take it out, and I put it in mine. Grog, I'm finding out a way, as soon as I can show this to you, fellow. I'm going to go into Kraghammer very, very fast as opposed to slowly, and it is, so we should leave right now.
Laura: Can I go with you?
Orion: Yeah, and I'll cast-- because, who was around, just them two?
Matt: Just those two.
Orion: I cast Fly again at 3rd or 4th level, to cast on them.
Travis: I don't want to go!
Matt: Now, all of a sudden, you're (whoosh) lifted up in the air.
Orion: Yes, but we get there much faster if we fly. And I go.
Laura: And I take off after him!
Travis: What if I want to stay?
Orion: You can stay.
Travis: But I'm fucking floating above my meal! No! This is bullshit. And I'm bouncing off the ceiling and shit. Can I control myself?
Matt: You can. It takes a moment to adjust to it.
Travis: I just start trying to swim down to my plate.
Matt: It takes you a little bit, but you do eventually get control of it.
Travis: (eating noises) This isn't so bad. (farting noise)
Matt: Propulsion does work.
Laura: As we're flying, can I keep an eye out for our party members that are returning?
Matt: Yep. And as you guys coast over, you see, leaving the exterior wall gate to the south side of Emon, you see the rest of your party walking back towards the keep.
Laura: That means we're close enough. Brother!
Liam: Hello?
Laura: We're heading to the portal, Tiberius is working on something. We can get there faster! I'll be back soon.
Liam: Oh, all right. Gilmore has an in  he said we just need to mention his name and we're through. We can send Tiberius through.
Laura: Brilliant!
Orion: Ooh, that gives me a wonderful idea! And then, I'll cast it at 4th level again, and I'll go (pew-pew!) and cast it on--
Marisha: Just because I think it's funny-- Grog is flying over too, right?
Travis: I'm in that kitchen, floating around, farting and eating food. Look, I've got priorities.
Marisha: Okay, well, I see you guys are flying? The two of you?
Matt: So you fly down and cast Fly on the rest of them?
Orion: Right. Come on, follow me!
Liam: Holy shit, I've never flown before! This is amazing!
Sam: I'm flying, too? What's happening?
Matt: You guys are now floating. You guys are floating, as well. You're coasting over Emon for roughly 12 or so seconds before Grog, you drop to the ground, and now Tiberius and Vex, you begin to plummet.
Laura: Why are we plummeting?
Matt: Fly is a concentration spell. You cast it again. Your amulet keeps it up for two rounds, which is 12 seconds, and then the previous Fly spell deteriorates.
Orion: What about my circlet?
Matt: That's what I'm saying. The circlet lets you maintain concentration for two additional rounds.
Laura: Oh, okay! Tiberius, I'm falling!
Orion: I cast Fly again at 6th-level on everybody else.
Sam: I start falling.
Orion: No, because I can catch everybody.
Matt: At that point, now all of you guys are flying.
Orion: You fall in the kitchen, though.
Travis: Well, that makes sense.
Liam: Is this going to stick, Tiberius?
Orion: Yes. It's the same spell. I just really need a nap after this. I really need a nap after this. I go back to gather them all.
Matt: You make your way. Now, all of you following Tiberius, you coast down to the Alabaster Lyceum, landing right through the front area (whoosh), this whole party appears. Catch your feet, and there you see the same clerk looking up. "Ah, I see you've returned."
Orion: Yes. Can we not talk to the middle guy first? Can we go right to the last guy?
Matt: "Down that hallway. Follow it to the very end."
Orion: Thank you very much.
Matt: "You're welcome."
Orion: Follow me, everybody!
Matt: You all glide through the hallway, or walk, if you prefer. The end of the hallway, you open once again into the office, and there you see behind his desk once again, the headmaster Thurmond, who looks around. "Oh, yes. You've returned. I received the note from your friend Gilmore, and you're welcome to utilize one of our sigils."
Orion: Wonderful. That makes me quite happy.
Matt: "To Kraghammer, was it?"
Orion: Yes, but I do not want to use that favor for that sigil. I would like to call our friends, and I brought the item. I bring out the amulet. I want to show our friends in Kraghammer that we actually brought them the thing to get their permission to go on their sigil, and the other continent that we were on is called what?
Laura: Vasselheim?
Orion: Yes. The favor I would like for Gilmore is to get the Vasselheim sigil, please. But let's contact our friends at Kraghammer first.
Matt: "Two notes. There is no sigil in Vasselheim. They have been outlawed and destroyed to prevent arcane intrusion or subterfuge. There have been, historically, many a war's passed in which Vasselheim nearly fell to the sudden appearance of small armies within its walls, and as such, many of these sigils, all of them have been destroyed over the past 1,000 years. However, it was the third war--" And he's going into a long diatribe about the history of Vasselheim.
Laura: You are so educated. Perhaps we could talk later about all of this wonderful history.
Matt: "Certainly. Yes, I'm sorry. The mirror." He pulls up the mirror, pulls out his chest, brings out the same marble again, pops it into the mirror. It shimmers. "Hello? Hello?" You hear another voice say, "Oh, are you kidding me? Really? You again? All right, what are you bothering me with?"
Orion: Using my Mage Hand, I'm like, it's one of the things that you wanted us to get.
Laura: Who are you talking to?
Orion: I can see it. It's fine.
Matt: "What's it say? I can't read it from here. Read it out for me."
Orion: What does it say, Keyleth?
Marisha: To Lorna, with love. It's written right there, Tiberius.
Orion: Oh, sorry. To Lorna, with love.
Matt: At which point, you see the eyes of this dwarf that were very untrusting open wide for a second. "All right. Give him the sigil. Send him through. I'll see you soon." The mirror gives out again.
Laura: Oh, all of us?
Matt: No, the headmaster takes the mirror and puts it down. He points back to the clerk who's in the hallway behind you again, waiting, and says, "Go ahead and bring them to the Junction. Allow them access to the sigil for House Thunderbrand in Kraghammer." He nods. "Of course."
Orion: As he's doing this, I'm writing the sigil that I'm seeing forming in my--
Matt: He leads you to the Junction, and there is one of the doors he opens up on the inside, there is the actual sigil to Kraghammer there. He gives you some time to study it, you memorize it, you get it locked in, and you now permanently know the sigil of teleportation to Kraghammer within the House Thunderbrand.
Orion: Shall we go collect our money now?
Sam: Yes.
Laura: Yes.
Liam: We're all going? All of us?
Marisha: Well, I guess just the five of us, cause Grog and Percy are back at the Keep.
Sam: Would you rather just send Tiberius, then?
Laura: No, we should go.
Marisha: I can go back and check in on them.
Orion: Everybody's here but Grog.
Taliesin: And me.
Orion: Wait, where are you? Oh, you're working. Tinkering.
Liam: I have an errand to run.
Marisha: You have an errand to run? All right, I'll go with Vax--
Laura: It's the three of us, me and you and--
Orion: Okay. Thunderbrands are buttholes, though.
Sam: That's all right. That's why we're taking the heaviest hitters.
Marisha: Wait. We'll address that later. Come on, Vax.
Laura: Persuasion-wise.
Matt: So you guys head back to the Keep, you meet up with Grog and Percy, what about you guys? What're you doing? For, Tiberius, Scanlan, and Vex.
Laura: We go through.
Matt: Well, it's just the sigil. You have to cast the spell.
Laura: Oh.
Sam: Oh.
Orion: Yeah. Is that what you want to do? Is that what's going on?
Sam: It's a spell?
Orion: Oh, shit. No, actually, I need to sleep. All that flying left me a bit exhausted.
Laura: Oh my god.
Liam: Sorcerers, they improvise.
Laura: Wait, you're saying that we cannot go through?
Orion: Well, hold on. Maybe there's a way I could trigger the spell?
Sam: Let's go home and go to sleep.
Orion: Let's get a drink, maybe? It's only been a day.
Marisha: You can cast that sigil anywhere, right? You don't have to be here? We could do it from home.
Laura: Then let's just fucking go home.
Orion: What time of the day is this? It's still afternoonish, right?
Matt: At this point in time, with all the travel back and forth, it's getting close to dusk.
Orion: Great.
Marisha: We'll take a nap and we'll go tomorrow. It's getting late, the Thunderbrands are probably going to bed at this point. We don't want to invade. They're probably just sitting down for dinner.
Sam: They live in the Underdark. There's no real time there.
Orion: My swallow's been crafted at the other place, right? Has that happened already?
Matt: Yeah, it's been crafted for you, yeah. It's not a swallow. It's a quarterstaff with knives attached.
Orion: I'm calling it swallow. On the way back, because we're obviously going to leave in the morning, to do stuff. I'd like to quickly stop at any blacksmith I see on the way back to Greyskull Keep.
Matt: Okay. Yeah, there are a couple blacksmiths that you know about on the way through.
Orion: Okay. I go to the good one, not the bad one, per reputation.
Matt: Best reputation is Karin, but she's a specialist. She's the one that made Trinket's--
Laura: Yeah, Karin!
Orion: I'll go to her, because she's awesome.
Matt: All right. You go on and approach there. She's currently working away on some custom piece that she's currently working on. She's like, "Hello, can I help you, dragonborn?"
Orion: Yes, I'm Tiberius Stormwind from Draconia; moreover, from Vox Machina--
Matt: "What can I help you with?"
Orion: Oh. Sorry, right. We've done business before. I would like to commission you. And as I'm doing this I'm taking out five of my daggers that I have, and I'm going to hand them to her. I would like to commission you to somehow craft these daggers into a type of bended glaive, if you would. I don't know how long it would take you to do so.
Matt: "What?"
Orion: You see, it's like, it would look like this, but it's--
Sam: Krull?
Orion: Yeah, totally, but the blades are bended, but they're all connected in the center. You could use an iron, or a steel ingot to connect the--
Matt: "I can certainly try, yeah, aye."
Orion: Wonderful!
Matt: "All right. It would take me about two days? And you've already supplied the material, other than a bit of the side bits. I'll say I'll charge you 100 gold pieces."
Orion: 100 gold pieces?
Matt: "Aye, I'm a specialist!"
Sam: You went to the good one.
Orion: What, that's all? I mean, oh yes, of course. Here's 120.
Matt: "Certainly. Thank you. All right, it should be done within the next two days. You're free to come by and check on it if you like, but it'll be done."
Orion: I trust your work. Trinket's armor was fantastic.
Matt: "Huh?"
Orion: Did she do that? I thought that was the same character.
Laura: This is Karin.
Sam: She just thought bear. She just knows bear.
Orion: Bear's armor. The bear's armor was--
Matt: "Oh! You're friends with that one? She was real nice. That bear was adorable. Happy to help with that one."
Orion: His name is Trinket.
Matt: "Oh, is that what it was?"
Orion: I'm surprised she didn't tell you. It's an adorable name.
Matt: "Probably had. It's just been a while."
Orion: This is Lockheed.
Matt: "Oh, you're so cute, Lockheed." You guys talk for a little bit and eventually make your way back.
Orion: I do business with her, and I go back to the keep.
Sam: Are we still waiting for him outside?
Matt: Yeah, you guys are right outside.
Sam: When he comes out, I cast Minor Illusion to make it look like I have a long gray beard. (laughter)
Sam: Can we go home now, please, Tiberius?
Orion: Yes. Sorry.
Sam: Any other stops you'd like to make? The dry-cleaners, perhaps?
Orion: Prestidigitation.
Sam: Oh, that's great. Now let's go night-night so you can cast a spell on us.
Matt: All right, you guys head back to the keep.
Liam: While they're doing that, I stealth away from the group.
Marisha: Can I do a passive perception check to see if I notice him sneaking away?
Orion: I would like to fart. Natural 20!
Sam: It's a huge fart.
Matt: Go ahead and roll perception.
Liam: I rolled a 32.
Marisha: Perception or passive perception?
Matt: For this, because it's not active? It would be your passive.
Marisha: Then that is 24.
Matt: Vax has vanished. While you might have noticed, instead the explosion-like eruption of gas from your dragonborn friend distracted you and gave him the proper getaway. You vanish.
Liam: Yeah, I'm totally down an alleyway, through the alley, onto another main thoroughfare. I grab a random person on the street. Excuse me, I'm looking for a specific butcher. Harold the butcher. Do you know? I think he's in the upper slums. Can you point me toward him?
Matt: The individual you stopped is a younger gentleman, probably in his mid-20s or so, a bit dirty in the face and coming from a day of work, going to the local tavern to finish his eve with some drinks. "I can't say I do. I mean, there are butchers all over town. There's one--"
Liam: Where's the upper slums? Upper slums, please.
Matt: "Oh, that would be north side of Emon. That way." He points you towards the--
Liam: I don't even say anything else. I just walk. I don't know how long that will take me.
Matt: It will take you about, from where you are right now, 30 minutes. All right, so you guys get back to the keep. Grog has eaten his fill.
Travis: I'm asleep on the table.
Matt: Yeah. Passed out. Percy's nowhere to be seen. You, I would like for you to make a tinkering roll in relation to the construction of ammunition.
Taliesin: Ten.
Matt: Ten? You manage to, utilizing material for 20 bullets, only craft ten. But you get ten bullets out of it, as opposed to wasting the materials.
Orion: Is it possible to, before I go to sleep, I have a basic poison potion I've been hoarding. Could I try to dip the tip of one of my bolts in that?
Matt: You can certainly try. There's a difference between poison and disease. They're different. The potion seems to have no effect.
Orion: On bolts?
Matt: It doesn't have any effect.
Taliesin: How many batches of bullets are you going to let me attempt to make?
Matt: For the day, that's what you spent making. Tomorrow, we'll get to whatever it is you want to craft then. You go off and manage to make your way to the upper slums.
Liam: Yes. I see a stunted old woman and stop her on the street and say, Grandmother. I'm looking for Harold the butcher. Do you know where I can find him?
Matt: "Best I can gather, he'd be around that way." She points you, and the breath is awful. She's missing teeth, but her crooked finger curves off to the side, and you can see across the way, next to a homestead or hovel, there is a very humble-looking butcher that is currently in the process of closing shop.
Liam: I'd like to go stealth. I rolled a 20.
Matt: All right. You make your way up there. You can see there's an older gentleman in his mid-40s or so, salt-and-pepper hair, black with a bit of gray on the sides, is currently in the process of closing up.
Liam: Do I see Kynan anywhere? No? And it's a home? It's a business and a home?
Matt: It's hard to tell. It looks like a business from this perspective.
Liam: Okay, I'd like to go around the back of the building and scope it out.
Matt: You look through the windows. There's a dull light on the inside from what looks like a small hooded lantern set up for a bit of interior light, but there's nobody else in the house.
Liam: There's nobody in? I'd like to, at the window, listen and use perception to see if I can tell if anyone's inside.
Matt: You listen for a while. Make a perception roll.
Liam: Yeah, that's 25.
Matt: All right. As you continue to listen, eventually you hear the slamming of wood. You look off, and through the bit of the glass window-- you're peeking from the side-- you see the same gentleman who was closing the shop enter the room where the hooded lantern is. There's a table. He sits down quietly for a second, looks at the lamp, starts cleaning his fingernails a little bit, gives a big sigh, and turns off the light of the lantern and exits the room, closing the door behind him.
Liam: Is it one floor, the building?
Matt: It's one floor.
Liam: It's one floor. Is the window locked?
Matt: You checked the window. It's not locked.
Liam: All right, I'm climbing in.
Matt: You slip in without a problem. You've done this many times before.
Liam: It's a family residence where Kynan lives. Are there bedrooms?
Matt: It's hard to tell, looking around the room here. There are three doors that exit. One that he came through, which is apparently from the front of the butcher shop. This appears to be a central room that connects to wherever else he walked. There are two other doors.
Liam: They're not trapped, are they?
Matt: They're not trapped.
Liam: So I'm going to crouch down and push open the first door. What do I see?
Matt: The door immediately right or the door in front of you? The door in front of you is the one that the man traveled through.
Liam: Oh, no. Not that one. There were two other doors, weren't there?
Matt: There's the door that he came in from when he sat down, and then he left through the door across the way from you, and there is a door that been unopened.
Liam: There's one other door? That's the one.
Matt: Okay. You push open the door very quietly. It makes a little creaking sound, but you stop. Peering inside, it's dark. There appears to be a bed. There's a small table. There's what looks like an old pair of boots that are worn out on the side. It looks like a bedroom that nobody's currently in.
Liam: And there's no sign that this is a youth's bedroom or father's bedroom? What can I glean from what I see in here?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Liam: I'm going to use Luck. That's better. 22.
Matt: Okay. You take a little bit of time in peering over the materials, looking at the bed size, looking at the boot size, looking at whatever you can nearby. This bed is definitely weathered. It's been used for a long time. There are a couple of small knick-knacks and toys that are discarded underneath that have been there for a while that lead you to believe that this was at one point a boy's room. However, what you do notice is that most of the materials, most of the belongings, anything that you would normally see in a boy's room, anything that would say that a person lives here seem to have been hastily grabbed and taken off.
Liam: And the father went out the other way? All right, so I creep back out the window and I go out the front and I knock really loud on the front door.
Matt: A couple moments later, a voice comes from the other side. "Hello?"
Liam: Hello. I'm sorry, I don't mean to bother you. I know you've closed up shop.
Matt: "I'm done for business for the day. Come back tomorrow."
Liam: I'm actually not looking to buy anything. I owe your son a bit of money. I lost some money in a wager we made on a dog fight, and I was hoping to reimburse him. Do you know where he is?
Matt: The door opens a little bit, and an eye peeks through. You gather there's a slight scent of alcohol from the other side as he starts talking. He says, "I don't know where my son's gone off to. He came in in a huff. We got in an argument. He grabbed his stuff and left. He does this every now and then. He'll be back."
Liam: You think he'll be back?
Matt: "This isn't the first time he's done this."
Liam: I want to leave something with you.
Matt: "You said it was money you owed him?"
Liam: Yes.
Matt: "I can give that to him."
Liam: I take 50 gold of what I have left and I leave it with him, and I take out three daggers. I can hear my sister's voice in the back of my head. I want to use insight on him to make sure he's trustworthy. Oh, that's good. That's 20.
Matt: Okay. There's something about his face that gives you the feeling that he's more interested in the contents of what you're leaving than actually transferring these to the intended recipient.
Liam: Just give him the 50 gold. Thank you. And I leave.
Matt: Okay. Closes the door behind you, you hear a lock. Light goes back out in the room.
Sam: Go in there and kill him. Kill him, shit on his bed, and leave.
Liam: I head back to the keep.
Matt: Okay. All right, eventually Vax finds his way back to the keep. The rest of you are there, at rest for the evening. Is there anything else you want to accomplish before the night's out?
Marisha: I just flipped through my book on the alchemy section for a bit.
Matt: All right. You all find yourself to bed for the evening, rest up for the next morning, and at that point we're going to go ahead and take our break. Five minutes, guys, a strict five minutes because we still have a lot to get through. A lot to get through tonight, don't want to stay late.
Liam: Another nine hours.
Matt: No. See you guys in about five minutes, quick restroom break. We'll be right back. [break]
Matt: Welcome back, from our very strict, very strict five-minute break. We're very good at that. Yeah. That's right. Couple quick things. First off, we just hit 7,500 subscribers! (cheering)
Matt: That's amazing for many reasons. But all of you who are currently watching, be active in the chatroom so you can be included in the next giveaway we're doing. Giveaway's going to include a signed picture of the cast, a signed poster by the cast of the amazing art of our fantastic artist, Kit Buss.
Taliesin: Maybe signed by Kit.
Sam: She's amazing.
Matt: Yeah. So please be active in the chatroom, be part of that giveaway when it gets put out, and thank you guys so much for being so amazing and getting us to that point that's--
Liam: Yeah! You 7,500 people, fucking thank you, man. Thank you.
Travis: But only you 7,500. The rest can fuck off.
Matt: That was in character. All right, cool. Let's get back and see if we can, see if we can roll through some of this stuff. As you wake the next morning, you guys awaken to the dull sound of metal clanging as Percy has already been the first to wake and is back in the workshop. Tiberius, you're well-rested. Everyone's spells have returned. You get to make a beard roll.
Travis: Beard check, please! Three. Five.
Matt: 35? What? Bundlesofkittens, by the way, won. Congratulations to bundlesofkittens. Going to get prizes.
Laura: Adorable.
Matt: 35% does count. As you wake up, you reach up and feel the return of a nice hefty bit of scruff to your chin. Yeah, it's getting pretty thick now. It's a good, like, half an inch to an inch length. And you're starting to get a little, you notice the first time you grew some facial hair it was coming through that weird, creepy translucent color? It's starting to come through with a proper, almost a dark red-brown color to it.
Travis: What?
Marisha: Got a little bit of the Irish thing going on.
Travis: I don't know, I might have to get a cage; the women are going to come running.
Matt: So as you all gather for breakfast, you get your fill, a fine breakfast awaits you, already prepared by your servants of the Greyskull Keep. What do you wish to do?
Travis: Good morning, Vox Machina. Lovely to see all of you.
Marisha: So Grog, you fell asleep in your plate of food and woke up with a beard.
Travis: I know. Some guys are just lucky. (laughter)
Taliesin: Have we checked to make sure it's not a stain?
Travis: Hey, fuck off with your stinging, burning shit, all right? I'm not putting anything else in water. I don't know if you know, Scanlan, but water burns.
Laura: Good job, Percy, now he's never going to bathe.
Taliesin: You may have taken the wrong lesson away from that.
Travis: No, I pretty much got it. In, burn, ouch, powder.
Orion: You're not a chinchilla, Grog, which is a small creature that bathes itself in dust. But you are a human, which water is good.
Travis: I'm not a human.
Orion: Well, you are a humanoid. Which is, water is good. Which, most of you is water.
Travis: (gasps) You always drink water when we drink. Does it burn?
Orion: No, it feels rather--
Sam: Let's get going.
Taliesin: He does breathe fire.
Orion: I'm feeding Lockheed some of my breakfast.
Matt: Certainly. Lockheed enjoys the breakfast. Lockheed is looking healthier. The color is a little more of a deep emerald green, and he appears to have a little more energy this morning.
Sam: Does it shit on your shoulder?
Matt: He hasn't noticed, but there is a slight streak of dried pseudo-dragon poo. You're not aware of it to cast that yet.
Taliesin: Methinks the DM doth speak from experience.
Matt: As a bird owner, he does.
Orion: I'm going to, I rolled, I'm going to do a roll for the day, I think I rolled one for the day, and I'm going to go: Staht. Staht. And I'm going to, I rolled a 14 to try to teach it to sit. Staht.
Matt: (lizard noises) It sits down on the edge of the table.
Orion: And I give it a treat. Krar, Krar, there you go.
Matt: Bites your finger.
Orion: As it's hanging, I put it on my shoulder.
Matt: (lizard noises) It sits there.
Marisha: They get nippy. It's in the breed.
Matt: So! What do you want to do?
Sam: We want to get out of here. Cast the thing. Let's go.
Orion: As I'm having my oatmeal and such, I start to cast.
Marisha: I still think maybe the more talkative members of the group should go?
Sam: Still want to split the party?
Taliesin: I'm staying home, anyway
Marisha: I'm checking in with Tiberius-- oh sorry, Percy.
Matt: At which point the teleportation sigil appears in the center of the floor the way Tiberius had prepared it. It's glowing right now.
Travis: I've got the creature bits so I should go, too.
Laura: You! Take care of my bear, I'm leaving him here with you.
Liam: All right. I got him.
Laura: Oh, Trinket! I love you so.
Matt: Trinket comes up and like rubs his nose against your coat.
Laura: Behave, all right?
Liam: I'm going to feed you so much chocolate.
Laura: That's really bad for him! Don't!
Marisha: It'll be fine.
Matt: The sigil's starting to spark--
Sam: I jump in.
Travis: I jump in, too.
Matt: Okay, so all of you who are going, you leap in. You're staying and you're staying, correct? And you're staying. All right, Keyleth, Percy and Vax. All of you guys step in and all of a sudden there's a familiar whoosh of some sort of dark transference, you feel as if gravity for a moment doesn't exist and your feet find purchase on some sort of a wooden floor. The room is dark. You glance about the immediate vicinity, and for those of you who have low light, there's very little you can actually make out other than the fact this is a basement of some kind, and you are amidst a bunch of sheet covered crates.
Orion: Light! (whoosh)
Matt: As the light fills the room, you look around.
Orion: I cast it on Lockheed. On his tail.
Matt: All right! Lockheed begins trying to shake the light off the tail, so it moves around a little bit.
Orion: Oh, Bensvelk! That means "good" in Draconian. Bensvelk. And I feed him a treat.
Matt: (chuckles) All right! You look around the room, there are about six or seven of these crates immediately visible to you. They have sheets put over them, they're different sizes, some sort of storage room. There is a staircase that leads to the floor above.
Laura: Wait. Do they know we're coming? We're just in the middle of their home now?
Orion: Yes, of course, Vex, they know we're coming. I showed them the amulet, it was how we got the sigil to come here to begin with. It's fine. We're doing business with them. It'll be good.
Laura: Can I perception and make sure there's no traps around us? Just to make sure. We're just popping in, and this is a magic house, am I right? So I can't check for traps worth shit.
Matt: Room looks safe!
Laura: Great. Good. Great.
Travis: Well, good. Let's get out of here.
Matt: All right. You guys make your way to the second floor. As you step up to the top you can see there is light emanating from the top of the staircase and a figure moves into the staircase. A stout dwarven figure. This is the same individual you spoke to previously. The dwarf steps to the top and says, with an air of annoyance to the voice. "All right. Waited up all night for you to arrive, and you never did. And you come here and interrupt my breakfast."
Orion: I'm sorry. We thought you would like a night's sleep before we intrude and--
Matt: "It's fine, step up the stairs, please." and he steps out of the way, leads you into the central chamber. This house is unfamiliar to all but Scanlan, who turned invisible suddenly and decided to wander in briefly.
Sam: Yes, I did. My old stomping grounds.
Matt: The classic "I don't know!" Looking about it's very well-kept. It's an old house; the ceilings are taller than you expect for a dwarf type home. A lot of the ceilings are a little low especially for you Grog, this one's built roomy. There's actually a lot of cultivated cave plant life, a lot of boxes that contain various underground dwelling plants and other such funguses. The air itself is mixtures of sweet and pungent. Mixed almost as if there's a spice garden somewhere, and you're not really able to take a beat on what the actual interior would smell like, it keeps changing around you. You're brought to the main foyer area, and the dwarf turns back and he says "All right, you've made your transference. Where's the amulet?"
Orion: I'll open the Bag of Holding. And I'll take it out. Before I actually go over and speak, I'm going to turn to Scanlan and Vex. Is he the same person who pays us for the other--
Laura: No. I should probably go find that guy. Or we can go all together.
Orion: I just didn't want to say the wrong thing this time.
Sam: Sure, don't worry. You will.
Orion: Oh, sorry. Here is the amulet. And I show him. Now, as far as trade, as it was rather taxing to procure this particular artifact--
Laura: Incredibly difficult, he means to say.
Orion: Yes, she's correct. I was wondering if we could, perchance, trade it for a favor of your arcane ability?
Matt: "It's funny, because I already did. I gave you a permanent entry to my own household, my family's household, by offering you this sigil, that gave you entrance to the interior of our well-guarded estate. That was a trade enough. That was what we agreed upon through the mirror."
Orion: That was just to get me here quicker, I thought.
Matt: "So you come into my home and try to extort me?"
Orion: No, not at all! Here's what happened, see. We were on an adventure-- I pull out the carpet out of my Bag of Holding. And this carpet was enchanted once with the ability to fly, and it helped us many times in many adventures. It was de-chanted, I guess, if you want to say it. And we need it re-chanted. And I thought that House Thunderbrand would be a strong enough house to have the ability to do such a thing. Maybe not as it seems. And I hand him the amulet as I'm saying this.
Matt: He takes the amulet.
Orion: And not as a trade, but as a favor for just the effort, or maybe because I'm not strong enough as a sorcerer myself to do it.
Matt: Make a persuasion roll.
Laura: People speak very, very highly of your abilities. Can I assist him?
Matt: It's not going to matter. You keep talking, and as you're explaining this, he's not even paying attention to you. The dwarf is staring at the amulet, looking at the back of it where the inscription is. And you swear for a minute, you see what looks like a tear, gathering in the corner of the eye of the dwarf, who then reaches up and wipes it from the corner and takes the amulet and puts it in the pocket and says, "My apologies. Thank you for returning this. You were talking about the carpet, right?"
Laura: Yes.
Orion: Yes.
Matt: "You want it to be enchanted?"
Laura: Well, we've heard very wonderful things about your abilities and not many people can do such a feat.
Matt: "We have done a carpet before. Only one. It's very possible."
Laura: Did it look anything like this one?
Matt: "Not this pattern, no, that one was more of a blue. I mean this can be enchanted, but the materials and the time put into it-- It's a very pricey endeavor. A carpet of this size, especially."
Sam: How much?
Matt: "We're looking at the better part of a year to enchant this and that'll cost you about, time included, that'll cost 50,000 gold pieces."
Laura: Oh my god! I throw my hands up. I just can't. I just can't! How did we not? Oh my god.
Sam: She's very fond of the carpet.
Travis: I put my arm around Vex and try and console her.
Laura: 50? A year! Why?! Thank you so much.
Matt: "Well I mean, there might be smaller ones you might be able to find elsewhere."
Laura: No, I know it's a really beautiful carpet, and it would cost a lot of money to fix up, I understand.
Sam: She loves the hand-woven carpets. It's just very tragic.
Matt: "All right, well--"
Travis: Shall we go get our money now?
Sam: Yes, who's the man we need to see about that?
Laura: Oh, that's the Kraghammer-- We go to see--
Liam: Johnny Kraghammer?
Laura: Johnny Kraghammer.
Sam: Nostoc Greyspine?
Laura: It was Greyspine.
Matt: Nostoc Greyspine. You're escorted out of the House Thunderbrand. Make your way down to the quarry, at the very bottom level of Kraghammer, once again. It's been a long time since you've been in this portion of the world, let alone this city, where you started this leg of your entire journey. You do make your way down into this area to Lord Nostoc Greyspine's proper office, the one where you managed to procure his expensive wine and make this venture the very beginning. You step into the familiar halls. As soon as you enter, you have a brief discussion with the guy at the front, who recognizes you and leads you into the office. There, waiting, behind his desk is Nostoc, who's currently in the process of looking out the window over the entire quarry of his mine. He turns over his shoulder, looking at the rest of you. "Well, I'm surprised to see you all alive. Just assumed you'd all got yourselves killed, like the usual bumpkins who come wandering this far down in the mountain."
Laura: No. We did not die. We, in fact, succeeded in taking care of those creatures. Under-- dark-- carpet.
Sam: She's-- That time of the month.
Laura: Oh! Excuse me. We came to collect the money you owed us for completing the mission you sent us on.
Matt: "Ah yes, of course. Of course. Understood. What was the price we had agreed for that one?"
Laura: Oh, it was 30,000 gold, plus all the extras for the scalps that we acquired.
Travis: I open the bag of holding and go, Here, here's one brain chunk. And I dump it on the floor.
Matt: As a note, I'm pretty sure at practically no point in your adventure to the Underdark did you ever say you were scalping a creature.
Liam: We're above base--
Marisha: We totally forgot about that.
Matt: You completely, in the entirety of that adventure, didn't collect a single scalp from anything you killed.
Travis: I thought I grabbed the brain chunk. I thought I grabbed an arm, too. There was just an arm from the stitched guy, and I just grabbed it.
Liam: An arm is not a scalp. It's this.
Matt: Nostoc also looks at you and goes, "And while I respect your memory, a dwarf's mind is like a trap that you can't escape. I believe the agreed upon price was 25,000 gold pieces."
Laura: Oh it was? That is so weird, I remember 30.
Matt: "I don't even know what you fought. If you're going to collect your money, tell me what the hell you freaking killed."
Laura: Mind flayers! A beholder! Have you heard of a beholder?
Matt: "You fought a beholder?"
Laura: We fought a fucking beholder.
Matt: "Really? And you're all still alive?"
Sam: Well no, not all of us. If you'll recall there were more of us when we came down here. And some of us aren't here because they died.
Travis: I start pretending to cry.
Matt: Make a deception check.
Laura: That's really good.
Sam: 21.
Laura: I start thinking about the carpet and I really do start crying.
Sam: So before you berate us, know that we are mourning the loss of two of our members. And a bear!
Laura: (sobbing) And my bear!
Matt: "Beholder, you say?"
Laura: It was really big.
Matt: "What else did you encounter?"
Laura: Illithid.
Sam: Lots of illithid. A whole city of illithid.
Matt: "A whole city of illithid?"
Laura: We destroyed half of an elder brain-- Part of an elder brain.
Travis: And there were all these dark--
Laura: Dwarves! There were dark dwarves. Duergar.
Sam: They were mind controlled. It was crazy, we're not just making this up. It really happened.
Travis: There were these wrinkled testicles that were walking around on feet.
Laura: He almost died! Just from this one little brain.
Travis: Strange thing. If you're stupid, and it looks at you with its wrinkled testicle face? You go unconscious.
Matt: "I know the creatures you speak of. I've dealt with my share of duergar, though--"
Orion: I completely stayed away from it, because I was terrified.
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Liam: (singing) Roll high!
Laura: Are we all rolling? Because we're all talking.
Matt: You were spearheading that part of the group.
Laura: I was? I thought Scanlan was.
Matt: Scanlan already made his roll.
Travis: What about giving her advantage because I was talking about testicles?
Matt: No testicle advantage on that roll. I'm sorry.
Liam: In what circumstance would testicle advantage come into play?
Sam: At Gilmore's.
Laura: That would be 11.
Matt: 11? "Looking at your number, I can see that you've certainly encountered some dangerous things in your travels, taken some losses. And I will say, since you've left, we haven't had at least one excursion interrupting our mine, which has been very helpful. The fact that you've returned with these tales-- I believe most of it. I'd say, given that circumstance, I'd be happy to pay you up to 18,000 gold pieces."
Sam: I am going to cast Suggestion on him.
Laura: 18,000 gold in addition to the--
Travis: He's casting.
Liam: He's doing it!
Matt: So what's the DC? You don't have your hand cone.
Sam: I don't have my hand cone out. 17.
Matt: Natural one.
Laura: Money!
Matt: All right, what are you suggesting?
Sam: I'm going to suggest to him that he is an honorable man and we had a deal. And that he should honor it, to the fullest extent of the word.
Matt: He looks about at the rest of you guys.
Sam: I also, as a cantrip-- oh god, I hope it's not concentration. Forget it. I'm not going to.
Matt: "The Greyspine name holds weight in this city, the last thing I want is that that be sullied by miscommunication. If we agreed to 25,000, I'll pay 25,000. But I hear a single disagreement out there, or a bad word that came from your lips about our exchange here, and I'm going to come for the rest of that money."
Travis: I hold up the duergar's severed arm, and I curl all the fingers in and make a thumbs-up like that.
Matt: He looks back at you, very slowly, as you do this, with a tense stare. (laughs) "All right, all right." And he starts bringing up coin purse, after coin purse, after coin purse, counting it up as he does. It takes him about five minutes or so, and eventually he counts out, at your vision to improve it, 25,000 gold pieces and platinum pieces and pushes it across to you guys. You've retrieved that. No additional funds, as no scalps were collected, but you do get 25,000.
Travis: Do you want the--
Matt: "You can hold onto that, thank you."
Travis: You're very gracious.
Laura: (singing) 25,000 gold in my hands right now. Thank you so much. This won't make up for the lost lives we have suffered, but-- (choking up) It helps.
Matt: "I'm glad. And I'm sorry for your losses. Perhaps you'll be less stupid in the future."
Travis: Probably not. We should go.
Sam: Remember the blood we spilled for your people and your safety.
Laura: Vox Machina! (laughter)
Sam: Oh! I go to give him a business card, but then I realize I never got them printed so.
Laura: Also! Gilmore's Glorious Goods! Great work.
Sam: Yes, Gilmore's! If you're ever overdark, come check it out. It's a great store.
Matt: Like an unexpected web pop-up, he gives you an expression of: where is this coming from? "Get out! Get out of my office!"
Travis: Tiberius, how do we get out of here quickly?
Orion: I start going back to the chamber and I'll do the spell again.
Sam: Can you do it again? Don't you have to rest?
Matt: You can do it twice? 6th-level spell twice?
Orion: No it's a 5th-level spell.
Matt: What? The teleportation?
Orion: Yeah, it's a 5th-level spell.
Matt: I think it is. You're right.
Orion: Yes, very well. And then we'll go back to-- I'll choose Emon.
Liam: Excuse me? As soon as they left, Trinket and I, we left, and I went to the nearest shop and bought a lot of pink ribbon, and I have been furiously tying bows all through Trinket's hair, the entire time they've been gone.
Marisha: Actually I'll help with that campaign. I do some braids, and add some flowers.
Liam: Keyleth has been weaving flowers in, and I have been knotting braids. Started at the head, and then worked all the way down Trinket's back and down the tail. The entire time. Feverishly.
Taliesin: I come up for lunch. Keyleth, can I borrow you for a-- what in good god?!
Marisha: Is it important? Do you need me right now? This is pretty important.
Taliesin: Is Trinket comfortable with this?
Marisha: He's so comfortable! Look, I gave him plenty of treats, he doesn't even know what's happening.
Matt: (sad bear noises) This mournful low, guttural groan. You're pretty sure it translates to, "Why?"
Liam: I feed him a piece of chocolate at that moment.
Laura: Don't give him chocolate!
Matt: He licks it off.
Taliesin: Keyleth, can I borrow you? When you have a moment.
Marisha: Ten more minutes. I'll be down in ten minutes.
Matt: It takes about ten minutes before the keep doors open and the rest of your party returns.
Marisha: And I run downstairs really fast.
Liam: Side note, I let Trinket give me bear-kisses all over my face. Vex never lets Trinket kiss her face, and it's so sad, and I let him just drool all over my face everywhere.
Taliesin: I feel like we're playing out some real-world psychodrama here.
Orion: As this is going on, I want to turn to Scanlan and go, Gnome. I have an idea that I want to run by you. No, your name's Scanlan. Okay. I was going to go and do this, just on a whim as I usually do, but I was thinking that we should speak to Allura, and I don't think I should speak to her alone.
Sam: I'm sorry. I must be asleep. Are you planning something? Ahead of time.
Orion: Yes.
Sam: Wow. That's amazing!
Orion: You know. Like I told Vax, you just have to chill out sometimes, and I'm like, well, maybe I should run it by the man with the mouth.
Sam: Well, you've come to the right place. I do have quite a mouth. Yes, let's go talk to her. Wait, she's the woman you fancy quite a bit, isn't that true?
Orion: Yes. This is more business rather than denied pleasure.
Sam: What do you want to speak with her about?
Orion: Well, as far as I see it, there's no other way to get our carpet reenchanted. I want to confess what we did to her, and hopefully she takes mercy and helps us out with this, as we've helped her out far beyond anything that--
Matt: At this point in the discussion, you guys all look up and see, sitting in the center of the main foyer area of Greyskull, a very mighty bear, brought down low, sitting covered in pink ribbons, looking forward, going (distressed bear noises)
Sam: See? I told you it was a girl!
Laura: Trinket! You look so cute.
Marisha: Oh, I knew she'd love it!
Laura: We need to get these off of you immediately. But you look really, really cute. And I scratch his little ears. How dare--
Matt: You look over, too, there are traces of chocolate smears across the face of Vax.
Orion: Vex. No, Vex. Yes. Stand over-- and I use my Still Image and take a little spell of her--
Taliesin: Say it. Staffie. Just say staffie.
Orion: No, but it's of her, it's a youie.
Travis: But it's with your staff.
Liam: What is the piece of art immortalized upon? A piece of wood?
Orion: Oh. And I open my Scroll of Telescription, I'm like, see?
Laura: Oh look, now I can remember this moment forever. Thank you. Trinket, let's go get you a bath.
Travis: We got so much money.
Laura: I go and put it in the party funds. We got our gold.
Sam: Good job. We can pay back Gilmore.
Liam: For my share? Just my share.
Laura: Are we splitting up all the party gold now?
Orion: Vex? I give her the picture. Now you have a picture of your bear with the silly bows.
Laura: Oh, thank you.
Liam: And I take advantage of her good mood and say, I just want 1,200 gold, and I won't ask for any more of it, any of the amount.
Orion: Ooh, yes, I would like the same thing.
Laura: Do you want me to just split up all the party gold right now?
Sam: No, I don't, no. Just give us a quick stipend. Give us each 1,500 and let's move on.
Laura: Everybody gets 1,500. Is everybody happy? Trinket, are you just so thrilled?
Matt: (sad bear noises) He's pulling them out with his claws as best he can.
Laura: Oh, sweetie. Bath time.
Matt: Trinket stands up and heads out to the front courtyard. All right, so it's 1,500 times seven.
Laura: I'll do the math.
Sam: Let's go do our recon. Who's doing it?
Travis: Are we going to kill them?
Sam: No, we're just going to go spy on them.
Taliesin: I'd like to finish my morning crafting before moving into the evening crafting. I'm going to have help. I'm working on project number three.
Matt: Okay. This is probably going to take you the rest of the week. It's an extensive project.
Taliesin: If I have a little help? This is something I've been tinkering with for quite a while, now.
Matt: Right, but it's also the most complicated thing, outside of the gun, that you've constructed.
Travis: We've got a couple more days, too.
Orion: How many days have passed, since we've been doing this? Two?
Liam: Percy, you go to work. We'll figure out everything else.
Matt: It's up to you.
Taliesin: Do you think I'll have time to finish everything that's on my list, if I roll well?
Matt: Probably not everything. You'll have to choose between a couple.
Liam: What if he rolls a 20?
Taliesin: Because I was going to have Keyleth lightning spell to help set the battery for the--
Matt: Right. Well, that is technically an enchantment.
Taliesin: If it just uses it to start a charge?
Matt: Oh, to start a charge? Then you can do it.
Taliesin: Okay. Yeah, I was going to Frankenstein this.
Matt: Okay. We can begin the roll now.
Taliesin: All right.
Matt: Go ahead and make a tinkering roll.
Taliesin: That's better. 20.
Matt: 20, okay. Not actually doing the charge yet, because you're building the basis of the structure. You help him downstairs in his workshop with the various materials to begin crafting the actual shell of the the item. What else are you guys doing?
Sam: Let's go do recon.
Liam: Yeah, what are we checking out, though? I mean, it's not like the Briarwoods are out in public. We don't know anything about them.
Laura: We need to ask around town about the Briarwoods.
Sam: We need to get into the Briarwoods' estate and talk to them.
Marisha: Well, they're not local. They're coming into town. They're coming into town in five to seven days.
Matt: No, they're arriving now in six days and arriving for the actual feast.
Sam: Where's the feast to be held?
Matt: It's to be held in the palace.
Laura: Shit. We can't do any spying.
Marisha: Not on them.
Orion: All we can do is get gear and do things and we can sleep for a few days.
Taliesin: You can help me in the workshop.
Marisha: Make a plan. Maybe make a plan? We don't really have a plan.
Liam: Can you remind me and the group, the dinner, I know it's with the Briarwoods, but who else? Is it with Uriel or who is it with?
Matt: It's with Uriel, the Council, which is why you guys were invited, also because Percy asked. And the Briarwoods. It is partially to discuss and celebrate the agreed-upon construction of a bridge that goes across the Shearing Channel at the far northeastern side of the continent of Tal'Dorei. There is a large channel where these two large mountain ranges, which are the closest the two continents are to each other, but it's a very treacherous pass of water, so any trade having to be done has had to travel southward, in a big arc around the bottom of the island, or via skyship, both very expensive. This bridge will enable a much faster trade route between the two continents, and Whitestone has essentially been in charge of spearheading the construction of this bridge and making this agreement with Uriel, that would be overall helpful for both continents. And since they've agreed upon this, they've been invited here to Emon for the first time to have dinner with the Council and Uriel to celebrate it.
Liam: We maybe want to talk to Uriel.
Laura: Maybe. Maybe you guys should go, because I want to spend the next few days training Trinket how to roly-poly roll forward and bludgeon people with his armor.
Matt: (laughs) Okay.
Marisha: I mean, the only thing I can think-- Percy. Do you still have an idea of what the Briarwoods look like?
Taliesin: Oh yes.
Marisha: I could attempt another scrying spell. Could even possibly go to Allura for help and try again.
Taliesin: See if Allura will come here, because I want to keep working. And I'll also say we should send word to Uriel that I will not be myself at the--
Sam: Yes, that might be very strange.
Laura: We should maybe send word to him that the Briarwoods should be watched.
Taliesin: The less we say, the better.
Marisha: What makes you say that?
Liam: You think Uriel might be in the Briarwoods' pocket and pass on that we're aware.
Taliesin: It would not be the first time.
Liam: That's true.
Sam: Yes, even if you wear this disguise hat, Percy, how are you going to get into this event? It's a private event. You can't just be some random person.
Taliesin: I will be with you, and if we can let Uriel know that I am coming under a false pretense.
Sam: Yeah, but that's going to arouse all kinds of suspicion.
Marisha: Exactly, yeah, if we tell Uriel you're coming as someone else, he's going to ask why.
Taliesin: He knows that I don't trust them.
Travis: He does?
Taliesin: He does.
Marisha: Wait, who was it that came and talked to us? Who was that?
Matt: That was Seeker Asum.
Marisha: I was going to say, it was Seeker Asum, but he didn't say that Uriel had his doubts, he said he had his doubts.
Taliesin: So let's let Asum know.
Marisha: Let Asum know.
Sam: Why don't you disguise yourself as--
Taliesin: Burt Reynolds.
Sam: What about Vax? He can sneak in.
Taliesin: Will the hat let me choose who I look like?
Matt: The hat, like any Minor Illusion spell, you can choose your appearance.
Taliesin: How much of a shape-change can I--
Matt: I mean, you can look pretty close to somebody else.
Taliesin: Could I look like Grog?
Matt: You could. But as it is an illusion, there is no physical-- so if somebody were to reach up and touch your shoulder, it would just pass through.
Marisha: Right, and your voice doesn't change, so you probably don't want to try and sound like Grog all night.
Taliesin: Well, I was actually thinking of Pike, but.
Sam: Ooh, Pike. You could be Pike. You would be a very big Pike.
Liam: Percival, there's nothing I want more than for you to take Bad News and unload it on every one of those motherfucking shits, but if you're me and I'm nobody, if I'm a ghost, I can help take out one or two.
Taliesin: You'll stick to the shadows, and I'll be you.
Marisha: Not to be-- sorry, you were going to say something?
Taliesin: No, that's actually a pretty good plan.
Liam: How many days left?
Matt: Six.
Liam: Can I ask you a question, DM? I have in the assassin perks. I think it says seven days, I can be anybody. As long as I don't do anything else and I work on getting the right papers, and no one will know who I am, 100%, but it's six days, so am I shit out of luck? This is why I was talking about it yesterday, motherfuckers.
Taliesin: That's okay. It's a good plan. I think this plan is a good plan.
Orion: I think we'll be fine, because I have privilege perk.
Liam: You make me invisible.
Sam: I can also do that. Or he can.
Liam: Yeah, one of you two.
Sam: No problem. I know it's a few days off, but we should have some sort of safe word. Some sort of attack word. Grog, any suggestions?
Travis: Jenga.
All: Jenga.
Marisha: I like that. We're not hired to kill the Briarwoods, and not to be that member of the group that has a golden heart and wants to ruin everyone's fun. I don't want to stand between you and your revenge that you are absolutely owed, Percy, but are you sure this is what you want? Is this going to make you feel better?
Taliesin: I don't know what I want. I want to see them. I want to look at them. I want to see them.
Marisha: Do you want to talk to them?
Taliesin: No. I want to listen to them.
Travis: Then we follow your lead.
Taliesin: I want to see them. I don't know.
Marisha: Do you want us to fucking capture them and drag them back to the cell that we built in our keep? We built it for a reason.
Sam: (whistles) She gambles now. She's crazy.
Marisha: I know, I've been opened up to so many things.
Taliesin: The best I can give you is we'll just have to see what happens.
Liam: Percival, I trust you implicitly. You have earned that trust. Do you believe them to be evil in the purest sense?
Taliesin: I do.
Laura: That's all we need.
Liam: That's all we need.
Sam: We don't even need that much. If you'd just said to kill someone, we'd probably do it.
Taliesin: I saw things.
Laura: Should we prepare? Let's do it! I've been training Trinket, though, does that help?
Marisha: I've been reading my alchemy books.
Matt: Six beard checks.
Sam: I went to get business cards.
Matt: Right. That'll cost you 25 gold for 100.
Sam: I'm going to get two sets. One says Scanlan Shorthalt, one says Burt Reynolds.
Matt: Okay. Both have been constructed without question.
Liam: I repaid my debt to Gilmore.
Matt: All right, debt is paid, mark off that gold.
Laura: Yes!
Matt: How many is that?
Travis: I'm at five total, right? 46. 45. 55. A one. And a 95.
Matt: By the end of this week, you have grown what is a rather majestic full chin-beard. You are probably the first goliath to have facial hair. It's a full, we're talking Portland man.
Sam: Oh no.
Liam: Another thing that I did was go off and get a lathering cream, and the second to last night, after I took Grog out to the tavern, I bought him a lot of drinks.
Travis: I assume dodge.
Liam: I didn't shave off his whole beard. Only half of it.
Travis: I just became the most handsome man in the world.
Laura: Do not shave his fucking beard off.
Liam: This much.
Matt: Make a stealth check. Make a perception check. You just broke a mechanical pencil! (laughter)
Liam: DM? I rolled a natural 20. I have advantage on stealth checks, and I rolled an 18 and a 20. Natural 20.
Matt: Sleeping soundly, drunk, you do not hear the approach of Vax. As you pull out your blade and get ready, I want you to roll a sleight of hand check.
Liam: After the 20?
Matt: One thing to not be noticed. It's another to shave someone's face without being noticed. This is about stillness of fingers, not just how stealthy you can be.
Liam: I'm using Luck. Okay, so I rolled a 21.
Matt: Roll a perception check, Grog. With advantage because this is against your face.
Travis: 13.
Liam: 21.
Matt: All right.
Laura: Why are you so evil?
Liam: Why did he trip me and make me eat shit two months ago?
Taliesin: Oh!
Marisha: Oh!
Orion: Oh!
Travis: Appetizer of things to come, my friend.
Matt: The crowing sound of a distant rooster. The farmlands that surround the outside of Emon, which are relatively close, within earshot. The morning sun rises, cresting over the eastern skyline of Tal'Dorei. Grog, you come to consciousness, stretch, reach up to rub-- half a beard.
Travis: Half a beard? Like, just one side of my face?
Matt: One side of your face.
Travis: I say in a low, guttural growl--
Liam: You have no idea it was me.
Travis: Vax. I didn't have to wake up to know it was you, motherfucker.
Liam: Make an intelligence check! Make him make an intelligence check!
Marisha: We all know it was you.
Travis: I reach down, I find a dark stone on the ground, and I go over to the bare side of my face and I draw a very beautiful mustache to complete the other half of it.
Liam: He is dumb as a post. Why does he know--
Travis: Because you're the only fucking idiot stupid enough to do that!
Liam: Magic is mysterious! Why couldn't you grow half a beard due to magic?
Travis: Maybe I don't know. Let's say I assume. (laughter)
Matt: However, it is a new morning. Roll a beard check.
Travis: Eight, four.
Matt: No movement.
Liam: Sorry, big guy.
Matt: All right, so as a note, Percy, I want you to make four more tinkering rolls.
Taliesin: All right.
Sam: I'm going to give him inspiration for one of them. (singing) Do you want to build a machine gun?
Taliesin: (singing) Why, yes, I really do.
Matt: What have you got?
Taliesin: 28.
Matt: 28, okay. Second one?
Marisha: Oh god.
Matt: Dice going everywhere.
Sam: Inspiration, d10.
Taliesin: I got a d6 from the last one you did.
Matt: d6 is what I gave you.
Taliesin: d10, so I'll roll a d10 with the next one. That one was 20.
Matt: All right. Third one?
Taliesin: 28.
Matt: All right, and the fourth one?
Taliesin: 23.
Matt: Okay, so over the next few days, you've constructed what amounts to a large, metallic gauntlet. You have taken this gauntlet and wired all through it insulation and metallic insulating tips in what is essentially a small, for lack of a better term, alternator of some kind.
Taliesin: I was going to try to sneak in a few bullets during that time.
Matt: The fifth roll's going to be that. You have constructed this device. The quality seems fair. It's untested technology, just something that's a brainchild of your own, utilizing Keyleth's aid. Keyleth, I'm going to have you roll a wisdom check. Roll that and add five.
Marisha: Well. Add just my base wisdom?
Matt: Plus six, it would be. Sorry.
Marisha: Yes, plus six, so 20 total.
Matt: 20 total. You step out and you set it down in the middle of the courtyard. Keyleth, you summon a storm that slowly gathers above the top of the keep. You guys start hearing sounds like rolling thunder outside and you come and look, and you see Percy and Keyleth are out standing in the middle of the courtyard. Keyleth with her arm in the air as this black, dark storm cloud begins to swirl above the entirety of Greyskull Keep. With that, she brings her hand up and then brings her fist down as a bolt of energy (thunder clap) streaks down from the clouds, slamming into a small object on the ground that then gets flung about 15 feet in a random direction. Tumbles to the ground. You rush over to grab it. You can see arcing over the metal. (electric sparking) These small electric arcs. You reach over and wait a second. You prod it. Pick it up and it's hot. Drop it instinctively. You give it a few minutes to cool off. Pick it up when it's warm enough; you put it on and there is essentially this large, sparking, metal centerpiece that is giving off this low hum.
Marisha: Did it work? Try it on Tiberius.
Orion: Sure. Here.
Taliesin: Touch.
Matt: Okay. Tiberius, make a constitution saving throw.
Sam: No! (laughter)
Orion: No! (laughter)
Matt: All right, you suffer 14 points of lightning damage and are stunned for a round. I need you to go ahead and roll a d20.
Taliesin: Cock-a-dooed. (yelps)
Marisha: High rolls startle him.
Taliesin: 19.
Matt: 19, okay. It stays intact from the force of it. A little bit of the energy that was stored in there appears to dissipate. You figure there's only a few applications of this before it needs to be recharged, and every single time it's utilized, there's a low chance that it may detonate, or crumble, or something bad may happen.
Sam: Percy, that's amazing! What do you call it?
Orion: (unintelligible mumbling)
Taliesin: Are you all right, Tiberius?
Marisha: I go over and give him a Cure Wounds.
Matt: You manage to eventually shake off all your muscles that were so locked, tense, give way for a second.
Orion: It's effective.
Marisha: That was awesome.
Taliesin: I call it Diplomacy.
Sam: Diplomacy?
Laura: I like it.
Travis: That's great.
Laura: As we're standing watching that, Trinket comes rolling into the courtyard!
Matt: Let's go ahead and make an animal handling check.
Laura: Oh, why didn't I get more points in that?
Liam: Roll high. Come on.
Matt: I say with advantage because Trinket's been your companion for so long.
Laura: Natural 20!
Matt: Which is close to what you needed because this is a very difficult feat. Over the week you've worked with Trinket and you've worked on a technique where, instead of a multi-attack, Trinket can do what is essentially a trample attack, meaning Trinket can roll forward and roll through anything that's equal to or smaller. And damage everything in that path.
Liam: (singing) Circus bear.
Matt: We'll go over the logistics of that some other time, but Trinket has now learned a roly-poly trample attack.
Laura: Should we call it the roly-poly or the cannonball?
Travis: That's your call.
Matt: It's your call. Call it what you want.
Liam: Roly-poly is cute; cannonball is--
Laura: I think I like cannonball because it's better to shout during the battle.
Matt: The Trinket cannonball.
Liam: Roly-poly!
Orion: For brevity, I rolled six dice. I rolled, the only high ones worth mentioning was a 13, a 15, and 18.
Matt: With a 15 and an 18--
Orion: 17, I mean.
Matt: Yeah.
Orion: And the, because they're all negative three. And I attempted to teach to Lockheed to hide and speak and to stay.
Matt: Okay. To hide and to speak. To stay did not stick, unfortunately. You had two rolls that were high enough to get those two in there though. Hide and speak. All right. The morning has come to fruition. You have a few hours before you're supposed to arrive at the palace. You have been notified that this is a very formal event.
Sam: We'll need fancy robes.
Laura: Oh, we have some formal dresses already.
Matt: Roll again, please.
Taliesin: 23.
Matt: You manage to construct 20 pieces of ammunition from 20 units of materials.
Travis: We have three fancy robes.
Orion: Oh, and I've picked up my glaive, right? Two days. It was time to.
Matt: You go back to Karin. You now have some kind of a knife-glaive thing.
Orion: Krull! I'm naming it Krull.
Matt: You are unsure how it will work in combat? But it looks neat.
Orion: And I attach it to my coat.
Matt: It just hangs to the side. Careful how you sit.
Liam: Do I still have the finery I wore to the Velvet Cabaret?
Matt: You would, yes.
Liam: All right. So we have to worry about you, Grog.
Travis: Are there any tapestries or curtains in the castle?
Matt: There are, actually.
Travis: I walk up to the prettiest one and I rip it down, and I throw it over myself like a toga.
Marisha: (laughing) It's pretty good.
Matt: It, in a "Foreigner in a Foreign Land" kind of way, could work.
Travis: And I practice my curtsy. Because I've seen Vex and Keyleth do it, so I think everybody does it.
Orion: I do it, as well. I don't know what's going on.
Taliesin: I want to see him roll an athletics check for that.
Laura: Tiberius.
Orion: Yes?
Laura: Could you Prestidigitate this thing and make it look like an actual thing?
Sam: Not for very long.
Matt: That's more of an illusion.
Liam: You pull the hairs out.
Travis: What's wrong with this? I'm from a strange land. My customs are my own.
Sam: Grog, have you washed yourself in water at all this week?
Travis: No. It burns. ORION I do Prestidigitation immediately to get rid of some kind of smell that I'm sure is emanating.
Travis: I freak out running around the room. (screams)
Orion: It's not water, Grog. And I keep casting it on him. It's fine, see. (splash)
Laura: You're fine.
Travis: It must have been that powder you gave me before. It made me immune.
Laura: That's what it was. You're immune. You're definitely immune to water now. Good job.
Orion: What's wrong with what you're wearing now?
Laura: His toga? He's wearing a toga made out of a tapestry.
Orion: Oh, so I'll go and I'll use some of my Dust of Illusion and I'll (pfft) on what he's wearing and shape it into a fancier robe.
Matt: From a visual standpoint, the robe tapers and curls around his form, and comes to look like a nicer robe. The material looks like it's made of almost a reddish silk. The actual imagery of the tapestry slowly fades and becomes just various textures and material. From your eyes, it's less interesting, but from a presentory standpoint it could be passable.
Liam: Don't forget his exotic facial hair, as well. That probably lends to the whole package.
Matt: Yeah, which by the way, you guys do see. It's half giant beard and half scrawled-on charcoal.
Orion: And I notice this, I go  Oh. Oh, Grog. And I use a little bit more of Dust of Illusion. I wipe it. Smear it on there.
Travis: I wipe it away!
Orion: No. Stop! Hey, hey, hey-- I put it on. Actually, I'm going to take it, and I'm going to actually put it in your hand and be like-- put it on your thumb and be like: I want you to smear this where the beard was, and I want you to think really hard that you want it there. Okay? So put it on first. There you go. That's it. And now think really hard that you want it there.
Matt: The dust tends to glisten, and where there was once charcoal outline, a mirror to your once beautiful beard continues, full, as if nothing had happened.
Travis: I reach into the bag of holding and I take out a little goblet, and I pour some ale in it. And I walk over to Vax, and I go, here you go.
Liam: This looks very good. Thank you, Grog.
Travis: You're welcome. Would you like some more?
Liam: No, I don't want to cloud my thinking before we go up against the Briarwoods.
Travis: Probably smart. I'll take that back. I crush the goblet in my hand.
Matt: This creaking metal sound. The goblet is now destroyed.
Travis: Oh no! What happened?
Matt: All right, dressed up, you all make your way to the Cloudtop district as the sun begins to bring itself to the other side of the horizon. As you approach the outside of the Tal'Dorei palace, there are general guards set up to accept guests. They're just there in wait as part of their process today. As soon as you arrive and announce yourselves as having arrived, is there anything you want to do to prepare?
Sam: Well, are you in disguise yet, Percy?
Taliesin: Yes, I look like Vax.
Sam: Cloaked Vax?
Liam: Where are we?
Matt: You guys are nearing the palace right now.
Liam: Nearing the palace? Hit me.
Marisha: I produce a few flower cummerbunds and start pinning them on the party.
Laura: I go in and put my arm through Percy's arm to make it seem like we're twins. I go in with Percy to make it look like we're the twinsies.
Sam: I'm going to cast Invisibility on Vax.
Travis: I hand the Potion of Climbing to Vax and say, don't die.
Liam: No promises.
Sam: You've got one hour until my Invisibility is going to wear off, so find a shadow.
Matt: Do you guys make yourselves known at the palace front?
Sam: Yes! We're friends here. Yes.
Matt: As you approach, you make yourselves known. The guards lead you to the front area of the palace. The sun's just starting to hit the distant side of the water of the Ozmit Sea to the west of Emon. As you guys finish talking to the front guard that you've arrived, Seeker Asum steps out of the front of the palace and sees you. "Very good. Glad you could make it. Please enter. I will wish to speak with you briefly before the event this evening."
Laura: Of course.
Matt: "Are you missing anyone?"
Laura: Oh, yes. Percy wasn't feeling very well. He ended up staying home.
Matt: Make a deception check.
Laura: 11.
Matt: "Very well. That's unfortunate. His skills could have been of use to me. Come inside."
Laura: I pat Vax's hand-- Percy's hand. What the fuck. This is creepy.
Travis: Call him Vaxy.
Laura: Vaxy.
Taliesin: That will work just fine. Thank you.
Matt: He leads you into the green meeting room you guys have had previous council meetings with. It's currently empty. He sets the guards to the side and brings you inside and says, "All right, so if my little birds speak truth, they should be arriving around dusk, so we probably have no more than 20 minutes before they are here themselves. If you're not aware, they should be referred to as Lord and Lady Briarwood. Their names: Lord Sylas Briarwood and Lady Delilah Briarwood."
Marisha: Sylas and Delilah? (singing) Hey there, Delilah.
Matt: "This is a political dinner. Please do your best not to cause a scene during the meal, as I need that time as a distraction to do my own digging."
Laura: Yes.
Matt: "Vax."
Taliesin: Yes?
Matt: "You're light of step and quick to fade. Would you wish to join me on this or stay with the dinner party?"
Taliesin: I'll stay with the dinner party. I wish to observe.
Sam: He also has a bit of a cold.
Taliesin: I wish to observe the Briarwoods myself.
Matt: Make a deception check.
Taliesin: (gritty voice) I wish to observe.
Liam: You've got to go more nasal, Taliesin.
Taliesin: Yes, nasal.
Orion: Yes, you need to go down here.
Sam: Sort of like sandpaper on a chalkboard.
Marisha: I should have done something about this.
Taliesin: Five.
Matt: Asum goes, "All right. If we are to do this, I would appreciate a little bit of honesty at the front point."
Orion: Well, I'm Tiberius Stormwind from Draconia.
Taliesin: It's all right.
Sam: This is not Vax.
Taliesin: Asum, it's me.
Matt: "I gathered as much, as soon as you began to speak. Now, I can understand, based on our previous conversation, that you have interest in keeping low key, but know that I am an ally in this. If you're not here, where is the rest of your party. Where is Vax?"
Taliesin: Vax is here.
Laura: He's stealthing.
Taliesin: He's being quiet.
Matt: "Well, Vax, if you can hear me, follow me when the meal begins. I may have use for you. All right, so. The Briarwoods have a very good relationship with Uriel and the Tal'Dorei council, established back before they expanded outside of Wildemount. I've sent two of my best gatherers into Wynandir to seek out more information on them. I don't know when that information will be available; they've only been gone but three days, and hopefully in time, we'll learn more of what their machinations may be. Many of the noble houses of Whitestone were left vacant when the de Rolos passed and were given to friends of the Briarwoods. Whispers that reach me speak of these new nobles, not being highborn, nor affiliated with the gentry at all, so I'm curious as to what allies they've made either before or after taking Whitestone for themselves."
Marisha: What are the names of these people who've taken over White--
Laura: It was the Briarwoods.
Matt: "I don't. The Briarwoods have."
Marisha: I thought they said they had friends.
Matt: "I do not know yet. I've sent folks out there. Those who have been sent to Whitestone have either defected or quit and sent me letters of resignation which is part of the reason I am very curious as to what's going on in Whitestone. Now, I've also found the documentation that delivered the ungoverned lands of Whitestone to the Briarwoods was signed, officiated and cataloged months in advance to the de Rolo family passing. I'm still following the trail but I find the timing far too convenient. With their arrival coming up, please be controlled, remember what I've told you and as more information comes in in the passing weeks I'll bring that to your attention, as well. Be observant, listen, pry what information you can, but do not raise suspicion."
Sam: We will be as quiet as a house mouse. However, if you need us to act, just utter the word "jenga."
Matt: "Jenga."
Marisha: I also make a matching corsage and pin it on his lapel, as well.
Matt: As you do, he looks down at it and goes, "Thank you; it's not my color."
Marisha: You know, that's fine.
Matt: "I appreciate the offer but my theme goes with browns and blacks so as not to be seen. This is a bit bright for my taste."
Marisha: It might have had a more utilitarian purpose, but it's fine.
Matt: "I'm not going to be at the dinner, but thank you."
Laura: Do you have any of your people learning about the Briarwoods? Are they magic users in any way? Have you heard anything?
Matt: "The only thing I can recall as the information of the Briarwoods, at least what's come this way was while they were ruling the lands in Wildemount as part of their kingdom there, Lady Delilah Briarwood was an accomplished practitioner of the arcane arts, a long-trained wizard as far as I know and been through quite a few different schools and had a brief stint here in Emon training at the Lyceum, but that was naught but nine, ten years back? Maybe more."
Laura: Do any of you know, as somebody practiced in the arcane arts, are you good at seeing through illusions? Or--
Sam: Who, me? Who, us?
Laura: Anybody that is, you know, very skilled?
Orion: (chuckles) Of course. I just need to know that one's happening. So it's tricky, is what I'm saying.
Laura: So she wouldn't automatically know. They wouldn't be able to spot immediately that Percy is not actually--
Orion: Somebody would have to have rather powerful abilities to see through an illusion spell like a disguise or such. It's like a rakshasa could see though that kind of thing, per experience. I doubt that the Briarwoods have any--
Matt: At which point you hear, muffled in the distance a (horn noise) this horn sound that seems to be blown as a notification that the arrival of guests has rolled in.
Travis: Are you ready for this, Vaxy?
Taliesin: No. Let's do this.
Orion: Would you like me to cast Fireball?
Matt: Asum goes, "No, please, none of that. Vax, if you can hear me in this room, ten minutes into the meal see if you can spot me and follow me in the foyer. Good luck."
Laura: Great.
Sam: Keyleth, I hope you phoned ahead and gave them your order for a vegan meal.
Marisha: Oh, I always do.
Taliesin: She's vegan. Of course she told them.
Marisha: Exactly. It's on the RSVP.
Matt: Asum leaves the room. Do you wish to stay inside, do you wish to see the guests as they arrive?
Taliesin: Let's go be social.
Sam: Let's go mingle.
Matt: All right. You guys head back out to the front of the palace, the large stairway that leads down into the central road outside of the palace in the middle of the Cloudtop district. The sky itself has now come to a dark purple blue slowly moving over into the distant sunset. The sun has disappeared beneath the sea and you've completed the dusk as the sunset slowly turns gold. A dark wood carriage flanked by four armored men on horseback pulls onto the road right before the Tal'Dorei palace. A young man steps from the front of the carriage and opens the door. Stepping out you see a strong, tall man in the nearby lantern light. Short brown hair frames a very chiseled and handsome face adorned with a well groomed goatee. His clothing is based in blue and black, fitted elegance trimmed with golds and red. A strip of grey fur cresting over one shoulder framing his torso. He turns, extends his hand towards the door, where a feminine gloved hand finds it. A beautiful woman steps out after. Her hair dark auburn and pulled up into a tight braided bun, resembling some sort of a glamorous school teacher almost. Her gown is in the same color scheme as the man, if a bit heavier blue than black, and a long billowing skirt tapers up to be form-fitted across her body, continuing upward to wrap her neck nearly to the jaw. They both turn to face the greeting party, bowing slightly as two of their companion guards flank their approach up the steps. The other two helping the young man who steered the carriage carry their rather large bags behind them. This is Lord Sylas Briarwood and Lady Delilah Briarwood. As you guys are standing here at this point, stepping behind you a hand reaches over and touches the back of your shoulder. You look behind you and there, smiling, is Arcanist Allura Vysoren dressed in a very fine blue gown. You've never seen her quite so formal, but very beautiful type thing. She glances over the shoulders, "It's so good to see you. I'm so glad you all could make it."
Laura: So wonderful to see you. I give her a hug.
Matt: She gives a little hug, too. Glances over at you. "A pleasure, Vax'ildan."
Orion: See? She can see it.
Marisha: Yes, she can.
Matt: What are you doing?
Orion: You look gorgeous Allura, and my friends are just making weird faces right now. It's probably because of how beautiful you look.
Matt: As you guys are having this discussion about 15 feet from you the Briarwoods enter the palace, their guards enter with them. There's been no pleasantry and very much an intended arrival. None of you are recognizable to them, thus they make no intent of introducing themselves.
Laura: We catch any of their eye at all?
Matt: They appear to be looking about and taking in their surroundings but they're both engaged in a mumbled conversation between the two of them as they enter.
Marisha: Is anyone waiting to greet them?
Matt: As you follow where they're going, as you walk into the main foyer area where you stand there, waiting carefully at the back, there are a number of servants that have arrived and have taken some of their bags and help them up the stairs. There is one, the head servant who is there talking to them and you hear him speaking to them. "Wait in your quarters be ready, the meal should be ready within the hour. If you would be so kind as to prepare yourselves, relax, unwind, set up your rooms. You're to stay for a few days at the very least. But we shall call you when the meal is ready." At which Lord Sylas Briarwood turns to him and says, "I greatly appreciate the information. Just come to our room and let us know when the food is ready. Now, come, my dear"
Laura: Can I keep an eye on them as they're walking to their room? Just as long as I can see their mouths moving, I can read their lips.
Taliesin: I also want to scan their entourage to see if I recognize any faces.
Matt: Okay, perception check. Perception check for you, as well.
Laura: Do I have to perceive it? I have a feat that I can read it.
Matt: Oh, you do?
Laura: Yeah, I have Observant  Read Lips meaning I can read lips from any language I can understand.
Matt: That's true. Okay, good to know.
Taliesin: 19.
Matt: 19. No, they all appear to be run of the mill soldiers, nothing, no one that catches your attention. The young man who is helping them as they go through seems familiar, but no one that is jumping out at you right now. Someone you may have crossed paths with in the past but nobody that's really been formally involved in your life previously. Maybe a denizen of Whitestone that you've crossed before when he was younger. As they walk up the steps, you keep an eye best you can as they go. You catch a little bit of conversation that seems to speak about how long the journey's been, "That's all right, we'll be in there soon to discuss and we'll be out as soon as we can. We won't stay any longer than we need to." And that's the extent you gather as they continue up the stairway. As the next hour or so passes?
Orion: I flirt with Allura.
Matt: Okay, do you want to talk with Allura?
Orion: I flirt with her throughout the hour.
Matt: Okay, she's grateful for the conversation. She laughs, and she's very attentive to all of you and excited to see you. She lets you know that she's been caught in a little bit of the bureaucracy in the city and despises that. She's taken some time off for herself for about a week or so.
Orion: Actually, towards the end of that conversation I would like to bring up a specific thing. We've been having such a wonderful conversation.
Matt: "Of course, no, of course, Tiberius"
Orion: I think when things settle down a bit, perhaps you and I and maybe Grog, and Lady Kima can perhaps go out. Break bread and have some wine and such on an evening with each other. I believe my friend rather fancies Kima. What say you?
Matt: "Well, that's very flattering, Tiberius. I appreciate the invitation. I would say that particular mix of company might prove a bit awkward."
Orion: Well, of course. If it was awkward, nobody wants that.
Matt: "Perhaps we might-- I mean if you would like to get some tea sometime I'd be more than happy to--"
Orion: Oh, just you and I?
Matt: "Yes. Kima's quite a ways off and I believe she's still in Vasselheim, last I spoke with her, and yes, tea would be lovely."
Orion: Okay, all right, wonderful.
Sam: You walk away.
Orion: I walk away. (laughter)
Marisha: He got a date!
Travis: Is that carriage. Is the carriage still there?
Matt: The carriage, as far as you see, is being led off slowly by the servants to a side area of the palace.
Travis: And the armed on horseback that were with the Briarwoods when they came in?
Matt: Two of them are with the Briarwoods, and there are two helping to bring their stuff up to their rooms.
Travis: The four are with them?
Matt: The four are with them, yes.
Sam: I jump up and give him a little high five. Then, as an hour has passed, I beckon to Vax and find a shadowy area.
Travis: Real Vax or Vaxy?
Sam: Real Vax. Because my thing is wearing off, buddy.
Marisha: I've been scanning the crowd. Have I noticed anything over the past hour of any of our people? Any locals, any council members, who may be acting a little shifty?
Matt: Looking about, the council is roughly stepping in and out of the area like they're getting ready for the dinner and arriving from the Cloudtop district.
Marisha: Any of them breaking a sweat? Acting weird?
Laura: Yeah. I want to check out this, too.
Matt: Go ahead and make an insight roll, both of you guys.
Marisha: 22.
Laura: 23.
Matt: The two of you scanning over. Looking over there is Lord Riskel Daxio, he's an elven male, who was the one who is master of trade of the city. He's the one that handled the ordering of your keep when you first had it brought to your attention by Uriel. Allura, of course. Tofor Brotorus is there, the female dragonborn paladin. She seems generally just not happy about the whole scenario and she's not armored, she's dressed in what would be considered formal attire but it's not a dress, it's not a suit, it's this asexual formal outfit that looks like a robe but also like a suit and she does not look to be happy in it at all. Just arms crossed, at the far end, back against the wall just (growling noises) slowly stewing, not wanting to be there. You also see Arbiter Brom Goldhand, who is the master of law. Was previously one of the heads of the guard there within Emon and then was then given the job of being the head of the Watchful Hall. He's the master of law essentially in the city. That's right, Tofor is the master of defense that took over for Krieg after Krieg was slain. So those are the council members. Most everyone else there you see are servants. As time goes on eventually there is the ringing of a dinner bell down the hallway and everyone turns their head and notices and steps over to the great hall of the palace where the feast is to be given to you and other guests.
Sam: As we move, I release and then recast Invisibility on him when I see that there's a moment where everyone's distracted.
Matt: All righty, so you rejuvenate the Invisibility spell.
Marisha: Oh look, Tiberius, they have bananas!
Orion: Oh!
Laura: I can sense you, you dick.
Matt: You're escorted to the hall by Allura. She keeps chatting with you guys and asking questions about how Vasselheim was, and is Kima well? She stayed back there. She asks questions about why Pike isn't here and you tell her the story that she stayed behind and everything. You make your way into the great hall which seats a vast number of people. There are five major tables meant for like large feasts but there is one central square table in the far end that is by this giant hearth. This fireplace is probably a good six feet high and about 12 feet wide. It's a grandiose visual on the far end of this hall, and there's a long table right there set for about 20 people. You don't know if there will be that many there at the table but it can seat that many. At which point, all the different members of the council have their seats around it. You guys find your seats.
Laura: Can we get a feel for where the Briarwoods are going to sit?
Matt: With this many seats set, it's hard to tell, but you gather that they're probably going to sit--
Laura: Are there place cards? (laughs)
Matt: There are no place cards but there are two ends of the table that have two chairs at each end.
Laura: Okay. Can I position myself when I sit to where I can see them? So I can read their mouths, specifically.
Matt: Certainly. You can probably sit on the center or the far end of the table looking in their direction, should be fine.
Orion: Can I sit at the far end of the table at the very opposite end, if not at head of the end--
Laura: That's probably where Uriel is going to sit.
Orion: Oh. Who?
Travis: The king.
Orion: Oh! Not that chair.
Matt: Okay, but adjacent to it?
Orion: Yes. That would be rude, I think.
Matt: Okay, fair enough.
Sam: I assume I sit at the kiddie table because I'm so tiny?
Laura: They've got a booster chair for you, Scanlan.
Matt: They do have adjustments for gnomish guests-- is a way of putting it. All right, after you guys sit for a few moments, another servant steps forward and says, "Please, if we might rise for our guests Lord and Lady Briarwood to join us at the table--"
Sam: I am risen already. I'm standing already.
Matt: Lord and Lady Briarwood now enter arm in arm, slowly walking from the far end of the great hall. They make their way to one end of the table. They both wordlessly sit down, smiling and acknowledge everyone at the table. There's a moment of silence and then another servant says "And would all please attention be given to our sovereign Uriel Tal'Dorei the second and the Empress Salda Tal'Dorei." At which point, the sovereign and his wife enter from the same entrance point. Everyone stands up from their chair, waits for them to get to the edge of the table, at which point they nod their head. Everyone gives a low bow. You guys follow suit, following the social graces you're not familiar with but trying to learn as you go. Except for Tiberius, you know this deal. You all follow his lead on this. Eventually, everyone sits down again. Tables are pushed in by servants behind you, you're like 'oh' caught off guard by the whole experience. Uriel looks about the table with a smile, shoulder length brown hair and his chin goatee very well crafted into almost a point now. He looks about the table. "Thank you, Lord and Lady Briarwood, for making the journey across the lands so that we might meet in person, finally. Please, allow me to introduce our dining party and esteemed council of Tal'Dorei." He goes around the table introducing, "Arbiter Brom Goldhand. He is the master of law of our city, and is responsible for maintaining all of these grand people of our fair town in the realm of safety and order. We have Lord Riskel Daxio. He is our head of planning and construction; has overseen many of the expansions of the city, and is a trusted friend of mine. We have the Arcanist Allura Vysoren: one of my trusted advisors, one of the greatest arcane minds of all of Tal'Dorei, and the overseer of all things arcane within our city. We have the Guardian Tofor Brotorus, a fierce warrior and currently the master of defense in our city and hopefully for a long time to come." Tofor gives a (scoffs) sound and everyone is put off by it, but they're also seemingly used to it. "Arbiter Brom Goldhand: master of law. My lovely wife, the Empress Salda. We have here within our midst, as well: Vox Machina, a team of intrepid adventurers who rose up and saved my family's life and very well the city of Emon and have since proven very useful to our territory. Grog Strongjaw, a goliath of interesting dress, but strong of heart and blade. We have Vex'halia, half-elven maiden with a bow as swift as the fastest eagle." Looking next, he says, "We have here Vax'ildan, blades quick and eyes sharp, not a whisper passes his ear. Ah! There you are! Scanlan Shorthalt, a performer known far and wide. A wit as clever as you've ever seen. His songs are whispered through taverns across the land. We have Tiberius Stormwind--"
Orion: I'm from Draconia.
Matt: "Hailing from Draconia, which," he looks across to the Briarwoods, "the kingdom you hail from originally not being far off from Draconia, perhaps you've had some dealings with the Stormwinds?" And the Briarwoods give a nod. "Yes, we have seen them in the past. We've heard many good things."
Orion: We're pretty cool.
Matt: "We have over here, Keyleth of the Ashari, if I am correct on that? She is a denizen of the natural lands and protector of all things nature within Tal'Dorei."
Marisha: Hi.
Matt: "There was one more."
Taliesin: Two, and they could not be in attendance.
Laura: Yes, ill.
Orion: They were running around. They got diarrhea. Isn't that what you said?
Sam: Yes.
Matt: "Anyway. Welcome, and thank you." He reaches over and takes a small glass and clinks it with his silverware, the servants immediately muster up and start pulling glasses out and pouring wine into everyone's glasses and the conversation begins to naturally bustle about for this meal. Immediately conversation builds in about Uriel talking across to the Briarwoods talking about the bridge. He says "Now, the Uriel bridge, I don't think the name was necessary, but it's appreciated from my perspective. Now in this union between Wildemount and Tal'Dorei-- do we have a confirmed trade route between the two?" At which Lord Briarwood returns, "This is indeed very true. We are hoping that through this passageway, we'd have means of rather quick trade between this kingdom and yours. Not to mention this would allow for individuals to travel for carried parcels very quickly and we're hoping to establish perhaps a very quick means of communication outside of the arcane for those who cannot afford these various luxuries." Lady Briarwood taps on his shoulder and says, "Yes, and by the way, I don't mean to bring up a sore subject but it's come to our attention that apparently last Winter's Crest, there was an attempt on your life," and the table gets a little quiet for a second. "We're sorry to hear that and wish to express our--" Uriel puts his hand out and says, "No, no, it's quite all right. It was but a paltry attempt, and it was thwarted actually by Vox Machina. They have been tremendous in keeping us safe and I greatly appreciate their aid in overseeing my family's good fortune." Yes?
Liam: While all this is going on, can you describe. Are the Briarwood couple together, seated next to each other?
Matt: They are seated right next to each other at the head of one table across the way.
Liam: I intend to be behind them, but what's behind them, like?
Matt: What's behind them is just open space and servants. There's probably a good 25 servants here that are just like sitting there patiently, lying in wait for--
Liam: And behind the servants is a wall so there's lots of open busy crowded space? Okay.
Matt: And tables. There's like other unused tables in this great hall that are just out there. Four other ones.
Liam: All right. I'm going to drink the potion of climbing that Grog gave me, and I'm spidering up the wall and I'd love, while listening to all this to make an insight check on them just as they talk, just for funsies.
Matt: To inquire about--?
Liam: Just to see if they seem like sacks of shit.
Matt: Okay, go for it.
Liam: Luck, oh not that lucky. This is going to be very low. Yeah, never mind, low. Very low.
Matt: It's hard to tell from this distance really at all. They're very charming. You were expecting this very dour, dark, evil couple from all the conversation, but they seem nice. They seem earnest. They keep to themselves definitely, they're definitely a very tight couple but nothing about them catches you off guard as being anything instinctively twisted.
Liam: It's very hard to read them upside-down.
Laura: Could I inquire to Lady Briarwood?
Matt: You're saying this out loud? The conversation comes to a halt, she-- "Yes, of course. I'm so sorry, what was your name again?"
Laura: Vex'ahlia.
Matt: "Vex'ahlia. Absolute pleasure to meet you. Delilah."
Laura: You as well. I notice your dress is quite lovely. It doesn't look like a fashion that I'm used to seeing. Where do you hail from originally?
Matt: "We hail from Wildemount. It's quite a ways from here. The continent to the far east."
Laura: Really, I'm not familiar.
Matt: "You should come by sometime. We haven't been home in a number of years, having to tend to Whitestone, but we have quite an elaborate homestead there. We'd love to have you come stay with us if you ever find yourself in that side of the world."
Laura: I would love to visit. How long have you been at Whitestone?
Matt: "We've been at Whitestone for the better part of-- I can't even remember." And Lord Briarwood looks, he goes, "Best I can recall, four or five years. It was an unfortunate mantle to pick up but we've done what we can in honor of the passed de Rolo family."
Sam: Oh, sorry.
Orion: I was just going to ask, you seem such a lovely couple. Do you have any children?
Matt: "We unfortunately do not. It seems it was not in the cards for us to bear. However, we consider many of our esteemed servants and house guests our extended family. So we can leave a legacy, however we can possibly do so."
Laura: Can we insight check as, what they're saying?
Matt: Certainly.
Laura: I mean, I know they're lying out their asses. Fuck. 18.
Matt: 18? Seems pretty earnest.
Sam: Lord Briarwood. Down here, hi.
Matt: "I'm sorry, I--" he snaps and a servant moves a large like pig platter out of the way that was blocking your head from his vision.
Travis: You can move that over here actually, thank you. (chomping noises)
Sam: Lord Briarwood, we may share a mutual friend or acquaintance of some sort. My father was a prominent doctor, and he may have studied medicine with a fellow that you know named Dr. Ripulah, Ripley? Dr. Ripley? Do you know such a person?
Matt: "Yes, actually. Dr. Ripley is one of our esteemed physicians in Whitestone. Yes, recently come into some land herself, although she has been on holiday for some time. Following her own research as doctors are wont to do."
Sam: Are you close with her?
Matt: "I wouldn't say close, but she's been a friend at times, and she was one of the few that came with us from Wildemount over to Whitestone and has helped us restructure and maintain and help facilitate the blossoming of a city without a leader."
Sam: She sounds wonderful. Well, when you see her next tell her that my father, Dr. Jeff Shorthalt, said hi.
Matt: "Jeff Shorthalt, I will be happy to pass that along."
Taliesin: Lord Briarwood, I am not familiar with Whitestone. How did you become caretaker of such a place?
Matt: At which point, one of the other council members goes, "Um." and puts his hand out. "It's all right," and he pats the hand of his wife. He looks over at you with a smile. "We know not if it is connected with the disease, but before all this occurred, we became very close friends with the de Rolo family about ten or so years ago. Actually, the first time we met is an interesting tale, if you want to tell it, please." His wife goes, "All right all right, so they were taking a brief vacation east to Wildemount. Apparently, they had not traveled and they brought their family with them, a whole gaggle of small children. They were coming this direction. Now our homestead is on the western outskirts of Wildemount so one of the first places you traverse before going into the kingdom proper. However, the family, the de Rolo family had been caught in a bad downpour, a storm that had blown in and made travel rather impossible, and apparently they stopped not far from our homestead. They came to our front door asking for shelter for the evening, and we were happy to house them. We gave them dry clothes, food for the night, and well, a rather fast friendship was forged. As we quickly began to notice they weren't just rabble of the street, they themselves were highborn as we were and in a very dire circumstance. So we let them in, they stayed for but a week. We showed them about the western side of Wildemount and let them on their way. And since then we've had many different years we've spent together as families going on various journeys and trips together. But as time went on we got busy on our own and separate ways and we hadn't spoken in a while. They were in the process of discussing the building of the Uriel bridge about five years ago, and we were going to meet with them about pursuing this venture as a joint-- well, when the disease took them. The family passed on. We were surprised that they would've considered leaving Whitestone in our name, and we couldn't say no, at this point. To carry on their legacy, I felt, was important enough let alone the memory of that to carry on the building of this Uriel bridge. I thought I really wanted to spearhead the wishes of Frederick."
Orion: That is so courageous of you. Do you want me to Fireball her now?
Taliesin: A toast, then!
Matt: "A toast."
Taliesin: To gracious hosts.
Matt: "To gracious hosts."
Sam: L'Chaim.
Orion: Gesundheit.
Matt: "So. Uriel," and he looks across the way and says, "one of our largest exports in Whitestone is timber from the forests and woods that surround Whitestone and the Alabaster Sierras. We've had a rising danger in the surrounding woods. It has made it proven difficult to export most of these wooded goods. If it is possible, we would like for you to send some aid, perhaps a small band of soldiers to lead a strike into the woods." Uriel looks across the way and says, "Ah yes, we can definitely discuss that, I don't see why not. We are currently in peacetime and we have a reserve of soldiers we can send your way."
Marisha: I mean, we're also free.
Sam: Oh yes.
Matt: As the meal continues on, more conversations arise. A lot of bureaucratic BS. Anyone want to interject anything or ask any questions?
Orion: Is Allura there, still?
Matt: Allura is there, yes.
Orion: As we're eating I'm going to  By the way, did you ever perhaps finish making that extra earring I gave you several weeks ago? I don't know how long it's been.
Matt: Allura looks, glances over to the side and says, "Yes, it's been completed. No one's come by to take it from me"
Orion: I had no idea, I'll send someone.
Matt: "And as a note, I'm about a month away from completing the sigil in the base mentof your keep."
Orion: Oh, wonderful. Thank you, that's-- so talented. What flavor tea do you like, Allura?
Matt: "I prefer a mint or jasmine, to be honest."
Orion: Noted. I walk away
Matt: You step up and walk away from the dinner table. (chair scraping) Tiberius stands up in the middle of the discussion and walks away from the feast
Taliesin: Lady Briarwood, it is such an act of compassion to take on such responsibility as a house such as Whitestone.
Sam: Tiberius, get back here.
Orion: You said walk away.
Sam: No! Not every time!
Matt: "Well, thank you. This is the first time we've been away from Whitestone in many years."
Taliesin: That's such a spectacular act of kindness and generosity. Would, perhaps, Vox Machina also be of service to you?
Matt: "Perhaps, you seem strong of build and--"
Laura: We are handier than we look.
Marisha: We killed a beholder once.
Travis: Just right out with it.
Matt: "That is an impressive feat, young Keyleth."
Marisha: We should just lead with that.
Taliesin: And we killed an illithid once, as well.
Matt: "Slain a beholder? Uriel, you keep in the presence of some mighty heroes." Uriel goes, (chuckles) "They are proven allies. I mean, if you utilize their assistance. That would be very possible. May have something coming up that I could use them for myself, but we'll discuss in time. Nevertheless, the meal continues." She smiles and looks back at you.
Marisha: Can I do an insight check to see if that look at Percy-not-Percy was--
Matt: You can make an insight check, sure.
Taliesin: Can you? Can you make an insight check? I don't think you can.
Marisha: She looked interesting.
Matt: You're distracted by the pattern, the brocade across her torso area.
Taliesin: You know, you could roll lower if you tried.
Orion: I want to do an arcana check on them.
Matt: What are you checking for?
Orion: If they're armed with anything that has arcane properties.
Matt: Make an arcana check. It's not so much something you can sense, more than you can look for symbols. You rolled a 17? It looks like there are elements of their accoutrements that are, like any of you are carrying on yourselves. There's a choker that's part of the outfit that Lady Briarwood wears that itself does appear to have some tiny enchantment-based markings across it. They are adorned in various protective magic, but so is everybody else at the table.
Orion: Got you. Standard gear.
Travis: Lord and Lady Briarwood, we are, in fact, quite handy. Vax, we also killed an illithid, if I recall.
Taliesin: I think we did. Did we befriend an illithid or kill it? I think we did both.
Orion: We befriended it, it betrayed us, and then we killed it.
Sam: But enough about us. Earlier, you were telling us about a poor family that came down with that disease. I'm just curious, coming from a medical family. What was the disease that they had?
Matt: They look at each other and give a sorrowful look. "We do not know. We were only given the information that the family had passed, but a month or two after it had already occurred."
Marisha: The entire family. All of them?
Matt: "Most of the castle seemed to have fallen to it, as well."
Laura: So dreadful.
Matt: Uriel says, "My condolences, by the way. I understand that's very hard." "It's all right. The least we could do is try to carry on their legacy."
Laura: I know how hard it is to lose someone very close to you. I'm sorry for your loss.
Matt: "It's appreciated." He looks at his wife, and she looks up for a second. "It's all right."
Marisha: I'm sorry. I'm just a little confused. If the whole family died of disease, weren't you afraid to go into this town, into this castle? Weren't you afraid of contracting this disease yourself?
Matt: "There was worry of such a thing, but before Whitestone castle could be entered, we made sure to send in our best clerics to rid of any existing possible lingering disease, and to make sure to remove any corpses or bodies that may contain it. There was a period of time that we were worried, but after a few months, we came to the conclusion that we were safe, and thus we moved our way in."
Travis: Lucky for you.
Sam: Anyone care for some games of jenga?
Matt: At this point, the dessert has been brought out. It's a fine, almost creme brulee-type dish. It's delicious.
Laura: Are they whispering to themselves, still?
Matt: As part of the discussions, there are a few side exchanges here and there. The best you can make from it is, "Did you notice him?" She says, "Yes, don't worry." And, "Tonight, we'll stay." And those are the only things you can make out from the exchanges back and forth.
Laura: How long do you plan on staying here, Lord and Lady?
Matt: "Well, after this dinner, I imagine a few days, and we'll be on our way. We're merely here to finalize the paperwork for the bridge construction." She looks over and gives a nod to Lord Daxio, who gives her a nod back. "And maybe see the city for a while, and make our way back. It's too hard to be away, and our nephew has been left in charge of this."
Laura: Do you have plans on the morrow? I would love to give you a tour of the city.
Matt: "That would be lovely."
Laura: Wonderful! Should I send word? How should we arrange this?
Matt: "Where are you staying?"
Laura: We are outside of town at our own keep, actually.
Matt: "What's it called?"
Laura: The Greyskull Keep.
Matt: "Greyskull Keep. We will have you sent for when the time is right."
Laura: Lovely. That will be so fun.
Orion: Vex is so into showing people our city.
Laura: Perhaps you can show me some more of your fashions. I love your dress so much.
Matt: "Oh, well it's hard to show you this here. What you need to see is the Wildemount fashion district. It is divine."
Laura: Sounds wonderful.
Travis: I look at Vax and I go, does anyone want any dessert?
Orion: (gulping) I'm having a little.
Laura: Vax? You looked at Vax?
Travis: Yeah. Vaxy. The one that I can look at.
Orion: Do you want dessert now? Would you like this fireball creme brulee?
Taliesin: I'm just fine.
Marisha: (whispered) I don't know what to do now.
Matt: The meal has been now wound down, the dishes are being gathered by the servants, the wine has stopped being poured, and now everyone settles in with sighs of a meal well spent. The other council members begin to excuse themselves. Uriel stands up and says, "My apologies, me and my wife find that rest is in our future. Please, feel free to walk the halls as you see fit. Thank you again, Lord and Lady Briarwood, for joining us, and we're excited to continue this venture. Good night to you all."
Marisha: Hey, you should Hunter's Mark them or something.
Sam: Wait, no, that's Uriel that's leaving.
Liam: What's the gentleman who realized that I was there? Earlier, before we came in?
Matt: Asum? He's not in the room. He's been waiting in the foyer for you.
Laura: He was telling you to meet him in the foyer, a long time ago.
Liam: Oh, that's all right.
Laura: (whispered) You should go spy on their room. Go check out that room. I'll distract them.
Travis: (muffled) Go see if he's still there.
Matt: Lord and Lady Briarwood also stand up. "On that note as well, I think our meal has come to an end. We appreciate your--" and Lady Briarwood continues the sentence, "and we wish you all a fine night--"
Liam: I'm clicking my Boots of Haste and scuttling along the ceiling back towards the door.
Orion: I know a particular spell that it's rather wonderful. And I go blow a stream out and do a cantrip, Control Magic, and start doing a nice dragon fire dance that I know of from my home.
Sam: I play a little flute.
Matt: They both sit and watch for a moment--
Sam: (Star Wars Cantina song)
Liam: Am I finding what's-his-face?
Matt: You make your way out, and he's not there. You don't see him anywhere.
Liam: I'm doubling back.
Matt: Okay, you double back. After about a minute of this, "Yes, well, thank you kindly for that wondrous display. I feel that sleep takes us, and we are going to retire to our quarters. Have a wonderful night, everyone."
Marisha: Are you staying within the castle?
Matt: "Yes, yes."
Marisha: Oh! Fantastic.
Orion: Have a wonderful rest.
Matt: "And good night." And they both stand up, and then they make their way out, through the main great hall exit.
Liam: I'm following.
Matt: Okay. You gather across the ceiling as you go. You watch them head up the stairway to the second floor. They head to the right, down a long hallway, a series of doors. They come up to a door, where there are two guards standing outside. The same guards that led them inside the building, and were riding on horseback.
Laura: Could I Hunter's Mark him before they go in their bedroom?
Matt: Hunter's Mark is technically a minor spell. You could try it.
Laura: I mean they're walking away, when their back is turned, could I do it when they're not paying attention?
Matt: I'd say, make a stealth check. Trying to do this subtly at the table.
Laura: 20! (cheers)
Matt: You Hunter's Mark which one?
Laura: Lord-- no--
Sam: Sylas or Delilah?
Laura: Delilah.
Matt: Okay, you mark Delilah as she walks off. You have a sense of where she is at all times in the vicinity. As you follow them, they go to the door, the guards open the door for them, and lead them into their room, and then close the door.
Liam: Oh, that fast? All right. How close to the door are the guards? Right up against it?
Matt: Not against it, but immediately to the right and left of it.
Laura: I don't know what else to do, you guys.
Sam: Burn their room down. We've got to find Seeker Assam, or whatever his name is.
Liam: I yank off my serpent belt and throw it as far as I can. Not as far as I can. 20 feet, and set it in motion, so there's now a snake in the hall, 20 feet in front of these guys.
Matt: All right. You take it, and you throw the snake. Let me check one thing on Invisibility real fast. Just because--
Marisha: (laughs) Yeah, just, snake flies down the hall--
Orion: If he does an action, it dissipates the spell. It's not Greater Invisibility, so he goes uninvisible, when he does something.
Matt: "Attacks or casts a spell." It's not either of those. It's activating an item. You take the belt (whoosh), fling it (hissing), the snake appears to the side. One of the guards looks over. Looks over at the other guard, he pulls out his weapon and one of the guards steps over to where the serpent is and starts trying to stomp it out, and it nips up and gets some of the armor, and he's just, stomping out the snake.
Liam: So one's 20 feet away now?
Matt: About 25 feet away, yeah.
Liam: 25 feet away, and one guy stayed?
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: Kill them.
Liam: I drop, and I'm going to bean him on the head, like his name is Kynan.
Matt: Okay! All right. As you leap off the top, you (whoosh) land on the ground. Go ahead and roll an attack.
Liam: Okay. "Advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn in combat yet."
Matt: And he is surprised, because he does not know you're there.
Liam: And I'm invisible, so that's an 18. That is 29 to hit. Using the blunt end! I just want to knock him out.
Matt: Right, okay. Go ahead and roll sneak attack damage.
Liam: Doubled. 12, 17, 23, 24, 26, so 52. Plus-- No, I mean, if I am as skilled a rogue as I am, how could I not just want to knock somebody out, and not unintentionally-- ten. On top of the 52.
Matt: 62 damage will do it. You (whack) right to the side of the helmet, with a dull (thud) sound. Just falls like a sack of potatoes right against the wall.
Liam: Hand on the door. Is it locked?
Matt: The door is currently not locked. You can see the guard you just knocked out, had the key in his hand and was in the process of going to lock the door right when that happened.
Liam: Okay, so I flip my hood over my head, and I quietly go in the door.
Sam: Oh wait, you're not invisible anymore.
Liam: Yeah, I know.
Matt: Okay. So. (creak) You open the door and enter the room, closing it behind you. As soon as you enter the room, it's a large guest room. There are two windows across the way with curtains drawn to the side. You can see the darkness of the night sky behind that, and the rest of the low-lit Cloudtop District visible, and the courtyard surrounding the palace. Immediately to the right and left of you, you see two large tables that are covered in black cloths, that are just, tables to be, you know, vases and stuff set up on them. One's clean, one has actual decor on it. There are two wooden tables immediately to the right and left of you. There's a large red rug, central to the floor, that is circular, and on the far corners next to the two windows you see armoires, like dressers, for clothing and such. In the center of the room, you see, on top of the rug, against the wall between the two windows is a large canopy bed, very beautifully carved from dark wood, has a purple cloth silk canopy that drifts down around it. And on the far end, you can see now, against one of the tables, is Lady Briarwood is currently taking jewelry off of one of her arms while Lord Briarwood is right by the bed, holding on to the post, like he's just walked over to that area.
Liam: They're both at the bed?
Matt: They're both at the bed.
Liam: I got a 25 for stealth and it didn't work?
Matt: They're both looking in your direction.
Liam: All right. Oh, sorry. Sorry, I heard a noise in here. I work for the city. I apologize. That was really stupid. As you were. I walk out.
Matt: Make a deception check.
Liam: I'll use my last Luck of the day. Didn't do it; same thing. Nine, 11.
Matt: 11?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: Lord Briarwood goes, "Oh, well, that's all right. Not to worry, in no serious rush. Isn't that right, my dear?" And she looks over, she stops taking her jewelry off and turns. "Yes, yes, of course. As you, a man who works for the city."
Liam: Yes ma'am.
Matt: "What do you do for the city, if I may ask?"
Liam: Oh, I'm a guard. I mean, there's not really a name for what I do. I work for Uriel, I just-- I'm security, ma'am, and I thought I heard a noise in here. And I heard a body fall, I thought-- sounded like a body fell.
Matt: They both step a little bit closer. Looking at you--
Liam: I'm backing up as I'm talking, I'm right at the door! I didn't shut it behind me, I just cracked it open.
Matt: Right. Lady Briarwood goes, "You look strangely similar to a gentleman we just had dinner with."
Liam: That's crazy!
Matt: "It's uncanny how similar you look."
Liam: Yep.
Matt: (arcane chanting)
Liam: And I run!
Matt: You get to make a wisdom save, is what you do.
Sam: Jenga!
Liam: Not good. It's an eight.
Matt: You turn to move and your muscles (crunching) tense up, as you're unable to physically move.
Liam: This is awkward, ma'am, I'm just trying to do my job.
Matt: You're halfway through the doorway, stuck in place, as she keeps walking forward now, giving you a curious look. Lord Briarwood comes and flanks you from the other side. (clicks tongue) "You try and flee. I'm merely asking you questions. Come, let us discuss in more private quarters." And you feel the hand of Lord Briarwood slam onto your other shoulder. "Don't worry. You look delicious." And he pulls you into the room as she closes the door behind, and that's where we're going to end tonight's session. (screaming)
Sam: Jenga! We had a safe word for a reason!
Liam: That's cool.
Travis: Hashtag Save Vax!
Marisha: Dude, I think they're into some weird shit.
Matt: That was a very slow tension building episode that turned very interesting at the end. How you doing, Taliesin?!
Taliesin: (yells and groans)
Laura: They're so evil!
Marisha: They're creeping me out, man.
Taliesin: You're making it so much worse than I ever imagined.
Laura: They're totally vampires.
Marisha: Now we're going to have to rescue Vax.
Taliesin: I swear if the Briarwoods are responsible for a party kill, I'm going to feel like such an asshole.
Matt: (laughs) That'd be rough. Well, cool. We'll all be picking up that next week on Thursday.
Marisha: Oh, please, like you haven't rushed into a situation before, Orion?
Orion: No! I never have. I can actually say that.
Liam: Like attacking an inanimate door?
Marisha: Yeah! Or, or launching a Fireball in the middle of a wood house?
Taliesin: Trying to convince an entire army of illithid to follow you?
Marisha: Yeah! Rushing off to Draconia to buy a Bag of Holding.
Sam: Or just today, running off to the, to the sigil!
Orion: Never put myself in danger except for the illithid. Never put myself in danger. The fire thing. Now granted, I didn't know how Fireball worked at the time.
Liam: I'm sorry you're such a nervous fellow!
Orion: I'm just saying!
Laura: Oh hey, what's going on?
Liam: Come on, how am I going to play my second character unless I die now?
Taliesin: Or you could become a vampire! You can be a vampire half-elf.
Matt: All right guys, so! We got a lot of awesome donations tonight. Let's go ahead and rock through those.
Liam: I regret nothing.
Matt: As you shouldn't! That got really interesting really fast.
Liam: Yeah. I regret zip. [end of transcription]

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around, roll dice, and play Dungeons and Dragons, while Liam curses at me a few seconds before we start the show to try and throw me off. It's worked once before.
Taliesin: Cock goblins.
Matt: It'll probably work again. (laughs) Welcome to the show. So yeah, for the returning friends, thank you for coming, and for new folks, welcome to the chaos.
Travis: Get the fuck out.
Laura: Don't say that.
Matt: It's already so hostile here tonight. So I guess first and foremost, let's see if we can get through these announcements pretty quick. First and foremost, a reminder, me and Marisha will be in Colorado tomorrow at the Colorado Anime Fest. We'll be guests this weekend there, so if any folks are coming out, we'll look forward to seeing you. We'll be flying over bright and early tomorrow morning. Taliesin, you're also--
Taliesin: I will be in Phoenix, Arizona at the Amazing Comic Con, and if you follow me on Twitter, @executivegoth, I will actually tell you where I will be at the convention at various times.
Matt: So you can stalk him.
Taliesin: You can stalk me. I'll be very stalkable. E-stalk.
Marisha: It's like Santa Tracker, but Taliesin Tracker.
Matt: Yeah. Waldo Tracker. Why has nobody done that yet? Give it some time. Let's see. Also, I guess, tonight we're going to be trying out this new table camera here on the side to give you a separate view of the battle. We can switch around as we're finding our way through the amorphous betterment of our program.
Liam: Can we work in like a Wolf Blizter hologram? Like they have on CNN as well?
Matt: I'll put that on the wish list.
Liam: On the table, next to all the guys.
Matt: Only if it's actually Wolf Blitzer, though. If we can have him running through the battlefield, it'll be great.
Taliesin: Just his head, floating.
Matt: But yeah, so you can head to the Geek and Sundry Amazon wish list, the link should be in the chat, for other things they're looking for to hopefully try and improve this experience and bring it to you guys and be even better going forward. So you can check that out, and this camera's our first leap in that direction, so you can let us know how you think it works and bear with us as we still figure this whole thing out. Let's see. Also, next week, most of us will be at Wizard World Portland. That's our first Wizard World, you can check out the website for information about our events and signings and tickets and stuff like that, so go check it out, please, we look forward to seeing you guys, and we'll see you up in Portland next weekend. What else do we have going on?
Liam: Well, you know, we have an ongoing relationship with Wyrmwood Gaming, which you can find on the internet. They make beautiful boxes for holding dice and stuff, and if you use the code "critrole," "critrole," you will get free shipping. They have all different kinds of woods, they're lovely. And then also, hey, this is an impromptu announcement, but Kurtis Wiebe just announced on the Twitters, Kurtis Wiebe is the writer for the comic book Rat Queens.
Laura: Amazing.
Liam: We all are addicted to it. He works with Tess Fowler, who's the artist right now, and basically their outfit and our outfit are in love, and Kurtis announced on Twitter today that he is going to be shoving Vox Machina in there in some way, somehow, and we're very excited.
Laura: We're making a cameo appearance in Rat Queens, you guys!
Taliesin: Our first cameo.
Sam: I want to be the rat!
Matt: (laughs) You would, wouldn't you? So stupid excited for that. Can't even. I can't even. It's so dumb. So dumb. Life is dumb. Life is dumb. But yeah. So, we got that going on. I can't think of anything else. If anything else comes up, we'll throw it in there in the mid-break, but in the meantime--
Sam: Oh yeah, I want to give a quick shout-out to my charity of choice, the Pablove Foundation.
Matt: Yes!
Sam: I talked to them today. Their minds were blown by all the gifts that people have sent in and donations in the name of Critical Role and the Critter community. They didn't quite understand what the Critter community was, but I enlightened them, and they're so jazzed by you guys. And they appreciate not just the donations and gifts, but also, they said that the Critters have been writing long letters and telling great stories and stuff, and they're super excited.
Marisha: That's awesome!
Sam: So keep it going to those charities. The Pablove Foundation.
Marisha: Yeah, should we go off and do a shout-out of each of our charities?
Matt: Sure, go for it.
Taliesin: First Place for Youth. I'll have a link up to my Twitter in about five minutes. They help kids get through school, they help kids who are orphaned and having issues get their stuff together and become fabulous teenagers like we need in this world.
Marisha: We do. And of course, Sam is with Pablove Foundation.
Sam: The Pablove Foundation.
Marisha: Pablove Foundation, which is amazing. I chose the Nature Conservancy. They're great and they protect the lands and the animals that is very important so we can keep having a beautiful green world.
Liam: I chose the Planetary Society, just in case the green world dies, and it promotes exploration of space, and the stuff like that.
Laura: I chose My Friend's Place, which is an awesome, very similar to Taliesin's, it's an awesome place for teenagers that are runaways or living on the streets. It gives them a place that they can crash and really help get their stuff together.
Matt: 'Sup, Jewel-face?
Travis: I am the Vision. (laughter)
Matt: Donate to the Vision.
Travis: Yes, I have Operation Supply Drop, which is a great charity service that delivers fun where there is none to soldiers that are in combat overseas. It delivers gaming systems, games, brings some much-needed levity to areas of high intensity and overall warrior badassmanship, and I'm very proud of that.
Liam: What a variety of charities.
Marisha: Yeah, that's a good stretch of charities.
Matt: My charity.
Marisha: Oh, yeah.
Sam: Oh, yeah.
Matt: I got one too, guys!
Marisha: Sorry. I sometimes forget about you, because you're on that side.
Matt: I know, it happens.
Liam: You're god!
Matt: Hey, no, overlooked my entire life, it's nothing new. My charity is First Book, which brings reading materials to underprivileged children and helps people become more confident readers and youth that don't have access to programs to help promote literary adventure and really delving into the amazing thing that is reading. Thank you guys for helping us support that, it's been really fantastic.
Marisha: All things that are important for the future.
Matt: So important. More than you'd give it credit for. Yes.
Marisha: And of course, as always, Critical Role always supports 826LA.
Laura: Yes, continually.
Marisha: Continually. They are our sponsored charity of choice, and of course look up 826, there might be an 826 in your area. And you should go to their storefronts. They make great date locations, as Taliesin always says.
Taliesin: Yes, great date.
Laura: Oh, they really do, that is a really good place.
Matt: Find a date. Take them there.
Marisha: Find the date first.
Matt: Tell them Critical Role sent you.
Marisha: Don't try and find dates at 826. That gets-- that's bad. (laughter)
Taliesin: Wow, you took that to a dark place. You took that--
Matt: Anyway. So. So. Let us go ahead and delve into tonight's game proper, folks. So, to get you up to speed, Vox Machina, the intrepid band of adventurers you see before you, after a series of adventures, had found their way back to their central city of Emon, in the center of the region of Tal'Dorei. After a ceremony in which the leader of their city, Sovereign Uriel Tal'Dorei, was announcing him stepping down, the town was suddenly under siege by a group of extremely powerful and dangerous ancient dragons that call themselves the Chroma Conclave. After tearing the city asunder in many places, three of them flew off into the east under the instruction of the fourth and possibly largest and leader of the group, that has recently been found to be called Thordak the Cinder King, who currently resides in the center of the city of Emon, claiming that his mercy is only for those who worship him and essentially feed his greed and hunger. As such, Vox Machina, narrowly escaping the battle, a couple of encounters with these dragons, including one above their Keep, are housing a number of survivors who have made their way out of the city and are currently residing in Greyskull Keep for protection. You guys went into the city to see if you could find any other allies and friends that may have survived this encounter. You befriended a member of the Clasp, named Garthok, who walked amongst the rubble and proceeded to show you the secret entrance he knows to the Clasp, of which you may be trying to inquire about information. On your way to that area, you passed by Gilmore's shop, Gilmore being a good friend of the group and a powerful magic practitioner and creator of magical items and artifacts and a number of glorious goods. His abode, however, smashed and currently a pile of burnt wood and rock. Looters were currently poring through, and you attempted to get them to leave the area alone. It came to blows, and with many of the looters falling in battle, two of which were kept locked away. You discovered the location of where they were hoarding the massive amounts of gold and artifacts that they had acquired from the rubble. You then found the secret compartment in which Gilmore's teleportation sigil was locked beneath his shop, where the remaining family of Tal'Dorei, Salda and the three children, as well as Gilmore himself, wounded and barely alive, having saved them. You found that Uriel, the Sovereign, did not seemingly survive the encounter with the dragons, and Gilmore nearly fell going back to try and make sure that you guys were okay, barely escaping with his life. You managed to save his, and taking the children, Salda, Sherri, and Gilmore back to Greyskull Keep, some of you splintered off to try and acquire the goods that were taken from his store, however, they apparently had already been stolen from the location they were being stored in, or been delivered already, you're uncertain as to what became of them, but you get the sense that it was probably best that you chose Gilmore over the gold at first glance. Making your way back to the Keep, you've sent Gilmore up to rest for the evening, some of you have then found your way down into the temple of Sarenrae, where a number of the escaped refugees from Emon currently try desperately to cling to their memories, to try and keep the shakes at bay and contemplate what the next step is for survival in this now partially ruined city. That was where we left off. So. What would you like to do?
Sam: Kill all the dragons and save the day.
Matt: Good! Roll for it.
Laura: Oh, that was a good roll. See?
Taliesin: Natural 20. No, no.
Marisha: Good show, guys.
Laura: I rolled five natural 20s before the show even started.
Sam: That's a great, great idea.
Laura: So it's all going to be terrible.
Sam: Why are you rolling before the show?
Travis: She feels like she's got to "warm up" her endless army of dice.
Laura: No, I just have to figure out which ones I want to use that night.
Travis: You have five d20s right now.
Laura: I know, and they're all useful. No, I've got six out here.
Liam: Yeah, yeah, definitely all useful.
Taliesin: This is, by the way, for anybody tuning in for the first time at home, this is how we express that we have no idea what to do.
Sam: Where are we?
Taliesin: We're at home.
Matt: You're in Greyskull Keep.
Sam: And Gilmore's with us?
Matt: Gilmore's with you, he's been brought upstairs--
Liam: And did Pike's holy visitor fix the keep, or is the keep still effed up?
Matt: Actually, in the short time in which her visitor, this angelic deva-like entity that was brought forth from Sarenrae's sphere of influence, did manage to repair entirely the damage that was sustained to the Keep from the battle with Vorugal out in your courtyard. So yes, Greyskull Keep is now back to being intact and rather fairly polished. The stained glass is affixed and corrected.
Liam: It must look so strange next to the ruined city of Emon.
Matt: It's far enough away, but--
Laura: Little strange.
Marisha: So what time is it? It was nighttime, right? Or was it midday?
Matt: It's about midafternoon at this point, maybe pushing into the evening.
Taliesin: Is Kima still around?
Matt: I'm sorry, what was that?
Taliesin: Is Lady Kima still around, or?
Matt: Lady Kima's been in Vasselheim.
Taliesin: Oh, not Vasselheim, I'm sorry. Allura. I'm on the wrong page.
Matt: Yeah, she and Drake went.
Marisha: Remember, they turned into shooting stars and they flew away.
Sam: Is Clarota still here with us? (laughter)
Laura: We're off to a good start tonight, guys.
Matt: In your hearts. In your heart of hearts.
Travis: No, not even there. That piece of shit. Where are the majority of the people? Are they in the dining hall and in the--
Matt: They're scattered between the dining hall and the temple to Sarenrae. Partially because, one, there's enough space there, two, it's a place of sanctity, it's a place of hope, and Pike is currently bringing people-- not preaching to them, per se, but offering comfort in their current area of misery and worry. So those are pretty much the localized areas. Occasionally one of the kids might begin wandering the halls, a parent might chase after them, trying to draw them back in, but respectfully, no one's wandering the house filling their pockets, they're all still happy to be alive at this point.
Laura: Well, that's because we don't have anything, because Scanlan's troupe stole everything anyway.
Matt: There's that, too.
Sam: We bought new silverware.
Travis: Sure we did.
Sam: Maybe it wasn't my troupe, maybe it was our new guests, the people fleeing for their lives.
Travis: I was going to say, are there any new people that have come into the keep while we've been away? Can I ask one of our guards that?
Matt: Sure, yeah. Shayne, who's out front, currently strolling through the courtyard, comes up to you, and as you ask her, she goes, "Well, we've had a few other refugees come in and ask for entry, and we patted them down to make sure there were no weapons and tried our best to keep an eye on them since they arrived. Seems like most everyone's keeping either into the city or keeping fairly underground."
Travis: Nobody's sticking out to you, though, no shady individuals, nobody sweating more than is necessary when being threatened by a big fuck-off dragon?
Matt: "Not yet, but I believe Jarett's keeping a close eye."
Travis: Jarett--
Sam: That guy. Man-crush?
Travis: No. (laughter)
Sam: I wonder, in all prudence, should we go around to the 'fugees, the refugees and do a quick--
Laura: Insight check?
Sam: -- scan, alignment check or something?
Travis: Lauryn Hill is shaking her head.
Laura: Do we have anything that can sense people's alignment?
Sam: Pike might.
Marisha: Yeah, I can.
Sam: Can you do a mass, a mass sense alignment?
Marisha: Mass sense alignment?
Sam: Is that a thing?
Marisha: No, I'm saying I could do some insight checks on people.
Sam: Oh, I'm talking about your magic.
Marisha: No, I'm not Pike.
Sam: All right.
Travis: Pike's with us, though, right? She could do an insight check.
Sam: Is she with us?
Matt: Pike is with you. She is currently helping folks inside the temple. But you could go ask her to.
Liam: Use the skull to wish to know everyone's alignment. Problem solved.
Travis: We'll kill everyone. Kill everyone.
Sam: Maybe we should just kill one of them to make an example.
Laura: This is terrible, what is happening?
Liam: This isn't the real game, the game hasn't actually started yet.
Matt: So. Glancing about the populace of scattered refugees throughout the general vicinity of Greyskull Keep, I will pick two of you who wish to be the main surveyors of the crew.
Sam: Is this insight?
Matt: This would be insight, yes.
Laura: I'm on it.
Marisha: I'm on it with Vex.
Matt: Okay, so Vex and Keyleth, both you guys roll insight checks, please.
Laura: See, this is why I shouldn't have this many dice, because I don't know what to choose. Okay. 21.
Liam: Insight?
Marisha: 22.
Laura: 21.
Matt: Okay. Both of you guys spend about ten, 15 minutes or so scanning through the crew, asking a few questions, helping a few folks out while keeping an eye on reactions around the general vicinity. No one sticks out to you as being either hiding their intent, shifty. There are a few folks that are aloof from the whole experience, who seem to be either in a state of shock, or discomfort based on their current surroundings, but nothing in a way that strikes you as nefarious or worrisome.
Liam: And are they all strangers, other than the people we brought back with us?
Matt: Correct.
Liam: They are strangers?
Matt: Yeah. There's a lot of people that live in Emon, and none of them seem to catch your eye.
Liam: Yeah. Is anyone still badly hurt?
Matt: Most of them have had their wounds tended to. There are a few that have general scars, some from elements of frostbite on their skin, who were caught in the blast, who were salvaged after Vorugal left. There are a few that have scrapes and bruises from fleeing from the town, from collapsing debris from different buildings and such, but no serious injuries. A few bone fractures here and there that have been set and bandaged.
Liam: I'm going to spend the first bit of time at home helping Pike, doing whatever she tells me to do, really, to help the people here.
Marisha: Is there any deceased that need to be tended to?
Matt: Well, there are a number of deceased in the front courtyard, people that were frozen and shattered as part of Vorugal's attack, which at this point, most of them have been taken care of by the guards and given a proper burial on the outside of the Keep, a few yards away, towards the inside of the one of the hills. They haven't been left to thaw, if that was what you're worried about.
Marisha: That's what I was worried about.
Taliesin: Red meat. Red.
Laura: Gross.
Liam: Way to go dark. Way to go dark.
Taliesin: I thought that's what we were doing today.
Matt: Cost-effective. A number of the refugees have also helped the guards as well, transporting the bodies of the deceased and making sure that they're properly interred in the nearby countryside.
Marisha: Okay.
Sam: What are our options here? First of all, do we know Gilmore's status?
Laura: Yeah, we need to get him settled in, make sure he's all right.
Liam: Well, he's gone up, he's resting.
Marisha: Yeah, we put him to bed already.
Liam: He's in Percival's room, I think. You said you would sleep in your laboratory.
Sam: And when we last left things, there was one plan to go into the tunnels of the thieves' guild and try to see if there's any more--
Laura: Yes. Actually, Garthok.
Marisha: Yes.
Laura: Garthok is waiting for us down in those, so we can go look at the Clasp and talk to them and everything, because he's told them we're on our way.
Sam: And to what end, again? We're going to see if there's any random diplomats left over?
Taliesin: They're the only functioning organization left in the city at this point.
Liam: It's true, they're a double-edged sword, though. I mean, they should not be trusted, we cannot trust them, but they are an infrastructure under the city. They may have more of an idea what's going on than we do. I'm the best to speak to them, but I'm not on good terms with them, and I've never really talked to you about this, but you were marked at one point, a long time ago.
Laura: What?
Sam: For death?
Liam: Actually, yes.
Laura: Why? What did I do?
Liam: I'm sure I don't know. The reason there is a brand on my back is because I interceded. Some other schmoe died instead of you. You might be a bit of a sore point with them. I don't know. They might not remember, but I don't think that's true, I think they'll remember.
Marisha: How long ago was this?
Sam: What did you do?
Laura: So many things.
Liam: Before we met, when Vex and I were on our own.
Sam: Was it because you farted that time?
Laura: You didn't think you could mention this? All the times we've dealt with the Clasp? You didn't think it was worth mentioning that I almost died?
Marisha: She's already been down there. She's already been down there! You think they're going to recognize her now?
Liam: We're going down to talk.
Laura: We've been down there to talk.
Liam: Right. All right.
Laura: That's why you don't keep secrets.
Taliesin: Well, I say that we organize a group. Let's not get overexcited about the sudden realization that some of us can be a bit iffy. We've all had a moment, probably within the last three weeks. I'm not saying I don't.
Travis: I haven't.
Taliesin: Yes, oddly, you and Pike seem to be immune.
Travis: It is a virtue.
Taliesin: But let's organize a group, and let's at least open relations with them at this point.
Marisha: Well, hang on, hang on. What are we going to say to them when we get down there? What are we going to offer them?
Taliesin: We are going to offer them our services in getting this city back to a functioning level. They don't want a city ruled by a dragon, we don't want a city ruled by a dragon. It's in their interest to help us clear the city.
Liam: They're going to look out for themselves, and you're probably-- I'm sure you're right, they want these dragons out, but they will do-- they will preserve their own existence, and there's a possibility that bowing before these beasts will preserve their existence.
Taliesin: Not long-term, and these are groups that think long-term.
Marisha: Wait, are you talking about us bowing to the Clasp, or the Clasp bowing to the-- okay. Sorry, there were levels.
Liam: And yes, we've been down there, we've argued with them, but we're talking about going down there and making an alliance, an ongoing alliance, and shit might come up, that's all I'm saying.
Taliesin: Let's make it a business deal. We're talking about making a political decision. This is politics.
Travis: What if they leave? What if they leave the city, or what if they turn us in to the dragon to save their own asses?
Taliesin: They could. I doubt they'd leave, that's a terrible waste of an investment.
Marisha: You're essentially relying on the underbelly of Emon to restore it.
Taliesin: I am, I'm relying on greed, it tends to be exceedingly reliable.
Marisha: In your experience.
Taliesin: Yes.
Laura: In all experience, let's be honest.
Taliesin: Thank you.
Travis: Said the greedy one to the greedy one.
Liam: This is one option, are we sure we don't want to seek help--
Sam: Yes, what are our other options?
Taliesin: I'm curious as to other options.
Sam: We know why the dragons are here, right? Ish?
Marisha: I really feel like it might be necessary for me to also reach out to the Air and Earth and possibly even the Water Ashari. It might be difficult because I haven't been there yet. To see if they've had any other tears through the other elemental planes.
Taliesin: That would be quite wise.
Marisha: We can also seek to employ their services.
Travis: Scanlan.
Sam: Huh?
Travis: What about you becoming a spy?
Sam: I've been thinking about that, long and hard.
Marisha: Have you?
Sam: Yes.
Marisha: What are your thoughts?
Sam: Most of what I do is long and hard. And my thoughts are still: fuck you, no way, fuck off.
Travis: So what you're saying is?
Sam: Maybe. (laughter)
Liam: So you're saying there's a chance.
Travis: Your shining moment--
Taliesin: Nothing is ever going to top the triceratops, really.
Sam: Maybe the triceratops could kill all the dragons.
Travis: All right. So we reach out to the Ashari.
Taliesin: Absolutely.
Sam: How's your homeland?
Taliesin: I don't know.
Sam: Do we need to find out?
Taliesin: I would love to.
Sam: You can transport there instantly.
Taliesin: I can. I just can't get back instantly.
Laura: You need Keyleth.
Taliesin: And I figure that they would have sent somebody at this point if things had gone-- they have an instant transport to us if they need to find us.
Sam: True.
Laura: Unless they don't know about the stone and the only one with the stone--
Taliesin: The Council knows about the stone.
Travis: Or there's no one left to send.
Liam: Yes, if things went south--
Taliesin: We would've heard.
Marisha: I can scry twice today.
Taliesin: That would be lovely.
Marisha: I can do it two times. So we need to pick where it's most important to check in versus where we might want to pop in and say hello.
Taliesin: Whitestone is also somewhere we could arm ourselves more completely against something like this. We're going to have to start--
Travis: With what?
Matt: As a note, too, Pike can also scry as well.
Laura: Oh, good. Because I would like to check in to Vasselheim as well.
Sam: How do you kill a dragon? Do we need a dragon? Can we get a dragon that hates these dragons? Is that a thing?
Laura: You know, there is the Slayer's Take.
Travis: Wait, what are we talking about dragons? Do other dragons hate dragons?
Sam: Yeah, could we find a dragon who could fight for us?
Laura: Well, there's metallic dragons.
Liam: Don't get along with chromatic.
Sam: Do we know any metallic dragons?
Travis: Yeah, where are they?
Marisha: We would have to go to Vasselheim and maybe--
Taliesin: My Aunt Edna.
Travis: What?
Taliesin: She's a dragon-lady, I don't know if that's the same thing.
Marisha: Like, oh, like she-- little ceramic dragons, she likes collecting them?
Taliesin: I was mocking him, yes.
Sam: So, wait, the Slayer's Take, what?
Laura: Well, it's an organization made to hunt massive creatures, isn't it?
Liam: It's a horde of fucking ass-kickers, is what it is.
Taliesin: We fought a dragon-- we killed a dragon for them.
Marisha: They're also rooted in Vasselheim, which is--
Sam: It's safe.
Laura: Yes, but-- If everything else is under attack, Vasselheim is inevitable.
Sam: Yes, but they're protected.
Laura: For a time.
Liam: Allow me to play tiefling's advocate. If we leave now and allow the Clasp to take hold and form some sort of new shadow government, without us having any part in it, it's out of our control completely. It won't be in our control at all. But maybe if we speak to them now, we'll have a better idea of what's going on. I'm not sold on any idea yet, but if we leave now and let things play out, it's entirely out of our hands.
Marisha: All right, well, how about this? We can scry, between Pike and I, four times. So we can make four phone calls today.
Sam: Not phone calls, just a look.
Marisha: Yes, look home. No, we can peek through a window. And we can try and go visit the Clasp.
Sam: Okay, well, let's scry it up, then. Who are we calling? Whitestone, Vasselheim, center of Emon?
Taliesin: Whitestone and Vasselheim, I think. Definitely.
Marisha: And I want to check in with--
Travis: Can I object to checking the center of Emon, right? Because that's where the Cinder King is?
Taliesin: Yes.
Travis: Didn't it, like, ruin magic when we did it to the beholder, didn't it see us and laugh and we were like, augh, it hurts my brain--
Taliesin: He's got a point. You've got a point.
Sam: You're pretty smart, Grog.
Marisha: We don't need to scry into Emon.
Travis: I remember.
Liam: We're talking Vasselheim, yeah? Whitestone. And you can do it another two--
Marisha: You know what, let's go talk to Pike, because Pike might possibly have some sort of spiritual connection with Vasselheim as well that might save us a scry.
Taliesin: It's possible that Vasselheim might be our next stop after we secure everything here.
Marisha: Okay.
Sam: Oh, Pike! Oh.
Marisha: I can also teleport us once today, if we decide to go anywhere.
Sam: Thanks.
Marisha: Pike!
Sam: Pike! Pikey!
Matt: Comes out, a little bit of dirt on her brow, looks like she's been busy handling some of the folks--
Sam: I reach out and brush the dirt from above her forehead.
Matt: She smiles and pushes your hand away. "Yes, what, yes?"
Marisha: Pike, do you have any sort of spiritual connection with Vasselheim? Do you feel-- you know how--
Matt: "I do. I do. Why?"
Marisha: Okay, can you check--
Sam: Can you scry?
Marisha: Can you see if they're okay? We want to scry and check in with a few places.
Matt: "Of course, of course, no worries." She ushers you guys back into the temple.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: And then gets a little nervous when she starts thinking about it and walks up to the central platform of prayer and takes out her holy symbol. Her armor's off right now, by the way, she's in her ceremonial robes. Because it's hard to clank around in armor amongst a bunch of refugees. Sits down and focuses for a second, and pulls out some salt, and begins spreading it into a small triangular shape around her, and then pulls her holy symbol out and closes her eyes, and for that moment, you can see a beam of sunlight come through the roof, the glass roof of the temple, which then refracts into multiple colors that slowly dissipate around her. You can see, everyone else that has gathered in the room falls quiet, and watches on as there is this tiny little visual miracle. And she stays there for a moment. A few more moments. Probably about 30, 40 seconds pass before the light slowly retracts back up through the glass, and she stands up and turns around and goes, "Vasselheim seems fine for now. Untouched from the dragon's scourge, at the very least."
Marisha: That's good.
Laura: That's good.
Taliesin: What of Whitestone?
Matt: "Oh. Yes." She gets right back down into position with an air of begrudging acceptance. Focuses for a second. Spends a few more moments in her scrying ritual before stepping back, and turns slowly to you, Percy, and says, "Whitestone seems fairly overlooked by these dragons as well. The town rebuilds. People seem to be going about their lives. Possibly none the wiser as to what's transpired this side of Tal'Dorei."
Taliesin: We'll send word, at the very least.
Laura: It's all over the water. Maybe the dragons haven't gone that far.
Taliesin: It's far north. I'll make sure to send word.
Matt: "Okay." One of the kids starts crying, and she goes, "Oh, hold on." And goes over and starts tending to one of the children who has like a knee brace on, and is currently aching, and she goes to help calm him down. "Shh, shh."
Liam: Do you think you could look in on Syngorn?
Marisha: Of course.
Laura: Mostly to see, you know.
Marisha: I step up to the table, and begin my scrying ritual, checking on Syngorn first.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: Shit.
Laura: Come on.
Taliesin: We need like cups and string or something.
Sam: We do. Or a walkie-talkie. He's saying, Syngorn is gone.
Laura: Don't say that.
Taliesin: Millions dead.
Laura: Millions. It's very large.
Travis: Remember to shop at Gilmore's Ruined Rubble. (laughter)
Sam: Oh no, he didn't even get a new franchise before it was--
Taliesin: For all your reclaimed wood needs.
Travis: Oh. Well done. Well done. That was nice.
Taliesin: The best was watching Laura go, "Oh what a great i-- ooh."
Travis: And endless supply of pavers and gravel.
Sam: Gilmore's Building Supplies. (laughter)
Travis: All your home improvements.
Matt: Back to your regularly scheduled D&D game.
Sam: What did you see, Keyleth?
Marisha: Syngorn is gone. And I don't mean destroyed, I don't mean burnt. I don't mean that it's rubble, I mean it's gone. The city is gone. There's, like, a huge chasm, a huge empty spot in the middle of the forest where Syngorn once lied. Lie.
Sam: Lay. Did it look like it was destroyed to nothing? Or transported somewhere?
Marisha: Like that. Like transported, like the city was lifted out of its place and was teleported elsewhere.
Sam: Could it have been-- I don't know how your scrying works-- could it have been some sort of a magical block? Not real, an illusion of some sort?
Matt: I would like Vax and Vex to both roll a history check.
Laura: Any kind of advantage on that? For growing up there or something?
Matt: Nope, that's-- you get to roll this because of that.
Liam: History?
Taliesin: Should have stayed in school.
Liam: Didn't help.
Laura: Eight.
Liam: 15.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: Can I take a roll just for being a nerd?
Liam: All out of luck.
Matt: Are you proficient in history?
Taliesin: I am proficient in history.
Matt: Sure, I'll let you roll.
Taliesin: I want a nerd roll. 24. Book reading!
Matt: Okay. Being the astute researcher, the indoor kid growing up. Yeah. There aren't a lot of books that made their way north about pure elven culture, especially wooded elves, that comprise the entirety of the Syngorn nation.
Taliesin: I speak Elven, so that's good. (laughter)
Matt: It has rarely come into play, but because of previous wars, terrible devastation, and the need for the elvish culture to protect itself, and to maintain its existence, you do know that there have been instances of large enchantments on places of cultural importance that would bridge between here and the Feywild. And as a defense mechanism, essentially, would cloak and/or shift those locations.
Taliesin: They've gone into hiding.
Marisha: How can you be sure?
Taliesin: I can't, but there's reason to believe so. It's what it points to.
Liam: What points to what? What are you talking about?
Taliesin: Historically, elves have, in times of great stress, taken important sites, important places, people, and either cloaked them, hidden them, or moved them into the Feywild until such time as the danger has passed. There is precedence for this. They've gone into hiding.
Laura: Great.
Liam: That's one more thing our father failed to impart to us.
Laura: (laughs cynically) At least he's safe.
Taliesin: Most likely.
Marisha: I need to check in on the Air Ashari. I'm going to spend my last scrying.
Matt: Okay. As your vision separates from your current place of origin, you find yourself drifting up into the clouds and speeding through the air. The location itself is blurred, though recalling the origin of where you originally came from, you pass by columns of black smoke to your left, you assume somewhere related to Westrunn's current location.
Marisha: Right.
Matt: Eventually, the clouds part, and you find yourself thrust down upon the earth amongst the center of the Air Ashari tribe. You can see the thin leather constructs that make up a portion of your people's hovels and buildings. You can see the nearby chasm-based windfall that pours through constantly with a gentle whistling sound that forever is marked as the chorus that guides you all to sleep every evening. There, you can see your people amongst various conversations, going amongst their various daily duties, seemingly untouched, unscathed, and unaware of what recent events had transpired.
Marisha: They're okay.
Matt: That is the last of your scrying capability for the day.
Taliesin: You didn't have to know that. Big girls don't scry. Sorry, I saw it on Netflix.
Laura: Wow. Wow. Hit after hit after hit today, Taliesin.
Liam: You know, just because you can, doesn't mean you should.
Taliesin: I know. I know. Coffee hasn't kicked in yet.
Marisha: All right, they're okay. They seem unaware, which is very disheartening on a few levels.
Taliesin: Well, they'll know soon enough.
Marisha: Exactly.
Taliesin: We are going to need transport.
Sam: To where?
Taliesin: Ah. I don't think we're going to win this fight staying here, I think we're going to have to rally power, I think we're going to have to rally allies. I don't think there's enough here for us to win.
Laura: Can we relocate all of the refugees staying in our walls? Can we bring everyone through the Sun Tree? Keyleth? How long does it stay open?
Marisha: Six seconds.
Taliesin: We can go in shifts. This is not something that's going to be solved tomorrow. We can take a week, and move people.
Liam: That's true. And there's 50 to 100 refugees, you said, something like that, right?
Matt: At this point now, in your keep, surviving, you're looking at the 30s.
Liam: 30s?
Sam: But there's hundreds more inside the city walls. Thousands.
Taliesin: We're going-- we're not going to be able to empty the city.
Laura: But we can at least get these people out.
Taliesin: We can get these people out. And we're going to need-- and I apologise for the brightness in my voice-- I think we're going to need an airship.
Laura: An airship sounds wonderful, Percy, but--
Liam: You mean like the one that crashed?
Taliesin: Like the one that crashed.
Laura: One dragon attacking it and it's down.
Taliesin: We're going to need to move quickly, though, from city to city, and we're going to need to get word.
Marisha: Well, moving quickly from city to city-- I don't know.
Taliesin: We may have to steal an airship or something.
Sam: You're going to steal a plane?
Taliesin: I'm making a plan. I'm thinking of a plan.
Laura: You keep thinking, there.
Taliesin: It's working.
Marisha: Well, I mean, I've recently discovered that that misty Wind Walk spell that I cast on all of us is not great for battle, but is great for travel. And that lasts for eight hours.
Sam: What does? Who?
Marisha: Remember how I failed and almost killed us all?
Travis: Shit the bed. Yeah.
Marisha: Yeah. Thanks, Grog. What I learned out of that was it's not great for battle, but it is great for travel. It lasts for eight hours. We can move 300 feet per second.
Laura: Wonderful. We get the refugees out, we go to Whitestone, we talk to them there, we use the Misty Walk thingy and go to Vasselheim, talk to the Slayer's Take. This is perfect. Problem--
Sam: Are we going to check in with the Clasp? I really like Percy's idea about stealing a plane. I'm just throwing that out there.
Taliesin: There is an empty airdock that's currently not being used in the city.
Laura: Do we need a ship right now, darling? I understand the joy in it.
Taliesin: We don't need it now, but we're going to be-- need to move--
Sam: We could take all of these refugees with us. Don't you understand? We would be helping humanity.
Marisha: I'm with Vex. You all honestly--
Laura: -- believe a dragon wouldn't notice a giant airship flying out of the city?
Sam: Not if we hide it with some-- some smokescreen action of some sort.
Liam: Guys. This is an RPG, not a JRPG. (laughter)
Taliesin: I want to live like Teddy Ruxpin. This is all I've ever wanted. (laughter)
Laura: We need to talk to the Clasp first.
Sam: All right, let's go talk to the Clasp. We'll ask them what they think about--
Laura: Plus Allura and Drake are coming back. We need to talk to them as well. Find out what's going on in Westrunn. And then we need to get everyone out.
Marisha: I can transport some of us via plants today. I will have to sleep if we want and study to do the Misty Step again.
Laura: I've got a plan.
Taliesin: We have time. This is not a one-day plan.
Laura: Here's a good plan. This is a good plan, though.
Liam: Here it comes, everybody.
Laura: Open up the tree. Send a bunch of refugees through.
Marisha: Shove a bunch in.
Laura: Shove them through as fast as possible. Percy. You go with them. We keep the stone. You go through. You talk to your sister. You bamf back with the stone.
Marisha: Let Whitestone know what's going on. Because they're going to freak out if like--
Laura: And then we talk to the Clasp together.
Taliesin: I think that's a good plan.
Marisha: They will freak out if 20 refugees pour out of the Sun Tree. And they have no context.
Travis: Do that first.
Marisha: Okay. So wait, are you going to go on your mission while we go talk to the Clasp?
Laura: No, we're going to wait for you. So can we get the refugees together?
Matt: All right, so as you go into the temple and get Pike's attention, you begin to round up the refugees, which as a statement, historically, is already unnerving. You begin to push them all together in a group and tell them what?
Laura: Well, we comfort them and tell them  all right, obviously Emon is not a safe place to be right now.
Matt: "No, that's true, that's true! It's terrible here!"
Laura: It's dangerous, and we want to keep all of you as safe as possible.
Matt: "Yes, and thank you for taking us." Everyone starts cheering.
Laura: We have a plan.
Sam: We probably can only take a few. It should be women and children.
Laura: We're going to take those of you who need the most attention first, and we're going to bring you to Whitestone, which is a city that has not been affected by dragons at all. It has much need of people who can do an honest day's labor, and you can earn a wage and find a living there, for the time being, and if at some point in time you want to come back to Emon when all of this is done, of course you're more than welcome to.
Liam: There is opportunity.
Marisha: And no dragons!
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Laura: I'm rolling the gold one! 20?
Matt: Okay! A couple of folks currently, (muttering) "I've never been to Whitestone! Is it cold?"
Laura: In the winter.
Matt: "It's winter!"
Laura: Then it could be a little chilly!
Sam: Bundle up! We'll give you some wool blankets for the trip!
Matt: "Okay?"
Liam: There's definitely no vampires there. None.
Matt: A couple of kids go, "Vampires, sir?"
Laura: I like that we're sending to them to the place that's got the orb of death.
Matt: "What was that? What'd you say?"
Sam: No, nothing, she didn't say anything.
Laura: I said, "You might be able to see your breath!"
Matt: "Winter! Right! Okay, let's grab our things!" And some of the folks start getting their things together. Packing up their things-- what they had on their back, essentially, as they rushed here. Shake a few out of their shell-shock, and they all gather up towards the center of the Temple of Sarenrae.
Laura: Percy-- stone. To go through the--
Taliesin: I already gave it to Keyleth.
Laura: Oh, okay.
Marisha: DM question? How many do you think I can fit through in six seconds?
Matt: We'll find out!
Marisha: If I put them in like a line, and we're like, "Go! Go! Go!"
Matt: That's up to you guys! How do you want to do this?
Liam: They can't get-- no one can get cut in half, can they?
Laura: Well I assume, as soon as we see it start to shrink, we stop! We cut off the line.
Marisha: Well, what we should do-- here's the thing that I'm worried about. We don't want, like, a kid to go through, and then they get separated from their mom.
Travis: Well, everybody's got to grow up at some point.
Laura: Anybody with children. How many children are here?
Matt: I'd say you have seven children.
Laura: Children with their moms go-- and families go first.
Liam: Well, we were saying that the terribly injured, the people with the worst injuries--
Laura: All right, those people first!
Liam: Yeah, those people first.
Travis: Yeah, because they'll go through real fast.
Liam: And then with kids-- But they need attention now! They need--
Sam: Hey! We're going to be doing this every day for several days.
Taliesin: Hey, I've got a weird theory. Let's not send people with injuries yet, so that perhaps Pike can stay here and take care of them for a little bit?
Laura: Oh! Good call, okay! So the injured can stay.
Travis: Can't we put them on a wagon? Can't we like put them on a wagon, down and like--
Taliesin: We don't want to lose a wagon to Whitestone.
Sam: This is just how Schindler did it, by the way.
Laura: What!?
Sam: He debated it for a while, and then-- (nervous laughter).
Liam: No words! No words!
Travis: And the room goes silent, and the mug comes up.
Laura: Okay. So not the injured. Families first. How about that?
Taliesin: We'll count to six, and then we'll put the rope down, and when we hit six, we pull the rope, and it'll hold everybody--
Sam: Wait, there's a rope?
Laura: As soon as we see it start to shrink, I'll hold the people back.
Taliesin: Yes, hold the people back.
Laura: So Percy, you're first, everybody follow through. So any families here? Families?
Matt: Some of the kids raise their hands, some adults go over and they grab kids' hands and stand next to them. "Yes."
Laura: Are you really respons-- I can tell when you're lying, sir. Are you responsible for that child?
Matt: Make an insight check.
Laura: 26!
Matt: Ha! Two of those people are definitely just taking a kid's hand in hopes of getting through first.
Travis: I walk in and start cracking my knuckles behind Vex.
Matt: "Well, I mean, I can wait, no worries! Eh--"
Laura: Child, where's your parents? Do you have one?
Matt: "They haven't shown up yet."
Laura: Oh, dear.
Sam: Leave them here, in case the parents come.
Laura: Okay. Then you would stay and wait for your family, potentially?
Liam: You can stay with Pike, for now.
Matt: Pike comes over and pats him on the shoulder. They're the same height, so it's easy.
Marisha: Let's do completed full families who are comfortable relocating.
Laura: That can move. Here we go.
Matt: Altogether, completed full families, there are two.
Marisha: How many people?
Matt: It'd be a total of eight people.
Laura: That's good! That's a good amount!
Travis: Yeah, think about it! One one thousand, one one thousand--
Laura: And then, any other like single people that can move fast?
Marisha: Yeah, a couple single people? To bring up the rear?
Matt: Okay. You have about ten more people that raise their hands.
Taliesin: We can get that many through in six seconds.
Sam: What are you talking about?
Laura: Get ready to run, people.
Marisha: All right. So let's go to the tree. Percy, you're going to lead. Percy, you're going to lead. We're going to put the eight up front, with the ten, 15 stragglers behind. I tell them all: all right. As soon as you see that tree start to part, run! Run your face off! I tell that to the crowd.
Taliesin: And keep running. So that you make room for everyone behind you, we don't want like-- it's not the bottom of an escalator. Whatever that is. It's a thing I've been working on, it's going to be great.
Marisha: Don't stop in the tree, you will create terrible congestion.
Laura: Everybody comfortable with the plan?
Sam: Can I inspire Keyleth for this?
Matt: Sure.
Sam: Okay, I will perform a limerick for her to inspire her. I know an airheaded young druid / whose plans are more gassy than fluid / when the battle starts / she turns her pals into farts / they see danger and pass right through it!
Marisha: Thank you, Scanlan. I love it. It's so like me.
Matt: Take a 1d10 inspiration die.
Travis: I hate to be the detail-oriented one about this whole thing, but should somebody be counting as soon as she starts so we put down an arm at six?
Laura: You count in your head, Grog.
Travis: You really don't want me to do that.
Marisha: Maybe with my inspiration, I can get a few more seconds in there?
Matt: We shall see. I'll say for the sake of this, go ahead and roll a wisdom check.
Marisha: Oh boy.
Matt: A d20 and add your wisdom modifier.
Marisha: Oh, that's not good.
Sam: You've got inspiration if you need it.
Marisha: Can I add my inspiration to this?
Matt: Go for it.
Marisha: Ooh, that's good. That helps a lot. What am I adding? Just my straight wisdom?
Matt: Yep, wisdom modifier.
Marisha: My modifier? 19 total.
Matt: 19 total, okay. So as you all gather around in the center of the temple, Keyleth, you step up to the outside of one of the two front trees to the temple, one of the ones you guys usually use to transport to and from here. As you focus in and reach your hand out and touch the outside of the tree's bark, with a rough tearing sound, the tree bark widens into an oval-shaped doorway that is immediately visible. On the opposite side, you can see before you a lightly snow-dappled landscape that is the central market of Whitestone.
Laura: We put blankets on everybody, right?
Matt: From what you had.
Marisha: Go! Go! Now, run, go! Go, Percy, go!
Matt: Who's pushing?
Taliesin: I'm already through.
Matt: Percy's through. All right, are you guys just letting them go at their own rate?
Travis: (shouting) Move your fucking asses!
Matt: Roll an intimidation check.
Marisha: It's like a football line.
Travis: 17.
Matt: 17. With that, everyone goes, (startled noise) and starts charging through wildly. The crowd starts pushing through.
Marisha: I'm trying to hold it.
Liam: No severed limbs, no whammies!
Matt: Okay. All of the rest-- the family people go through, the young folks push through. You manage to get a total of 23 people through. (cheering)
Matt: Some folks who weren't even planning to go on this were so driven by the sudden shouting Grog voice echoing from behind that they charged forward Black Friday-style, and managed to escape the tail end of the spell tapering the doorway off.
Liam: "I regret nothing!"
Sam: Well, I hope Percy comes back soon.
Marisha: I've got the gatestone.
Matt: Percy?
Taliesin: I'm going to get everybody organized. Everyone, please follow me. We're heading towards the main castle.
Matt: They're all looking around.
Taliesin: Welcome to Whitestone.
Matt: A gentle snowfall is coming down. The sky itself you can see is covered in light, white clouds. Just enough moisture to carry the little snowfall that's happening. There are folks in the center of the town that are surprised to see this arrival, but recognize you and cheer a little bit. "Hey! Percival." (laughter)
Taliesin: Thank you for that smattering of applause. Golf claps, please. Golf claps.
Matt: The refugees all gather up behind you, and you guys walk towards Castle Whitestone.
Taliesin: We make our way to the castle.
Matt: The guards greet you and lead you inside. And within a few minutes, Cassandra comes down from the upper floor. "Percival, you've returned."
Taliesin: Things are not going well. Have you heard any news of Emon and what has been transpiring there?
Matt: "No, we've been focused on restoring our city. Why?"
Taliesin: Yesterday, we were attacked by a group of chromatic dragons. The city is destroyed. There's no simple way to say this, but we're under siege. We were afraid that Whitestone would be destroyed, as well, but it seems that they have passed over you so far, but we fear for many cities' safety. I was hoping that it would be all right if we moved a small number of refugees through to Whitestone for the time being. Less than a hundred, I imagine. These are the first 20-some-odd that we've pulled through.
Matt: And she looks behind you, looks to the crowd, snaps her fingers. Some of the guards step forward, she goes, "Please, if you would make sure to find any of the various unoccupied buildings are provided to these refugees. Thank you." And the guards nod, and begin gathering the group and sending them back into town, and she gives you a look back and says, "For better or for worse, we happen to have a number of vacancies in the city due to recent events. But--"
Taliesin: Oh! Well, yes. Nothing I-- Anything I should know about?
Matt: "No, just-- We've lost many in the struggle against the Briarwoods. But yes, they will be provided for, I assure you."
Taliesin: So I will let you know to stop all business with Emon for now. Be very wary, prepare the city for a possible dragon attack. Things are looking dark.
Matt: "Yes, yes."
Taliesin: And if it's possible, any research-- any energy that can be put forward towards mounting some sort of defense against these creatures would be greatly appreciated.
Matt: "Right, right, well, we had a few individuals that were researching the ziggurat beneath the city. Two left a while back and we had one arrive just the other day."
Taliesin: Who arrived the other day?
Matt: "I cannot recall his name-- Realm Seeker, Realm Seer-- I'm not--"
Laura: (whispering) Eskil Ryndarien!
Taliesin: Please bring me to him.
Matt: All right, Cassandra leads you down into the city again, and one of the houses has been provided, she knocks on the door, the door opens and you see stepping out, an older gentleman who you've heard of but not really had an encounter with since-- no, actually you encountered him for the final ritual that took the phylactery from Grog's chest.
Taliesin: Oh my god.
Matt: But this is Realmseer Eskil Ryndarien, the archmage that basically was one of the folks who lived within Westruun and was called to Whitestone as part of research--
Taliesin: That's some pre-stream stuff, everybody.
Matt: As the door opens, he comes out, eyes adjusting to the light, and you can see the interior is very dark. He's one of those live-in-lightless-territory types of person. Comes out with his round spectacles around his nose, his robe is disheveled, bundled over his shoulders, he goes, "Yes, if I may be of service--?"
Taliesin: We've met! You look very familiar.
Matt: "Quite! Yes we have. You're with those S.H.I.T.s, weren't you?"
Taliesin: (laughing) Ah, yes.
Matt: "Unfortunate title you've chosen--"
Taliesin: Long gone, thankfully, long gone. We're Vox Machina--
Matt: "Good! Vox Machina, glad you took my suggestion."
Taliesin: Yes, thank you for that. (laughing)
Matt: "What can I do for you?"
Taliesin: Well, first of all, how goes the research into the--
Matt: "Frustrating, to say the least. It appears that this entire--" and he walks back into the house, expecting you guys to follow. As you enter, immediately you're hit with the smell of sage and other burning herbs, and you can see there's a vast number of books that are strewn about the table in front. The fireplace in the back is pouring smoke up into the roof area and soot's starting to gather on the stonework on the outside. Looks like there's two or three different kettles going off with different types of tea. It's complete chaos in here, but he seems to be in control of most of it, at least. He goes, "From best we can ascertain, this is some sort of a magical siphon device. It has prevented us from utilizing any sort of ritualistic endeavors in ascertaining its nature, it's quite perplexing. I'm hoping to either head over to Wildemount, or perhaps return to the Cobalt Reserve and perhaps find some historical information about such an object, but nothing in my current--"
Taliesin: Well, sir, I have some bad news for you. I hail from Emon, which has been attacked by chromatic dragons--
Matt: "I'm sorry, what?"
Taliesin: Dragons have declared war on civilization. A group of dragons have destroyed our city, and they have destroyed other cities as well. We are in desperate need of powers to defend ourselves with-- So I would be very careful and send forward-- Send word ahead of yourself before you travel anywhere, it may not be there by the time you get there.
Matt: "Well, I guess it's good that I moved my tower before I left."
Taliesin: Things are looking grim and I would ask while you-- If you intend to remain and work on your research on this anomaly beneath our city, perhaps thinking as to how it may be turned into a weapon for our use against these creatures would not be out of the realm of question, and any information you do have of the chromatic dragons would be invaluable. Any research that can be done. We are at war.
Matt: "This is very disconcerting news. I will do what I can. Unfortunately, I'd have to get back to the Cobalt Reserve. That's where most of my research is completed."
Taliesin: That's Westruun?
Matt: "Let me see. Jeckt--" And he snaps his fingers, and you can see his manservant, Jeckt, who you've met before, slicked-back darkish red hair, mustache, very prim and proper-type manservant, well-dressed, steps out of the shadows. "Yes, my lord?" "If you would be so kind, prepare me for travel, pack up this--"
Taliesin: Westruun is no more, sir.
Matt: "Well, that's really frustrating!"
Taliesin: Yes.
Matt: "Really."
Taliesin: Extremely aggravating.
Matt: "Yes. I am unhappy with this circumstance! How am I supposed to do my research without a place to do my research?!"
Taliesin: Well, we hope that you will find our winters here quite solitary, and convenient on that level. Things are looking grim.
Matt: "Well, you can say that again."
Taliesin: I must go. I have other work to do to start preparing--
Travis: Peace!
Matt: "Yes, yes go! Do your thing!"
Taliesin: Good day, sir. And good luck to you.
Matt: "Should I find anything, how will I-- whereabouts-- Where are you?"
Taliesin: We don't know yet, but we will be returning here.
Matt: "That does not help me. I will do my best."
Taliesin: Cassandra will be able to get a hold of me if necessary.
Matt: "Ah, Cassandra. All right! Someone of use around here."
Taliesin: I am going to go find my sister and make my way to the stone.
Matt: He doesn't even say goodbye to you. He's completely flustered. It's funny. For everyone who's taken completely by the horror of the situation, he just seems really perturbed about the--
Travis: Inconvenience of it all.
Matt: Yeah, it's so inconvenient. That library was very helpful.
Taliesin: Why isn't the internet working! (frustrated noise)
Matt: Basically. You find your way to Cassandra again. She's waiting outside of the room. "I hope he's been helpful, brother"
Taliesin: No, he wasn't helpful, but it was very helpful the way he wasn't helpful.
Matt: "Yes."
Taliesin: It's a strange, strange--
Matt: "He's a very strange man."
Taliesin: Everything's going to be all right.
Matt: "I hope so."
Taliesin: Thank you. I will return very soon. We will, again with your permission, hopefully be using Whitestone as a place to regroup and prepare ourselves.
Matt: "Is there worry that these dragons might come here?"
Taliesin: Yes.
Matt: "How will we stop them?"
Taliesin: You'll hide. I have thoughts, perhaps of a weapon. I don't know. But we're going to find a way to stop them.
Matt: "We have to."
Taliesin: I'm not good at being the bearer of any bad news, but this is very dangerous and I don't know what we're going to do.
Sam: (whispers) Steal an airplane.
Matt: "Neither do I."
Taliesin: (whispers) They don't have an airplane.
Matt: "Stay safe, Percival."
Taliesin: I shall return soon.
Matt: "I hope so. We'll do what we can in the meantime to see to your refugees and hopefully try and prepare ourselves."
Taliesin: There will be a few more through, possibly tomorrow, with word.
Matt: "All right. We'll be prepared. Thank you." She reaches out and puts her hand on yours, again, and looks you sternly in the face and goes, "Be careful."
Taliesin: I will.
Matt: "You're all I have left."
Taliesin: And Cassandra, I'm proud of you. You're doing very well here.
Matt: "There's still a ways to go, brother."
Taliesin: We'll get there.
Matt: She hands you the gatestone. And with that, there's a slight popping sound as you're in a very soft bit of bluish-purple light. Your body slowly subsides and fades into nothing before it (poof) vanishes out of existence. As you guys are back at the keep, suddenly, who has the gatestone? As you're holding it, it begins to shake in your hand and give off a warm light.
Marisha: I think our reservation's ready.
Sam: I'm telling the, what, seven remaining refugees?
Matt: You have about eight or nine.
Sam: Sorry you didn't make it through. It doesn't mean that you'll be here forever. We'll get you there tomorrow. No big. Don't worry about it.
Laura: More food for you guys, which is A+.
Matt: At which point now, there's a slight smell of burnt cedar before the air itself begins to sound like a light hum or vibration as suddenly Percy's form (poof) appears in the center of the room next to your gatestone. Both of the stones you guys are holding all of a sudden become white-hot, and you instinctively drop them before they tumble to the ground.
Laura: Hey! They work!
Taliesin: They hurt. Good to know.
Sam: That's great. Did you see your sister?
Taliesin: I did, everything is fine up there, the research continues. They're happy to take people.
Laura: That's wonderful.
Taliesin: So, and they are prepared for more. They're also happy to be a base of operations as we put things together.
Laura: And you told them to make preparations in case something happens?
Taliesin: Whatever preparations one can make for something like this, to be prepared to hide. (sighs) For now.
Liam: In the worst-case scenario they can go underground.
Taliesin: Worst-case scenario, they can go underground, yes.
Laura: They need to start hiding food.
Taliesin: They have to grow food, they haven't really recovered that yet. There's also a--
Marisha: Hopefully I hooked them up there.
Taliesin: I have one of those terrible ideas I get on occasion.
Sam: What is it? I love it.
Taliesin: That thing beneath Whitestone could be a weapon.
Sam: How?
Travis: Ooh, that's true.
Laura: Anything touching it disintegrates.
Travis: Yeah! Like a dragon.
Sam: Do you shoot it at something?
Taliesin: I might be able to turn it into a projectile.
Laura: How would you turn it to a projectile-- are you okay, Keyleth?
Liam: It is a fun idea--
Taliesin: A long-term idea.
Marisha: Just choking on Percy's idea.
Taliesin: I can make an antimagic missile.
Marisha: What-- a magic-- a magic missile? An antimagic missile?
Taliesin: An antimagic missile.
Liam: One plus one plus two plus one.
Laura: One plus two plus one plus one!
Sam: That's a great idea.
Taliesin: I've been-- I've been mulling it over.
Sam: Could we fire it from an airship of some sort?
Taliesin: Yes, I have-- that's actually part of the idea.
Marisha: Percy, when I tried to touch that thing it was like it was sucking me in. I don't think that thing and me touched. How are we going to turn it into a projectile?
Taliesin: I have thoughts, I'm going to follow them through, and it may require some experimentation in the future, but I think perhaps--
Marisha: At the cost of possibly your life?
Taliesin: I take my life into my hands any time I build something. I think that a non-magical approach to containing it might actually work. I think the problem is--
Laura: Well that's good, because it cancels out any magic--
Taliesin: I think the problem is that we keep trying to magic our way out of something that denies magic, and maybe I can engineer our way out of it.
Marisha: Have they found anything out, did you get any updates?
Taliesin: A little bit of information, there will be more later. I'm going to take a look at all the data and see if it's possible.
Sam: Should we go visit the Clasp?
Travis: Oh, please.
Taliesin: I'm trying to be more open.
Travis: Yeah, let's go!
Marisha: What time is it?
Matt: At this time? It's pretty close to dusk, the sun is getting close to the mountain line, you probably have another hour of daylight.
Marisha: Okay.
Taliesin: To the Clasp?
Travis: Yeah, they're probably nocturnal anyway. That means they're around at night.
Taliesin: They're not turtles, no.
Marisha: Did you learn something new, Grog?
Travis: What?
Matt: All right, you guys heading back into Emon?
Sam: Everyone? Some? All?
Taliesin: I think Pike should stay behind to take care for--
Marisha: You seem to have reservations--
Sam: Vex, are you okay going down there? You're marked for death by these people.
Laura: I've been down there several times without knowing that.
Sam: I know, I feel like it might put you on edge.
Liam: She's not marked for death, she was marked for death, it's just awkward. It's awkward. I'm not a full-fledged member, they don't like me. I don't like them!
Laura: Maybe I can become a member.
Liam: Maybe you can.
Taliesin: This is politics, you're not supposed to like them.
Liam: Well, let's go, then.
Travis: Yeah! What he said.
Matt: You guys taking the tunnel or you walking in?
Laura: Taking the tunnel, we're taking the secret entrance--
Travis: Oh come on, we're never even-- we've not even walked in yet.
Laura: Garthok showed us the secret entrance, he's waiting for us and having them prepare our way, this could get bad.
Matt: No, are you guys walking through your tunnel to the city, is what I'm saying.
Laura: Oh! That! Yes. Cool.
Liam: We're not going to walk in the open.
Sam: What are we doing?
Laura: We're taking our secret tunnel into the city.
Sam: Okay. It puts us in the wrong side of the city, but it's okay.
Laura: What else are we going to do?
Marisha: (coughing)
Laura: How you doing there? You okay?
Marisha: I'm good. Mm-hmm. Sorry. I got a piece of chip stuck.
Taliesin: No, I'm going to leave one with Vax.
Travis: What is it?
Taliesin: I'm giving Vax my gatestone.
Liam: That's a good idea.
Taliesin: I'm giving you the other one.
Liam: For now, it's a good idea, I won't hold onto it forever.
Taliesin: He's the one who's going to get stuck in a room alone if they decide they don't like him.
Liam: Can we call this the Jenga stone? In moments of need.
Taliesin: Jenga stone. Remember, it takes about a minute to work.
Liam: Do I need to spend a little time with this?
Matt: No. However, it does work only once a day.
Liam: Once a day?
Matt: After another long rest you'd be able to use it again.
Liam: All right. Good to know. All right.
Sam: Into the city.
Laura: In your pants.
Matt: Like you do. Half-elven storage space. You guys find your way back into Emon, utilizing your secret tunnel entrance, coming up through the false outhouse once again. You leave the chain behind, locking it up, and make your way into the city.
Laura: Cast Pass Without a Trace on us.
Matt: All right. You guys, I'd like you all to make a stealth check.
Travis: Come on, giant blue nut ball dice. Natural 20!
Laura: Aw, it fell out of my hand. I don't think it should count if it fell.
Matt: Nope, too bad.
Laura: Aw, that's mean. Oh, I get advantage!
Sam: Oh, and we get a plus ten, right?
Taliesin: 33.
Sam: 15.
Marisha: 35.
Liam: 38. LAURA 35.
Travis: Natural 20.
Sam: Wait. With no judgment, is Trinket coming?
Laura: Trinket is staying with Pike.
Sam: That's a fine decision.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: Hell hath frozen over.
Matt: Placing Trinket over here.
Laura: Oh! He's crying! I'm crying.
Matt: So as you guys start dodging between the alleyways, making your way towards the north side of Emon, alongside the ruined interior of the Cloudtop District, you instinctually begin to-- and I'd say-- who else has proficiency in perception?
Liam: Right here.
Matt: All right. You guys all start noticing there are what looks initially like flocks of birds moving through the sky. Some of them are heading down into parts of the town in the distance. As you continue to push forward, one set of four in particular start heading overhead. You look up and you can see a small cluster of about five or six flying creatures. Not dragon-sized, by any means, but either a very, very large bird or something of that degree. You can't make out the details, as right now as the sun's beginning to set, a lot of it's dark against a red-orange sky. You keep yourself at bay, waiting for them to pass.
Marisha: Oh, waiting for them to pass?
Matt: Unless you guys want to do something else.
Laura: As a dragon-favored enemy, could I guesstimate what those winged creatures are that would hang out around dragons?
Travis: Could you determine if they're wyverns?
Matt: Yes. They are actually indeed wyverns. Wivverns. However you want to pronounce it. Both work in my world. It's fine.
Liam: It's pronounced 'jif'.
Matt: Yes. (laughter)
Matt: I will fight you. But yeah.
Sam: They're diving into the city?
Matt: You can see a few that dove into city and stayed there. And one group goes overhead, and continues onward.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: Pushing forward, deeper into the city, you make your way through the Temple District, and start pushing through Abdar's Promenade once again, retracing your steps from the day before, dodging through open areas as fast as possible to stay within the shadows. All of you go darting into one of the alleyways. As you turn behind you, you can see your tiny-legged gnomish bard friend, keeping up as best as he can before his foot hitting a divot on the ground and (slam) falling face first on the ground, making just enough noise--
Sam: Sorry. Sorry.
Matt: You hear a little screech in the distance. (screech) And coming up on the rooftop, you can see, perched up there, appears to be one wyvern that is looking over down at the currently toppled gnome, and on top of the wyvern, you see something riding it. Something that is holding reins on the edge, something humanoid is glancing over, just a little enough of a shadow, to see.
Sam: He sees me? I see him?
Matt: He looks down at you, yeah.
Sam: Okay. I will cast Hold Person on him.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: I don't know what he is, but I want him to stop.
Liam: And Scanlan's the only one-- we all see it?
Matt: You all barely see it looking over the edge as Scanlan's there, left in the middle of the main walkway. That is going to be a natural 17 on the will save. That'll be an 18. What's your DC?
Sam: Well, it's 17, but the hand-cone makes it 19.
Laura: Ah-ha!
Sam: Do you think I had the wherewithal to use it?
Matt: With having you fallen on your face, I'd say probably not. Since it wasn't specified, that would be a DC of 17. So the creature seems to rear back for a second, shake its head, and you get a little bit of a look at the features at this point, too. And it is humanoid, but you can see its outer body is not fleshy, or smooth, it is scaled and bumpy. You can see ridges across the back of the head, and in one of the hands, looks like some sort of a spear. Immediately as it rears back, it puts its head up and goes (guttural gibberish).
Laura: The creature?
Matt: Yeah, riding on the back of the wyvern.
Laura: Those are the things that attacked the airship!
Sam: Yes. Possibly.
Matt: I would like you all to roll initiative.
Taliesin: This is going to be fun.
Laura: I think you should turn it into a bunny, Keyleth! Turn it into a bunny.
Marisha: Jesus Christ. I can do that today. Just rolled shitty on my initiative.
Liam: Not too good.
Sam: (singing) This is the music that plays when we fight!
Matt: All right, so! Scanlan, as you were running across the thoroughfare, you tripped and fell that way.
Sam: That's me!
Matt: The rest of you had come into this alley over here. Currently, looking over the top of this rooftop, is this wyvern and its rider.
Marisha: I love that the rider is like (derpy noise).
Matt: (imitates derpy noise) It's fine.
Marisha: Go home, rider, you're drunk.
Matt: That's going to be-- 25 to 20?
Taliesin: 26.
Travis: 20.
Matt: 20. All right, 20 to 15?
Laura: 18.
Matt: 18, let's see. Vex. 15 to ten?
Sam: Yikes.
Matt: Ten to five?
Sam: Eight! No, seven.
Marisha: Five.
Matt: (laughs) Okay.
Taliesin: Wow.
Liam: Uno!
Matt: Plus?
Liam: Oh, six, thanks for that.
Matt: So you would be-- actually, technically, Keyleth, is next to you.
Liam: That was so crushing, to see the number on the die.
Matt: Aw, sorry buddy. It happens to the best of us. All righty. So. Currently with this guy up on top of the rooftop, Percy, you are first.
Taliesin: Quick question, is he in flight, or is he just sitting on the rooftop?
Matt: Just sitting on the roof, perched on the edge. You can't even actually see him, everyone else who's near the front can see, the few that made the check. You've got a little bit of movement up there, but you're just out of view with the building-- you're right in an alleyway.
Taliesin: There's no easy way up onto the roof, is there?
Matt: Aside from a well-placed acrobatics check. You could try.
Taliesin: That would be my whole movement, too, wouldn't it, though?
Matt: Most likely.
Taliesin: Nah, let's see.
Travis: And how high is the roof?
Matt: I'd say it's about anywhere from 16 to 20 feet tall. It's two-story, but it's not extremely well-built.
Taliesin: I'm going to try to get a vantage point where I can at least get where he's only three-quarters cover. So I suppose I'm going to head south down the alley to see if I can get a--
Matt: Pushing to these guys?
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: Okay, so one-- You can get to about there if you want to.
Taliesin: I can get a good look at him there.
Matt: You can see, yeah. He'll have half-cover from there.
Taliesin: Half-cover's fine. So, if I were to knock him prone, would he fall off the roof, or could I try and push him off the roof? These are my--
Matt: For the wyvern, or for the rider?
Taliesin: The wyvern.
Matt: You can try. It's hard-pressed, he's sturdy on the side, knocking him prone might fall over onto the rooftop. Who knows if it'll slide or not. It's your call. What do you want to try?
Taliesin: I'll try knocking him prone, and see if that does it.
Matt: Okay!
Taliesin: Actually--
Sam: Do it!
Taliesin: Yeah, it's either that or try and push him off the roof, which could be pretty funny. I'll try and knock him prone.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: All right. So I'm going to use Bad News, because that's funnier.
Matt: Okay. So (whoosh) you whip out.
Taliesin: Take a shot. That's a 28 to hit.
Matt: That'll hit.
Taliesin: And that's a wing shot, so you have to make a constitution saving throw.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: Against 18.
Matt: Well, this is the wing or leg shot, right?
Taliesin: Wing or leg shot. I'm sorry, that's a-- Actually, I'm sorry, I have the new sheet.
Matt: Yeah, new sheet on that one. Updated that.
Taliesin: Strength saving throw. Sorry, strength saving throw against 18.
Matt: Okay. That's a natural 19 plus four for strength, so that's a 23 on the save.
Taliesin: Motherfucker, but he'll still take some damage.
Matt: Still takes damage though, go ahead and roll.
Taliesin: I'm going to take another shot at him, too, because eff that. I was not quite prepared for this. 2d12 plus six, four, eight, 14 points of damage.
Matt: 14 points of damage, nice. All right.
Taliesin: And I'm going to take a-- reload, take another shot and try and knock him off the roof.
Matt: Go for it. The same shot?
Taliesin: Same shot. Ugh. That's a three, so that means I--
Matt: Misfire.
Sam: Clank!
Matt: So, first shot of Bad News, (explosion noise) echoes, the sound of the blast rippling through the nearby alleyways, the blast hits the wyvern in part of its arm, sending a spray of blood as it shrieks in pain. As you can see its rider is moved to the side, and you see a second head behind the rider from the reaction of movement. Looks like there's actually two of these creatures riding on the back of this creature. As you go to reload, bring Bad News up again to fire a second time, you pull the trigger and there's a (thump) sound, and you can see now a stream of smoke pouring out the back of the gun itself, and you're a little worried what this is going to do if you don't fix it soon.
Travis: Look down the barrel!
Sam: Yeah, that'll work.
Taliesin: I can use my-- I actually can't do-- Am I going to panic and try and fix this?
Matt: Next turn? That's your movement, that's your three attacks, do you have a bonus? Anything?
Taliesin: I can-- I'm going to, I'm going to throw an action surge and see if I can fix this.
Matt: Go for it. Go ahead and make your tinker check.
Taliesin: Yes! Yeah, 14.
Matt: So you spend your action quickly trying to fix the gun and get Bad News back. You manage to clear the barrel, get the pellet out, as the rest of the team starts coming up with their turns. That'll be the rest of your action. Okay, finishes Percy's turn. Grog, you're up.
Travis: I'd like to hold my turn until it gets off the roof and maybe comes down to the ground.
Matt: Okay, okay, good to know. Let's see here. It appears that my-- Taliesin, could you do me a favor and hand me that box next to the fridge there?
Taliesin: Sure.
Matt: Thank you. All right, so Grog, as you're doing that, the blasting sound of Bad News that echoed through, you all of a sudden start hearing other shrieks in the distance, like a call to arms of a number of other entities.
Marisha: Oh boy.
Matt: As you see a multitude of other winged creatures begin to arise in the distance.
Taliesin: I shouldn't have gotten him that box, should I?
Marisha: Was that in the box?
Travis: Yeah, we could always run, too.
Taliesin: Could.
Sam: How far are we from the tunnel system? Far.
Matt: You're a ways. Probably a good 25-minute run. There's another one on the roof over here. And there's one on this roof here. Each one of them with their own riders, as well.
Laura: Shit.
Matt: Now. All right, so for this turn, this one leaps off and swoops down here to where Percy is while both of its riders leap off to the side. One that leaps off and rushes over to Scanlan on the ground, and this other one that gets right up next to Percy. This one goes flying forward and lands in the center to about there. Two of its riders leap off. This one stays up in the air over this way in a flanking position-- or in a visual perspective with two of its riders on its back. Put them there.
Liam: For clarification, does this count as turns, or are they, since they're coming late to the party, or this is just them in position?
Matt: This is them now entering the fray.
Liam: Are they into the initiative order, just gameplay talk?
Matt: Yeah. Well, this is the initiative I rolled for them after being called by the guy who was already shouting out into the air.
Laura: Oh, right, right, right.
Matt: You didn't see them before, given your perspective. These guys leap off over here-- over there. Okay. So we have, first the wyvern that swooped down on you, Percy, is going to go ahead and make an attack with its bite and an attack with its stinger as a multiattack. So that first strike, that is going to be a-- The bite, 13?
Taliesin: That does not hit.
Matt: The stinger, however, is a 19.
Taliesin: I'm going to use my Amulet of the Shield and up my AC for that attack to 23, so.
Matt: Yeah. So that will miss. So that uses the Amulet. Good to know. So the stinger goes to strike you after the bite misses, and as you grasp your chest, you can see now an arcane barrier shines in front of you and completely ricochets the stinger out into the air to the side as it reacts angrily. The other giant humanoid lizard creature that's coming towards you with a giant heavy club is going to attempt to slam you with it.
Laura: There's so many things!
Matt: Twice. Well, it's going to attack you with its club, that's going to be a 17.
Taliesin: Nope.
Matt: And then it's going to try and slam you with a spike shield. That is 15.
Taliesin: Nope.
Matt: So that guy starts swinging at you loosely.
Taliesin: I'm sword out. Yeah.
Matt: All right. Attacking you, Scanlan.
Sam: Oh. Shit.
Matt: The one that's on the ground there. All right. So it has two attacks against you with advantage.
Sam: With advantage?
Matt: Because you're prone. You're on the ground. That'll be a 24 to hit.
Sam: Yeah, yeah, okay.
Matt: And the spike shield is going to be a 24 again, actually.
Laura: Oh no!
Matt: So as you're on the ground, it slams you with a shield for 12 points of bludgeoning damage.
Sam: Okay.
Laura: Why didn't I bring Trinket?
Sam: I know! What's wrong with you?
Matt: The shield slams you for eight points of piercing damage. So a total of 20 points of damage as (whack) slams you into the ground twice.
Laura: I thought this was a stealthing mission!
Matt: It was until he rolled a 15 stealth.
Sam: Blame me, blame me.
Matt: Those wyverns are too far away for combat. The other guys are just assisting the scenario here.
Liam: Percy shot at them.
Matt: Okay. There's one fellow over here that is a bit far away who steps off. Instead of holding the same clubs and shields or other various hack weapons, he's carrying a gnarled staff.
Sam: Oh, shit.
Matt: Steps forward and sees the weapon that you fired twice and had been fixing, this large metallic dangerous entity, looks forward and begins hissing under his breath (hissing gibberish).
Sam: Do I see this?
Matt: You do.
Sam: I'm going to release my--
Matt: Though you are being slammed on the ground. I'd say make a perception check, actually, to see if you see this.
Sam: Okay.
Matt: Because you are currently--
Sam: 19!
Matt: Yes, actually, I will say you do see this.
Sam: I will release my Counterspell.
Matt: Okay!
Sam: I assume he's casting something.
Matt: He is, actually--
Travis: Or has a terrible cold.
Sam: And I will-- I will sing at him, (singing) And you still haven't hit what you're aiming for!
Matt: That's a second-level spell, it is dispelled immediately. As he'd attempted to Heat Metal on your weapon, you can see as the metal begins to glow for a moment and you could feel the heat welling in your hand, all of a sudden the spell (crack) is shattered, like the sound of thin glass in the distance as Scanlan shouts to intercept its arcane ability. That is going to end their opening turn. That brings us down to the initiative order. Vex, you're up.
Laura: Oh, I think Grog was before me.
Matt: Oh, right, Grog, you're holding your action first.
Travis: Right. Can I barrel down through the alley now that someone's on the ground, and race towards the one that's nearest Percy?
Matt: I'll say sure. Usually, going forward, if you hold your action, that's just your action, not your movement, you still move to the situation, but I'll let it stand for this, it's fine.
Travis: I'll remember that going forward.
Matt: Yeah. So you're going to tear down to this guy there?
Travis: Yeah. I would like-- and I would like to swing twice with Craven.
Matt: Go for it. Still maintaining your bonuses from last game, by the way. You haven't taken a short rest yet.
Laura: Oh my gosh!
Travis: Yes indeed.
Laura: He's so strong from the last game.
Travis: Plus-- That's 26.
Matt: 26 hits.
Travis: And a 14 on the second one.
Matt: 14 does not hit. This is the Great Weapon Master?
Travis: No, these are regular attacks.
Laura: You didn't rage yet?
Matt: Did you rage?
Travis: Yeah. Oh! No, I did not.
Matt: Do you want to rage as part of your bonus action to this?
Travis: I would like to rage.
Matt: Okay. Figures. All right, so as your bonus action you go into a rage before you strike. Go for it.
Travis: 12-- 22? Oh, wait. Yep, 22.
Matt: 22 damage. All right. The second strike missed.
Travis: Oh, that's right. 22, that's it.
Matt: 22. So you rush forward, slam the sword into the side of the lizard creature. It puts its shield up and it manages to block most of the blow, but it still slides off and slams into part of its neck area. It shoves the blade out. However, it fails its save.
Travis: Yes!
Matt: Take a strength point off of it and add that to what you have now. What's your strength currently?
Travis: 22.
Matt: So it goes up another plus one to attack and damage. If it became 22, it does.
Travis: Yes.
Matt: All right. Grog, that ends your turn. Vex, you're up.
Laura: Is there anywhere I can stand that I get a good cone shape? Or am I all blocked in?
Matt: You can try to move through. You might get an attack of opportunity from the guy that's attacking Grog.
Laura: Okay, how high is the roof next to me?
Matt: It's about 16, 20 feet.
Laura: Could I acrobatics that shit up?
Matt: You could try to. Go for it.
Laura: Okay.
Liam: Parkour!
Laura: Hold on. Oh! 31?
Matt: With that, you look over and see the rooftop up there. You leap off each side, Ninja Gaiden-style. Hop onto the rooftop with a solid view of the entire battlefield before you, including the one flying creature up there.
Laura: Oh, okay. Then I'm going to Hunter's Mark the magic user.
Matt: All righty.
Laura: And I'm going to Conjure Barrage in a cone to get as many of those fucks as I can.
Matt: Okay, so it's a 60-foot cone. Right there?
Laura: Yeah, sure. Sorry, Scanlan.
Matt: You will hit Scanlan, as well.
Sam: Oh, balls! I'm a little man!
Matt: All right, so go ahead and roll for that.
Laura: 3d8.
Matt: Yeah, roll 3d8 damage.
Sam: 3d8 damage?
Matt: Yeah!
Laura: It's not that much. 16, and then an extra d6 on that guy. An extra six.
Matt: Okay, so does he make his save? He does not.
Sam: Do I have to make a save?
Matt: Yes, you do.
Sam: What kind of save?
Matt: This would be a dexterity saving throw.
Sam: And I'm on the ground. That's a nine.
Matt: You take 16 points of damage from that. That's a fail, and a success. So 16. The wyvern makes that, so half that for eight. He fails. All right, cool. Got it. So as you go forward, leaping up on top, you mark the one guy, turn around, and release a torrent of arrows that sprays into the center of this open pathway of the city. I believe that ends your turn.
Laura: Yes, it does.
Matt: All right, that brings us to Scanlan.
Sam: Oh, me?
Matt: Yep.
Sam: Balls. Shit. I'm on the ground. If I stand up, that's my action?
Matt: It's half your movement.
Sam: That's half my movement. Okay, I'll stand up. He doesn't get to hit me, right?
Matt: Not unless you move away from him.
Sam: Okay. Which riders are still on their beasts?
Matt: These two are the only two that are still on their beasts.
Sam: I will ignore the guy next to me and I will Hand Cone it up, and I will-- he's got two riders?
Matt: Yeah, they have these ramshackle-- you can see now with a closer look, these leather kind of saddles? But they're mostly thrown leathers that are strapped to its back, and there's two of them holding onto these knobs in front to stay on.
Sam: Two riders?!
Laura: Come on, Scanlan.
Sam: I guess I'll Dominate one of them. The main guy.
Laura: Can you Dominate the beast?
Sam: He's not a person.
Matt: There's Dominate Person and Dominate Monster. They're two different things.
Sam: I'm going to dominate the guy in front.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Maverick, not Hollywood.
Travis: It's Maverick and Goose!
Sam: Well, at the end, it was Hollywood.
Travis: No, it was Merlin.
Sam: Merlin?!
Travis: Yeah. Tim Robbins.
Sam: Merlin was the teacher, the guy who spun out. Hollywood was the guy who was his--
Travis: You don't want to do this with me.
Taliesin: This is the first conversation I've ever been in in this group where I feel young.
Matt: The rider's screeching down while it's holding on, and all of a sudden it shakes its head for a minute and looks down at you, eyes connected, and you know that this entity is waiting for its command.
Sam: Can I only give it one command per turn?
Matt: You can give it a basic command and it will follow it through, unless you wanted to directly control it.
Sam: Well, I've got two things to do. He's got to get rid of that fucker on his back, and also other things. Let's go for the big kahuna. I command him to ride his beast to attack the one below him. The wyvern below him.
Matt: Okay. All right, good to know. And do you want to stay where you are? Do you want to move?
Sam: No, I don't want to move because he'll hit me. That would be bad. Who hasn't gone? You haven't gone.
Taliesin: Vax hasn't gone--
Sam: Vax hasn't gone? Oh my god.
Laura: No. because he rolled a one, remember?
Liam: Yup!
Sam: Okay. I will inspire Vax with my inspiration. And I will say: This is ground control to Major Vax, you've really made the blade. And the papers want to know whose blood you spilled!
Matt: (laughs) All right, take your d10 inspiration die.
Liam: d10. Yes.
Sam: Rest in peace.
Matt: All right. That's Scanlan's turn. Vax, you're up.
Liam: So I'm having trouble seeing the battle map. Grog is right against a wyvern, right?
Matt: Grog is against a lizard-like creature--
Liam: Oh, so not against a wyvern?
Matt: No. That's a little bit away. But Percy is next to it.
Liam: Oh, so Percy is right there?
Matt: Correct, yes.
Liam: And Scanlan's next to the magic user, right?
Matt: The magic user's over here, that's been Hunter's Marked.
Liam: Scanlan's up against a dude, right? All right, so what I want to do is slink up behind Percy, reach over-- oh, no, I want to click my Boots of Haste, is what I want to do.
Matt: Did you use them during the battle against the looters?
Liam: I don't think so.
Travis: I don't remember him doing it.
Liam: No, I didn't. No I didn't, I definitely didn't, because I remember kicking myself for-- I definitely didn't. Okay so, click, everybody starts moving slower around me. I want to-- so Percy's against the wyvern, I want to reach over Percy's shoulder and stab the wyvern, and then I want to throw another dagger at the dude standing next to Scanlan.
Matt: On this side there, you mean?
Liam: Yeah. Well, I can't tell, I can't see shit-- is that over Percy's shoulder?
Matt: Because right now you're being blocked, you can't quite get to the wyvern unless you move around the building that you left.
Liam: But I can go around it, yes, let's do that. I'm going to stab the wyvern in the butt, and then I'm going to throw a dagger from my other hand at the guy standing next to Scanlan-- I've got a question for you. Because both of them have somebody who's running interference, do I get sneak attack damage on both?
Matt: You only get one sneak attack damage per turn.
Liam: Just per turn?
Matt: Once per turn.
Liam: All right. So I'm going to use sneak attack damage on the wyvern if I get it.
Matt: Go for it! So first strike against it, as you (whoosh) whip around the side of the building, blades out--
Liam: 25!
Matt: That hits!
Liam: And then for the dude by Scanlan gets a-- word, 19.
Matt: Yep. If you have both blades out, you get a third attack too, don't forget.
Liam: I do. Oh-- yes. So the third stab will go back at the wyvern.
Matt: Okay! So the sneak attack against the wyvern, first strike.
Liam: Yeah, and the last one was a 24 total, so that hits as well. Okay! So that's two, one, yes. That's 14, 17, 22, 23, 25, 27, 29 into the wyvern.
Matt: All right.
Liam: And then the jerk over by Scanlan gets seven.
Sam: Yes!
Liam: And then the wyvern takes another, the Keen Dagger, takes another nine.
Matt: All righty. So, as you rush around, you stab the wyvern on the back of its haunches and you see it shrieks in pain (screeches), looks over its shoulder and starts biting its tail, its stinger swinging about, but you avoid it, fling the other dagger to the side and then jam the other side of its haunches with your other hand. It's definitely aware of your presence now.
Liam: Did I use up all my movement?
Matt: Nope!
Liam: Knowing that it can swat at me, I'm going to try to go right back around where I came from.
Matt: All right.
Liam: And I'm wearing the Cloak of Displacement.
Matt: Okay. It's going to swing at you with disadvantage.
Sam: Just call it cloak number seven.
Matt: That's a two on the first roll, so yeah. That misses you. (whoosh) Its stinger swings out towards you and you duck underneath, it slams to the side of the building, breaking part of the wood, you can see splinters fly out to the middle of the road. That ends your turn?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: All right. Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: Okay. How far away am I from this guy, like-- roughly how many feet?
Matt: Roughly--
Marisha: The guy who's in the air, flying.
Matt: I'd say about 60, 65 feet.
Marisha: Beautiful. I want to move up and around-- here-ish.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Sorry, I've got this thing in the way. Back a little bit-- scoot back. Is that still in your path?
Sam: No, he's my guy.
Marisha: He's your--? Oh. Well, I'm not going to fuck with him. I'm going to-- you Dominated the guy?
Sam: I Dominated the guy.
Marisha: Should I turn the wyvern into something else?
Sam: I don't know. I don't know.
Marisha: Should I Polymorph him? Yeah, I guess he's Dom-- you are Dominating that guy. Is there anything else that's flying? He's the only one that's up in the air left, right?
Matt: Yeah, all the other wyverns have landed and let their riders off on the sides.
Marisha: So you commanded him to attack the one below you, right? I'm going to turn that wyvern into a-- chicken!
Matt: This one?
Marisha: Yes!
Matt: Okay. What's the save on that?
Marisha: Poof! He has to make a wisdom save.
Matt: That is a seven!
Marisha: Fail!
Matt: And with that-- (laughs) The wyvern-- (laughs) Twice now--
Marisha: (laughs) This is my favourite game, you guys!
Matt: The bane of wyverns everyone-- (swoop, chicken noise). As both the riders tumble off, slamming into the ground (sound of impact). That would be-- Okay, ten points of damage to the wyvern, which kills the chicken form entirely. It turns back to a wyvern on the ground, taking the excess three damage.
Laura: Yeah-- (laughs) Keyleth.
Marisha: Fuck.
Laura: Shit! (laughs)
Matt: What?
Sam: Do I keep hold of my guy?
Matt: The riders fall also, they both take an additional 14 points of damage to each of them from the fall.
Marisha: They all took damage-- and they're on the ground now.
Matt: Let's see if it takes damage and makes a new saving throw against the spell. Does not make it, so it is still Dominated.
Sam: Oh. Okay. Thank God.
Marisha: I didn't fuck it up this time.
Matt: But they are all-- all three of them are considered prone for now. They are all knocked prone.
Marisha: Cool. That's my turn.
Matt: All right, ends Keyleth's turn. At the top, Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: Okay. Where am I, I can't see--
Matt: You're right here, you're blocked in between the two buildings, the mouth of the alleyway, with a wyvern and lizard creature right there, standing before you.
Taliesin: Okay, I have no advantage on any of these bastards at the moment if I were to attack. Okay, that's fine. And how would you describe-- these are like scaly people?
Matt: This up close and personal, they are humanoid in build, they have, you know, stand up upright, they have long tails, ridges across the head, they're bigger than an actual human and they're very muscular, and the more you look at it, you can see that their clothing, they have tattered cloth and leathers that have been haphazardly dyed in blood and gore to all be a very, very deep red color. And they're pretty uniform across what they are wearing.
Laura: They're an army.
Sam: Team colors.
Taliesin: I think you've got that one guy covered at the moment, so I'll concentrate on the--hmm. Tough call, tough call. You know what, I'll have a little fun. I'm going to pull my sword and I'm going to take a slash at the guy who's involved with--
Matt: All right, go for it.
Taliesin: That's 21.
Matt: 21 hits.
Taliesin: Oh shit, I forgot to use my bonus action. Can I pop in a quick bonus before that?
Matt: For what?
Taliesin: Hex him.
Matt: You've already hexed today. You used it in the battle versus the looters.
Taliesin: Oh, it's--
Sam: Same day.
Taliesin: That's right. Still the same hour. It can only do it once a day, right? That's all right. That's fine, I can just do a little thing. So, just add to this, would he be described in anywhere on his little D&D card as something with a dragon keyword?
Matt: Nope!
Taliesin: So I'm just going to do normal damage to him?
Matt: Yes.
Taliesin: Okay. So--
Matt: Wyverns, however--
Taliesin: All right, just checking. I'm going to do nine points of damage, slashing damage, to him.
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: And I'm going to turn to the wyvern, and take two slashes at the wyvern.
Matt: Go for it.
Taliesin: First is-- ew. 14?
Matt: 14 hits.
Taliesin: Wow.
Matt: They're sacks of hit points, but they don't have lot of armor to them.
Taliesin: That's 19 plus-- 26 points of damage.
Matt: Nice!
Taliesin: And second shot-- 13, 24, yeah, that hits. Ten, 17, 18, 19, 26 points of damage.
Matt: 26 twice in a row. So with this you pull the sword out, as soon as you see it in the proximity of the wyvern, the blade itself almost seems to shimmer with this gleam of green on it, like the metal almost seems to bend and wave with your movements. And as you turn back around to slash at the wyvern, the blade cuts through it like butter, there's not even resistance, it goes right through its flesh. With each slash of the longsword, you can see large chunks of its muscle coming visible as parts of its body are now being pulled from the muscle and sinew. It shrieks in pain, you can see it angrily now starting to get ready to rake at you pretty heavily. That end your turn?
Taliesin: That's my turn.
Matt: All righty. Grog, you're up.
Travis: Yeah, I'm going to continue where I started on, shitfucker out in front of me.
Matt: Okay! (laughs)
Travis: But I would like to go Great Weapon Master and I would like to use Reckless Attack.
Matt: Go for it.
Laura: Wow, wow. Wow.
Sam: Reckless.
Matt: Roll your first attack against him.
Travis: That's a 31.
Matt: Roll damage on that.
Travis: 25?
Matt: 25? He fails his save, so you get another plus one to your strength, and that swing just cleaves it in two. It goes (whoosh) right through its midsection, it (gurgles). It tumbles off, falling to the ground.
Laura: Oh my god. Grog.
Liam: Grog is full juicing.
Travis: I told you he'd open up to me! (laughter)
Matt: You can move in now with your movement and do your next attack, if you'd like.
Travis: I'll go ahead and take care of that wyvern that's next to me.
Matt: Go for it, all right, so now you get your next attack.
Travis: Natural 20.
Matt: Go ahead and roll damage.
Liam: Does his strength go up to 100 eventually?
Matt: It's double your first dice roll--
Travis: 19-- oh, so the 2d6 was nine, plus five is--
Matt: So 18.
Travis: Plus 11.
Matt: So 29, plus two additional die rolls.
Travis: Ten.
Matt: Okay. So we're at--
Matt: 39.
Travis: 39.
Marisha: 39.
Matt: And then one more? Because you roll 2d-- it's twice, because of Brutal Critical.
Liam: Jeez, you got like Tetsuo arm, it's like five times bigger than it should be.
Travis: Four. Four for those two, do I plus five to that as well for the--
Matt: Well, plus ten for your-- you already added that for your--
Travis: Yes, 2d6 plus five on each one and the--
Matt: No, it's just the additional 2d6 each time.
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: So yeah, with that you turn around after hacking its friend, leaping forward (grunts), foam at the corner of your mouth, your eyes bloodshot and angry. You take the blade and sweep it down, and it plunges itself right into the wound that Percy had left open with his sword swing, finding no resistance before it comes all the way to the hilt in the body of the wyvern, which shrieks for a moment (screeches) before its breath stops and its body falls limp.
Sam: Yeah, one down!
Matt: Does make its save, though.
Travis: Oh, yeah, and on Great Weapon Master on a crit or killing an extra hit, but I guess I--?
Matt: As a bonus action! For the record, going forward, if you're frenzied raging it doesn't really give you a benefit, but if you're not, it does help. So in theory, you could if you wanted to try and chuck it.
Travis: (laughs) Just throw it? Don't throw it?
Matt: What are you going to do, Grog?
Travis: I'm good, I'm good.
Matt: Ends Grog's turn. All right. Now these guys both get up, currently no longer on the wyvern. Did you want to give it another kind of a thought, if you see it land?
Sam: Get on the wyvern and kill the other one.
Matt: Okay. This guy gets up on the wyvern, grabs its reins, pulls it forward, and jams it with its spear as it leads it inward. It runs forward and is going to take a swing-- It's going to take a swing with its stinger at the one behind it. It's confused and figuring out what's-- why is it doing this, it's more of like-- this might work once. That is going to be a-- 17, it hits! That's going to be 11 points of damage, does it make its save? It does not make its save, that's an additional 24 points of poison damage on that one. So that's 35 points of damage, one wyvern to another. (laughs) As this guy immediately whips around angrily.
Sam: You have pleased me. (laughter)
Matt: Both of these guys go charging forward here.
Laura: Oh no, Scanlan!
Matt: It's going to pull up its javelin and chuck it at you, Vex.
Laura: Me?
Matt: Yeah. That is going to miss you at a 12. It (swoosh) throws, the javelin arcs past you. This one over here is going to come forward and it's going to take a javelin as well out and chuck it right at you, Grog.
Travis: Heh, you're dead.
Matt: That is a 20 to hit.
Travis: Hits.
Matt: You take ten points of piercing damage, reduced to five, as you basically (impact)--
Travis: (snapping noise)
Matt: (laughs) Snap it off and grin in its face.
Travis: Let me return that favor in a second.
Liam: Grog is on god mode.
Marisha: (laughs) Save game plus.
Matt: (laughs) --now it sees the danger that you're in, looks at you, sees you hack through the center of one of the wyverns, intensely looks at you and begins casting another spell.
Travis: Oh shit.
Matt: Like it is wont to do.
Marisha: Is it?
Travis: Come on, smart Grog.
Matt: All right. So, Craven Edge, as you're holding it, all of a sudden the handle becomes white hot and you immediately take six points of fire damage just holding it.
Sam: Grip it harder! (groan)
Matt: Fire's biting through. Three attacks against you, Scanlan.
Sam: Oh, God.
Matt: Currently two of which are flanking you, so they're going to have advantage on the attacks. So that's a natural 20 on one of them. This guy is-- 18. That hits. And then this guy here without the advantage-- still hits with a 17.
Sam: I'm going to use Cutting Words on the last guy.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: I'm going to just-- (plays flute badly) to distract him.
Matt: Okay, go ahead and roll a d10.
Sam: d10. Which one's ten, I never remember. This one. Nine!
Matt: Okay! So he rolled a 17 plus seven, that would've been a 24, that brings him to 15, which I believe misses you. So the last strike, as he swings towards you, the shrilling tones, it causes him to reach up and grab one of his lizard-like ear holes and (snarling) the swing goes wildly over your head. However, as you duck down, you look up as you see the shadow come down of two large clubs that (boom boom) over the head of your tiny gnomish form. That's going to be-- (groans)
Sam: Oh, that's not a good sound.
Matt: Oh, and they also get bites after this, too. All right, so you take 12, which would double to 24-- Oh, no, sorry, 12-- 20 points of bludgeoning damage from one. You take 12 points of damage from the other. So 32 points of damage total. And they're both going to attempt to bite you as well, with advantage.
Sam: A bite with advantage!
Matt: That is a 20 on the first one.
Sam: That's the damage it does?
Matt: That's to hit. And that one's going to -- double 19, so they both hit. So you take another 20 points of damage total of piercing damage as they both start tearing into your body.
Laura: 52 points of damage just then?
Sam: (rasping breath)
Laura: No, Scanlan!
Marisha: No, you're still up, you're still up! I thought you said you had 55!
Sam: I did.
Laura: 52!
Marisha: It was 52 total.
Laura: You have three points left.
Sam: Ah! That was close, guys. I saw my mother! Then I saw myself at math class, failing.
Matt: I need you to make a bunch of concentration checks here.
Sam: Oh yeah. Okay.
Matt: To maintain control over it, yeah.
Sam: Advantage on concentration checks.
Matt: Yeah, so just roll two at a time.
Sam: Two whats?
Matt: Two d20s.
Sam: Well, I only have one d20.
Matt: Adding your constitution modifier to it.
Sam: How many-- oh, for each thing that-- constitution modifier. Holy God. Okay. I'm counting both of those, the first one's only 12.
Matt: 12, that'll work, because none of them-- only one of them did 20 damage and it's minimum of ten, so as long as you get above a ten with each one, you're fine.
Sam: Okay. So I got to do two more?
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: Yeah, that's 16 plus two.
Matt: Okay. Another one.
Sam: 17 plus two.
Matt: Another one.
Sam: Two plus two.
Matt: You have advantage on these.
Sam: Seven plus two. Nine.
Matt: Nine. Nope.
Sam: No good. No bueno.
Matt: With that, you lose your concentration on the Domination spell. As that fades--
Laura: That's okay. The other wyvern is still mad at the first one, so that's good.
Matt: So that ends their turn. Vex, you're up.
Laura: Oh man. Okay.
Matt: You see Scanlan being tossed around on the ground, and then you see streaks of blood in the air as one of them tears a big chunk out of his shoulder.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: He looks up at you briefly, his eyes half-open.
Laura: Scanlan! I got you!
Sam: No, no, I know you did. You shot me on the last turn, I remember. Yeah, you got me good! You got me good!
Laura: I shoot from my Bow of the Sky Sentinel.
Matt: Sky Sentinel, I believe, did you use that last battle?
Laura: Fuck.
Matt: I'm pretty sure you did.
Laura: I did, but I only used my burning thingy once, so I can do that. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. So I'm going to move my Hunter's Mark to one of the guys around Scanlan.
Matt: Okay. Do you want to say the most wounded of them?
Laura: Yeah, sure.
Matt: That would be--
Laura: Or the least wounded of them, actually.
Matt: The least wounded would be this one.
Laura: Okay. And then I'm going to shoot-- I'm going to shoot arrows.
Matt: All right!
Laura: All right. I'm going to shoot through my Blazing Bowstring on that guy and the guy in front of him.
Matt: Okay. Right there and there?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: So Blazing Bowstring, and then regular. Go for it.
Laura: Okay. So I forget how to do that. I roll to attack. Why is this so hard?! Okay, 18!
Matt: 18 hits.
Laura: Okay, I'm going to roll damage on that one, which is ten plus my normal eight. 12, 14 plus six for Hunter's Mark. 20 plus six for sneak attack, bitch!
Liam: Did you just call the DM a bitch?
Laura: No, I was calling that guy a bitch.
Sam: Matt does not deserve that kind of language.
Laura: 6d6. So that's 25 damage against the first guy.
Matt: 25 damage? That's just enough. Say goodbye to him. That sneak attack was just what you needed, that was the last bit of damage.
Laura: Yay! Okay, so the second guy is another 18.
Matt: Another 18? That hits.
Laura: Actually no, that's a 20-whatever. Yeah. Okay. 14, 15, 16. Do I get sneak attack on him, too?
Matt: Can only sneak attack once per turn.
Laura: Dang it. So 16 damage against that guy.
Matt: 16 damage, okay. So this arrow-- The first one hits it in the neck and he gurgles and falls to the ground and bleeds out on the floor next to Scanlan. The other one, the arrow strikes it in the middle of its shoulderblades and it arcs up in pain, but it's still standing. Though it's having to really move around with much pain in its face. That end your turn? You going to stay up there?
Laura: I'm going to-- yeah.
Matt: Staying up on the rooftop, sniping down. Good call. That brings us to Scanlan!
Sam: It's my turn?!
Laura: Take a potion! Heal yourself!
Sam: Oh yeah! If I had a potion, that would be great! I will do Thunderwave-- Thunderwave at third level.
Matt: Thunderwave at third level, all righty.
Liam: Dissention in the ranks.
Matt: (laughs) Okay, so that is 4d8 thunder damage to all the ones on a failed save. So, their constitution saves here. Is this through a hand cone?
Sam: Sure, man.
Matt: Figured-- both fail!
Sam: What is it, 4d8?
Matt: It's 4d8 thunder damage. They are pushed ten feet away from you.
Sam: Did they all fail? Did they both fail?
Matt: Yes. This pushed this way. This pushed that way.
Sam: Ten. 17!
Matt: 17 points of damage to each. Okay! They're blasted backward, barely catching themselves on their feet. And from the impact, you can see what little bit of red-colored leather armor they have on is tattered and destroyed. You can see blood pouring out of the sides of their earholes where the thunderous blast possibly burst their eardrums. And they're both like, shaking their head. All right.
Sam: Bonus action, I will Healing Word myself--
Matt: (laughing) Okay.
Sam: I can do that at higher levels? Yes?
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: I'll do it at a level four.
Matt: (laughing) Okay.
Sam: And I will sing to myself; sadly, pathetically, (breathy) I get knocked down, but I get up again. Ain't never going to keep me down. (laughter)
Matt: All right! So that is 4d4 plus five healing to yourself.
Sam: Okay, 4d4 plus five-- That's 14 plus five.19.
Matt: 19. So you heal yourself 19 hit points. That ends your turn. Up next, Vax.
Liam: I'm going to scramble up to the top of the building that I'm right next to.
Matt: Acrobatics check.
Liam: Sure. No problem. Yeah, way high. 20-- 33.
Matt: Yeah. You parkour up the side, land on top of the rooftop. Leap across and you're now at the edge.
Liam: Is that Percy right there?
Matt: That's Percy right there.
Liam: Okay. Oh, who's right directly in a row, away from me? Yeah, I can't tell. It's a bad guy?
Matt: It's a bad guy, bad guy. Bad guy, bad guy, bad guy.
Liam: I want to run, actually, and I want to jump off and land next to Percy. Yeah. I want to run straight by and I want to stab the dude. I'm going to run forward, yeah. Stab that guy. (laughter)
Liam: Yeah, exactly. That is 20.
Matt: That hits, roll damage.
Sam: Run, run, run. Stab. Run, run, run. Stab. Those are the two buttons on the Vax video game. (laughter)
Sam: Run and stab.
Liam: Nine.
Matt: Nine damage?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: (grunt) You shank him in the side and he tumbles over. (cheering)
Liam: Run towards Scanlan, and I want to grapple him. Hopefully he just takes it. No, not that far. One square back. Right there! Grab him. And I'm using my bonus action to dash and then drag him backward, behind Grog.
Matt: It's an action to grapple someone who would be against it, are you letting him grapple you?
Sam: Oh, hell yes.
Matt: I'll say for the sake of the--
Liam: Right, two actions and a bonus action, mix them around, Matt!
Matt: Yeah, it's fine, because he wants to. You rush forward, you grab him, and you're dragging him back this way?
Liam: And then back-- yeah, right behind Grog, and I drag him behind Vex and Grog, back by Keyleth. (airplane noise)
Matt: Okay. I'll say that's about as far as you get because you have a bit of movement taken away, even though you are hasted, because he's not too heavy, but he's still a gnome.
Liam: Right. Dash-- hasted, I can go very very far.
Sam: Your hands are so rough and masculine.
Liam: I spank him on the ass and say, you're welcome, shorty.
Marisha: Okay. I'm going to push my way through the crowd a little bit. Can I have that laser pointer?
Liam: Yes, you may.
Marisha: Thank you. Okay. (grandiose voice) And now with all of the rage, thinking about all--
Sam: "I turn someone into a chicken."
Marisha: I-- boof! Boof! Boof! I want some feather-down pillows for our loft. I channel all of my Fire Ashari ancestors. And I cast my 7th-level Firestorm!
Sam: Oh god, we're all going to die.
Marisha: So as I concentrate, enraged at the sight of dragons, I have ten--
Sam: (whispers) Did you get me away from-- because I--
Marisha: Yes, you're fine. You're fine. No, he didn't get you away because he knew this was happening, it just happened to work out. So ten ten-foot cubes-- They all have to be connected. Exactly, I'm going to start here and I'll work my way over. They're ten-foot-- remember, they're ten-foot. But they're attached. So they're bigger than that.
Matt: Three-- well, they're ten foot by ten foot, which is about this size.
Marisha: Okay, okay.
Matt: Right, so it's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Marisha: Oh, okay, yeah, get the wyvern.
Matt: You can get all of them there.
Laura: Oh my god, that guy is going to be so--
Liam: Grog's going to bite his head off.
Matt: What's the DC on this?
Marisha: They have to make a dex saving throw or they take--
Matt: Right, right, but what's your DC on it?
Marisha: Oh, my spell DC? 19.
Matt: Fail, fail, fail, they're not very dextrous. Fail, fail, fail-- Fail! They all fail. (cheering)
Matt: So that's 7d10 fire damage to each of them.
Sam: Why don't you use that all the time!?
Marisha: I just got it! I just got it when I leveled.
Liam: You've got to be careful with friendly fire, and we're all out of the way.
Marisha: So a giant, fiery chasm splits open.
Matt: The ground bursts open, rocks being torn asunder as giant columns of flame-- boof, boof, boof, boof, boof-- out of the ground, completely engulfing each one of them in this sudden conflagration of red and orange and yellow flames and molten magma.
Marisha: 24. 24, that was four-- 24, that's good, so 27, 36, 30-- 42 points of fire damage. (clapping)
Liam: Phew. Gingers, man. Gingers.
Marisha: My hands light up.
Matt: Each one of the lizardfolk-type creatures in the flames, you see them shriek for a second before their forms are turned to ash in these blasts of fire, each sub-woofer-like, guttural impact as the ground cracks open like (explosion noise) scatter amongst--
Marisha: So they explode? Popcorn?
Matt: Yeah, each one of the wyverns themselves, you can see the flames emerge around them, and as it recedes they have burn scars and their flesh is cracked and peeled against the fire wounds that now tear across the front of their body. They're all looking fairly hurt by that.
Marisha: And then, I take a bow. (laughter)
Marisha: And I'm-- exhausted a little bit, little single tear as I think of my ancestors-- And that's it.
Matt: All right, end of your turn. Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: All right. I'm going to start walking towards that wyvern at the bottom there-- Yeah, that way, I'm not going to get quite close enough to get into the reach of that jerk over there--
Matt: So you can go here.
Taliesin: Yeah. While I'm walking by him, though, I'm going to nail-- I don't even know if I'm really going to-- going to shoot him three times while I'm walking by, because that's funny. With Sharpshooter.
Matt: Okay. So first shot against them?
Taliesin: It would be seven, 19.
Matt: 19 hits. Go ahead and roll damage on him.
Taliesin: That's-- 1d10, what did I do with my 1d10s, because I wasn't thinking-- here we go. That's 26 points of damage.
Matt: (explosion noise) You take his head right off as you walk by, without even looking. (explosion noise, pained squawk) And you can see the lower jaw gets blown off and it falls to the back on the ground.
Taliesin: Since I've got two more shots, I'm going to start shooting at that one dragon-- that wyvern, as I'm--
Matt: Right there? Go for it. Two shots on the wyvern.
Taliesin: Sharpshooter again.
Matt: All right.
Sam: Pew!
Taliesin: That's a nine, yay! So that's 16?
Matt: 16 hits.
Taliesin: And I'll roll the second one, just to have it. That's nine. Nah, nine'll miss. Thankfully will not-- that's great. 26 points of damage.
Matt: All righty. This one (explosion noise) the bullet hits inside of its body, you can see a little (splurting noise) of blood squirt out--
Taliesin: And I'll get as close as I can get to him in this round, also, I'm going to spend my movement walking straight towards him.
Matt: (heavy walking noises) That's the rest of it there. Okay. That's your turn. Grog, you're up.
Travis: Oh! Yeah! I leave one of those to you guys, and I run at the two wyverns on the left.
Matt: Getting in the middle of the fray? Against them both?
Travis: Yeah, against them both!
Matt: There you go! Grog charges, and they're both-- There you go!
Travis: Here's hoping these puppies go-- That's 24?
Matt: 24 on the more wounded one?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: All right, that hits him.
Travis: Can I swing at the other guy?
Matt: If you want to.
Travis: Yeah, let's divvy it up, I don't want to give anybody too much love. Five, four, 26?
Matt: Hits, so roll damage on each.
Travis: 11, 22, 32?
Matt: They're both Great Weapon Master? Okay, 32 damage?
Travis: 32 on the first.
Matt: First one, you carve through him with the blade (whump).
Laura: Nice.
Matt: Makes his save.
Travis: Five, ten, 21, 31, 31.
Matt: 31 damage? Okay. This one you (whoosh) streak across with Craven Edge. Makes its save. You leave a large wound across the front of its jaw and it (choking noise). However, you did kill one, so you do get to use your bonus action for an attack because of your Great Weapon Master feat.
Travis: Do I have to roll for the hit?
Matt: Yes.
Travis: That's 31?
Matt: With the minus five?
Travis: Sorry! No, no, never mind, sorry, what's 31 minus five?
Liam: 26.
Taliesin: 26.
Matt: Hits, yeah, you're good.
Travis: Okay. Three, seven, 12, 30. Oh, 22, 32.
Liam: He's covered in ichor.
Matt: 32. This time (whoosh) you swipe through the second time with the blade, this time carving off part of its wing, and you see that one of the wings is half-curled and keeping up to the side, it's hobbling around its legs, looking like it's on death's door, but still keeping itself. All right, is that the end of your turn?
Travis: That's it.
Matt: All right, (wyvern noise) in there, and this one stays there and is going to unleash upon you, Grog. It's going to bite and tail attack against each of you with the stinger against you, Grog. That is a 21 to hit?
Travis: Hits.
Matt: And natural 20 on the stinger, okay.
Travis: Well, I have resistance against poison, so that helps.
Matt: That does help, actually, so it'll just do regular poison damage against you. So you take 11 points of piercing damage, reduced to six from the bite. And the stinger deals-- That's 12 points of piercing damage, reduced to six as well.
Travis: Okay.
Matt: The stinger, however, I need you to make a constitution saving throw.
Travis: All right. Ugh, 12.
Matt: That's a failure. Actually, it would have been an additional 12, because it was a critical hit on the pierce, so you take 12-- so a total of 18 damage so far, and then, as part of the poison, you take 48 points of poison damage. Because you have resistance, that is reduced to 24.
Sam: Hey! That's nice!
Matt: All right, you have poison resistance from the belt, right? Yes. All right, so there you go. The other one coming up against you, Percy, strikes with its bite. That is going to be a 20-- 16?
Taliesin: 16 misses.
Matt: 16 misses. That is going to be a 22 for the stinger.
Taliesin: Stinger hits.
Matt: Okay, stinger hits you for six plus four, ten points of piercing damage. I need you to make a constitution saving throw.
Taliesin: Constitution saving throw. 20.
Matt: 20, you succeed. No poison.
Taliesin: So I took ten points of--?
Matt: Piercing damage. Correct. All right, it's looking rough on both their ends. They're just fighting to the end at this point. All right, that ends their turn. Vex, you're up.
Laura: I'm going to cast Hunter's Mark on the one fighting--
Matt: Moving it over?
Laura: Yeah. Percy.
Matt: All right.
Laura: And I'm going to first attack the one fighting Grog.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: 16?
Matt: 16-- does hit, yeah.
Laura: Yes! Okay.
Matt: Don't have a whole lot of armor. They just got a lot of hit points.
Laura: 17 plus sneak attack-- 18.
Matt: 18. So Grog, as you're thrashing about with the blade at this creature, eager to get that final hit, you reach back with Craven Edge before an arrow (impact) into its face and it (burble, thump) collapses to the ground.
Travis: Aw! (laughter)
Laura: And I shift my attention over to the one fighting Percy!
Matt: All right.
Laura: And that is 30, no, 28?
Matt: 28 hits, go ahead and roll damage with the extra d6 for Hunter's Mark.
Laura: Nine, ten, 11-- Where's my dex? 17.
Matt: Gotcha. 17 points of damage. second you (whoosh) pull out the second arrow, (whoosh) release it and it strikes the side of its body, and (pained squawk) it still seems to be standing. It hurt it, but didn't leave it in any dire straits yet. That ends your turn, are you staying where you are?
Laura: I'm staying where I am!
Matt: Okay, Scanlan, you're up.
Laura: Actually, I'm going to jump off the roof and rush over to Scanlan.
Matt: Okay. So leaping off, make an acrobatics check.
Laura: 24?
Matt: 24-- Scanlan, at the start of your turn, as you're getting ready, all of a sudden (impact) in front of you, spooking you momentarily, you see Vex lands on her feet and looks down at you with a look of concern and wanting to make sure you're okay.
Sam: Oh, hi, thanks for checking on me. Could you move for a second? I'm going to kill this thing. (laughter)
Sam: Oh, so I'll-- I can't do much, because I'm far away and I don't want to kill Percy--
Taliesin: It's not going to live through me anyway.
Sam: That's true. I will Wand of Magic Missiles him.
Matt: Okay, using how many--
Sam: I'll use six of my seven.
Matt: Oof! All righty. So go ahead and roll proper damage on that.
Sam: Okay, the first, okay, so is that 6d4 plus one?
Matt: This would be Magic Missile, cast at level six, technically, I'm pretty sure--
Sam: Well, it's weird, because my--
Matt: So it would be-- it would be 6d6 plus six.
Sam: 6d6 plus six?
Matt: Oh, I'm sorry. 6d4 plus six. Bleah.
Travis: (chuckles) Heh, math.
Matt: Hey.
Sam: Sorry, it's close.
Laura: Yeah.
Sam: One more? 12 plus what? Six? 12 plus six. 18.
Matt: 18? Okay. The missiles (impact noises) slamming into the side, arcing off and swirling around Percy to hit it, anime-missile-streak style, hitting it from all sides, you can see chunks of its body being blown off from the force of the arcane casting. It still stands, though it is dripping from multiple wounds and is having a hard time.
Taliesin: I got this.
Matt: Ending your turn, Scanlan?
Sam: I think so, I mean, I'm okay. I'll heal myself a little bit more with another level one Healing Word.
Matt: Go for it, take your d4 plus five.
Sam: Okay. Seven more points-- yay!
Matt: You're up.
Liam: I'm going to start walking towards it and dagger, and dagger, and dagger.
Matt: Go for it.
Liam: First is 20.
Matt: 20 hits.
Liam: Second is 23.
Matt: Hits.
Liam: Third is a 23.
Matt: Hits.
Liam: So, we get--
Matt: This is Sneak Attack.
Liam: Ten for the fir-- Sneak Attack? Is it near something?
Matt: Percy is in melee range with it.
Liam: Okay, so the first is ten plus-- wah!
Laura: Oh no, dice down!
Liam: Ten plus 16, 23, (growling) 29, 36, 39, 41 for the first dagger.
Matt: How do you want to do this? (cheering)
Liam: I will aim for its open mouth as it's going "huah." And pin its tongue into the back of its skull.
Matt: As you step forward, your first dagger, you pull it out and aim it and over-the-hand toss it as it rears back, ready to bring its fangs out to sink down into Percy, the dagger vanishes into its throat, and you see its face go lax for a second. (wet coughs) It begins trying to cough, and as it does, you can see bits of blood and gore from its throat being hawked across the ground. It takes a few steps. Percy steps out of the way as it heads towards you before it rears back and (choking, thump) and collapses onto the ground. You can see the blade still sticking out the back of its head, towards the back of its throat, before it appears at the side of your belt.
Sam: Sorry I made a noise, guys, sorry.
Laura: Next time, stealth. We should get inside.
Travis: Yeah.
Laura: We should hide.
Taliesin: We should-- we should take what we can and we should also hide the bodies.
Laura: Good call.
Taliesin: Let's bring everything inside.
Marisha: I go down to the wyverns and I start going for those stingers.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: If you can do this quickly, Keyleth, because we need to hide these bodies.
Matt: It's going to take you a while to do it.
Liam: Can I assist with my Keen Dagger, and help her under her instruction?
Laura: Let's get them inside.
Liam: We're going to drag the wyverns indoors?
Taliesin: Drag everything indoors.
Sam: Wait, wait, wait-- these stingers are on the end of tails?
Liam: Yeah.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Sam: Grog, can you chop off their tails and we'll take the tails with us?
Laura: No, we've got to get the wyverns inside. If anything flying overhead sees these bodies, they know something's been attacked.
Sam: Aren't half of them burned to a crisp anyway?
Taliesin: Not crisped, just scorched.
Marisha: There's some ash. I go ahead and I do a cantrip, Gust, and start spreading out the ash.
Matt: Okay. It still looks like someone emptied a bunch of fireplace ash pits into the center of the walkway where there once were lizardfolk.
Laura: I'll have the bag.
Travis: What for?
Laura: Just the Dust of Tracelessness.
Sam: I give us cover. I'll blow my Horn of Fog.
Laura: I start putting the Dust of Tracelessness down on the ground so it looks like nobody's been here.
Matt: Low fog sound as Scanlan blows the horn. Fog fills the vicinity and you guys begin tossing Dust of Tracelessness around--
Travis: I go grab the humanoid figures and I throw two over my shoulders and then I get one in each hand and I start dragging them toward a door?
Taliesin: Any-- inside. Just inside.
Travis: To an "any inside."
Liam: I'll get the door for you. (door creaks)
Matt: All right, you guys pretty quickly manage to move what you can out of the way, we'll say over the next few minutes the fog is there. Under that cover, you begin to drag the wyvern bodies into the alleyway, into the shadows. If you want to go ahead and make some checks here to go ahead and see if you can harvest.
Marisha: Yeah, okay, let's do different ones. Okay, so first one, I'll definitely take advantage, so, since I have advantage-- not that much better-- 14. The first one.
Liam: Would it help if I gave her my Keen Dagger for the rest of it?
Matt: I would say, given the circumstance, all it would do would offer her advantage, which she already has, so it wouldn't make much difference. So the first one, it's been a little too damaged in battle and you aren't able to really draw any poison from the stinger for the first one-- what's the second one?
Marisha: Second one, 15 total.
Matt: 15's what you needed. You manage to extract just enough of the wyvern stinger poison for possibly a single dose, so you can mark down a dose of wyvern poison.
Marisha: Okay, I'll give it to-- I'll give that to Vax. Do you have poison? Or do you-- Vax or Vex-- I give it to one of the twins. Here, twins. You fight over it. Fight over it.
Laura: Is it good for you?
Liam: Yeah.
Marisha: Two more, maybe I can-- 14-- Okay, well, the second one I rolled a 25.
Matt: Okay, so that's a second dose of wyvern poison.
Marisha: That I give to Vex. Last one-- I'll take that 15, with-- 26.
Matt: All right, so you have three doses of wyvern poison that you've managed to harvest from these creatures; you guys can distribute as you see fit.
Taliesin: Anything else to loot from these schmuckuses?
Matt: They don't carry much gold, and what they have, you envision, probably went to the entity that rules Emon. And as you're looking over the bodies of the few of the lizard men here, you see they didn't just wander their way in here. And you remember mention from Allura before that there were lizardfolk worshipers of Thordak years ago. Apparently, once the city's been taken, Thordak has, or at least the worshipers of Thordak are also moving in. So, taking this time to harvest poisons, looking over the bodies, you can see the consistency between their red, crimson-dyed leather materials, and you get the sensation that while this was a small skirmish group, this is probably the new policing state of Emon. So. With that, we'll take a quick break for the restroom. We'll pick up here in just a few minutes, guys, if you want to hang tight. And we'll see you here shortly. Jumping back in-- As the party re-gathers themselves after the battle with these lizardfolk and the wyverns in the center of the city of Emon, you slowly make your way back through the streets towards the north, passing through Abdar's Promenade, finding the building that was previously brought to your attention thanks to Garthok.
Laura: Should we take a short rest, though, before we head down to the Clasp? Because some of us have taken some hits--
Taliesin: We'll take a breath in the--
Laura: Okay. Before we head down?
Taliesin: Yeah. In the basement.
Matt: So you guys find the building that was brought to your attention; you head down into the same cellar, keeping tabs on the external trap that was brought to your attention by Garthok last time. You make your way inside. There's the same barrel in the far corner; you pull the top off and there, indeed, is a ladder that leads down underground.
Laura: This is why I left Trinket. Because he wouldn't have been able to come down here anyway. Just so you know.
Travis: Hey, search that shit, Vax.
Marisha: He's very claustrophobic.
Liam: So we've just got ladder down. That's it?
Marisha: Well, hang on, let's heal up. I need to hit dice it up as well.
Liam: Well, I'm fine, so while everybody is--
Travis: I would not like to take a short rest.
Laura: Oh.
Travis: I lose all my Fancy Feast if I do.
Liam: Just do some push-ups. Just do some push-ups while I check this ladder out. So I'm going to check for any traps on this ladder or anything.
Travis: Oh, yeah yeah yeah! Can she heal me instead?
Laura: I'll heal you. I'm going to heal you--
Liam: 23.
Matt: Okay. Looking at the barrel, there are no traps currently set, and it's not locked. The only traps were on the outside of the cellar, from what you knew previously, and as that mechanism had already been shown to you by Garthok, so that was easily disabled.
Liam: I'm not going to go crazy, I'm just going to go to the bottom of the ladder-- in I go.
Matt: Okay. So while you guys are taking a rest--
Liam: 30 for stealth.
Matt: You drop down the ladder. As you head down what probably comes to about 15, 20 or so feet into pitch black-- it's completely dark down there. Do you have any light source, or do you want to--
Liam: I have a Flame Tongue Dagger.
Matt: Okay, so you pull the Flame Tongue Dagger. It puts out a very, very low candlelight, opens up the vicinity to you as your feet splash down into very, very shallow, a couple inches, shallow water. Looking around you, you are in a subterranean sewer system. The smell hits you as you hit the bottom of it. This is the entire underbelly of Emon, and there is the slight sound of trickling water that's rushing through this tunnel you're currently standing in. The ladder drops close to about a foot above the floor before it comes to a complete stop. Looking to your right, it descends a little further down on that side, and you can hear-- make a perception check.
Liam: 22.
Matt: Okay. To the right of you, what should be the eastern tunnel, you can hear the sound of trickling water growing louder; it's almost like this stream meets another. As you listen to the left, and the stench is pretty rough in this part, to the left you can see in the tunnel is a very, very faint dim, yellow light that is shifting ever so slightly in the distance as it curves around out of view. It is level to where you are now, actually, slight incline for a little bit.
Liam: (quietly) Vex'ahlia-- There is a long tunnel down here and there is a bit of faint light. I have Percy's fancy rock; I am not planning on doing anything crazy, but I think I should--
Laura: You don't have the-- the rock doesn't work until we sleep. You don't have anything.
Liam: Well, technically I do still have it. Regardless, I should go ahead and, if there's anyone to talk to, I should talk-- I'm not going to go yet, I'm going to wait 'til you guys have rested, and come down to-- it's pitch-black down here, I'm not running ahead. I'm better at this shit than you and the rest are, so take a rest, I'm going to sit here--
Laura: You're better at talking than the rest of us are?
Liam: Sometimes, Stubby, yes.
Laura: How will I know if you get into trouble, and your hands are tied--
Sam: Do you need me to come?
Laura: We can all hear you. (laughter)
Liam: Stubby, could you come down here for me?
Marisha: Hi, Vax.
Laura: Hold on just a moment. Mind the gap.
Matt: You splash down into the sewer system.
Laura: Eugh, fuck, it smells down here.
Liam: Yeah.
Laura: Do I have to step in the water?
Liam: Probably. Come here.
Laura: Yes?
Liam: All right so, before all these guys-- you were being stalked by someone, I don't know for what reason, I don't know who the person was, I don't know what they wanted with you.
Laura: Stalked?
Liam: Someone wanted you, and I don't know who. The Clasp was going to get you for them, and I stopped that from happening. I followed you one night, or rather, followed this person following you, and met the Clasp. And I made an exchange for your life.
Laura: What?
Liam: I went and got someone else. And--
Laura: And said it was me? No--
Liam: Not immediately. You're almost on it. They told me to get a body, I got a body. A living body. A child rapist. And brought him to the Clasp, and they brought out a stick-- really it was made of human tongues.
Laura: A stick. Of human tongues.
Liam: Yes. They touched it, and he turned into you.
Laura: What the fuck?
Liam: And they took that guy. For whatever. And in exchange for your life, I have this, and they are allowed to call on me when they want. So, I know that we've run in and out a couple of times, but we're going in. You can talk my fucking ear off in a moment, all right? Just shut up for a second. We are going to go in and try to form some sort of alliance or working partnership, this is different than running in, smashing some shit and running out, all right? So keep the cloak up, hang back, don't say a lot, and you can talk my ear off later.
Laura: Okay, I will do that, I want to know that tongue guy, that looks like me-- is he dead or is he alive now? They gave him to some stalker, some stalker!
Liam: I don't know why you were wanted, I don't know what it was about, all I knew is that they were going to take you away and I wasn't going to let that happen and I took some fucking piece of shit and traded him in.
Laura: So there could be at this moment in time another person that looks just like me parading around the world?
Liam: Well, if I had to wager on it, I'd say that he's in a dungeon in a rubber suit, but I don't know where, no.
Laura: Well, thank you. For, you know, doing that-- (nervous laugh)
Liam: I never told you because it's creepy as fuck.
Laura: Was it the Clasp here, was it the Clasp in Westruun?
Liam: It was in Westruun.
Laura: Well, these guys probably don't know me.
Liam: Probably? Probably.
Laura: I'll put my hood up--
Liam: Stay at the back.
Laura: I would like to find out who the guy was that wanted me, though. That's kind of weird. Thank you. For everything. thank you. You always have my back and I know it.
Liam: Yeah.
Laura: And for that, I won't say very much.
Liam: You do you, Vex'ahlia.
Laura: Everyone can come down.
Matt: So as you finish your short rest, you all progressively find your way down the ladder and to the subterranean sewer system. The choice is to travel to the east or western side of the tunnel.
Liam: Sounds like there's, I don't know, drainage or something coming from slightly up in that direction.
Laura: I'm guessing towards the light, is where they are. Scanlan?
Sam: Oi?
Laura: Do you have something that can make disguises? Don't you have like, not the mustache, but something that can really change my looks?
Sam: How do you know I'm Scanlan? I could be in disguise, but yes I do.
Laura: Could I use that?
Sam: You would have to attune it to yourself-- is that right?
Laura: Oh, it takes like a little bit?
Sam: Oh no no no, requires attunement. What do you think?
Liam: Well, that's not a bad idea, but it means we've got to sit in this stank.
Sam: I can instantly make us, with Seeming, I can instantly make us all look different. Or just you.
Laura: Or just me. How about just me? I've got a question, though. Here's the thing: if you think that they know what I look like, don't you think they know what you look like? Because you look just like me. So what difference does it make if I'm there or not?
Liam: I don't know if the person who wanted you was part of the Clasp. I don't know who it was. It's parading you around in front of the people who made an illicit deal with me.
Laura: All right, all right, all right. Seeming, how about that?
Liam: It could be fine. I don't know.
Laura: Okay! Seeming?
Sam: Yeah, no--
Laura: Please?
Sam: (smarmily) It's pretty high-level stuff--
Laura: Scanlan, what if I heal you?
Sam: What if I-- ooh! I cast Minor Illusion and give her a moustache. What about that? Is that pretty good?
Matt: A fancy, fancy moustache that you cannot wipe off your face!
Travis: Hey, that's very handsome.
Liam: I don't think that's going to be enough. It's not quite enough for our purposes.
Sam: All right, I dispel it.
Laura: How about a limerick as payment, Scanlan?
Sam: A limerick for you?
Laura: For you.
Sam: Oh! You're going to give me a limerick?
Laura: I'll give you a limerick. Hold on. I've been preparing it--
Liam: She's multiclassing a third time.
Laura: Have you heard tale of Scanlan the Bard? / Or Burt Reynolds, if you look at his card. Always tries to get laid / Sometimes with ladies he made! But I still respect him, 'cause rhyming is hard. (laughter, cheering)
Sam: That was excellent.
Liam: Second firestorm of the night.
Travis: Where's the extinguisher?
Matt: I will give you a d6 inspiration dice for that.
Laura: Yay!
Sam: Wait-- me or her?
Matt: Her.
Sam: Wow. That's impressive. Here's the hat. You can use it--
Laura: Oh, thanks, Scanlan.
Sam: In about 20 minutes you'll be able to use it.
Laura: I take off my circlet, I guess, and I put on the hat.
Liam: How 'bout that smell, everyone? Eh?
Marisha: Did you live in this?
Liam: I never lived--
Marisha: Did you deal with this!? Oh, oh, that's good.
Liam: I'm, like, a distant cousin to all this. (laughter)
Matt: In the time it takes for you to take the Hat of Disguise and go ahead and attune to that, you guys are now prepared. What path would you like to take?
Sam: Towards the sounds, yes?
Matt: Well, you have the sound of water rushing to the right, in the darkness, and you have the sound, or, yeah, the view of slight moving light to the left.
Liam: But did you say, on the right, is it going down, or is it coming down?
Matt: The water is trickling downward; the water continues sloping downward this way. The opposite direction is where the light is. The little bit of light you see in the distance.
Taliesin: I say we follow the water.
Liam: Follow the water down or follow the light?
Marisha: Follow the water towards the light. Right?
Travis: Jesus, what the fuck are we doing here?
Liam: This is like the Underdark again.
Sam: I abstain.
Laura: Let's go towards--
Marisha: Towards the light.
Taliesin: I'll do whatever they say.
Marisha: Are we going towards the light or towards the rushing water?
Travis: Light.
Marisha: All who vote "light," say "aye."
Taliesin: Aye.
Laura: Aye.
Travis: Aye.
Marisha: All who vote "water," say "aye."
Taliesin: Aye.
Marisha: To the light.
Matt: So you guys head-- left, or--
Liam: Is there any-- I'm sorry, one last question. Is there any Thieves' Cant on the walls at all?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Laura: Can I look, too?
Matt: You know what, yes, you can.
Sam: With inspiration.
Travis: Is there any poo on the floor?
Liam: 31.
Laura: Oh, he doesn't need my help.
Matt: Looking along the walls, you start heading in that direction, you do see a few markings that basically say 'sanctuary' in Thieves' Cant, in the direction of the light.
Liam: All right. Confirmed.
Matt: You guys continue onward?
Liam: Yeah, I'll lead the way. Yeah, we sat here for 20 minutes in the stank.
Matt: Yes. (clears throat) So, you guys continue forward up that tunnel. Eventually, as it curves around, the light-- you can see-- it's shifting, because it appears to be a distant fire light that is the source in this vicinity, and as you turn the corner, as the tunnel slowly curves around, it opens up into a large central sewer chamber, though most of it is dry, and you can see there is a large mound of dirt in the center that seems to rise above most of the water that has collected along the ceiling, and there are a series of platforms constructed out of wooden scaffolding at different levels all throughout this chamber. Some of it looks a little rickety, some of it looks very old, but various states of moisture rot. (offscreen sneeze)
Matt: You hear a sneeze from the distance from one of the-- (laughter)
Matt: As you look and see a series of small bonfires throughout the room that are currently lit and surrounded by figures. You see a ramshackle tent city, and/or a series of small, wooden hovels that have constructed here. You see a number of figures that are huddled around these bonfires: cloaks, hoods up, generally keeping warm in what is a relatively cold, subterranean area. You guys, glancing over here, as you're first looking, and you can see a few of them appear to be laid up and hurt, and there appear to be at least a few individuals that are heavily bandaged or have slings on. As you guys step into the room, not being very stealthy in your arrival--
Liam: We could have been, but I use a bit of sign language from the Cant, and let them know that I'm part of the Clasp?
Matt: Okay. A few of them stand up, hands on the side of their hilt, and stop there for a second before one individual steps out of the shadows and puts his hand up, putting it down. You recognize this to be Garthok.
Sam: Garthok!
Matt: He says, "Don't worry, they're with me. I'm glad you made it. It had been a while. I was afraid maybe you wouldn't come."
Sam: We got held up by some wyverns. I almost died, it was crazy. We're here now.
Matt: "It sounds like it. I'm sorry to hear it."
Sam: Hey. It's all right.
Matt: "I'm glad you stayed alive." And as he starts to talk, the group of individuals standing about ten feet behind him separate as another figure pushes past them. Pulling the hood back, you can see a man about six feet in height, average human height, long, blond hair that trails past the middle of his back over a dark grey cloak. Fine features at one time; he looks older, you can see the weathering in his face and the various wrinkles and lines from years and years of living in this atmosphere.
Liam: You said "human", right?
Matt: Human, yes. He has a red-tinted monocle over one eye.
Sam: Ooh! I like him already.
Matt: As he steps forward, the rest of the Clasp put their hands off to the side of their weapons. He pushes aside Garthok to the rest of you and says: "So, you are the ones called Vox Machina, am I correct in this assumption?"
Sam: Yes, you are.
Matt: "Hmm! Trusted of Uriel, executors of Modeth the Traitor. One among you is a member as well, I'm told."
Liam: I step forward.
Matt: "Then you are welcome here. I am Spireling Shenn--"
Sam: (whispers) Spireling Shenn?
Marisha: (murmurs) He's a Spireling!
Matt: "Master of networks and information--"
Sam: Ooh!
Marisha: Ooh!
Matt: "--of the Clasp of Emon. Excuse the mess, we lost a portion of our territory and are currently caught in mid-adaptation. So, what can I do for you?"
Liam: Well, you know who we are.
Matt: "And you know who I am, now."
Liam: Yes. And you know my spotty track record with the Clasp. But that's all past now. The city's in ruins. You're looking at the right hand of Uriel.
Matt: "Uriel is no longer with us. You are a hand to nothing."
Liam: Of course. We're looking for what to do next with this city. I don't think any of us wish to be the pets of the beast that's now roosting in the heart of Emon.
Matt: (chuckles) "No, that does not do any of us any good. Business has ground to a halt, and we've lost a few good patrons in this unfortunate circumstance. We lost our entire northern tunnel structure as soon as the creature attacked the Cloudtop District."
Liam: Well, I'll be honest, our first thought was to flee this city.
Matt: "Safer."
Liam: But before we make that decision-- yes, it is-- we know that you're the next best thing to a government in Emon.
Matt: "Hmm."
Liam: And we want to know what's left behind.
Matt: "Well, we're seeing to our own. We're going to see how many of our allies still lie within the city. Going to reach out to our friends across Tal'Dorei and see how much of a network we still stand to keep. Then we call in a few debts, reach out to some friends and, ah, we see if we can find some way to supplant this red thing."
Liam: Can I insight check?
Matt: Go for it.
Liam: Not good. No. Nine.
Sam: Nine, you said?
Liam: Nine. The plan now is to lay low and hide?
Matt: "Well, for now, I have a number of operatives topside who are currently trying to get as much information on the red one as possible. The piles of wealth are growing, and it looks like the beast is building a damn home out of the district."
Taliesin: The city's going to need a black market.
Matt: "Oh, I am aware, and we are preparing for that. However, it's still fairly fresh, and individuals aren't willing to release any coin when all of it goes to the pouches of the thing that sits on us. Word has gotten back that Westruun was also hit rather hard in the night. And these creatures have continued eastward ever since-- no further word on their whereabouts. So we're put in a reactionary position, which I loathe. We're used to being ahead of the rest of the curve."
Taliesin: Well, here's where we could help each other.
Matt: "It would appear that could be a possibility."
Taliesin: We need this city to stay alive. We need the citizenry to be fed, and we need people to know where they're going to get their medicine and when they're going to get their food. We understand it's going to be tricky. We need information, we need spies, we need to know what's happening in the city, and you need people like us to stay out of your way.
Matt: "That seems like a fairly top-heavy trade in our direction, if you ask me. There are many ways to get people out of our way."
Taliesin: There are ways that we can benefit each other.
Matt: "I would love to hear it."
Sam: (whispers) I would, too.
Taliesin: We have safe haven-- and please, by the way, stop me if you feel I'm being too broad.
Sam: No, go for it.
Taliesin: We have our keep that is untouched by the dragon's attack-- we have a safe haven.
Matt: "Hmm. How is this keep accessed?"
Liam: We can get to that.
Taliesin: There are-- options.
Liam: We also have strong connections to Whitestone.
Laura: And Vasselheim.
Sam: And to The Slayer's Take-- that's what they're called, right? Yes? There could be a formidable force that could come to protect the city or drive out the dragons.
Liam: We're proposing a short-term solution-- you want to get back to a position where you can grease the wheels and make money. That's not going to happen anytime soon. But you can't take care of these beasts on your own. And neither can Whitestone, neither can we.
Taliesin: But it is very likely that we will be the thing that is dropped upon it from a great height, and the most cooperation we can get, getting into a position of power over this beast, the happier we'll all be.
Matt: "Hmm. Let's say we do this, let's say we go forward with this alliance. You get out of our way, you promise resources from Whitestone, perhaps? They have quite a few unique contributions they could make. The Slayer's Take-- I have not had many dealings across the Ozmit Sea, but are you referring to, ah, Vasselheim?"
Sam: Indeed. They are a mighty force.
Matt: "Now, that is a tough nut to crack, that city. If you're connected in Vasselheim, perhaps we can talk."
Laura: There's no guarantees you'll be able to get in anywhere.
Matt: "There's no guarantees we'll be able to provide food or medicine-- it's dangerous times, my dear."
Laura: It is. But the sooner these dragons are defeated, the sooner business can get back to usual.
Matt: "Of course."
Laura: Ow. I mean-- (fake coughs) eh.
Sam: I know I'm getting a bit ahead of ourselves, but once the dragons are gone and the city's returned to normalcy, what is your ultimate goal? To hold power or to remain in the underbelly?
Matt: "All the real power lies in the underbelly, my friend. I have a proposition for you, then. We will do this. We have many channels and secret tunnels throughout the city, and we could very easily deliver food, medicine, shelter, even, to the wired and poor and downtrodden folk of this town, be the subterranean heroes of Emon. Out of the goodness of our hearts, of course. However, once this creature is toppled, and the city is brought toward, I gather you would have the ear of whoever comes to power in this city."
Sam: We may very well be the person that comes to power in this city.
Matt: "That is helpful. And I imagine you also have some presumably powerful connections in Vasselheim. We would be interested in beginning a sect of our fair trade in that distant, all-too-- how do I put it? Xenophobic cityscape?"
Travis: What?
Matt: "If you agree to be our seed in that stubborn garden of a town, you have our aid."
Marisha: Can you give us a moment? (softly) Please?
Matt: "My patience grows thin."
Marisha: (whispering) Can we talk about this for a second, guys?
Matt: He adjusts the monocle on his eye.
Marisha: Do we really need them? Are they really providing us with enough to make this worth our while, to where we essentially want to open up the Pandora's Box of crime in Vasselheim? Do we want to be responsible for that?
Travis: Well, I'm all about Pandora and her box, but I don't think we really need this. It's not worth all of that. Especially if we're going to Vasselheim.
Marisha: I feel like we just took one pretty top-heavy deal and traded it for an even more top-heavy deal not in our favor.
Taliesin: Oh no, I'm not-- I feel the urge to further discuss this. Also, to be fair, we're not representatives of the Clasp; we couldn't, technically speaking, open-- All we can do is-- I think, the most fair thing to do-- to offer in exchange for this is perhaps some trade with the materials that are available in Whitestone and maybe a promise of keeping a blind eye towards their business until the finished reconstruction of the city. Let them reestablish themselves until the city is properly completed.
Laura: Don't say that.
Taliesin: You need an underbelly. Underbellies are function. Underbellies function for this very need: the fact that we can actually get food and medical supplies into the city right now if we need to. Less than 72 hours after such a devastating attack, there's no other system--
Liam: If the Clasp were to vanish, something else would take its place.
Taliesin: They're inevitable.
Laura: But I don't want to introduce them to Vasselheim, no.
Taliesin: At the cost of people starving or not starving.
Laura: We're already here, Keyleth.
Marisha: I'm down for joining them and letting them join our cause, and using their infrastructure, but beyond that--
Liam: Can I use perception to make sure that we're really private right now?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Laura: Can I join in?
Liam: 22-- Oh, 22, plus can I use my inspiration on this?
Matt: When'd you get that inspiration die?
Liam: I got it in the wyvern fight.
Matt: It would've faded by now, unfortunately.
Liam: Okay, so 22.
Laura: 33.
Matt: 33? You're far away from the crowd. However, Spireling Shenn has been very concentrated in shifting his attention from each person that is currently speaking in this conversation.
Marisha: He's reading our lips.
Laura: I turn my back to him and I say, he can read our lips as well as I can.
Taliesin: Of course he can, which is why I'm not saying anything that I wouldn't want him to hear anyway. I just don't want to promise anything we can't deliver. I don't think we could deliver Vasselheim; we're going to be busy! We have too much on our plate as it is.
Laura: I don't think they'd listen to us anyway, honestly.
Taliesin: I'm going to offer what we can give, and see if that's enough.
Sam: We have to have something to sweeten the pot.
Marisha: Yes.
Sam: What are you offering, money?
Laura: Offering to sweeten the pot-- we're defeating a fucking dragon! Let them get back to normal.
Sam: We can't promise that! The dragon could very easily kill us!
Laura: We could say-- They certainly can't do it without us. And we can't do it without them. But we'll be bringing in other armies with us.
Marisha: I agree-- it's joined forces at this point, that's all we can offer them. A place to fight at our side.
Travis: You're still assuming he's going to keep his word, too.
Taliesin: Let me go back to him. (deep sigh) Shenn.
Matt: "Yes, hmm."
Taliesin: I propose a counter-offer. I just don't feel comfortable offering Vasselheim; I don't think that we could necessarily deliver, and we, honestly, have a lot to do.
Matt: "All I'm asking is an introduction to a handful of key figures in the city, no more than that."
Taliesin: Well, I will not promise that now. What I can promise right now is some access to materials from Whitestone, which-- and I show him my gun hilt, which is embedded with the gems. I can see what's still lying around, and we can make a deal. I can also promise that for the reconstruction, once this has been dealt with, which is in everybody's best interest, until such time as there's a functioning government in this city, you will be treated with the respect appropriate of a group of people who are helping keeping the city functional.
Matt: "You act like that hasn't been our treatment for the entirety of this city's existence. You think your council didn't have dealings with the Clasp for many years before this happened?"
Taliesin: Of course they have.
Matt: "We helped make this city function. All we're offering is this service to other places that maybe don't have the right guidance to achieve their true greatness. All I ask is an introduction. Beyond these other. Far after the fact; don't even need to worry about it now. Who's to say what changes from now to then?"
Laura: Who would we even introduce you to?
Marisha: We don't even know anyone.
Sam: Yes, we do. We know some high-ranking clerics. We know the Slayer's Take. We met a bunch of people up there.
Marisha: In a zealot city? You want to go to a cleric and be like, "Hey. Thought you might want to meet the underground mob boss."
Matt: "We don't have to worry about that now. Just a simple handshake, and it's all done."
Taliesin: I'll put something forward to the group. If they prove themselves honorable, if they prove themselves faithful and capable of keeping this city afloat, then we will speak to whomever they wish us to speak to precisely of what they did. No more, no less.
Matt: "If this is an issue of morality, I would like to remind you that, one, we've let you escape after murdering one of our leaders, only upon learning that he himself was an immoral individual."
Liam: You're welcome.
Matt: "Also, we went against our word as an organization by letting you take a war criminal that had already paid his way out of the city."
Taliesin: And for that, we are grateful.
Laura: And we gave you something very powerful in exchange.
Marisha: And you got to keep that man's money.
Taliesin: That was business.
Matt: "It was business, but business that was persuaded by the actions of good people, and bringing justice. We want society to thrive."
Taliesin: I'm willing to kick this ball down the field.
Travis: What?
Matt: "So. Not wasting any more time, shall we make this a fine, healthy city once again?"
Taliesin: This feels a fair deal to me, and it means that we can leave knowing that the city will, in fact, still have a populace while we're gone.
Marisha: You seem used to selling your soul, Percy.
Taliesin: It is the job of ruling.
Sam: If we come back and learn that you have made a deal with the dragons, you'll be the first to die, not them.
Matt: "Oh. I would only hope that would be the case. I wouldn't be caught dead dealing with such a selfish entity."
Sam: All right, then let's do this. Keyleth, shake the man's hand.
Taliesin: You don't have to.
Sam: You've got nice soft hands.
Taliesin: Vax?
Travis: It should be Vax.
Taliesin: This is not the worst deal I've ever heard.
Marisha: You just don't know that yet.
Matt: "I have things to do."
Taliesin: I have met the devil. That's not him.
Laura: Don't do it.
Marisha: Percy, you make me so nervous.
Taliesin: Thank you.
Matt: "I haven't all day. My arm grows weary with impatience."
Marisha: Vax?
Sam: Would you like me to sing to give you some extra strength for that arm?
Taliesin: Vax, I will make the deal if you're not up to it, but I want your blessing.
Liam: You know what? Keep your deal.
Travis: Yeah! Attaboy.
Sam: We're going to leave the city abandoned?
Travis: Yes.
Sam: With no one to protect it?
Marisha: We are not abandoning it. We already discussed it. There's more than one way to cut through this knot.
Liam: I don't think you're going to let this city fall, anyway. If this city dies, you've nothing.
Marisha: I agree.
Liam: If the parasite hasn't a host to feed on, the parasite dies. No, thank you.
Marisha: Percy? I'm sorry, but I think our methods of being rulers might differ. I don't think I need to sell myself for the greater good.
Matt: "Very well. Unfortunate as it is. Step forward."
Liam: Is this a whisper?
Matt: No, this is him asking you to step forward. He steps really close to you, and he takes you by the shoulders and turns you around to face away from him. Do you resist?
Liam: I'm going to roll out of his hands forward to my friends.
Matt: Okay. Make an acrobatics check.
Liam: 28.
Matt: 28. You tumble away from his grasp, and he (grunts). "Very well. I know your face now, at least. And the rest of the Clasp will know you are a false member, now. You are not welcome in these tunnels ever again, and if we see your face amongst our kind, it will be our word that you are to be taken on sight. It's a shame you've marked yourselves our enemy this day. I wish it wasn't this way. But to step up and confront us with such disrespect for all the patience we've shown you in previous years is just-- it irks me. Stinks of a lack of civilization. So please be on your way. We'll do as we do. You do as you. Now be gone." And he turns around, flicks his cloak, and steps back into the group. The rest of them keep their hands on their belts and wait for you to leave.
Sam: I look at Garthok and say, "Even you?"
Matt: Garthok actually gives you a very stern look and pulls his blade an inch from the side of his scabbard.
Travis: I wouldn't do that.
Matt: At which point, you can see 25 more Clasp members step out. Even wounded ones as they are, all stepping up and gathering. There are now 35 to 40 of them starting to form out of the shadows, forming a semicircle around you entirely.
Sam: Don't do it, Grog.
Taliesin: Absolutely not.
Marisha: Let's go. Come on.
Travis: A fellow can't smile every once in a while?
Laura: We'll just back up.
Taliesin: I take a bow, and I turn my back to them and walk out.
Laura: I do not turn my back. I walk backwards the entire way out, with an arrow notched.
Travis: I stay next to Vax.
Sam: I say, party on, Garthok. And then we leave.
Laura: Keyleth? Darling? Could you maybe make a wall of stone and close off this tunnel?
Marisha: Unfortunately, no.
Liam: Save a thought for the people of Emon, if you've any room left in your narrow minds. And I back out.
Marisha: I end with, hopefully, you will realize there is a far greater enemy at hand than the personal squabbles between us small people. And I also step away.
Matt: The Spireling's not even in view at this point. He's disappeared amongst the rest of them.
Marisha: I'm sure he can hear me.
Matt: Possibly. As you guys exit and find your way back up to the surface, as the last of you makes it outside of the entranceway, you immediately start hearing this slamming and breaking of stone from underneath you, and you gather pretty rapidly that this entrance is being entirely removed for possible entry.
Taliesin: I would like to point out, since you had such noble intentions towards my position on things, this is your ego at work here. I may be many things, and I may be a deal-maker, but I never forget that when I rule, I rule these people, as well. I'm not better than them. And you may think you're better than them, but this is what it creates. It creates enemies.
Marisha: No, Percy. The difference is, I don't think I'm better than them.
Taliesin: They certainly think you do, and they are not pleased.
Laura: This mark. Is it magic? Can they trace you through this mark?
Liam: I don't answer. I walk over to Keyleth. Can you still do the thing with your hands?
Marisha: (fire noise) That thing?
Liam: I rip my shirt down. I want you to burn it away. Now.
Marisha: Vex, do you have an arrow?
Laura: Of course.
Marisha: I hand it to him. Put this in between your teeth. (sizzling noise)
Matt: (sizzling noise) Searing white pain through the back of your eyes, Vax, as Keyleth presses her palm into the center of your shoulder blades. You can hear the sizzling and cracking of skin, and smell the burning of Vax's flesh in the air in this cellar. Make a constitution check.
Liam: Seven.
Matt: Seven. You break through the arrow with your grip, and actually give out a very loud, painful scream out of reaction.
Liam: Like you do.
Laura: Similar to when you hit me in my arm.
Matt: Kind of. A moment passes. Keyleth, you pull your hand back, and where the Clasp symbol once was, there is a hand mark burned into the back of the shoulders.
Travis: Vecna. (laughter)
Liam: It was you.
Travis: Kill her now!
Matt: What would you guys like to do?
Sam: Well, that was a bust.
Taliesin: That could have gone so much better.
Travis: Vax, I think you made the right call, and I don't think very often.
Sam: Or very well.
Travis: Yeah.
Liam: Thank you, Grog.
Taliesin: I think we could have gotten out of there with at least the hintings of an alliance, as opposed to just--
Laura: Straight up--
Taliesin: Bitter enemies. This was a disaster.
Travis: Sometimes you have to walk away from a bad deal to find a good one.
Sam: That's not a thing.
Taliesin: That's not a thing. Where did-- you didn't read that--
Marisha: I got what you were saying, Grog.
Travis: When it rains, the sun is shining.
Laura: That's deep, Grog. I like it.
Travis: Stew on that.
Laura: I cast Cure Wounds on--
Liam: No!
Laura: I already did it. Too late! I fucking touched you, fucker.
Liam: Does that take the scar?
Laura: It just takes the pain away.
Matt: Cure Wounds? What it does is prevents infection. It does heal you for the hit points you would have lost for that. I'll say it nullifies the damage you would have taken from the burn mark. It does not alleviate you from the scarring. It's not as graphic as it would have been, had it been left to heal on its own, but it does muddle the Clasp symbol somewhat.
Liam: Okay. Thank you.
Sam: Shall we go back to our keep?
Travis: We could just kill them all now.
Liam: There's hundreds of them, Grog.
Taliesin: (splutters) No, we can't.
Travis: I saw, like, 40 or 50.
Liam: Yeah, there were another 160 in the rafters.
Taliesin: It would do no good. Who would be bringing food into the city in the first place?
Liam: They're going to go on doing the same thing they would have done with us or without us.
Taliesin: They're doing it without us, though.
Marisha: But Percy, do you honestly think that after all of this was done-- do you want to be beholden to those people?
Liam: And I don't believe they are going to bend the knee to Thordak. I don't believe it.
Taliesin: They're not going to, no. Of course not.
Liam: And that was all I, personally, was worried about.
Taliesin: I wanted people on the inside keeping us informed, and we just lost a very powerful spy network.
Liam: I think the only people on the inside right now have scales.
Taliesin: Everybody needs something.
Laura: Can we go back to the keep?
Taliesin: We are not going to bother. We're going to go and we're going to find a way of killing these things, and we're going to hope for the best in this city. That's what we're going to do.
Matt: As you guys are heading back, I need stealth checks from everybody.
Laura: Stealth check. Pass Without a Trace.
Marisha: Fuck! Natural one.
Taliesin: Oh my god, really?
Marisha: Natural one.
Laura: Then what's the point of anybody rolling?
Liam: 27.
Sam: 19.
Laura: 37.
Travis: 29.
Taliesin: We have a plus ten? 33.
Matt: All right. You guys push southward through the city, finding your way. At this point, the sun has set. Night has come in, and occasionally you hear the flapping of leathery wings overhead as a number of sentry groups of wyvern riders go tearing through the city. At one point, you hear a similar (raspy cry) sound, and you hear other ones begin rising up off the rooftops, heading in your direction, Keyleth. What do you guys do?
Taliesin: The minute we see that, I'm going to push her against the wall, and I'm going to Minor Illusion a shadow right over her.
Matt: Okay. Make a new stealth check with disadvantage.
Laura: Add ten.
Matt: (chuckles) It's a natural one on their end.
Marisha: Oh, good.
Matt: As long as you didn't roll a natural one.
Marisha: No, I didn't, I rolled an eight, plus a seven, plus ten.
Matt: So, at that point, they (whoosh), one swoops down and lands on the edge of the roof, and you see it curling down. And takes off again, and they continue on, out of the way. You wait a few moments before silence takes the night once more, and you press on heading southward. (laughter)
Laura: Nice.
Sam: Good job, Percy.
Marisha: Thank you, Percy.
Taliesin: One day you're going to stop being afraid of me, by the way, and I hope that day comes soon.
Sam: Before we go to the keep, do you want to swing by the place?
Taliesin: The place?
Sam: The place with the airships.
Taliesin: There's no "swinging by," that's a caper. That's an entire thing, that if we're going to do--
Sam: Just to go there and look?
Travis: The showroom is fucked. It's broken.
Taliesin: This is one of those things that we're going to have to get everybody on board before we even start talking about it, so probably a good night's sleep.
Sam: All right.
Laura: We need to sleep. We need to get up in the morning--
Taliesin: And then we'll talk about an airship. I'm really on board with the airship.
Sam: All right.
Laura: I think we need to go to Vasselheim or Whitestone.
Travis: Vasselheim.
Liam: We don't need an airship to do that.
Laura: No, we don't. But we also need to find out what's happening with Allura in Whiterun. Westruun. All those cities.
Sam: All right. Back to the keep then, I guess. When we get there can we check in on Gilmore and the queen?
Matt: Yes. And as you return to the keep, Pike has been taking care of the rest of the individuals, and she's been seeing to Gilmore's side. Gilmore is fast asleep, dealing with the tail end of a fever that has broken, after the healing from the day before. Earlier in the day, I should say. It also appears that Salda and the children have been in and out, keeping an eye as well. Pike, as you enter, looks up to you with a smile, and says, "He'll be all right. He's going to pull through."
Laura: That's wonderful.
Matt: "I should probably stay with him for a bit. Make sure he's okay."
Liam: Is he unconscious still, or just sleeping?
Matt: He is asleep, currently, yeah. "He's been conscious throughout the day while you were gone, but he's got to rest a bit more. He's still had a rough few days."
Travis: It's dead on.
Taliesin: Just needs headphones.
Matt: I just need headphones, and to brush against the mic occasionally. Especially during really really impactful story moments.
Liam: "What? What?"
Matt: So you guys find yourselves resting for the evening. You take to a night's sleep.
Laura: You going to sleep, Grog?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: Yeah, you got to sleep.
Travis: I got to sleep.
Matt: If you don't sleep you're going to start getting levels of exhaustion for the next day.
Travis: Oh. Okay.
Matt: All right. So you lose the strength bonus. Everyone, you can get half of your hit dice back.
Travis: That's a lot of--
Liam: As the sun goes down? It's been down and everyone's going to their rooms? I go to Keyleth's door and knock on it.
Matt: Keyleth.
Marisha: I open the door. Hi.
Liam: Hi. I don't want to be alone tonight. Do you?
Marisha: I haven't been wanting to be alone most nights. And I let him in.
Matt: Okay. So, we--
Laura: Bow-chicka-wow-wow!
Matt: Jump forward to the next morning--
Taliesin: That wasn't the kind of ship I was hoping to get. (laughter)
Taliesin: I don't think we can all fit on that ship.
Matt: So, next morning, you all wake up; full hit points, get back half of your max hit dice that you spent. All your spells back.
Laura: I give Scanlan the Hat of Disguise back.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: You sure you don't need it?
Laura: Yeah, fuck 'em.
Sam: All right. Keep up those rhymes. Not bad for a first timer. (laughter)
Matt: All right, so. What's the plan?
Sam: You know, Vex, I don't want to be alone right now. (laughter)
Laura: I take his face and I push him down on the ground.
Matt: All right. What's the plan?
Marisha: I don't know.
Laura: Do we have a plan?
Taliesin: I suppose our plan is the Slayer's Take next?
Travis: Yeah, Vasselheim.
Sam: How do we get there? Wait, we have to get rid of all the 'fugees.
Laura: Yeah. We need to go to Whitestone, then.
Taliesin: Well, here's the question is do we want to head towards Vasselheim from Whitestone?
Laura: Yeah, let's do that.
Taliesin: So we'll all go. We'll take the last of the-- I can't believe I'm going to say this-- the last of the 'fugees.
Sam: Yes. Ooh, la la la.
Laura: Wait. All of our guards, and our servants, as well. I don't want to leave everyone here.
Sam: We're abandoning the keep?
Laura: I don't know what else to do. If dragons attack, our five guards aren't going to be able to do anything.
Liam: One dragon crashed in the roof of the building.
Taliesin: Accidentally smushed.
Liam: What are the cook and the maid going to do?
Taliesin: Make it breakfast.
Liam: Jarett's pretty badass, but I don't think he can handle that.
Travis: Dragons get hungry.
Sam: When we come back, our keep will be gone.
Taliesin: And we'll be able to build it back up.
Marisha: It'll match the rest of the city, Scanlan.
Liam: Percival's the lord of Whitestone. He's got a castle!
Laura: We find a new keep.
Sam: But my room is just the way I want it.
Taliesin: I'm sure that some lucky dragon's going to come and shit in your bed. It'll be fine.
Sam: All right, if we're going to leave the keep, I'll need a moment in my room.
Liam: You'll find another room bathed in self-loathing. (laughter)
Liam: It doesn't need to be here.
Taliesin: It takes a good month to bathe a room in that much self-loathing.
Sam: You look like you're glowing this morning.
Liam: That's ridiculous.
Sam: I've never seen you quite so chipper.
Taliesin: Let's gather what we need, make sure that Gilmore is ready to move, as well. We'll bring everybody through to Whitestone.
Sam: All right.
Matt: All right.
Laura: I guess we should go tell the guards that they probably will have to leave, if they want.
Taliesin: And that they can come work in Whitestone.
Laura: Well, I don't want to force them to, but of course they're welcome to.
Liam: Why don't you go ask the guards? I'll go talk to the kitchen staff.
Laura: All right.
Travis: I know who she's going to talk to.
Laura: He's the captain of the guards, anyway.
Matt: We'll say for the sake of brevity, you speak with the rest of the keep's staff, including the guards as well. Jarett for the most part is like, "As long as I'm still getting paid, we're more than happy to go where you need us to be. If it's further away from dragons, I am okay with that."
Sam: Don't you need your tools?
Taliesin: I can pack up my kit, and I've also technically got a reasonable workshop back in Whitestone.
Matt: Okay, so you gather your materials, you prepare at the tree in the center of the keep, you say your goodbyes--
Sam: Before we go out there, I go to my room, I take a dump on my bed--
Matt: You've used it at the temple of Sarenrae--
Sam: No, it's not a potion. Just a straight-up poo.
Matt: Just a straight-up poo? Okay. Marking your territory. I respect that.
Sam: I hang a note on the gate of the keep.
Travis: Shitting on your own bed?
Sam: I don't want anyone else to use it. And with a butter knife, I put a note on the gate to the keep that says, "If Kaylie comes, go to Whitestone. P.S. If my painting is delivered, please forward to Scanlan Shorthalt, care of Whitestone."
Matt: All righty.
Travis: "Mind the poo."
Laura: I leave a note for Allura, and tell her we've headed to Whitestone, as well.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: I don't say Whitestone. I say, "the place where we sent you originally," so she knows where it is.
Matt: Okay. Notes are placed. Spell is prepared?
Taliesin: I've packed everything that could possibly be used to make anything dangerous.
Matt: Okay. You have your supplies at the ready. You all gather in the center of the temple of Sarenrae. Keyleth?
Laura: Not yet, Keyleth!
Taliesin: We'll be back.
Marisha: What's wrong? Are you ready, Vex?
Laura: I mean, it's the first time we've had a home in forever, and we're leaving it.
Sam: Can you make it disappear, or something?
Laura: We can go. It's nothing.
Marisha: I can put Hallucinatory Terrain over it, that'll last a bit, but not long enough to make it worthwhile.
Laura: It's just stone.
Liam: We've done it once before. We can do it again.
Taliesin: It will be built back better than before. That's what we do.
Laura: Let's go.
Matt: The portal opens outside of the tree, and all of the refugees start rushing through. You guys give chase, following over to the opposite side, where Whitestone waits. You all emerge from the Sun Tree in the center of the familiar town.
Liam: Fucking cold!
Matt: It is chilly. Not as snow-dappled as it was when you first arrived. A little has melted, and the clouds are a little bit more open; you can see some of the blue sky above you. It's actually a beautiful day, if a bit chilly. As you emerge, you can see there's a few individuals in the center of the town, including a couple of the original refugees that seem to be waiting for the rest to come through. They greet you as soon as you arrive, and rush up and grab a couple of people that they had met at your keep. Some come forward and say, "Thank you. I'm so glad you made it!" They shake your hands. You've arrived back in Whitestone. So, do you guys want to wait here for the day, and then make your way to Vasselheim?
Sam: Do we need to talk to anybody here?
Taliesin: Just to set up to make sure that the queen and her children are taken in at the castle.
Liam: I imagine you'll fill your sister in.
Taliesin: I will. I'll fill my sister in on how they're to be taken care of. Make sure that Gilmore is taken care of.
Sam: We may want to stock up on potions and stuff before we leave.
Laura: Yeah, buy as much as we can.
Taliesin: There's a shop.
Matt: There is, but you guys have cleaned it out.
Laura: Buy stuff in Vasselheim.
Matt: They have not had an opportunity to restock. Their main providers have been killed.
Liam: Do you think that with the time that's passed, Cassandra has found any of the belongings of the Briarwoods? They were pretty snazzy.
Taliesin: We can ask about that.
Matt: You approach Cassandra, who is happy to greet you once you return. "Did you have a question?"
Taliesin: Vax?
Liam: We need to kill some dragons, and we are out of everything. You've been here a while. Have you found anything of the Briarwoods? Any store of treasure or potion or anything of use?
Matt: "Well, the personal effects you all retrieved when they were defeated. What remnants of income or gold which they'd kept was put in with the rest of the Whitestone treasury when they took over."
Liam: Not so much interested in gold as in means of protection or healing.
Matt: "They weren't really specialized in healing, I'm afraid, and what bits of protection they had, you've already taken. But if gold is what you need, we can probably spare you some."
Laura: I mean, I'm not going to say no to the gold.
Taliesin: Obviously, we'll sieve the coffer a little bit because we're going to need it for the mission.
Laura: So very generous of you.
Taliesin: Also, let's re-employ our castle guards as the Emon royal guards in the meantime, and they can serve the queen and her children.
Laura: I like it.
Matt: "That can be very easily presented. Oh, here we are!" There's a small chest with a lid that she hands it over to you. Actually, puts it out and your hands are already out. "All right. 2,000 gold from our coffers. It's not much, but we have to keep the city running."
Laura: Of course.
Taliesin: And a small amount of the green gem, if that would be possible, that's left over from the mining operation.
Matt: "Of the glass?"
Taliesin: Of the glass. If possible.
Matt: "Yes, certainly."
Taliesin: Thank you. I'm working on something.
Matt: "Very well." It takes a few minutes for that to be retrieved from down south of the tomb in the mausoleum, but nevertheless, you get four half-dollar-sized pieces of residuum glass.
Taliesin: Perfect.
Matt: Four shards of residuum glass. "I hope that's of aid to you. Apology for the confusion. We have quite a bit of individuals to find homes for, and get them running."
Taliesin: Gilmore will be of great help.
Matt: "Yes, as you've told me."
Taliesin: (laughs) I'm sorry to drop this all on you, and I'm thankful.
Matt: "I'm thankful that we even have an opportunity to offer aid to somebody. That's thanks to you, so it's nothing on us."
Taliesin: It will not be the end of it, sadly.
Matt: "That's all right. Whatever we can do. Anyway, good luck."
Taliesin: I'll be off in the morning.
Sam: How are we getting to Vasselheim?
Taliesin: We can teleport.
Laura: Yeah, teleport, right?
Sam: Is that true?
Laura: Just pop on over, yeah. We sleep for the night, and then we go over to Vasselheim the next day.
Liam: Let's have dinner.
Laura: Hang out in Whitestone for the day.
Taliesin: I'm going to work on that little project.
Liam: Whitestone and chill.
Taliesin: The thing I was trying to attach to my gun but wasn't working, I'm going to try to attach it to my boot instead.
Matt: Interesting.
Taliesin: I can draw you a sketch.
Matt: All right. While the rest of you guys are attempting to rest, I need you to make a tinker tools check.
Liam: Tinker tools. This goes in here.
Taliesin: That's better. 22.
Matt: 22. You've affixed it to your boot. We'll see if it works.
Taliesin: And I've got one working piece? I know each individual build, I have to build the--
Sam: The nubbin.
Taliesin: The actual device itself has to be built for individual usage; it's not auto. I'm going to try and build one and see how it goes.
Matt: Okay. So total cost for the materials on that will put you at about 300 gold.
Laura: What?
Sam: 300 gold.
Taliesin: I'm working on something.
Laura: Okay.
Taliesin: Thank you.
Laura: I mean, it's your city.
Liam: Are you borrowing 300 of your gold from the money you loaned to Vex?
Taliesin: Since the day I've met her, I've given her every bloody dime I've made. So, yes. I no longer even think about it anymore.
Laura: And I love you for it.
Taliesin: She's practically the royal treasurer. She's just happier that way.
Marisha: (laughing) "She's just happier that way."
Matt: All right. You find an evening's rest. The next morning comes uneventfully. You find yourselves refreshed. I'd say at this point, you're all at full hit dice after two nights of rest; you're fine. So, on to Whitestone, Keyleth?
Laura: Vasselheim?
Travis: Vasselheim?
Matt: Sorry. You're in Whitestone.
Liam: We were just here!
Matt: You recall you've seen a number of trees. The largest you've seen in Vasselheim would probably have been on the outskirts of--
Liam: Where we fought the hydra, maybe.
Marisha: We camped out in a few trees outside of Vasselheim.
Matt: Do you want to stop outside the city or within the city, is the question.
Marisha: Whatever's closest.
Travis: No. No magic in the city.
Laura: No magic in the city, remember?
Matt: No arcane magic. Divine magic is a different thing. There's plenty of divine magic within the city.
Laura: Oh, is there a teleportation circle? Do we have one in Whitestone?
Marisha: There wasn't a teleportation circle to Vasselheim.
Matt: There are no sigils to Vasselheim. Part of their defense process is preventing any secret intrusion in that regard.
Taliesin: We'll teleport to the outside of the city and perhaps sleep at the temple of Sarenrae.
Matt: There's the Abundant Terrace.
Laura: We always have rooms at Slayer's Take, remember.
Taliesin: We do always have rooms at Slayer's Take.
Marisha: What's the Abundant Terrace?
Matt: That's the section that Melora looks over. That is where primarily most of the farming, food--
Marisha: Yeah, let's go there.
Matt: That's where you know there are a number of orchards and things that are kept in that vicinity. If you wanted to.
Marisha: That's right outside the city?
Matt: It's within the city. It's one of the five quarters. I won't say quarters. It's one of the five areas.
Marisha: Sure.
Matt: Quarters.
Laura: Is Gilmore staying here in Whitestone? Yes?
Matt: Yeah, unless you want to try and bring him with you.
Laura: No, it makes sense to leave him here, right? Where do you want to stay, Gilmore?
Matt: (laughs) You're approaching Gilmore. He goes, "To be perfectly honest, I'm not quite feeling 100%, and let's just say I'm not a huge fan of the zealot type."
Laura: Understandable.
Matt: "Vasselheim doesn't really jangle my dingles."
Laura: You've got a whole bookstore devoted to you here.
Matt: "This is true."
Taliesin: I would appreciate your help in restarting the economy of Whitestone, to be fair.
Matt: "Well. (sighs) Guess it's not too late to open a new branch of Gilmore's Glorious Goods, since my other, possibly, two no longer exist. (sighs) I was so close to opening. I started from nothing! I can do it again. (coughs) Good luck, you all."
Taliesin: You as well.
Sam: So we're going to a tree outside of the city?
Travis: Yep.
Marisha: Well, it's in the farming district in the city.
Matt: It's in the actual city.
Laura: All right, cool.
Matt: All right. Using this once again off the Sun Tree, you guys step through. As you emerge out the other side, you are in the thick of a heavy orchard in the Abundant Terrace. There is heavy snowfall that has fallen recently here, and where it was cold in Whitestone, it's cold here in Vasselheim. You can see built-up ice and sleet that has recently been pushed off to the sides of the orchard. Even amongst this very cold weather, all of the plant life in this area is vibrant and springtime green. As you all emerge in the center of this orchard, you can see one of the nearby workers who's tilling the land looks over. "Hey! What are you doing here? You're not supposed to be in the middle of the orchard!"
Laura: Slayer's Take business. We'll keep moving.
Taliesin: We were just leaving.
Matt: (groans) "Fucking Slayer's Take. Do whatever the fuck they want." He drinks out of his canteen. "Fine! Just get out."
Liam: Glad that manticore's not in your orchard. That's all I can say.
Matt: "Manticore?"
Taliesin: That's just cruel.
Laura: Don't worry. We took care of it.
Matt: (weakly) "Thanks." He starts looking nervously over his shoulders as he goes back to his work. Eventually, you guys step outside of the Terrace, finding your way to the Quadroads, which is the central network that the four main portions of Vasselheim attach to. This is the Erathis-based center of the town. You have before you, to remind you, at the very northern part of the town is the extremely tall, pointed mountain known as Heaven's Stair. Attached to that mountain on one side is the Silver Talon's Reach. That is the main temple to Bahamut. To the left of it, against the mountain, not actually into it, is the Braving Grounds. This is the area that is geared towards Kord, the deity of war, where you had previously had a conversation with the Dawn Master, the Earthbreaker Groon. There's the Platinum Sanctuary in the Silver Talon's Reach, which is where the Highbearer Vord, the Silver-Touched, the high priest of Bahamut is. You also just left the Abundant Terrace, and there is the Quadroads, which is where the Slayer's Take currently is. And there is the Duskmeadow, which is the Raven Queen's domain. Where do you guys want to go?
Liam: Remind me, what was the Duskmeadow, again? Was that where we chased the rakshasa?
Matt: That is where the Amaranthine Oubliette resides, which is the prison of the city.
Marisha: What was the name of the section of the city that has the Slayer's Take?
Matt: That's the Quadroads, the Erathis, deity of civilization.
Travis: So, like, I really want to go talk to the Kung Fu Panda master. I don't think we're going to get a lot of fights in. The guy, I think he was the teacher of Kern. The guy I beat in the crucible.
Liam: That ripped, chiseled old man?
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: The guy who beat you twice?
Liam: No.
Laura: No.
Travis: No.
Travis: And nobody beat me twice. He got lucky once, get it straight. I want to go talk to him because maybe we need some more fighters and strong folks and I think he might know where they might be.
Sam: We should talk to the Slayer's Take, as well.
Taliesin: We should get our rooms.
Laura: Yeah, let's go post up.
Taliesin: We have things to put down.
Marisha: And also only about a day's travel from Pyrah.
Sam: What's that? Pyrah?
Laura: Her home.
Sam: Oh.
Taliesin: What's left of it. That will be a trip that will be necessary soon, but not yet.
Matt: You guys hit the Slayer's Take first, or where are you heading?
Laura: Slayer's Take.
Travis: Slayer's Take.
Laura: Just to let them know we're here and we need some rooms.
Matt: Okay. You make your way to the outside of the main Slayer's Take guildhall. The dark wood exterior greets you happily. You can see they still have a gathering of various antlers of creatures that are tangled into each other that form this rustic-looking entrance. And there on the front doors, you see emblazoned the Slayer's Take-- for lack of a better term, their symbol with the words of their actual guild spread across it, as you saw before. Opening the front door, you can see within the main foyer area, there is the dark iron chandeliers that run across the entire length of the moot hall, if you will. Across the front area, you find the clerk desk. Sitting behind it, a familiar red-haired, tousled, chin-bearded, scarred-up tiny man with his feet up on the desk, falling asleep in his chair.
Laura: (laughs) Oi!
Liam: Ta-da!
Matt: "What is this craziness? (laughs) Ah! It's been some time."
Laura: It has.
Matt: "So. Hello."
Laura: Hi.
Matt: "What's your business? What are you looking for?"
Laura: Dragons? Have you heard about anything?
Matt: "Other than the fact that you killed one. That is the most recent, but nothing beyond that, really, no."
Laura: We're going to need rooms.
Liam: And we're probably going to need to speak to your lady lord.
Laura: Your wife.
Liam: Well, your wife, but I'm talking about the boss, here.
Laura: That's his wife.
Liam: Higher still  the sphinx.
Laura: Oh.
Matt: "Vanessa, she's currently out on a hunt. Should be back in the next day or so."
Liam: We've urgent business to discuss with her. For now, we need a place to stay.
Matt: "Well, you're always welcome here. This is your home away from home, so please, take a load off. Pick a room. It's up to you. It's good to see you all so healthy!"
Laura: Healthy.
Sam: Thank you, Mertin. Right?
Matt: "Yes. So glad to hear."
Liam: The only reason I remember that is it sounds like merkin.
Laura: Is Zahra around?
Matt: "She's actually currently out with Vanessa on a hunt, as we speak."
Laura: That's wonderful.
Sam: Perhaps we could see her.
Liam: Sorry, we're tired. We've been hopping all over.
Matt: "Me, too. I was sleeping when you came in. I don't mind if I get back to that."
Liam: Sorry. Any room?
Matt: "If it's somebody else's room, they'll let you know, so please, take your time."
Laura: Well, settle in?
Taliesin: I'm settling in.
Marisha: Yeah, I guess we all settle in.
Matt: There's a number of empty rooms. Doesn't look like there's a lot of individuals around. As you walk down one of the hallways, though, you do see there is a card table, and the two individuals in there, you see a very scarred, burly, and frustrated dwarf who's throwing down cards on a table. Black, long series of beards, and his hair over his beard. You see Thorbir is sitting there at the card table with another man wearing really beautiful, ornate armor that is well-polished; very short, dirty blond hair, who is apparently owning him at cards, going, (chuckles) "You've terrible luck, friend. I'm sorry to hear this."
Laura: (whispering) Aldor.
Matt: It's Aldor.
Taliesin: Whoa!
Matt: Thorbir's sitting there, and throws his cards on the table. (scoffs, sighs) "They tell me I'm supposed to have the luck of the dwarves." (laughter)
Matt: "Oh. I guess it's about time you all showed up. I'm going to get a drink." And he gets up, away from the table, and walks away from the rest of you, with a half-hearted "hi," but he's in a huffy mood and walks off. Aldor takes his winnings and scoops the change into a pouch.
Liam: Aldor, Aldor, Aldor.
Sam: How's Lyra? Have you seen her? (laughter)
Matt: "Why? Have you seen her?"
Sam: Not in a while, but we thought you guys were engaged to be married. No?
Taliesin: That's the last we heard.
Matt: He reaches forward and grabs your shirt and pulls you in. "Where did you hear that?"
Sam: Not from a reliable source, I promise you.
Taliesin: Very sketchy source.
Matt: "Good. You haven't seen her, have you?"
Sam: Not in a long time.
Matt: "Good."
Liam: She's still a member of the Slayer's Take, of course, though. Isn't she?
Matt: "I assume. I just run if I see her. She's a bit--"
Laura: Yeah.
Sam: No! She seems nice to me.
Matt: "Good. You know what, actually, if you want to do me a favor. I mean, she's a nice girl, probably pretty easy if you ask her. Why don't you take her off my hands and go on a date? Take her out for dinner. Distract her."
Sam: You saw her first. I'm a man of honor.
Matt: "Oh. No. I should go." He grabs his stuff and leaves in a huff.
Travis: Good to see him.
Laura: Yeah.
Taliesin: He's looking well.
Sam: True love.
Marisha: It's weird being back, you guys.
Sam: Well, I guess we should ask them all if they want to come with us to fight a dragon?
Marisha: Yeah, do we do that now, or do we do that in the morning?
Travis: In the morning.
Taliesin: In the morning.
Liam: It feels like we were just running screaming from dragons in the sky.
Marisha: Yeah. We traveled.
Sam: We'll sleep on it. We'll talk to Nessa in the morning.
Liam: We'll get up in the morning, we'll take some of that gold, we'll put it to good use, we'll wait until Nessa gets back, and then we'll carve out a plan.
Sam: Okay.
Liam: Percival?
Taliesin: That sounds just fine.
Sam: Kord's strength to us all.
Travis: Yeah!
Laura: I wonder if Kashaw is still here.
Liam: Probably, he works here.
Marisha: Who?
Sam: Kashaw. That was the one that they went on a--
Laura: Oh! Right, Keyleth? The guy that kissed you.
Marisha: (stammers)
Taliesin: Brooding. Handsome. He was so troubled.
Liam: He was.
Laura: He was very handsome.
Marisha: So we should probably go to sleep, you guys.
Laura: It's morning, still.
Matt: Yeah, it's maybe 10 00am.
Marisha: Take a nap?
Matt: It's across the world, so it's technically earlier.
Marisha: You know, it's jet lag. It's teleport lag. It gets to you.
Laura: Maybe Nessa and Zahra have seen him. We could find out. We could use another healer, always.
Matt: It would be 10 00, 10 30 in Whitestone. About 6:30, 7:00 in the morning in Vasselheim.
Laura: Pike, speaking of clerics, do you want to check in with your temple?
Matt: Pike has actually stayed back in Whitestone to help the refugees.
Travis: Yep.
Laura: Oh. She didn't even come to Vasselheim?
Matt: No, but she did say that she's going to keep an eye, best she can, through Sarenrae. When she can pop in, she'll try and see if she can project her form, going forward.
Liam: She's led by her conscience.
Matt: She's led by her schedule in New York. (laughs)
Taliesin: We didn't think to leave her a stone, did we?
Matt: If you'd like to, you could have.
Sam: Would we have done that?
Taliesin: I would have definitely suggested leaving her with one of the stones.
Laura: Yeah, we probably should leave the stone with her so she can pop in with us.
Matt: Okay. We'll say that she does that. She keeps a gatestone with her, just in case.
Travis: Trinket stays in Emon, right?
Laura: Shut up!
Taliesin: Trinket's going to guard the castle.
Laura: Trinket is right here, right now! He has been quiet, because he's really well-behaved.
Matt: Trinket's been practicing his stealth. (bear grunts)
Laura: So stealthy, darling.
Matt: All right, so you've set up your rooms, your stuff about you. You have a full day before seemingly anyone from the Slayer's Take is going to come back. Where do you want to head?
Taliesin: Individual?
Travis: Individuals? Yeah.
Liam: Oh, shit, can we buy potions in this city?
Taliesin: I don't know.
Liam: Shit! You can't, can you?
Laura: I'm afraid to start anything. It's 11 00.
Marisha: I know, it's late.
Matt: All right. Then we will end it there this evening. I just wanted to get an idea of where you guys were going for next week.
Laura: Oh, okay.
Travis: I plan to go see Earthbreaker Groon.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: I want to wait and talk to Zahra.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: I may want to have a conversation at the temple of the Raven Queen.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Zahra sounds fun.
Laura: Right? But I do want to buy potions, as well, and stock up.
Taliesin: Yeah, that, too.
Liam: Nothing. I'd probably tag along with Percival.
Laura: What?
Travis: Old punchy man? You don't want to come with?
Sam: Oh. Yeah, I'll come watch you if you're going to have a fight.
Travis: No, I'm going to have a conversation.
Liam: You're right. I do want to see Old Punchy Man.
Taliesin: We can do both.
Travis: Some hand-to-hand?
Sam: Watch you lose again.
Travis: I'm not fighting him!
Matt: All right, so Vax and Scanlan are going with Grog to the Trial Forge.
Laura: I'm going to stock up on a bunch of stuff.
Matt: Okay. We'll do some shopping.
Taliesin: I'm going to go to the temple of the Raven Queen. I also want to talk to our mapmaker friend.
Matt: So you're going to the Raven's Crest. Got it.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: All right, cool. We'll pick it up next week at that point, guys. Awesome. Well done, guys!
Travis: We abandoned Greyskull Keep.
Marisha: Yeah, we did.
Laura: Yeah, we did, and it's sad.
Marisha: It's very sad. We abandoned Emon.
Matt: Damn.
Laura: We can't help it from there. We have to go somewhere else in order to come back to it.
Liam: Greyskull Keep is going to be an ancient dragon's kitty litter box.
Travis: I'm allergic to cats.
Marisha: If you love it, you have to--
Marisha: Let it go.
Laura: Let it go.
Liam: Like our first hometown, or our elven town?
Laura: Don't say that.
Taliesin: I was going to say, do you know who says, "if you love it, you have to let it go?" The one who got dumped, that's who! Sorry.
Matt: That's horrible.
Taliesin: Yeah, you are. I'm a terrible person.
Matt: Well, guys. Thank you so much for watching. We'll pick this up next Thursday. Those we'll see tomorrow in Colorado, looking forward to it, and tomorrow, look for my next episode of GM Tips. That'll be fun, and is it Thursday yet?
Taliesin: See you in Arizona!

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: (as Victor) Welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, our Halloween edition. Where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons & Dragons. Hi. Tonight we will astound you with spooky tales. I don't know what's going to happen as we are just going to continue the game that we normally play. Welcome, I'm Matthew Mercer, dungeon master. (laughter)
Matt: Those who don't recognise my costume, you're really confused, especially if this is your first time tuning in. Sorry. (normal voice) I am not dungeon mastering like that for the rest of the evening because I will have to run into traffic after an hour. (cheering)
Matt: Guys, I want to give a quick thank you to Amazon for delaying all my orders, making me put my costume together last minute out of shit I found at Home Depot. So, thanks, Amazon. It's fantastic, I appreciate it. All right, anyway. I guess we should go through everyone else's to see the magnificent costumes around us. Let's go and start over here with our fantastic--
Sam: I am Hotis! The rakshasa. And I cannot speak with my mouth hole. (growls)
Taliesin: I have Clarota, but the mask is currently on its way here because I didn't have nearly enough coffee. So on the break there will be a giant squiddy mask that is terrible, just terrible. It's the worst thing.
Marisha: Half Clarota! I am Doctor Anna Ripley, from Wildemount.
Travis: You suck, Ripley!
Marisha: This is very heavy. This is a bludgeoning weapon, it is not a piercing weapon. It is a bludgeoning weapon. Right hand to the Briarwoods. And uber Percy fangirl. That's me. Cheers.
Laura: Ooh! Nice, nice!
Matt: All right, Liam.
Liam: Hi, Hi. I am Tyriok. I make maps.
Sam: Why are you having trouble picking that up?
Liam: Oh, well. I was turned to stone recently and I don't have two arms anymore. I have one. I can still roll dice though and I have maps and I have a compass and I am the least dangerous person at the tables. I'm not level one in anything, really, except maps. I'm level 15 in maps. I'm just happy to be here and be alive. Mostly.
Laura: We've been opening doors for him all night.
Matt: Thank you, Liam. That's awesome. Laura!
Laura: I'm Lady Briarwood. Here with the man I broke the world for.
Travis: You broke it for me, baby.
Laura: That's right. You should say who you are.
Travis: Oh right. I'm Lord Briarwood.
Laura: Nice!
Travis: Yeah. Undead. Betrothed.
Laura: That's right. More than betrothed.
Liam: Do you know, people who are in love high five?
Travis: We be representing the dead motherfuckers in this game.
Laura: I'm not dead.
Travis: Are you not?
Laura: No, man.
Liam: Just inside.
Laura: Just inside.
Marisha: Actually, me and Travis are the only dead ones.
Laura: I guess. Well, I am dead. No, I am dead.
Liam: Currently dead, but you weren't undead.
Laura: Exactly. I misunderstood.
Matt: You're both dead. You're destroyed. You're dead. You're somewhere--
Sam: I'm in another plane of existence probably.
Matt: Yeah, you're having a real rough week right now is what you're having.
Liam: My arm is dead.
Laura: You're the only person alive.
Liam: Cheers.
Laura: And you of course.
Matt: (as Victor) Parts of me. (laughter and cheering)
Matt: (as Victor) What?
Laura: Cheers, Victor!
Travis: Yeah, cheers. Salut, bitches! (cheering)
All: Happy Halloween! (laughter)
Travis: I can't breathe.
Liam: So that's it. That's the show.
Matt: Yeah. Thanks guys, thanks for coming. We shall get into our announcements for the evening. I need my hand to do that. This is, by the way, pre-finger loss Victor. As I know there will be some purists out there like, why does he have all his fingers on his right hand? Matt, you're so inaccurate to your own character.
Travis: Wow.
Matt: All right, so first and foremost, tonight's episode is sponsored by Loot Crate.
Travis: Loot Crate! (cheering)
Laura: Get your maps off the table, Tyriok.
Liam: Sorry.
Matt: We've got an unboxing to do here with their last theme here. But before we get to that, Sam did you want to--
Sam: I wanted to say guys that this month's theme for Loot Crate is magic. And I don't have much planned for tonight, but I did learn a magic trick. I'm going to do a magic trick. It's my first magic trick I've ever done. And I don't have a deck of cards at home, so I'm going to use spell cards instead. I'm going to give it a little shuffle here. Oh, hey there, cowboy.
Travis: Oh, please let something come out of your mouth.
Sam: Taliesin, can you give it a shuffle?
Taliesin: I'll give it a shuffle. Liam, do you want to shuffle?
Liam: Sure, I've got it. We got 30 minutes, right?
Sam: Get ready for November's enchanting theme Magical! We've cast a powerful, ancient spell to deliver you this 100% exclusive crate. Featuring bewitching items from Doctor Strange, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, Big Trouble in Little China. And more! Use the promo link: lootcrate.com/criticalrole.
Matt: Marvel as Sam slowly becomes Bill Cosby. (Cosby impression) You see!
Liam: No, no, no, you can't take that back!
Sam: I'm going to show Taliesin that these are, in fact, randomly shuffled cards. Can you please give the card deck a little cut anywhere you'd like. I'm going to look at this half of the card deck and it'll tell me what's in the other half of the card deck. Okay. I know, Taliesin, by looking at that, that the fourth card down is See Invisibility.
Taliesin: The fourth card down.
Sam: The fourth card down is See Invisibility.
Taliesin: So, this card here will be--
Sam: Will be See Invisibility!
Taliesin: It's like Nicholas Cage as a cat. It is, in fact, See Invisibility! (cheering)
Sam: The most magical part of this trick is is that it makes me a quadruple threat: Actor! Singer! Professional Lover of Ladies! And now, Professional Magician. Thank you, Loot Crate. (cheering)
Taliesin: Remarkable Nicholas Cage impersonator, too, it's really amazing.
Sam: My mouth hurts so much right now.
Matt: Thank you, Sam. Thank you, Loot Crate! Yeah, open your Loot Crates.
Laura: These are from October. These are not the current ones.
Taliesin: These are not the magic theme.
Marisha: No, it's the horror theme.
Sam: This is what everyone should be getting this month.
Laura: Okay, that's the coolest.
Travis: Are those Freddy Kruger chopsticks?
Laura: Yes, I think.
Matt: That's pretty badass.
Marisha: Little chibi Leatherface!
Travis: Of all the things you thought could never be cute. Leatherface.
Marisha: Little Leatherface.
Laura: I have to see if these are actually usable or not.
Matt: Negan shirt.
Liam: Got it! It's off!
Matt: Well done, Liam, well done.
Travis: Camp Crystal Lake.
Sam: Ooh, a little pennant. My son will love that, big fan of the movie.
Liam: I'm going to wear this for my kids all the time.
Matt: Regrettable Supervillains.
Taliesin: Too soon, guys, too soon. Just too soon.
Travis: Preying Mantis man. Cat Girl.
Taliesin: Camp Crystal Lake, oh that makes me happy.
Sam: These chopsticks are amazing.
Laura: The chopsticks are awesome, but don't try to pick up metal dice with them because they're way too heavy.
Liam: Don't eat metal dice.
Laura: Don't eat metal dice.
Travis: Ooh, the Walking Dead t-shirt. I call dibs on this next week!
Matt: There you go. Thank you very much, Loot Crate, for sponsoring us. You can go to lootcrate.com/criticalrole.
Travis: Promo code "criticalrole."
Liam: Beginner's luck.
Laura: That's right.
Travis: Good job.
Taliesin: That one's going to fail you every time, now.
Matt: That would have been impressive. Next up, let's see. GM Tips. We now have the second episode that just went up on YouTube. They go up a couple of days early on Alpha if you want to check that out. The most recent episode deals with improvisation, dealing with the unexpected. I'm a big fan of this new run. We get to go a little more in-depth with the elements of running your own games at home. So, if you're a GM, check them out. They come out every week, we have new ones coming out for the next six or so weeks. I can't remember how many episodes we did. So, for a while, so every week, a new one coming. Alpha on Tuesdays or Wednesdays, and then on Thursdays on YouTube, so check that out. Next up here we have Titanfall 2 came out!
Travis: Titanfall 2!
Matt: It's fun. I play Jack Cooper, your protagonist in the single-player campaign. It's basically a future buddy cop film with a giant robot.
Travis: You sound sexy in that, man. Just saying.
Matt: Thank you.
Laura: You do!
Travis: High noon!
Matt: (as Victor) It's how I like it! I'm like this the entire game!
Travis: That's a whole different Titanfall.
Liam: I'm in there too! I've returned from the first game as Barker and I will yell at you if you're in my faction. Damn, that's got some weight to it, son! Mmm!
Marisha: At least a d8.
Liam: (explosion noise)
Matt: And that was the end of Tyriok.
Liam: (as Tyriok) I shot something else off!
Matt: (laughs) Oh god.
Travis: Oh yeah! Telltale's Batman episode three came out. I really like the way that's going. Fun.
Laura: There's some good stuff happening in that episode.
Liam: Who is this Batman character?
Matt: Next up, our Critical Role Halloween costume contest finishes next week. Halloween night is the last time to submit so if you have a Halloween costume if you haven't finished yet, get it finished, put up some photos with the hashtag #criticalcostumes on Twitter. We will be judging those in the coming week and giving you guys prizes and rewards and all the silliness that we can try and produce for you because we're excited. So many good things are already out there. You guys have been crazy!
Laura: Yeah. There's been some really phenomenal--
Sam: Can I enter the contest as this?
Matt: I believe you already have, and you can win all of your shirts back.
Sam: Oh shit! Then I do not want to do that. (laughter)
Matt: Fantastic. Marisha. There is a new Signal Boost episode.
Marisha: Oh yeah! Both the Signal Boost Halloween episodes are out. And Taliesin and I are in them. And you make a cameo in the latest episode.
Matt: I stare at a mirror. It's fun.
Marisha: Yeah. Go watch for Halloween.
Matt: Travis. How about Talks Machina?
Travis: Yes! We are super excited about this one. Starting November 15th and every Tuesday after on Alpha we will finally get to introduce Talks Machina which is our Critical Role talk show. Hosted by our amazing friend Brian Wayne Foster. You can follow him at Brian Wayne Foster something something.
Marisha: It's like @brianwfoster.
Travis: @brianwfoster. And you can also catch the Talks Machina page on Twitter @talksmachina. You can also get early access if you go to alphainvite.com for early access to the page. We're going to be on there; it's our chance to give insight after the game. It'll be a weekly thing so we can answer questions that people might have, talk about moments that happened, how it went well, how it didn't, how we suck. There will always be a few of us on there every week, we might even have some guests, and some segments! It's going to be awesome. It's something we've been wanting to do for a while--
Laura: Yeah. And Brian's a really awesome guy so we're excited about it.
Marisha: Yeah. You guys are going to love him. He is great.
Matt: Brian is awesome.
Travis: Yeah. Hai!
Matt: Hai! That's all the major business announcements. The final announcement, for those who weren't paying attention to social media. Yeah. Take your glove off.
Marisha: Oh!
Travis: Take it off! Take that glove off!
Taliesin: We're doing that.
Sam: That's no fake hand!
Travis: That ring better be there!
Marisha: He put a ring on it! (cheering)
Liam: Applause, applause, applause!
Marisha: I have that to look forward to in my later years.
Matt: (as Victor) So excited!
Laura: Congratulations!
Liam: I mean, he doesn't have to take it off!
Matt: (as Victor) Only parts of it.
Sam: Are we going to do a Critical Role themed wedding?
Travis: Oh my god.
Marisha: No. No.
Matt: That's not going to be a thing. But we have already decided on our date.
Marisha: Although I might still have Travis Willingham as my flower girl. Doing the dust of tracelessness.
Travis: I would be honored.
Taliesin: So cute!
Sam: I'll start writing my Best Man speech. It'll be a song.
Matt: All the limericks in one.
Liam: Delivered in tiger?
Sam: Yes. Delivered in tiger makeup.
Matt: You've now done a tiger outfit twice. Two different tigers. All right. On that note, let's go ahead and dive in to tonight's episode of Halloween Critical Role. [dramatic music]
Matt: Welcome back. As we last left off, our band of adventurers, Vox Machina, were in the process of formulating their plan of attack against the Chroma Conclave, a group of chromatic dragons that had banded together under their king, a massive-sized red dragon that sundered the Tal'Dorei countryside and currently sits on the main city of Emon. You have traversed multiple planes of the world and have gathered these various artifacts called the Vestiges of Divergence in preparation for this battle, honing your skills. You guys, after finally defeating your third member of the Conclave and allying with a fourth, Raishan, you defeated Vorugal, the white dragon, over in the ruins of Draconia in Wildemount. You are now returning, after gathering the spoils of the fight, making your way to the next leg of your journey, to the very, very fast approaching conflict with the Cinder King himself. And that's where we begin. Last we left off in the middle of a nearby frozen forest, Percival and Vex, probably a fair distance of time apart make your-- no. (laughter)
Liam: That's "later."
Matt: Jumped the gun.
Liam: Matt, I don't know how we're going to do this. I got to look right at you.
Laura: Look directly below. Maybe stare at his eyes.
Liam: I'm going to look at the torch over his right shoulder. (laughter)
Travis: He's missing so many teeth!
Liam: We got to go shopping or drinking or something, nothing serious for the love of Sarenrae.
Matt: So! As you guys reconvene towards Scanlan's Magnificent Mansion to prepare for the next leg of your journey, what do you wish to do?
Sam: Wait, we're in the Mansion right now?
Laura: No, we're at the top of the ravine.
Taliesin: We're preparing to go through a portal.
Matt: Correct, you guys are. So you've gathered to go ahead and make--
Laura: Did you want to sleep before we went back to Whitestone?
Marisha: No, I can go. Yeah, no. It's been eight hours, I've done my thing?
Matt: Yes, for the restoring some of the farmland, yeah. Which as you complete the entirety of the spell, you watch as the rest of the snow melt begins to turn to water, and you watch as the land itself grows more fertile and the crops begin to pop forth. Like you began to see when the ritual initiated itself. With the completion of the land cleansed, you are free to go to the next length of your journey.
Marisha: Sorry.
Taliesin: Stop, I can't make eye contact. I'm sorry, it's okay. We'll get there.
Laura: I think you look great, Matt.
Liam: You look like Doc Brown exploded, I don't know what to do.
Taliesin: Pat that tuft of hair down.
Matt: Marty! Okay. Happy Halloween.
Liam: 30 more minutes, 30 more minutes and we'll settle down.
Marisha: You have to get immune to it.
Liam: I would like to set the Deathwalker's Ward to Matthew's costume.
Matt: All right, you take a short rest to set your-- (laughs).
Liam: That's from Vasselheim.
Matt: What else do you guys wish to do? What's the next step in your journey?
Sam: I mean we got to go back to Whitestone, right away? Is there anything else to do here? Is there anything to deliver, any piece of any body to take with us? Anything? We got everything already?
Laura: We need to deliver Ripley's arm back in Ank'Harel.
Sam: Okay.
Laura: That needs to happen.
Sam: Sure.
Laura: Kashaw's in Vasselheim.
Sam: Sure.
Laura: We need to do something about him.
Marisha: He might be in Whitestone by now.
Laura: He might be back. He might be on his way here.
Travis: He's a dick, he can take care of himself.
Laura: Hopefully, he won't just loose something on the Ravenites here.
Sam: Let's get out of here.
Marisha: They've been through so much.
Liam: I mean it's really reconfirming his whole life-view so, you know. Hi!
Laura: Hi!
Travis: I'm having trouble.
Sam: All right. Keyleth! Cast your thing and let's get the fuck out of here.
Laura: Let's get on to Whitestone. Get on getting on.
Marisha: I'm coming, boo.
Matt: As you focus and touch the outside of the tree, you watch as this small, familiar portal begins to tear its way through the outer bark of the nearby trunk. From there, as you reach through the magic creating this portal between you and Whitestone, you hear the voice echo in the distance, "I hear you." And thus, the temporary doorway between here and Whitestone is open. The rest of you guys rush through, with Kima and Pike in tow, you make your way into Whitestone itself. At this point in time, it looks like it's fairly late in the afternoon. It's still day here, that's a day, eight hours there. Actually no, it would be pretty early morning by here. At this point, you step out and the sky is starting to come to light. You see the blue slowly transitioning into a light orange to a yellow as the sunrise is making its way over the mountain range that surrounds the outside of Whitestone. You're met with a few wandering guards that wander through the town that acknowledge your presence, but it is your call as to what you wish to do now.
Sam: Does the town look like it's safe and intact?
Matt: It seems like it hasn't suffered any sort of incursion or attack, yeah.
Sam: Okay, yeah. That's good.
Marisha: We've only been gone for what? 24 hours?
Laura: No, like two days because we slept there.
Taliesin: About two days.
Marisha: I'm going to go check and see if I can find Kash.
Taliesin: Also going to head towards the castle. And we should drop off some of our spoils.
Laura: Our loot.
Travis: Where? Where do we drop them off at?
Laura: The castle?
Taliesin: I would imagine the treasury room is where it can be.
Matt: There is a treasury vault in the Whitestone castle.
Travis: Oh. Cool. Yeah. Totally knew about that place.
Matt: All right, Pike says she's going to go and check in with the temple and make sure everything there is taken care of and situated. Kima leaves with you guys towards the Whitestone castle. As you make your way up, you get to the very outside of the castle at the time the sunrise finally breaks the mountain range and you see the sun coming in. What little bit of mist begins to slowly burn off of the surrounding forested area. The cold, brisk morning air is immediately met with that warm ray of sun hitting you and it's welcoming both to be returning to a place of comfort but also the transition into day itself is a very warm and welcoming experience. As you step towards the front, there are four guards at the front gate. They step aside to let you in. As you step into the main foyer of the area, you already see a familiar sight. You see there waiting, arms crossed, leaning against the wall, Seeker Asum.
Laura: Scars still on the face?
Matt: Yeah, still acid-pocked scar across the right side, ruining the tattooed face. The rest of the castle seems relatively quiet at this time, as it is very early.
Marisha: She's the only one-- he's the only one there?
Matt: Within the actual foyer of the castle, yes, the main entrance area. As you guys begin to step inside, Seeker Asum steps in your direction. Steps in your direction, and Kima is already taking a brisk walk in that direction and goes, pointing outward toward Seeker Asum. "Now--"
Marisha: I grab Kima by the wrist. Not right now, maybe?
Matt: "Now you told me you'd already met with a creature. This is the--" At which point, Seeker Asum's hands rest on to Kima's shoulder. Kima's head whips around to face Asum, and Asum says, "You need not worry."
Sam: He's going to try a thing on her.
Laura: She hates that!
Sam: She doesn't like it.
Marisha: Oh no.
Taliesin: He's going to the sheets.
Matt: Kima's eyes blink for a moment and she--
Marisha: No no no no no no. I still have my hands on Kima, right?
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: I counter with a 6th-level Dispel Magic. Can I do that?
Matt: You can certainly try.
Marisha: Fuck.
Matt: All right, so as you begin to--
Laura: Oh no, we're going to start a fight, that's going to start a fight.
Marisha: I don't want her to fucking cast any shit on Kima.
Travis: What if it was just a chill out spell?
Marisha: It's probably a charm spell. Or a memory spell. No, I don't want to fucking wait--
Matt: It's not a Counterspell, but you can try to cast it on her to see if it has any effect.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: All righty, so the DC of the spell-- okay. So, as you pull back and begin chanting to yourself, clutching Kima and pulling her away from Asum, Asum's grip leaves Kima's shoulder and Kima's still shaking her head groggily. You finish the Dispel Magic and you feel the strange, warm pulse of energy radiate briefly out from Kima's body. Kima turns to look at you and goes, "What-- why would-- I'm sorry, I went groggy there for a second. We've had a long day. Good to see you, Asum." And Asum nods and says, "Well, the pleasure is mine. Glad to see you all made it back safe and sound."
Sam: Yes we did. Thank you, Asum.
Matt: "We have a meeting set here in the next two hours to gather our information and best situate the next plan of action. You also have a friend waiting for you. Your armored Kashaw returned but a half day ago apparently. Sleeping at the moment should you be interested in waking him from his slumber and notifying him of his, well, his services no longer being needed."
Travis: Did he return alone?
Matt: "He did. And rather proud with his findings."
Laura: Oh shit. Where are you off to now?
Matt: "Oh, I'm here waiting for the meeting."
Laura: Lovely.
Marisha: And who all is going to be a part of this meeting?
Matt: "As far as I know, it's going to be myself, Cassandra, Allura, and Drake."
Laura: Oh, good! Allura, we haven't seen her in forever. Have we?
Sam: We saw her pretty recently.
Laura: We did. Shit. Yes, we did. Never mind.
Sam: All right. Well then, until the meeting?
Matt: "Until the meeting. Now, food should be ready." And Asum steps out into the sunshine and closes his eyes, takes a deep breath as the sun rays hit and looks over his shoulder, smiles, and continues to walk down the path in towards Whitestone itself.
Sam: We can kill him right here, right now!
Marisha: (groans)
Travis: No, no. (coughs)
Matt: Kima takes a couple steps and says, "Wow, I'm more tired than I expected after that fight. Then again, we did kill a dragon! And that is fantastic!"
Travis: We did. Yeah. And you got a brilliant new sword.
Matt: Which she pulls out and (swish). You can see the arc of light streak across the blade as she flings it in the air with incredible strength for a halfling of her size. She's still marveled by it. "You know what? I'm not going to sleep. I'm going to go practice!" And she goes and runs off down one of the hallways towards one of the castle's training rooms.
Travis: Wait, Kima, Kima! You don't hear anything when you use that, do you? Like voices or someone talking to you or--
Matt: She holds the blade up to her ear. "No."
Travis: No, good! Good. It's a beginner problem, but you're quite advanced. Not worried about it. Enjoy!
Matt: "Thanks, Grog!" Slaps you on the shoulder with an awkward glance and continues the excited steps forward into vanishing somewhere into the castle.
Travis: The sword is clean.
Laura: Good job.
Travis: Yeah. Dodged a bullet on that one!
Laura: We should put that hide in the Treasury.
Travis: Hide?
Laura: The 140 pounds of dragonhide you're carrying right now?
Travis: Oh right! I'm dragging it behind me.
Laura: Yeah.
Travis: Yeah. Right.
Taliesin: Like a body in a carpet.
Travis: Well, I'm off to deposit this hide!
Sam: Good object work!
Travis: Yeah. Boy, I'm going to need to switch shoulders! Getting a little roll in the ol' righty there.
Marisha: Keyleth grabs Vax as they wander off and pulls him behind the rest of the crowd.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Let's go.
Liam: Where?
Marisha: Let's track Raishan.
Liam: All right.
Marisha: Let's track her. Let's just do it right now. Let's kill her. We can do it, she won't be expecting it. We can find her.
Liam: I pull her further away. She won't expect it, but she is a fucking ancient being.
Marisha: But she's sick and she-- We can do it right now. When she's not armed.
Liam: Keyleth, I want to kill a dragon as much as you do.
Marisha: It's not about killing a dragon, it's about killing her.
Liam: I know, but we want it to work. We want her to die. And if you and I do it, it's not going to happen. Her being sick is still up here. We need the others. I really want to use both my arms to take her, but I can't. I take her by the arms. And we need the others. If I thought we could do it-- Listen to me. I love you, and if you ask me again, I will go with you. But I don't think it will work. I think you and I will die. I think Raishan will spit on our bodies. You will not get what you want. And then Thordak won't die. No one will be happy. I understand--
Marisha: I just want this to be over.
Liam: I want this to be over.
Marisha: Okay.
Liam: We need to stay with the others; there's--
Marisha: Okay. Okay. I understand.
Liam: Listen to me; if you tell me to go in, I will go in. But there's strength with the others. After this, if you tell me to go in, you say the word. It's not like I haven't tried to throw my life away already. You think I wouldn't do it for you?
Marisha: I feel like it's very telling when Grog has more patience than I. (sighs) Okay.
Liam: Hey. It'll happen.
Marisha: I just don't want to wait so long that she gets the upper hand on us. The longer we wait, the more she learns about us. The more we're letting her in, the more we're revealing. I feel like the longer we wait, the closer is her inevitable betrayal.
Liam: Pulls her in and touch foreheads. I don't think we're going to be waiting for long; I really don't.
Marisha: Okay. Let's catch up with the others.
Liam: Yeah. Yeah.
Matt: The rest of you, what have you been up to?
Sam: I pull Percy aside and say, we can kill her right now.
Liam: Ugh! It's a tiger!
Taliesin: Well?
Sam: Well, we got to go to the treasury.
Taliesin: We have to go to the treasury.
Sam: And then what? Who do we need to check in with? Everyone, right? Gilmore and Kash and--
Laura: We've got a couple hours.
Taliesin: We have a couple hours. We need to talk to people. We need to find out where this meeting's being held, if it's being held downstairs or if it's being held in the battle room.
Laura: It won't be if Asum has anything to say about it.
Taliesin: Well, maybe he won't.
Sam: And what is this meeting? I know that we have to have a conversation with Asum.
Marisha: Yeah, but what is this about?
Taliesin: This meeting may be the beginning of something very violent or this may be the start of something; I don't know. But be prepared perhaps that this meeting may be on moment.
Travis: (singing) Be prepared.
Taliesin: Don't think about it. Don't plan. Don't have any thoughts in your head.
Laura: Improvise. We're good at that.
Taliesin: You can't lie about anything. Do not lie to her about anything. And one of the ways we can lie best is by truthfully saying we have no plans against her right now because we have no plans against her right now. The more we talk, the more she will be able to perceive our deceptions, if we have any. Be very careful. This is going to be very dangerous. There's going to be a lot of improvisation.
Laura: I hate knowing that she's going to be able to hear all of our plans.
Marisha: (sighs)
Taliesin: Honestly, we should have assumed that they could hear all of our plans from the beginning.
Laura: Yes.
Taliesin: (sighs) My fault, really. Well, we are very good at being spied on.
Sam: Yes, well, we like to talk.
Taliesin: And even if we do, even if we were to get rid of her, there's no sense in believing that they still don't know everything we're doing.
Sam: All right. Then we'll see what he proposes and take it from there.
Taliesin: And let's hope that we're downstairs, and if we're not downstairs, there's still options.
Laura: All right.
Matt: Grog, you've finally caught up with the group. You've managed to drop off your large amount of dragon hide in return.
Travis: Holy shit, that skin weighs a ton. Good thing I'm strong as fuck. What'd I miss?
Sam: Is there a cold place in the treasure room? Wait, this hide is going to be cured, or smoked, or something, whatever you do. Stretched?
Laura: It's got scales all over it. I mean that stays, right? It doesn't have to be kept cold?
Matt: I mean, it probably should be.
Laura: Kept cold.
Matt: It probably should be attended to in a short amount of time, like in the next week or so, before it's really--
Laura: Would it be an armorer, or a blacksmith, or-- who works with dragonhide?
Sam: Taliesin, what's the old fashioned word for the guy who does the hide stuff?
Liam: Tanner.
Sam: A tanner! Thank you!
Laura: Is there a tanner in Whitestone?
Taliesin: One would assume we have a tanner in Whitestone.
Matt: There are a few tanners, yeah.
Travis: Is it super cold where I dropped off the hide? Like is it below ground?
Matt: It's below ground. Yeah, it's not--
Travis: A bit chilly?
Matt: Comparatively. Whitestone in general is a pretty chilly place, so yeah.
Sam: But not like a fake-bake. We want a real tanner, right?
Liam: Hey, while they're talking about all this, can I stealth away?
Matt: Yes, you can. Make a stealth check.
Liam: I'll use Luck. 28.
Matt: What was that?
Liam: 28.
Matt: 28. Okay, yeah. You vanish without anybody else noticing your disappearance.
Liam: I would like to go as quickly as I can towards Gilmore's house.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: He's cheating on you, Keyleth.
Marisha: (laughs) Look, it's 2016.
Travis: Did we decide what we do about Raish--?
Laura: (shushing)
Taliesin: Seeker Asum?
Travis: Yeah.
Taliesin: We're going to talk, we're going to listen, and we're going to be prepared for anything.
Travis: Okay, so we're not (death noises and farts)?
Laura: Not just yet.
Taliesin: We're going to talk, we're going to listen, and be prepared for anything.
Sam: Was that last sound the sound of Seeker Asum's bowels?
Travis: It's open to interpretation.
Sam: Okay. After he dies, letting it all out?
Travis: Yeah. Just want to be fancy. I lean that way but, you know. Cannot speak for other people.
Taliesin: The work speaks for itself, really.
Matt: Fair enough. Vax, as you rush down towards the homestead that Gilmore had made here in Whitestone, the door is closed. There's a large pile out front of ruined furniture that's been jammed into this collection. Presumably from the last encounter they had when the incursion of assassins made their way in. But the door's closed, and seemingly locked.
Liam: (knocks)
Matt: A few moments pass, no response. (Mario coin sound)
Liam: That's him, that's magic!
Matt: But you find a cool coin.
Liam: (knocks)
Matt: Yeah. Eventually you hear a little rustling, and you hear a voice, muffled, from the upper floor say, "Confound it, I'll be right down!"
Liam: I'm so scared of this with that hair on your head.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: You hear some footsteps, and then eventually the door (unlocking sound). You hear the unlocking mechanism. The door swings open a little bit. And you see, you know, morning robe, chest open, curly chest hair poking out. A very groggy bedhead. Gilmore opens the door. "Yes, can I help-- Oh. Good morning." (laughter)
Travis: I don't know what to do.
Liam: Why did I do this? Tonight?
Marisha: Now you know why.
Liam: Hey, this is not fair. Can I come in to talk? Quickly, I have to head back to the others.
Matt: "Of course. Would you like some tea?"
Liam: No. I don't even have time, I just want to talk to you.
Matt: "I'd like some tea. Come on in, come on in."
Liam: All right.
Matt: He ushers you to enter, and leads you to one of the small chairs. And he walks back into the kitchen, shouting over his shoulder, "So! Vax'ildan, please. Tell me what's on your mind."
Liam: You know, we're getting closer to the end game here.
Matt: (laughs) "I certainly hope so. It's taken a couple years off my lifespan."
Liam: We just killed another one of the dragons.
Matt: "Really?!"
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: "How many is that for you now? Three?"
Liam: It is three.
Matt: "Making a name for yourself. I'm proud of you." A few moments pass, and silence. And Gilmore walks back out, clutching a small tray with a few teacups. And as he's walking, he's twirling his finger and you can see a little spiral of flame encircling the tea kettle as it begins to heat up. He brings it over, sets it down on the table. Pulls his robe in and sits down across from you on this low slung tea table. Takes a bit and sips it. "So, what brings you here this early in the morning, friend?"
Liam: I think I might be dead in a couple of days. So I came here to apologize. If you think I have no feelings for you, you're kidding yourself. I care for you very deeply. I have for a long time. And I don't think I've treated you fairly. But I wasn't playing games. Shaun. It's been a little weird lately, and I understand why, but I want you to know that I love you as a dear, dear friend, and I really don't think I'm going to be here in a few days. And I would hate to think that I would be--
Matt: "Shh. That's far too fatalistic for the Vax'ildan that I-- number one. Number two, you have nothing to apologize for. Look, everything's on fire around us all the time. We all jump at whatever bit of comfort finds its way before us. And at the same time, I appreciate your honesty. And I'm thankful for the connection that we do have. And yes, heartbreak comes. But heartbreak goes. It's part of life. It just means that I need to find somebody who's a little more my speed."
Liam: That guy'll be fast.
Matt: "He better be. Don't worry about it. Go. Kill a dragon. Another. Kill two more. Kill six more, I don't care! Just know that you're coming back, because I need you and your friends to keep pimping out my name."
Liam: Sure. Whoever gets you will be a very lucky man.
Matt: "I know. I know."
Liam: Love you.
Matt: "I know. You sure you don't want any tea?"
Liam: I'm really nauseous right now. I almost didn't come here.
Matt: "I'm glad you did." He takes your cup. "Waste not, want not. (sips) Now go! Stop being uncomfortable in front of me! I need to get my morning--"
Liam: Yeah. Yes.
Matt: "--situated."
Liam: Goodbye.
Matt: He stands there. Waves his hand and the door opens on its own.
Liam: I leave.
Matt: He takes you by the shoulder real fast before you leave, and turns around and goes, "'Till next time. Say it."
Liam: 'Till next time.
Matt: "All right. Go." And you feel a little pat on your backside, on the way out. He sits there holding his tea, watching you leave. Door slams behind you. You make your way back.
Liam: I'm sorry I made you do that in that skullcap, Matt.
Matt: Look, I don't have to look at this. I'm fine! (laughter)
Matt: From my perspective, this is easy.
Liam: All I saw was a very handsome man. (laughter)
Travis: Training. This is all training. It's training at a thousand times gravity.
Matt: (laughs) It totally is! Like performing arts with the weights on.
Liam: Been doing this since the 80s and 90s, man.
Laura: We need to find Kashaw. Before the meeting, yes?
Marisha: Yeah, I set off. To find Kashaw with Vex.
Matt: All right. Asking around quickly, he is back in the room where he's been staying in Whitestone. You go back to his door. It's closed.
Marisha: (knocks)
Laura: Kash?
Matt: Nothing.
Laura: (loudly) Are you sleeping?
Matt: Nothing.
Sam: Break down the door.
Marisha: Kash?
Laura: I'm going to jiggle the lock. Is it locked?
Matt: It's not locked.
Laura: I open it. Just a crack, and look in.
Marisha: I hope you're not naked!
Laura: Shh.
Matt: As you open it up, there's no light on the inside, but the light does come in as you slowly open the door with a (squeaks). You can see he's halfway out of his armor, passed out on his back, on the bed. He's one arm out, snoring loudly like he was too tired to make it all the way, and (snores).
Laura: Should we let him sleep or should we talk to him?
Marisha: I don't know.
Laura: He snores.
Marisha: Wow.
Laura: You know, my brother doesn't snore.
Marisha: No, I know.
Travis: Ew.
Marisha: No, I mean I don't--
Laura: No, just don't, just don't.
Marisha: Just don't worry about it. (laughter)
Taliesin: I love you, Travis.
Liam: You thought I'd be the one to fuck up. (laughter)
Laura: Do I have any like stones or any like rocks or anything in my bag or--
Marisha: You're going to throw a rock at him?
Laura: Yeah, just to see if he wakes up.
Marisha: We can't just poke him? That seems so weird, though.
Sam: You're an archer.
Laura: Well, I don't want to kill him.
Marisha: Why don't we just tap on his shoulder?
Laura: I'll sneak in, tap his shoulder, come back out, see if he wakes up.
Marisha: Oh, that's what I want to do.
Laura: I don't want him to know that, you know--
Marisha: That we did that? Sure. I'll stand on the outside and look unsuspecting.
Laura: I want to sneak in and tickle his little foot and walk out.
Matt: Well, he still has his boots on.
Laura: Shit.
Matt: It's more like his upper torso, he got partway out of that.
Laura: All right, I tickle his hands.
Matt: Okay so you're opening his palm--
Laura: Tickle his hands and then go back really fast to the doorway.
Matt: Okay, you tickle his hand. No response.
Laura: Fucking--
Matt: (snores)
Laura: I flick his nose.
Matt: As soon as you flick his nose and you start to back away, there's a blur of motion as suddenly he comes leaping out of the bed (grunts) and goes over and grabs his spear, his hand reaches for nothing in the air, and slings it forward in your direction, (whoosh) bypassing by your face by a few inches. And he looks still half awake, going (startled noises).
Marisha: Oh Kash, oh hi. Fancy meeting you here. Shit.
Matt: "Yeah, it's my room."
Marisha: I keep doing that.
Laura: I know; it's awkward.
Laura: Hi.
Marisha: Hi.
Matt: "Hi." And he throws his spear to the side.
Laura: Oh good, I was wondering if--
Marisha: Yeah, I hope we didn't-- I hope you weren't sleeping.
Matt: "I hope I wasn't either. Sure, all right, I'm glad you're here because it took me a long-ass time to get here." And he sits up in the bed and-- or he sits down back on the bed and reaches over and pulls out one of his packs and brings out a couple of rolls of paper. "Okay, so I talked to Vanessa and got two contracts that we could take up for this."
Laura: Okay.
Matt: "We got one here," and he pulls it out, "This is for two indigenous creatures to the region that you were talking about over by Wildemount. One is a purple worm matron."
Laura: Ooh, that sounds big.
Matt: "Supposedly. Shit's dangerous. Careful. This one is for a Storm Giant. This one is a little harder to get a hold of apparently."
Laura: They're so hard to get a hold of. We should probably focus on the other one.
Marisha: Mm-hmm.
Laura: Unless Vorugal's already dead.
Marisha: Yeah, wouldn't that be crazy if he was already dead?
Laura: What would we do with these contracts if he is? Just wondering about that.
Matt: "Get out of my room."
Marisha: Kash.
Matt: "Just get out."
Marisha: Kash.
Matt: "Get out of my room."
Marisha: Look--
Laura: Your help has been--
Marisha: Not overlooked.
Matt: "Out. Of my room."
Laura: We should probably go.
Marisha: We should probably go.
Laura: Do you want these back--
Matt: "Out of my room."
Laura: I'm going to set them down on the ground.
Matt: "Out of my room."
Marisha: You know, we could--
Matt: "Get out of my room."
Laura: By the way, you might want to get like a mouthguard or something because you snore a little.
Matt: You leave him in silence and darkness. (yelling) "Out of my room!"
Laura: Keyleth, we should go.
Marisha: Okay. Okay. We'll see you later.
Laura: Keyleth.
Marisha: What?
Laura: Come here.
Marisha: Okay.
Laura: And I take her around a corner. He kissed me.
Marisha: Kash?
Laura: No! God no! Percy!
Marisha: Like right now?
Laura: Percival!
Marisha: Did I miss something?
Laura: No.
Marisha: What? Percy?
Laura: Yeah!
Marisha: (squeals)
Laura: I know.
Marisha: That's good, right?
Laura: I mean I know you guys are like--
Marisha: No!
Laura: Pretty close and I don't know if that's weird.
Marisha: Why are you asking me?
Laura: I don't know, you're like his sister, kind of.
Marisha: He's not my twin brother.
Laura: This is true. How are things with you and Vax? Thanks for bringing it up. Is it good?
Marisha: I still worry if you care.
Laura: I care; of course I care.
Marisha: Yeah, you say that.
Laura: I hug her. Well not your antlers in my face.
Marisha: Oh, sorry, sorry, that happens a lot. I'm very happy for you.
Laura: Hey thanks. We should go look at the treasury.
Marisha: Okay, let's go to the treasury. We should go victory shopping.
Laura: Oh my god.
Marisha: Yeah.
Laura: Do you think he'd mind if we-- I mean we have so much money, we don't even need to do that.
Marisha: I mean it's basically our money, though, right?
Laura: Yeah. No. It's--
Marisha: Yeah. Okay.
Matt: All right, so you guys wander your way off--
Marisha: You know, Vex, I feel like you might be a bad or good influence on me. I'm not sure, but I like it.
Laura: It's all good.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: Scanlan, Grog, Percival. What are you guys doing?
Taliesin: Life is failing the Bechdel Test so hard right now.
Marisha: Yeah.
Laura: So bad.
Taliesin: Sorry. (laughs) Carry on.
Laura: Sometimes they do talk about boys.
Marisha: They are like 50% of--
Taliesin: No, I did not see that coming.
Travis: We don't really need to like check in with anything.
Sam: You mean do you have the gold?
Travis: Well I mean I-- yeah.
Sam: We should probably divvy it up, don't you think?
Travis: What? What? What?
Taliesin: No, no, no.
Travis: But it's really a lot to hold onto your person. I mean, it's a bag of gold--
Sam: No, but we should all replenish our personal--
Taliesin: You can have some pocket money, but--
Sam: Yes, yes, yes.
Travis: Yeah. How much do you want? You don't have it. I have it.
Sam: 5000. We have hundreds.
Travis: Yeah, if you want 5000. Do you have good credit?
Sam: Do I have good credit?
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: I've never misspent a single coin.
Travis: Can I have your last four pay stubs, please? (laughter)
Sam: Here's two of them right here.
Travis: Hey! That's good enough! Have 5000 gold!
Matt: As Grog gives you 5000 gold, which weighs roughly a hundred pounds--
Sam: Shit!
Matt: It weighs more than you do.
Laura: 5000 gold is a hundred pounds?
Travis: And it's probably about 1000 because I can't count to 5000.
Matt: Yeah. He starts divvying it out until it's like larger than you in a pile in the center of the room.
Taliesin: Well what are you going to do with it?
Sam: All right, all right. I'm going to give some back.
Travis: Are you really?
Sam: Why don't you give me ten platinum.
Taliesin: No! Absolutely--
Sam: (chuckles) It's the same! It's the same!
Travis: Why not?
Liam: Ten platinum?
Taliesin: Ten platinum is an awful lot.
Travis: But he can carry ten. That's easier.
Liam: Sure.
Travis: Hold on, let me consult Blackstone.
Liam: Ten or ten thousand?
Taliesin: (stage whisper) Don't do it!
Travis: Yep. Stoneblack says it's all right.
Sam: You're with us. You're with us.
Taliesin: I am!
Travis: I take the gold. I put it back in.
Taliesin: No!
Travis: And I give him ten platinum, which is actually six.
Matt: So you get six platinum from Grog, which is roughly sixty gold.
Travis: One. Three. Seven. Eight. Nine. 40. Ten.
Sam: That's it?
Travis: Yep.
Taliesin: Excellent.
Sam: And give me 500 gold, as well.
Taliesin: No!
Sam: Of course. I need money.
Travis: It's really heavy. How about I give you 20 more platinum?
Sam: Great. That sounds good.
Travis: And I give him four more.
Sam: (laughs) Give me 50 more platinum.
Travis: 50?
Sam: Yes.
Travis: All right. I give you one more.
Sam: Thank you. 11 platinum.
Matt: Perfect.
Taliesin: I'm going to try to find Allura. I'm going to leave them to their madness. I'm going to try and find Allura and Cassandra or anybody I can find in the castle at this point.
Matt: Okay. As you walk around, nobody else who's supposed to be meeting has gathered yet. However, Cassandra is awake and in the process of going through some papers. She has her personal guard at her side and two guards at the door and you can see she's getting herself prepared for the meeting. As you enter the room, the door partially ajar, you see her still down currently thumbing through notes. Her hair is still in disarray and pulled back haphazardly. And she's wearing her morning gown and without even looking up goes, "Percival. Glad you've arrived and still in one piece."
Taliesin: Yes. And down one dragon.
Matt: "I have to tell you, I'm very impressed."
Taliesin: Thank you. Two more to go. It's going to get a little heavier at this point.
Matt: "Indeed. That's what our meeting is about."
Iphone: What was that, again?
Taliesin: What was that, again?
Matt: "Sorry, I need to go fire some of my guards. They're making a nuisance. Continue, please."
Taliesin: Two more to go. I fear that it's possible that Whitestone itself may eventually be a target of an attack. I feel it may be inevitable.
Matt: "That is, actually, what our meeting is about. Prevent that from happening."
Taliesin: Quickly to check. I would know what languages Cassandra spoke, correct?
Matt: What languages do you know?
Taliesin: Elven, Celestial, Common.
Matt: She knows Elven and Common. She does not know Celestial.
Taliesin: Okay.
Matt: That was more your hobby.
Taliesin: I figured. That was my guess. I wanted to confirm.
Matt: Yeah.
Taliesin: I hand her a small slip of paper that I have written in Elven: "Be prepared for anything today. Keep silent."
Matt: She gives you a very keen look. And you can see Cassandra. As much as she is the healthiest you've seen her physically, her eyes have dark circles over them. It looks like she's been very harried by the events of these past few weeks. Understandably so. But she takes and looks over the sheet and goes, "Well, very well. Should be an interesting meeting then."
Taliesin: I think so. I do think so. It's good to see you taking command.
Matt: "It's good to see you, and I look forward to you sharing some of the burden soon."
Taliesin: Yes.
Matt: "Right?"
Taliesin: Quite possibly.
Matt: "Right?"
Taliesin: We will discuss whence the dragons are taken care of.
Matt: "Good."
Taliesin: We will discuss, at the very least, relieving you of some of this burden.
Matt: "Good."
Taliesin: I know it is not fair.
Matt: "Whatever is fair in this life? The wonders of lordship and ladydom."
Sam: I'm going to run off and try to find Jarett.
Matt: Okay. Do you wish to come? Anything else you want to bring to this conversation?
Taliesin: No, I'm fine with that. My last thing is, I'm going to quickly run and have a quick conversation privately with-- I assume we have some sort of royal jeweler of some kind, or somebody who does some of the ornamental work.
Matt: No one who lives on site per se, but there are two individuals that your family generally used for various forms of jewel craft.
Taliesin: I'm going to write and send a letter off for that.
Matt: Okay. No worries. Scanlan, what are you going to do? Looking for Jarett?
Sam: Looking for Jarett.
Matt: Okay. You head outside of the main castle, down to where the training barracks are for Whitestone. And you can see Jarett's already out there, with a small, metallic platter on his lap, scarfing up some food real fast. He's gotten his day started relatively early and as soon as you approach, mouth's already full. "Mmm! Scanlan! It's good to see you."
Sam: Good to see you too! What're you enjoying there?
Matt: (laughs) "The usual gruel that you find in this city."
Sam: Oh, I thought it might be something, meat-based that you could have popped up a bit with your spice.
Matt: "Oh, well trust me, I've used it on the eggs and it makes it bearable. Whitestone is not well known for its cuisine from what I can tell. Everything's gray and lacks flavor."
Sam: I'll invite you over to my house some time, give you a proper chicken dinner.
Matt: "All right, I will happily take you up on that offer, thank you."
Sam: Wanted to check in on (lowers voice) the task we talked about?
Matt: "The task?"
Sam: You know, the mission we discussed.
Matt: "Remind me again?"
Sam: I don't want to talk about it out in the open. But you know there was some illicit--
Matt: "Oh!"
Sam: Items of medicine.
Matt: "Yes, I sent a request through someone I know."
Sam: Sent a request?! You're using other people? I trust you, I don't trust other people!
Matt: "I'm not going to leave the city right now to go find-- Look, I have two people I know that might be able to get what you need. But it's going to take time."
Sam: (sighs) I don't have time. (sighs)
Matt: "When did you pick up this habit?! I'm worried about you now, Scanlan."
Sam: I haven't picked it up. I'm trying to pick it up, damn it! It's the most difficult habit to pick up! Listen, can I confide in you, man to man, one on one, here?
Matt: "Certainly."
Sam: You're a fighter, you're a strapping young battle man, aren't you?
Matt: (chuckles) "I have been told this once or twice, yes."
Sam: I haven't felt myself recently. You know, we have these fights and some of them are pretty epic and there's monsters involved and I'm usually on my game, but lately I'm feeling a little off! How do you cope with that?
Matt: "Well largely by not using illicit substances?!"
Sam: Don't judge! Don't judge.
Matt: "I'm not judging! I'm worried about you. Like, if you don't even have a habit, why would you look for this? The Scanlan I knew, the one that hired me, he knew how to deal with this issue. He got laid."
Sam: I don't really do that much anymore.
Matt: "Maybe that's why you're not feeling up to the task?" (laughs)
Sam: That is a very fair point, Jarett.
Matt: "I'm just saying. Look, and I do not mean to talk out of turn." He sets his meal aside. "But you are a man who walks, driven by his pelvis. Am I wrong?"
Sam: You're not wrong.
Matt: "Then what happens if the pelvis goes unused? Grows bashful?"
Travis: Preach.
Sam: Like a fine instrument, it can go untuned. If you leave a fine violin without playing it for many years, it could wither and rot until you need to replace some of the parts. In a way, the same is true for my member. But the problem here, Jarett, is that I'm distracted. I'm distracted by things that haven't ever distracted me before. I've made a promise to someone to stay alive. I've never valued my own life before and when we get into the shit, I'm second-guessing things. I'm making stupid decisions that I wouldn't have otherwise made.
Matt: "Because suddenly you have purpose. Because you have a reason to come back."
Sam: Yes.
Matt: "That's not a bad thing, then."
Sam: I don't know how to harness that kind of stress.
Matt: "Do you have a keepsake of this reason to return, this person you made a promise to?"
Sam: Do I have a keepsake? I don't think so.
Matt: "Then you need to get yourself a keepsake!"
Sam: Well she's not around right now to get a keepsake from.
Matt: "Then something else that reminds you of her. Something that you can look at in that moment when you're not so sure."
Sam: How did you get so wise, Jarett?
Matt: "Drink a lot, listen to people talk. There are none wiser than barkeeps, my friend, and I have been friends with many a barkeep."
Sam: These are all good suggestions. But I'm a man of instinct, and my instincts said I need to supplement my body with some extra liquid courage. So if you can please continue to look for me.
Matt: "I will continue searching and providing what you require."
Sam: I've heard that it can help people in moments of panic and stress.
Matt: "And I've watched it ruin lives near K'Tawl Swamp!"
Sam: I can handle a lot of things.
Matt: "You are a strange gnome."
Sam: Takes one to know one?
Matt: "Does not work in this circumstance but I applaud your attempt. It was good. I'll do what I can. But don't forget you have more than one reason to stick around."
Sam: I know. That's what worries me. I'll think about what you said. Maybe I'll go have a toss, see if that helps, too.
Matt: "Here, tell you what. Come here."
Sam: Yes?
Matt: And he suckerpunches you in the face. You unexpectedly fall back. You feel the pulsing of the blood run to your cheek. Your eyesight goes white for a second. He goes, "See, now you have to live to return the favor."
Sam: You! That was clever. I will definitely get you back.
Matt: "Good. I look forward to it."
Sam: Watch your back.
Matt: "I always do."
Sam: Get me some drugs!
Matt: Awesome. Grog.
Travis: It's daytime, right?
Matt: Yeah, it's early morning.
Travis: Is there a way I can find a courtyard or an open-air area?
Matt: There are a couple of courtyards within the perimeter walls of the castle. They have some small garden elements.
Travis: If I get there, are there a lot of guards keeping an eye?
Matt: Not within the courtyard, no. Occasionally, there'll be one patrolling.
Travis: Can I pee in the courtyard?
Matt: By all means!
Travis: I feel like I need to mark my territory. This is home for us, and I peed all over Greyskull Keep. I left little puddles that y'all didn't know about. It's real important in case other goliaths come around and are like, (sniff) "Nope, the wolf's here. I got to go elsewhere."
Taliesin: I assumed it was shoddy masonry and everything was leaking.
Travis: No, stealth roll, motherfucker. Can I take a leak on a wall in the courtyard?
Matt: Yeah and there are a number of walls to choose from: varying heights, different levels of masonry. You have the veritable pick of the litter.
Travis: Can I find the highest wall with the most ornate decoration on it and go slightly off left? The way me member goes and make a little box right there? A little waterfall on the whitestone.
Matt: Certainly. You find the portion where the exterior wall has one little parapet-joining portion with the exterior of the castle itself. There, you can see the masonry is fine, the stones themselves are clean-cut and joined properly. There isn't a whole lot in the way of ornate craftsmanship on the exterior of the castle or the walls, but you feel, as far as your interest, Grog, this is a good wall.
Travis: Very nice.
Matt: You mark your territory expertly.
Travis: In a wide, arcing pattern, not like the one shot, like a nice, upside-down crown.
Matt: There you go, like a Cylon eyebeam. Yeah, totally. You do so with gusto. Congratulations.
Travis: Thank you. Home.
Matt: That's how Grog spells home.
Marisha: Stellar RP.
Travis: How else do you spell home?
Matt: Unless there's anything else that needs to be done--
Liam: I'm not done with my errands. Can I go find Kynan?
Matt: You can. Kynan, who is currently under the watch of Jarett at the moment, is asleep. You start walking towards the direction as Scanlan is leaving the exterior of the barrack training grounds.
Liam: Hey, buddy.
Sam: Hi.
Liam: You look a little rough. You all right?
Sam: I'm fine. One of our employees punched me in the face.
Liam: Which one?
Sam: You don't want to know. It wasn't the cooking cook.
Liam: You look really tense. You look out of character.
Sam: (growls)
Liam: Oh dear. Head back. We're going to have that meeting soon. Get your game face on, yeah?
Sam: I will. I'll wash my face. Get to it.
Liam: All right.
Sam: How are you doing?
Liam: I'm good.
Sam: Yeah?
Liam: Best I've been in a while.
Sam: That's good to hear. It's been a while since we had one of our depressing chats. You seem a little more chipper these days. Coming around to my perspective, are you?
Liam: Can I make an insight check?
Matt: Yeah, make an insight check.
Liam: Seems full of shit to me. I'm going to use luck. I've got it.
Travis: That's your second luck!
Liam: Who cares? This is a game. I'm with my friends. I'm having fun. That is an 18.
Matt: 18. Are you deceiving him any?
Sam: No! Not at all.
Liam: But does he seem confident and happy is what I wanted to know.
Matt: As much as he would in the given situation, yeah.
Liam: All right. (sighs) I'm happy. I'm in love.
Sam: Really?
Liam: Yeah.
Sam: Do I know the fella?
Liam: Yeah. I'll tell you later, all right?
Sam: I want to hear details! Dirty, dirty details! Sweaty details!
Liam: Oh, he is so hung. Unbelievably hung.
Marisha: So much dick talk!
Liam: I'll tell you later. I have to run an errand. We have to get to this fucking meeting, yeah?
Sam: Oh yeah. I'll see you there. Game face on.
Marisha: Is this how they talk themselves up?
Travis: Yeah, don't women talk about their vaginas?
Liam: I'm talking about your goddamn antlers. Jeepers. Off I go.
Sam: Locker room talk.
Laura: Oh. (laughter)
Liam: (yells) No!
Matt: The campaign is over. Whitestone burns in flames. You make your way there. Jarett, you can see, finishing a meal. Looks over to you. There's nobody else in the training area. It's still relatively early. You do, with your perception, see back on the main stone building, you see a few individuals walking back and forth in front of one of the windows. It looks like things are starting up over there for training for the day. Jarett finishes his meal, scarfs up the last bit of egg on the side of the plate, "Hey!"
Liam: Jarett!
Matt: "Yes!"
Liam: Hey, I don't want to interrupt. Kynan, the new guy. Is he around?
Matt: "Probably inside, sleeping or waking."
Liam: Okay if I go in?
Matt: "Sure. This way."
Liam: Just be a minute.
Matt: "Sure, go for it." He sits back down. You head inside. The door's not locked. You open it. You see ten different individuals that are all in the process of waking up. You can smell coffee. Very basic breakfast meats being cooked. Some of them are around tables talking, hunched forward and laughing. As soon as you walk in, a few of them turn and look at you. Some don't recognize you, some do. You see, in the far corner sitting alone at one of the tables is Kynan, who is prison-style guarding his food and eating by himself.
Liam: Right towards him. Hey.
Matt: "Hello."
Liam: How are you fitting in?
Matt: "All right. Everyone here's been fine."
Liam: You hanging back?
Matt: "I mean, as much as I need to. This is still a lot. Jarett's been good. He's been watching."
Liam: He's a good man. Yeah, I get it. We killed another dragon.
Matt: "That-- wow."
Liam: Yeah. I don't want you to question your decision here, all right?
Matt: "No, I mean-- I don't have anything else right now really. So, what's the question?"
Liam: There's no question. But if you could, I have two favors I want to ask.
Matt: "Okay."
Liam: First one is, after I leave here today, could you embrace these people?
Matt: "Yeah, I'm trying."
Liam: Yeah, I know, and I know you have reservations, and I know that you've got guilt. When I walk out of here, I want you to work on letting go of that. For real! Leap of faith kind of shit. Just let go of it.
Matt: (sighs) "Well, I'll do my best."
Liam: I know. Scratch that, three favors.
Matt: He looks down a little bit for a second seeming like "oh boy."
Liam: Yeah, I know I'm a handful. The second one, I don't even need for you to say anything about this, but you know the white-haired guy I travel with?
Matt: "Yeah."
Liam: Yeah. He's got a sister, and I don't want you to do anything other than keep an eye on her and keep her safe.
Matt: "Okay?"
Liam: We're going into the lion's den. Soon, I think. And we'll probably come out of it, but just in case. She's got a lot on her shoulders; you know that. So just keep an eye on her. That's it. All right?
Matt: "All right."
Liam: And the last thing. You've got those knives I gave you, right?
Matt: "Yeah."
Liam: Yeah, hold onto them. I trust you. I need you to watch after one last thing thing for me, all right? It's very important. I wake up Simon, and I let him crawl down my arm. Do you see this guy?
Matt: "Yeah."
Liam: He's been with me through a lot, and I don't want him at the bottom of a ditch.
Matt: "Are you sure?"
Liam: I have never been more sure of anything in my life. I want you to have him, and I want you to take care of him.
Matt: "I'll do that. It'll be done. I promise."
Liam: Kynan, I need you to believe in second chances.
Matt: "It's all I have to keep me going right now." He reaches his hand up towards the snake, and Simon leaps from from your hand to his and swirls down his arm. He looks confused for a second as it wraps around his waist and then forms into the shape of a belt. You now see a few other guys in the room, and the room's got a little bit quieter. They're all watching what's happening, "What's going on?" He notices the attention and, "I'll take good care of him."
Liam: I believe you.
Matt: "I mean no offense. It's a lot of attention right now."
Liam: I give a slap on his cheek. Remember everything I said, all right?
Matt: "Yeah, I will."
Liam: You're a good kid. (whack)
Matt: (soft chuckle) "Same temple."
Liam: I'll see you later, all right?
Matt: "Yeah. Definitely." And you head out. Okay. At this point in time, a number of pages have been sent throughout the city to gather those who've been wandering about Whitestone, as you are being called to the meeting in the second floor war room held within the castle itself.
Marisha: Second floor?
Matt: Same one where you met with--
Marisha: Asum? That'll do. All right.
Taliesin: Be ready for anything.
Travis: Let's go Krogering! The best of everything!
Marisha: Before we walk in, I grab Grog. How do you do it?
Travis: Do what?
Marisha: You're able to utilize your rage when necessary. How do you keep it suppressed when it's not needed?
Travis: Ah. Well, good question.
Marisha: Please enlighten me, Professor Grog.
Travis: Right. It all comes down to one word, really. (clears throat) Family. Right, before I was a part of this group, I had no family. Pike took me in, I met all of you. And I had a purpose. So before that, I would be down to fuck anything up, anytime, no problem. I still kind of am. But I realized that if I fly off the handle too soon, it screws over my family. That's no good, because I care about you. Most of you. (laughter)
Travis: You're going to get yours. It's coming. And I'm going to help you. And I'm going to high five you when it's done. But until then, you keep that shit tucked inside. Let it build. And then when the time is right, you let her have it. And I'll throw you into the fray, when the time is right.
Marisha: Promise?
Travis: Yeah, I promise.
Marisha: Deal.
Travis: Deal. (cracking noise) (laughter)
Marisha: Ow! Ow, Grog! Grog!
Travis: Oh shit, sorry! I'm so sorry!
Marisha: No, it's fine. I appreciate it. It's good.
Travis: Oh, yeah. Bruises, right?
Liam: She should really take one hit point of damage. (laughter)
Matt: Sure, you take a hit point of damage.
Marisha: Oh man, people are going to ask questions about that later.
Travis: No, it's cool. You make up a really good story.
Marisha: Sure. Yeah.
Travis: But listen. If at any time it gets to be too much, you just go. We've got you.
Marisha: Okay. I don't want to let you guys down.
Travis: You won't.
Marisha: Thanks, Grog. Okay. (clears throat) Let's do this.
Matt: All right. You guys enter the war room, same as it was previously left. However, you are brought the image of the table in early morning: Allura, Gilmore, surprisingly, Drake Thunderbrand, Cassandra, as well as Asum, who's standing behind most of them, back to the window. They all, middle of conversation, turn, and smile as you begin to walk in. You see Gilmore nods to everybody. Gives an extra smile to you, Vax. Cassandra's waiting for the pleasantries to end. Allura comes up and takes your hand, and she goes, "It's wonderful to see that you've returned safely. I've had many terrible thoughts that perhaps this meeting would not be as positive, and I'm very glad to know that I was wrong. And that you brought Kima back to us as well. Pike is safe as well. So congratulations, I guess, are in order. Come, sit. These circumstances do press our timeline a bit." And you see there are a number of other chairs already brought into the room, prepared for you guys to sit around together.
Marisha: Is there anyone sitting next to Raishan?
Matt: No, actually.
Marisha: I sit next to Raishan.
Matt: Raishan is not sitting. Raishan is standing with her arms crossed, leaning against the window.
Laura: I want to stay standing as well.
Marisha: Yeah, I move closer to Raishan.
Matt: Okay. As you approach, you see Asum's eyes watch you. Small grin on the face, and a little nod.
Marisha: I give a nod back.
Taliesin: I pull a chair out for Asum, and I'm going to offer him the chair and sit. And pull one out extra for myself.
Matt: At which point Cassandra gathers all of your attention in the midst of this chaos. "The excursion to Wildemount went well. As far as I understand, you are now one more dragon-slaying into this chaotic endeavor. Well done. Tell me, how did this happen?"
Taliesin: A deal was made with the locals. We brought the dragon to an appointed kill spot outside of the city. We summoned a creature.
Laura: With the Gate scroll that we showed you, actually.
Taliesin: There was a battle. And we felled it. That was more or less how it went down. It was a simple trap, it was elegant, and we barely survived.
Marisha: I pull out the Spire of Conflux and hand it to her. We retrieved this in our spoils. You may recognize it as one of the Vestiges that we spoke of earlier.
Matt: Cassandra takes it and says, "It looks quite important. Allura."
Marisha: Yes, I thought I was handing it to Allura. (laughter)
Marisha: Sorry. It was meant for Allura.
Matt: I can see how this would be confusing.
Marisha: Yes.
Sam: You look just like Allura right now.
Laura: Allura, is everything okay? Have you been through some shit, Allura?
Matt: "It's been a rough week." (laughter)
Matt: I almost did Allura, too. Next Halloween.
Liam: Vax is leaning against the door to this chamber, by the way.
Matt: All right. Allura takes it, inspects it. "This is a magnificent artifact. Well found. Perhaps we'll take a look at it after the meeting together."
Marisha: Sure.
Matt: Cassandra gets everyone's attention once more, motions to the guards. The door that you're leaning by gets closed as the guards step out, so it's only you guys having this conversation. "So, with another of the Conclave fallen, retaliation is imminent. And with Thordak already infuriated at the death of Umbrasyl, and we only caught but a glance of that anger, thankfully through the means of which Allura and Gilmore and others were able to cloak the city, I do not feel that will last the entirety of the time we would need to take a leisurely stroll through our next series of plans. I fear that less protected cities may be in the path of retaliation before it finds its way to us." Allura speaks up at this point and goes, "Thordak is a creature of infinite pride. And a slight such as this against the Conclave will most likely trigger the destruction of even more innocents. Both to satiate his anger and, I'm certain, to also draw us out. He is an intelligent one, as is the company he keeps. I've also reached out to other members of the Arcana Pansophical, and hope that they would come to our aid, but given the recent death of Vorugal, I do not know if they'll arrive in time to be of any assistance. So we have to begin to gather our strengths, our allies. And honestly, I think we need to strike first."
Travis: You do?
Matt: "Well, otherwise we wait for the fight to be on Thordak's turf."
Travis: That's unexpected.
Laura: Just pop on over to Emon, then?
Matt: "Well, we need a plan first. We need to gather those we've called to arms. We need to assess what strengths we have, and utilizing all of these things at our disposal, come up with an idea of how we're actually going to do this." Gilmore steps in and goes, "If we are to strike, I agree it should also be very soon. We've pushed the boundaries of being on his peripheral even this long. And you say that he knows your faces, correct?"
Taliesin: Yes.
Matt: "His gaze will now surely fall upon the seven of you, at the very least."
Taliesin: It was inevitable.
Matt: Asum steps forward at this point, from the wall, and begins to walk in front of you, Keyleth, and between Percy, "The longer he remains as well, the more the landscape of Emon and the surrounding Bladeshimmer Shoreline begins to churn. Begins to boil with flame and toxic fume. He is scarring the surrounding land with his claws, his teeth, his flames, his roar, and those that follow in his shadow. His fearmongering has risen a number under him. A creature of such pride is eager to show that if you fall in such fear and do as he says, there are rewards. I'm sure you've come across many weak-willed individuals in your travels that would be eager to jump at the chance of working beneath such a powerful and dangerous creature." Allura steps in at this point now and says, "Now I believe it is partially his essence, but the expedited rate of this elemental transition around him is based on the soul anchor that we embedded within him to keep him in the Fire Elemental Plane. This stone that resides in the center of his chest and belly. I believe this stone is somehow drawing elements of the essence of the Fire Elemental Plane itself into Emon. I mean, it's not unusual for the presence of a red dragon over hundreds of years to begin to convert the scenery around, but this speed... I can only see a connection between the enchantment that we hoped would hold Thordak at bay, and the changes we're seeing at the center of Emon and beyond. Now, it was never intended for him to leave that place, and I feel deeply responsible for many elements of the danger we now see in this world. I only know that I will do whatever it takes on my end to see that this comes to an end. Whatever sacrifice, whatever is necessary. I'm at your disposal. But the responsibility of the destruction is also our own. The longer we take, the more chance he will tear through Kymal. He will tear through Westruun. He will tear through Daxio. He will begin to burn everything that Tal'Dorei is, until we show our faces."
Liam: I am curious what the Master of Secrets thinks. Asum?
Matt: Asum is still walking a circle around the table.
Liam: What do you propose we do?
Matt: "Hmph. Well, before we get to that, let us discuss things we have at our disposal, the information we have, and from that, we can garnish a plan. I am the Master of Secrets; I am not a Master of Warmongering and Attack."
Taliesin: I get up, I walk to the window, and I look out the window. We're not going to be safe here for much longer, that much is certain. We will need to move quickly.
Matt: Drake speaks up for the first time and goes, "Aye, not to mention that slippery green drake is still out there somewhere, and we have no idea where it is. Two members of the Conclave are remaining."
Travis: Well-- Ow! Right, yeah. Two.
Taliesin: Do you think perhaps it's best to skip one and hope for the element of surprise? Maybe he thinks we're going to finish off his generals before we come to him. It may be a brief moment of surprise. If anything, maybe he's expecting us to kill one more, not go for the main prize.
Liam: Cut off the head of the king?
Taliesin: Maybe.
Sam: Thordak, from what I understand, is extremely powerful and influential. That Raishan dragon is a mere pittance in comparison. A small, exponential ant, a pawn, if you will, on the battlefield.
Matt: "I certainly hope so. And if that's the case, then I think you're right. Go for the king first. But we must do so with eyes all about us because the last thing we need is to be flanked by that beast in the center of our attack."
Marisha: Exactly. We don't want to deal with two ancient dragons.
Taliesin: Can we lure it somewhere else, perhaps?
Matt: "If we knew where it fucking was." Allura speaks up at this point and goes, "Look. I know that Thordak's hate for me still burns, hence the reason why they went directly for my tower when they first arrived in Emon. The one trump card we do have in this is me."
Laura: Do you want to offer yourself as bait?
Matt: "If need be. I'm not saying that's the right plan, but I'm saying it is one thing we can perhaps utilize in our plan, in our strategy."
Travis: Is his hate for you?
Taliesin: I think-- There was a ship in Draconia, a northern ship of some kind. I still feel there may be some sort of weapon inside it that may prove useful. It was a ship that had been dragged there by the white dragon. It's been bothering me. And then of course we have whatever it is we have downstairs. I'm not saying we should use it, but it is powerful.
Laura: I don't know how we would use it.
Travis: We can't move it, can we?
Laura: We can't touch it.
Matt: Gilmore pops up again and says, "Exactly. We were poring over that thing for a number of weeks, until we had to build this barrier. And to be perfectly honest, I am sick of it."
Liam: You've got nothing?
Matt: "Well, we understand it's a siphon. It's bringing the energy of the nexus somewhere. We don't know where the other end of it is. Or if it's even functioning properly."
Marisha: Allura, do you still feel a connection with the soul stone that's inside of Thordak?
Matt: "Well, I have no personal connection to it, I know that I was the architect of its enchantment, and the ruse, of which sealed it within Thordak."
Marisha: You built it. You must know of some way to disable it.
Travis: Or a weakness.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: "We designed it to have no weakness. The intent was to keep him there indefinitely. Perhaps if we could--"
Marisha: What?
Matt: "Asum. You said you have friends, back in Emon still, that have been gathering intel." Asum turns. "Yes, actually. And I was hoping that, as part of our plan today, we could even go and retrieve some of this information. Perhaps that could teach us more about this soul anchor you continuously talk about."
Sam: How can we retrieve this information without going to Emon?
Matt: "Oh, we would have to go to Emon."
Sam: That sounds crazy. Is there any way to not do that?
Matt: "Perhaps I'll go alone."
Marisha: The soul stone has been broken and abused before. I have a feeling there's someone who might have an idea on how to disable it.
Travis: I really don't, I have no idea.
Marisha: Well, Raishan was the one who busted out Thordak in the first place, out of the Fire Plane. So I would assume that Raishan has some idea on how to--
Travis: Oh.
Laura: You think? I feel like Raishan would only know how to open up a portal.
Marisha: Well, I have a lot of feelings about Raishan.
Matt: Cassandra speaks up and says, "Well, you've been abroad. You've been gaining arms and allies, from what you've told me from across Exandria. Let us consolidate our options, our strengths, and plop it down in front of the Conclave, best we can."
Sam: I'm no master strategist, but we do have allies that we can call upon, and weapons, and men and arms and troops. However, taking the fight to Thordak in Emon seems foolhardy at best. I suppose this is where the intelligence could come into play. Is there some other place where we could go and try to take back from Thordak, to lure him away from Emon?
Matt: Asum steps into the conversation and goes, "The thing with that plan is Thordak has amassed thousands of lizardfolk in Emon at this point that follow his whim. In the nearby mountain ranges, many from the Stormcrest, that worshipped him the entire time that he was gone. Wyvern riders originally aided in taking the city that you met, as did I. But since, other allies have found their way to the Cinder King's sway. Last that I checked, it seemed that there were a number of allies that he brought over from his time in the Fire Plane as well."
Laura: What?!
Matt: "Fire giants, in the service of the dragon, now walk the streets."
Sam: So, if we go into Emon, we're facing fire giants, lizard people, and that's before we get to Thordak the Cinder King?
Laura: How the fuck are we going to fight him?!
Matt: "That's what we're discussing today."
Sam: Does Thordak covet any other territory, or city, or town? Vasselheim? Here? Anywhere that we can lure him to?
Travis: Anything he has nostalgic feelings about? Glintshore--
Liam: Anything that would piss him off?
Matt: "You were lucky to draw a creature of such infinitesimal experience and intelligence as a white dragon away from its home roost. I would be greatly surprised if you had pulled a great, powerful, intelligent, ancient red dragon from its home turf advantage."
Liam: So your prediction is that we have to slog our way through the outskirts of Emon to fight him on his home turf. Is that about the size of it?
Matt: "That's one way."
Sam: What's another?
Matt: "Distract his allies and go straight for the heart. You have allies, like Allura just said, all throughout the world."
Travis: This is true. We have the Herd, we can go get the werewolves.
Sam: The Ravenites would help.
Marisha: Everyone who we ask, everyone who we send in there, we're sending in to their death.
Taliesin: This is war.
Travis: Yeah, but it's either death now or death a little later.
Laura: We're sending ourselves as well.
Liam: So, are we talking about sending everyone we know and everything we have to the outskirts of town--
Sam: For a full frontal attack. While we bamf into the dragon's lair.
Liam: Yeah. We create a massive fucking clusterfuck on the edge of his periphery and we go for the center.
Laura: How long did it take you, Allura, to create that heart?
Matt: "Well. The design and the development and enchantment of it are powerful enough to anchor itself to the soul of a dragon of Thordak's strength. Better part of six months."
Liam: Six months.
Laura: Six months.
Liam: We've probably got a week or two.
Matt: "And that was with a dozen other hands helping me. Most of the Arcana Pansophical was at my side for that and we don't have that kind of time."
Liam: Well, we take a day or two and we amass every heavy fucking hitter we have, and we do this. What other choice do we have?
Marisha: I keep thinking back to Emon where we watched half of our friends die in a second.
Liam: A lot of us are going to die.
Matt: Cassandra sits up a little bit in her seat and goes, "If we are smart about this, we can minimize the casualties far more now than they would be a week, two weeks, a month, a year from now."
Travis: I agree.
Taliesin: What of Whitestone? We put the city at great risk. How much risk are we willing to take?
Liam: Percy, everywhere is at great risk right now.
Marisha: It's true.
Travis: We should leave Whitestone.
Sam: But even getting to Emon, aren't we exposing ourselves to detection and attack?
Travis: We are if we wait.
Sam: We're going to march several armies across the entire continent to get there? It'll take days.
Laura: How do we get armies there?
Liam: We're going to take a day or two. We're going to figure out how to get who we have to where we need. We're not doing this tomorrow. In a couple of days. Three days. Four days at the most. It's not ideal, but it's what we have to do.
Sam: We can at least move people to, you know. Where's that town that was established?
Travis: Outside of Westruun?
Matt: There's Westruun, Kymal were the two that you moved--
Sam: Westruun is close-ish, right, to Emon?
Matt: Westruun's a little bit further than Kymal is. Kymal is where you sent a lot of the Westruun refugees.
Travis: Right.
Laura: But they're just townsfolk.
Sam: But we can at least assemble there, from all the different territories, and then meet up, form a plan, and then march from there.
Laura: March on Emon? If we gather our forces, Thordak will notice.
Travis: Yeah, we've got to do a lot of recon before then. But I think he's got a good point, right? We've got to have like a staging point.
Matt: Cassandra turns, looks over to Asum and goes, "Recon, actually. Anything else, Asum, you may have in regards to what we can expect there?" Asum is still slowly walking around the peripheral of the meeting table. "I can tell you that most of the city's wealth and resources, as well as caches, sealed arcane relics, and weaponry, long held by the Lyceum or the arms of Emon, have been stolen and thrown atop the victory hoard of Thordak. Most who are part of this rebellion within the city are doing so with scraps. That is why the Clasp has been so instrumental in the removal of many of the oppressed folk within the city. Also, the fire that marks Thordak's presence that have drawn fire and molten rock across the city, as well as the outskirts of the city walls, scar the landscape and fill the sky with sulfurous clouds and black smoke. The good news is that smoke can be utilized, should someone have some control over the elements, to be a screen. However, where the Cloudtop District once stood, there is now but a heated cauldron of glowing stone and flame. Hundreds of gifts and statues left in Thordak's image litter the outer area, while a massive cavern dives beneath the central region of the district. Now this cavern, as we've watched it, we believe it to be the location of Thordak's treasure vault. As well as the occasional sleeping place of the massive drake we speak of. Thordak is also showing rather intense signs of physical change since being released from his prison. And his size still remains enormous by comparison. His eyes now burn with a searing white light. Burning stars in the sky. His jaw ever dribbles with burning liquid that blackens the ground it touches. The gaps between scales appear to flare bright with each breath, like a star engine beneath the scales."
Marisha: (sneezes) Sorry.
Laura: Bless you.
Marisha: Yeah. Sorry.
Laura: Do you think it's overtaking him?
Matt: "I've no idea. Allura?" And Allura goes, "Well, if the anchor was indeed removed from the Fire Elemental Plane, then Thordak would have had his soul torn from his body. That is how the anchor worked."
Marisha: So you don't think he actually even fully separated from the plane, he brought the plane with him.
Matt: "Or at least, maybe a piece. I wasn't there, I don't know the ritual that brought him over."
Marisha: Maybe then we're looking at this the wrong way. Maybe we go at this through the Fire Plane. Maybe there's something still there.
Taliesin: A way to sever his connection to the Fire Plane, maybe.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: Allura thinks for a second.
Marisha: We've got an easy door in.
Matt: "I could try. But the enchantment itself-- We don't have enough information. It wasn't bound to a specific place in the plane, it was bound to the plane itself. I don't know how you'd sever it from the other side."
Travis: From the other side, we'd have to go there.
Sam: Yeah.
Travis: That's called thinking outside the circle.
Sam: But then once we're there, what do we do?
Marisha: And we don't even know where to look. I mean, we could at least talk to the Ashari there. They might--
Taliesin: Another ally.
Travis: Is there like nothing friendly in the Fire Plane?
Liam: It's at least as big as Tal'Dorei. I mean, it's another dimension.
Laura: It's huge.
Marisha: It's huge, but not many people know the whereabouts. There's still locations and destinations within the Fire Plane. It's navigable.
Laura: Maybe all the evil things in the Fire Plane are gone right now and they're with Thordak.
Matt: Asum steps forward to the table, and puts his little halfling hands on the edge and goes, "Well, it's a shame that we don't have any information about this ritual that freed him from the plane."
Laura: That is a shame. A real shame.
Matt: "I'll see if my compatriots can gather information, but in the meantime we'll do the best we can to gather similar information."
Liam: Well, we know we don't have a lot of time, but do we maybe want to table this and think on it?
Sam: At the very least, should we send out some letters, alerting our allies that--
Laura: Shit's going down.
Sam: It's time to start stocking up and getting ready to move?
Matt: Drake steps forward and goes, "I think that's a fine plan of action. Reach out to all those you brought in. Hopefully we can get a few of our friends in this as well."
Laura: Did an airship ever arrive?
Matt: They all look at each other, a bit confused. "No."
Laura: An airship? Did anyone see an airship flying around?
Matt: "I didn't see one." And Cassandra goes, "No. There hasn't been an airship here, no. Are we expecting one?"
Laura: Mm-hmm.
Matt: "Good to know."
Sam: The city is invisible.
Matt: "Yes, so they won't see us if they come. If we see an airship, do you wish us to flag it down?"
Laura: That would be good.
Matt: "You trust it?"
Laura: Yes.
Liam: They are a rarity.
Matt: "All right."
Sam: Maybe come up with a landing point as well.
Matt: "Now?"
Sam: Well, soon.
Taliesin: We have one other possible option in front of us. Show them the medal.
Sam: No, thank you.
Taliesin: You're not going to show them the medal? Not that, no! No, not that. Please don't whip that out, no one wants to see that.
Sam: No, not the cube.
Taliesin: We have another ally that we have spoken of.
Sam: It's a tenuous ally at best. Maybe we shouldn't discuss it until we're 100% sure about it.
Liam: Yeah, that's a big maybe. That's a big maybe. Yeah.
Marisha: Yeah, they're very busy though.
Laura: Yeah, it's really far away and, then as we were leaving, the people that we talked to about it--
Matt: "It's fine, I get it! Reach out to your people on one end."
Taliesin: I slowly walk around the table, thinking hard about it. And I stab Seeker Asum three times in the back with my sword.
Marisha: Let's fucking do this shit! Let's do it! Let's do it!
Laura: But we need to know the ritual!
Liam: It's too late, he did it.
Marisha: (yelling) Yeah!
Sam: Oh Percy, no.
Matt: Go ahead and roll--
Taliesin: That's a surprise attack.
Matt: I know it is.
Sam: Oh god, why? We're in crazy costumes.
Liam: Check out the brain on Brad.
Laura: We've got Allura and Gilmore, and Drake.
Taliesin: We have a lot of people in the room.
Sam: Oh god.
Matt: Go ahead and roll. Roll the first attack. With advantage.
Travis: We're in a room.
Laura: Whitestone's about to be destroyed.
Sam: And Raishan's about to leave.
Liam: Oh man, he's not making you roll stealth, motherfucker.
Laura: Why would he? He doesn't--
Liam: Because I would. And Hotis did on me.
Laura: That's different.
Liam: No it's not.
Taliesin: That's 29.
Matt: Okay. As you pull the blade out of the hilt to go ahead and begin to strike-- You're a quick individual. You're also in the presence of an entity that does not trust anyone or anything. You take the blade and swing out in the direction of Seeker Asum. And where your blade strikes, it shimmers through the image. There's a flash, and Asum is suddenly four feet away from the position where Asum was standing. At which point, everyone in the room stands up immediately and is like, "Whoa whoa!" Cassandra goes over and puts her hand towards you, and Asum is taking a few steps back and is like (breathes heavily).
Taliesin: No tricks in here. No tricks in here, if we're really going to do this.
Matt: There's this moment of extreme quiet, tension, as Allura's looking at you, looking at Asum, looking around. And there's like this slow, connecting moment of realization throughout the room as everyone's eyes go wide.
Taliesin: If we're really going to do this, no tricks in here.
Matt: And with that, we're going to take a break. (screaming)
Marisha: Amazing!
Laura: Taliesin!
Taliesin: Don't trust a man who just kissed somebody! That's a man who's saying fuck it.
Liam: Backpedal, backpedal, backpedal!
Marisha: I'm into it. I'm really into it.
Liam: Yes, we know, darling. We know.
Matt: All righty. Well, we'll go ahead and take a short break here, guys. We'll be back here in a few minutes. And we'll (Victor voice) see what happens next! (normal voice) All right. See you guys here in a minute. [break]
Matt: Welcome back, everyone, to Critical Role. When we last left off, Clarota, over here-- Let us all marvel at that! (cheering)
Taliesin: It was me all along!
Laura: Oh god. Are you going to leave that on the whole time?
Taliesin: Oh hell no! I can't see or hear a thing.
Marisha: It was so short-lived.
Liam: Three seconds of costume, that's all you get! (laughter)
Sam: You can't put just this part on?
Taliesin: No, it's really uncomfortable!
Laura: Just the helmet?
Liam: Do the frigging helmet. I had my arm behind my back for two hours!
Taliesin: Why would you do that?
Liam: Commitment!
Marisha: I have so many guns in my belt! No one can even see them, and I'm still committed.
Sam: I painted my entire body.
Taliesin: What is wrong with you people?
Laura: That's good. You're good now.
Taliesin: I can't really claim sanity. I just did something mind-bendingly stupid.
Liam: You now look like one of your own bullets. (laughter)
Matt: You have a very Merlin from Excalibur thing going on there right now.
Taliesin: A dream to some, a nightmare to others. (laughter)
Taliesin: Oh, like lightning! Yes!
Matt: We need more green lights in here to really get the effect.
Taliesin: Go see Excalibur. Not right now, but tomorrow.
Matt: All right! So, bringing it back in. As your blade swings through and passes through the form of Seeker Asum, it shimmers and then darts backward into the corner of the room.
Taliesin: I immediately sheath and say  No more tricks. If we're going to do this, we need everybody to know what's on the table.
Matt: At which point, everyone who stood up and held off at the chaos, you see all the faces going off in realization. Asum goes from a defensive position and then stands up again. Crosses the arms.
Taliesin: We're either going to win, or we're not. I was hoping you were going to take care of that.
Matt: "We're working on that plan as we speak. But pardon me if I take a few-- how do you say-- careful backups in case one would take a blade and stab at an ally, supposedly."
Taliesin: You know damn well that we're not allies. You know damn well that this is a tenuous relationship. And you know that neither of us trust the other.
Matt: At which point, Allura puts her hand out and goes, "I'm sorry. What the hell is going on here?!"
Taliesin: We'll get there. I would hope that you wouldn't trust us, and I would hope that you understand that we don't trust you. But we need to make a real plan now.
Matt: As the tension slowly subsides, Gilmore puts his finger up, "Pardon my momentary ignorance. Would you like me to cleanse the room?"
Taliesin: I'm hoping for a conversation to start that I promised I wouldn't start myself. I am trying to keep to the letter of my word.
Sam: It might help if Gilmore were to make sure everyone is on the up-and-up in this room.
Taliesin: Seeker Asum, do you have an opinion on how you would like to proceed?
Matt: Seeker Asum takes a few steps towards you. Casually looks up to you and goes to pat you on the shoulder. His illusory hand passing through your form. Goes, "I'm quite comfortable where I am right now. Let us continue this conversation."
Taliesin: The floor is yours if you wish to tell everyone what the real plan is.
Matt: "Very well! Since my hand has been forced. Hello. Seeker Asum is still back in Emon, dealing with the difficulty of preparing the current circumstance we're discussing. I am Raishan. Member of the Conclave. Up until recently, tenuous ally with Thordak the Cinder King, who is now considered a mutual thorn in all of our sides. I've made an agreement with your Vox Machina for quite some time. Together, using our combined strengths, we slew Vorugal, the Frigid Doom, over in Wildemount. We've returned to reconvene. I've provided nothing but honest, upfront, and necessarily vital information to your victory."
Taliesin: I will confirm everything but "for quite some time" to the room.
Laura: I've just been staring at Allura.
Matt: Allura, you see her fingers are twitching and her arms tense, and there's this very faint air that's blowing her hair ever so slightly, where there's no wind in the air. She's on edge right now and is looking to you guys for guidance, like "Are we doing this?" Cassandra stood up immediately. For the first time in a long time, since Whitestone was reclaimed, Cassandra now resembles more her age than she ever did. She has a look on her face like she's far out of her depth. Understanding the circumstance, there's legitimate fear in her face, and she's looking at Percival with that look of, "What have you done?"
Taliesin: Now we can have a real conversation about what's going on. We have an ally on the inside, albeit an untrustworthy one. You'll pardon that, but there's every possibility that this is an elaborate trap. I respect your intelligence far too much to try and pretend otherwise. You understand certainly what I mean? Having this on the table, we now know that there's every possibility that the red dragon knows everything. There's every possibility that we're walking into a trap. Or there's every possibility that we have an insatiably powerful ally. It is a terrible risk.
Marisha: Or an insatiably powerful enemy.
Taliesin: Also a terrible risk.
Laura: Either way, we can now ask about the ritual.
Marisha: Why don't you inform the room on how you utilized an entire race of people to break the ritual?
Matt: Everyone's still standing at this point, looking. Cassandra slowly sits down but is still looking between Raishan and Percival. You watch as Asum's form steps towards the center of the room, the flash of green flaring in the eyes with a smile, "The anchor that you speak of was indeed removed from the Fire Elemental Plane. We discovered that it was indestructible. Good on you, Allura. Well created. We tried many different ways: rending it, crushing it, sending it elsewhere without the enchantment tearing Thordak with it. To no avail. In trying to find a way to bring Thordak through, we needed to bring the soul anchor and the Fire Elemental Plane with it. The one place where such research could be gathered promptly, fully, was Pyrah. Now, mind you, it was not my intent for such destruction to rain upon them. I spent many years with them. I got to know them. They're a fine people. In that time, I learned the ways of temporal travel between dimensions. The details that allowed me to see the fabric of the Fire Plane, to where we could encase a bit of it within the soul anchor itself. Once we had managed to crack that essence, I was able to, from a distance, using the allies at the other end-- Thordak had found friendship with some of the ousted fire giants. They found comfort outside of the ordning under the shadow of the fire dragon. In using their deep, rich-blooded past and forging and making, they were able to convert the soul anchor into something that housed the essence of the Fire Plane. However, we didn't have a means of creating a hole large enough to bring both through without destroying both in the process. And as such, we waited for the right time: The Winter's Crest."
Marisha: You bitch.
Matt: "To some, maybe. But we called this the Ember Seed. The Ember Seed resides in the center of this heartstone. That is what is causing Thordak to swell. That is what's driving him mad. That is what is drawing the very land around Emon to fiery eruption. It is also what keeps his soul on this plane."
Travis: What keeps his soul on this plane?
Matt: "It keeps the soul intact with his body."
Travis: Destroy the stone...
Taliesin: It can't be destroyed.
Matt: "In theory. But we've tried. Believe me; we've tried."
Marisha: And you kept the soul and the stone inside of him?
Matt: "To remove it would destroy him as well, as the Arcana Pansophical saw fit. So yes, both came through. Waited for the Winter's Crest, had enough power and understanding of the ritual to open the entirety of the tear, and Thordak screamed through, flames in his wake. And he laid waste to your people, not I."
Marisha: No. You used me. You used us. And my fear that I had originally appears to be true. A lot of this is my fault. I'm willing to accept my onus. The fact that you can't shows all the kind of person that you are. My promise still stands. I'm thinking it might come sooner rather than later.
Matt: "You do understand that without my aid, you will not succeed?"
Marisha: I understand that without your aid, none of this would have fucking happened in the first place.
Matt: "Yes, and there are quite a few in this room that fall in that category." She looks to Allura and Drake.
Marisha: So it seems all of us can accept our part in this matter, except for you.
Matt: "I accept my part in this matter as well. You don't think I feel duped by this? You don't think I have many things I wish to tear from the very corpse of that entity? You think I don't want to see him burn as much as you do? This vengeance that burns within me!"
Marisha: What would you do if you actually got what you want?
Matt: "What all of us want  freedom."
Marisha: I pull out the Spire of Conflux. There are always many solutions to many problems. You think Thordak is the only solution to yours? This staff was birthed from the head of Melora, the same goddess who gave you that curse. What if you wanted me instead? Me and this staff. Maybe I can help you more than Thordak can.
Matt: "Are you saying you understand the way to remove this? That you know the secret to burning this wretched disease from my form?"
Marisha: I'm saying I might be your best chance at salvation. I'm pretty sure this staff is the closest living relic that we have in existence to the god who granted your curse. Thordak is no god. That was your first stupid mistake.
Taliesin: I think if I might translate. What my friend here is trying to relate is that, perhaps when the dust has settled, your salvation may either be found in the withering corpse or cackling smile of a creature that you are subservient to, who will take great delight in your destruction. Or perhaps in those you've aided who will feel grateful.
Marisha: It's up to you, Raishan.
Taliesin: And I will advise her to take no revenge until all cards are on the table.
Matt: "Well. Good."
Marisha: Clearly you are the type of person who looks for answers in other people. You are clearly unaware of accepting any fault or any result of your actions. Why don't you start fresh? Do you really want Thordak to have another sway over you? Another gift, another favor, that he's given you? That he is going to hold over you for all of eternity? Do you really want that? You're stronger than that.
Matt: "That's why we're working to watch him fall."
Marisha: Are we?
Matt: (chuckles) "If you need not my help, just let me know."
Marisha: Oh no, Raishan. We don't need your help. Let me say that right now. This all depends on what you want out of the end of the deal.
Matt: "I wish to be given unfettered, unbothered, unwatched control over the corpse upon his death to extract the information I need. I will leave your very sphere of existence and understanding until the end of your days."
Liam: What happens if we say no to that?
Matt: "Oh, then I'll find another way."
Marisha: Spoiler alert  we're saying no to that.
Taliesin: Unfettered I'm fine with. It's unwatched--
Matt: "Then watch! Watch, for all I care. It will be Greek to you anyway."
Marisha: She's taken way too much. She doesn't get to leave!
Taliesin: She's already left.
Travis: Yeah, I walk over around the table towards Asum. I try and poke her in the shoulder. Him.
Matt: It passes through the form.
Taliesin: This is the deal that we are offered. This is the deal that's on the table. We are in a tenuous position of power.
Sam: You can stop poking, Grog.
Travis: She's not here!
Laura: That's crazy.
Sam: Give her one more good poke.
Taliesin: How do we get in contact with you when we know when we move and how?
Matt: "Well, what is your next step through your journey?"
Taliesin: That is the question. Now that everything's on the table, I'm sorry to shock everyone. I was hoping not to be the cause of it. I was hoping that it was time for everything to be on the table. But this is actually what we're dealing with. This is the complexity. This is the battlefield.
Travis: So we have to rally our forces to us, and we have to do some really smart recon. Do we make her a part of that or no?
Taliesin: No, the more distance that we keep, the better.
Sam: From her?
Taliesin: Yes. She will probably be, I imagine, in our way on occasion.
Liam: But no one make any mistake. She's lying to our faces. She is not telling us what she wants or what she wants to do. You have a whole plan!
Matt: "Assume what you will."
Liam: Shut the fuck up! You've been droning on for an hour! Shut the fuck up. You're not telling us what you want. You fucking shit bag. Fuck you!
Matt: "Keep great company."
Liam: Does anyone really believe that this is all going to be fixed if we work with her?
Marisha: I say we take a recess. Gather our thoughts. Raishan, my offer still stands. If you want to come and find me, I know you know how. Maybe we can commune with Melora together.
Matt: "You do not comprehend the magics that you even speak of. It's cute. Look, I agree. Distance is of aid to us at the moment. If anything, I should probably cut off the information of Vorugal's fall. I should speak with the Cinder King and still establish my allegiance from his perspective."
Taliesin: Can you cut off that information? I would imagine that would be far too much.
Matt: "Cut it off, no. But I can attempt to guide the fury, if you will."
Laura: Will he know it was us?
Matt: "I can guarantee it."
Travis: Can you keep him from attacking Whitestone?
Matt: "For a time, maybe."
Marisha: Can you guide his fury in a way that would be beneficial to the plan?
Matt: "If I knew what the plan was, yes."
Marisha: You were saying ideally, if we could get him away?
Taliesin: I don't think we're going to get him away--
Sam: We're going to do recon. We're going to send out word to gather our forces-- where?
Taliesin: What if he knew where we were?
Travis: We don't know yet.
Sam: Let's find out, let's pick a place.
Taliesin: What if you knew where we were? What if we found a place? We pick our battleground. He discovers where we're hiding.
Marisha: And Raishan rats us out.
Taliesin: And Raishan discovers this information.
Marisha: Would certainly put you in the good graces of the Cinder King.
Matt: Raishan takes a moment and thinks.
Taliesin: You are searching for us right now, are you not?
Matt: "I am indeed, but Thordak has been using us as the attack."
Liam: Yeah, he's not going to leave his nest.
Laura: So what if we kill you?
Matt: "What do you mean?"
Laura: How does Thordak know you're alive?
Matt: "Because I check in every now and then to remind him."
Laura: What if he sends you out, and we kill you?
Marisha: And you never come back? He'd be forced to be the one to have to leave the battlefield.
Taliesin: If he knew where you were headed.
Marisha: You're a clever girl. I'm sure you can make a ruse to make you look convincingly dead.
Taliesin: You wouldn't even have to tell us where you were hiding. You could just hide. And we could ready ourselves.
Matt: "That is an idea. Hmm. Take your recess. I'll take mine. There may be something to this plot."
Marisha: And we can all assume that when we exit this room, that our tenuous alliance is still that. Correct?
Matt: "I would hope that there's no more errant blade pokery?"
Taliesin: Now that I know your tricks.
Laura: We do it to everyone. Don't worry.
Taliesin: We actually do, now that I think about it.
Marisha: Yeah, that's kind of true.
Liam: We're also not alone here. Allura, how does this sit with you?
Matt: Allura is sitting right now, she's listening to everything with her hands crossed. Shakes her head and goes, "To be perfectly honest, this bothers me a great deal. But the fact that Whitestone still stands does speak volumes at the least."
Taliesin: It does.
Matt: "With the cards being in our favor."
Taliesin: It's not the first devil I've made a deal with.
Matt: "No."
Laura: Doesn't always turn out well, Percival.
Taliesin: Doesn't always turn out terribly, either.
Matt: "Regardless, I have a lot to think about. As do we all." And Allura slowly turns her head and looks up, probably for the first time since she sat down, to the illusory Raishan's Asum form. "Asum lives, then?" "Indeed he does. Indeed he does." And Allura turns her head back and goes--
Marisha: Can I do an insight check?
Matt: Go for it.
Marisha: Does she know if Asum is up to something no good? 25, I think? Better double check that. 25.
Matt: 25? Okay. It's hard to read the demeanor of Raishan in general. It's this middle ground of neutral expression with a half-cocked grin. Information flows at this consistent rate of being generally difficult to read. The beat of hesitation is meant for emphasis, more than covering, if that makes any sense. So it seems to have an honesty to it, if you could read any honesty from Raishan.
Laura: Raishan, now that we know you're you, do you have to continue the ruse of being Asum, or can you bring him here?
Matt: "I can certainly bring him here if you'd like. However, he is doing quite a lot of good with the Clasp, and Brom and Tofor underneath Emon right now, and they've managed to save many lives and continue to do so."
Laura: Maybe you could pop him over then? Just for a little bit.
Matt: "Well--"
Laura: You're quite powerful.
Matt: "What do you have need for Asum?"
Laura: I want to hear what's going on with the Clasp. I want to see for myself that he's alive.
Taliesin: We're actually going to have to have a conversation with the Clasp, because we're going to purge the city once the dragon is gone.
Matt: "Why don't you go see him yourself?"
Travis: No, I like her idea. I want to see him here.
Liam: Yeah. I feel a little better here. It would go a long way to earning some trust.
Matt: "Well, make your choice. Either I intercept and begin to work towards Thordak's ruse and set a space that convinces him perhaps I've fallen into your hands, or I go retrieve your friend from Emon. I'm not your errand boy, and we have a limited time here. Which is more important?"
Travis: Sure you are. You are our errand boy. We are your vessel to what it is you want. So get busy, and do it quickly. After all, you're very powerful. But that changes day by day, doesn't it?
Matt: "So, Emon it is. Very well. Back in a day."
Taliesin: We will start figuring out and discussing a place for the final battle. We will find a place that is advantageous. Your input, if you feel the urge to give it, is always welcome. At least to me.
Matt: "It's going to be very difficult to pry the Cinder King from his nest."
Taliesin: Your supposed death will go far for that.
Matt: "If anything, but I have no guarantees."
Taliesin: As long as everything is on the up and up, and as long as we do not catch you in deep deceit.
Liam: (whispers) Good luck with that.
Taliesin: We will make sure that the plan moves in the direction it is meant to.
Matt: "One day then."
Travis: One day.
Matt: And the image (disappearing noise).
Taliesin: He's going to send Asum to us.
Travis: So Allura, so it's clear  Seeker Asum is Raishan.
Taliesin: And has been since Raishan's appearance in Whitestone.
Marisha: And we didn't know until 48 hours ago? Tops?
Taliesin: Now, can we maybe make sure that everybody in the room is who they say they are?
Sam: Go stab everyone, Percy. One at a time.
Matt: As you say that, everyone pulls back from the table.
Laura: I'm a dragon too! (evil laugh)
Liam: Hi. Larkin.
Matt: There he is!
Taliesin: I apologize. I didn't know what else to do.
Laura: You thought you were going to stab him!
Liam: Yes you did, Percival.
Laura: That was not a play!
Travis: Yeah, let's be real about it. "No tricks in this room!"
Liam: Yeah, you shifted gears very quickly there.
Laura: No tricks.
Taliesin: I've told no lies in this room.
Liam: Uh-huh.
Travis: (fake cough) Whiff!
Taliesin: I tell that creature no lies. Ever. That is a green dragon. There is no tricking it, there is no deceiving it. There is just telling as much truth as you can get away with.
Matt: As you're talking, you feel a tug on your right arm. And you look over and you see Cassandra, who has come over to your side and is pulling on your sleeve with a very intense look in her eye. She goes, "Percival. I can watch Whitestone. I can get the people fed. I can keep the people armed. I can organize the day to day. I can't keep it safe from that."
Taliesin: Which is why I would ask everyone to please not antagonize it.
Matt: "Percival. Percival! I don't know what you dragged us into in this, but I need you to pull us out of it. I can't do this."
Taliesin: I've moved the battle. That is the best that I know how.
Matt: "How long have you known?"
Taliesin: Two days.
Laura: Not long, Cassandra.
Taliesin: Two days.
Sam: Maybe three.
Marisha: We were forced.
Taliesin: The day before we left to kill the white dragon.
Sam: There's a time difference.
Laura: And if we had told any of you, your life would have been in danger.
Taliesin: This was the best way I knew to keep her from destroying this city outright. This was the best way that kept her from telling the red dragon where we are. And the longer that we can keep her a tenuous ally, the longer Whitestone will stand.
Sam: When she does come back with Asum, this plan that we started in on-- it's a good one?
Taliesin: I think so.
Sam: Well, we have Raishan convince Thordak that we're amassing forces in Kymal or something. Thordak sends Raishan to get us. We "kill" Raishan.
Laura: Mm-hmm.
Sam: And then Thordak comes to check on our dead bodies?
Taliesin: We send word of a dead dragon.
Sam: How can that plan fail?
Liam: I mean, I'm not the only one who thinks she's more dangerous than he is at this point.
Laura: Oh yes. I think if we give her access to Thordak's body afterwards, we're asking for a lot of trouble.
Taliesin: Which is why if Keyleth can figure out a way to cure her of this disease, it takes a big card off the table.
Liam: We've got 24 hours.
Marisha: I have ideas.
Taliesin: We have more than that, because it's going to take quite a while. That's how long we have to make a plan.
Laura: Question. What if we do actually just kill her?
Sam: Raishan?
Laura: When we fake that we're killing her, what if we kill her?
Marisha: Just actually kill her?
Taliesin: She's going to be expecting that, and it will not work.
Travis: And she's super slippery. She just totally like evaded Percy's sneak stabby-stab.
Liam: Is there anyone around right now?
Matt: Oh yeah, no. Allura, Drake--
Liam: 20, natural 20! For perception.
Matt: For perception?
Liam: Yeah. I said, "Is anyone around?" and I rolled a 20.
Matt: You guys are still in the war room.
Liam: I know, but you know what I'm talking about. You know what I'm talking about.
Matt: Oh!
Liam: There it is, it's right there. Invisible fucking Larkin dwarf dragon.
Matt: You don't see anybody else around.
Liam: All right. That's a 20.
Laura: Should we continue this conversation downstairs?
Taliesin: First, is everybody who they say they are? Please, if you would be so kind.
Travis: Oh yeah, Allura. Can we light your sage real quick, make sure everybody's on the up and up?
Matt: Allura sits up and says, "Well, I mean, it makes sense. Asum is the one that requested we not move the war room down to the--"
Taliesin: So why don't we move the war room now?
Matt: "I think that would be the best, yes. Let us all adjourn to the new space at the ziggurat. That should at least keep things honest."
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: Allura picks her robes up and--
Sam: Grog, your beard might go away.
Laura: (gasps) No!
Travis: No, it's in there.
Taliesin: It just won't grow while he's down there.
Liam: I mean for science, right? Let's go. You look really good without a beard, Grog. I've always thought so.
Travis: You shut up, you. (laughter)
Travis: We can go down there, I don't care.
Taliesin: All right.
Matt: Okay. You guys make your way down to the ziggurat. The guards come and start carrying chairs and other elements of the war room. Eventually, you're all led down through the tunnels, which have been a little more refined and given an actual more comfortable path past the now-defunct whitestone refinery that the Briarwoods had originally established. You enter the ziggurat room. It has more lighting to it than it previously did. A number of torches now line the walls, the sconces that are lit as the guards progress upward. You can see the reflection to the green glass-like Whitestone material that permeates the outside of the ziggurat. And not right by it, but partially upward there's a small wooden platform that's been where the main base of operations for research and study is here. You see a number of desks set out. It's been built alongside of the large pyramid-type structure. And eventually, you all adjourn up into that space. As you go up there, you all feel a significant drop in enchantment. All of your magical items, all of everything, gradually fades in this space. So, Grog, you actually feel your musculature-- the Titanstone Gauntlets themselves, the effect begins to completely fade back to your classic, Grog-like strength.
Travis: I feel totally fine.
Laura: Are the walls still like people?
Matt: Oh, do you want to go to the top of the ziggurat and check?
Marisha: Oh.
Taliesin: Not yet. After the meeting.
Marisha: Did they have like a clean-up crew down there?
Taliesin: It's a guy on a scaffold with a scrub brush going, "Ew. Ew."
Laura: They're really clean naked bodies now.
Liam: Brush cleaning out the fingernails.
Matt: At this point, they're looking around. Everyone who's journeyed with you towards this new meeting place, the ziggurat, is of the same physicality they were at the meeting room. Any illusions that would have been cast aside or dispelled at this point seem to not be present. So everyone is, by all intents and purposes, who they say they are.
Sam: Okay.
Taliesin: And this also means it would probably be impossible to scry in this room.
Marisha: Yes.
Matt: Allura nods. "Yes, actually. Yes."
Taliesin: Excellent. This is where all talk must happen now.
Laura: Where it should have been happening.
Taliesin: So now you know what we've been dealing with for the past 72 hours. She did help with the death of that dragon. In fact, I doubt we would have survived without her aid. She could have very easily left us there to die.
Laura: It's true. She actually revealed her entire form during the battle. Which is quite diseased.
Taliesin: At least it appeared diseased.
Marisha: She's definitely not as strong as the others, but far more clever.
Taliesin: And she knows where we are. And what our plans are. And every inch of this place. Including this thing.
Matt: "Well then, what do you presume we do?"
Sam: We don't really have a choice, we have to work with her to some extent. We can make it hard for her, and we can be assholes to her, and go tell her to get Asum for us. But other than that, we have to work with her.
Liam: What's the benefit of working with her?
Sam: Because if we don't, she can destroy Whitestone whenever she feels like it.
Liam: What if we tell her we're going to fake her death, and then we kill her for real?
Sam: That's fine, if she ever gets close enough for us to kill her.
Taliesin: She's not going to.
Travis: She evaded it really easy.
Sam: Why would she need to come face to face with us in that plan, ever? She could say, "I'm going to go meet them in Kymal. Oh, I died!"
Taliesin: Our best bet is maybe-- hopefully enough of us still have our strength. Maybe at the end if she has been ravaged by the red dragon.
Travis: I agree.
Laura: And then we try to defeat her after that?
Travis: I agree. Our play is the finish line. That's it. Not a moment before.
Laura: But we have to beat her to it. If she gets a hold of that stone--
Marisha: It's what she wants.
Laura: Yes.
Taliesin: Our hope is to break the stone.
Marisha: We can't break the stone.
Taliesin: Only because no one has.
Sam: If we draw Thordak to us, at least we control the battlefield. She could still be lying in wait to pounce on his body the second we kill him.
Liam: If. We have to hope that she's actually going to fight with us. She's done it once. We don't know that she's going to do it again. We don't know.
Marisha: They mentioned moving the stone that shouldn't have been able to have been moved. Correct? They moved it inside of Thordak, and then Thordak left with the stone in him, right?
Taliesin: Yes, which I don't think should have been possible.
Marisha: Right. So how did they do it? Because I'm also looking at another thing that is supposedly immovable.
Laura: Supposedly.
Marisha: Supposedly.
Taliesin: Supposedly.
Taliesin: Oh, it's possible. Nothing is impossible.
Laura: Are you suggesting we put the vortex of doom inside one of us?
Marisha: Kind of, yeah. That's what I was--
Matt: Allura immediately puts her hands up and goes, "No! No. No. No."
Marisha: There's got to be a way to move it.
Sam: To do what, though?
Matt: "This is an absence of magic. It is a void of magic. It is a maw that devours magic. The enchantment that we put within Thordak is pure magic."
Liam: And you've been working on it for months, and you are smarter than us.
Matt: "Well."
Laura: Right. No way to transport it? None at all?
Marisha: It could be the only thing that could break the stone!
Laura: Think about it. If we could get that stone next to the vortex, he'd be fucked.
Matt: "Right! So what, we take a few wooden two by fours and push it along? Look, everything I know, everything I've studied, everything I've spent my entire life working for is useless near that."
Laura: This is a temple to Ioun, right?
Matt: "It was."
Laura: The goddess of knowledge?
Sam: Sure.
Matt: "The only person I know of who rightfully worshipped Ioun was Brom."
Laura: Brom?
Sam: Of the Clasp?
Matt: "Arbiter Brom. He was of the council with us."
Laura: And he's in Emon, potentially?
Matt: "According to Raishan. With Tofor and--"
Laura: Brom's with Asum?
Matt: "Yes."
Taliesin: What holds it there? It's a shame we can't open a giant door and push it down here.
Marisha: What did you just say?
Taliesin: We can't do it.
Marisha: What? Say it again, one more time?
Taliesin: It's a shame we can't open a giant door and push the dragon in here.
Sam: How on earth could we--?
Taliesin: We couldn't do it. It won't work. Because that side of the door won't open by its very nature. No door can be opened to this room. No one can get in or out without someone walking.
Laura: You couldn't have used the gate scroll in here.
Taliesin: I'm trying to even conceive of a machine that could move this. But I don't understand why it's here in the first place.
Sam: I don't think the secret to defeating Thordak is moving this thing.
Taliesin: It's a shame we couldn't. We have a line in the sand of how close we can get to this thing with magic, correct?
Matt: "This way." And she leads you back down the ziggurat, out to the entrance where you guys entered this large chamber. And about 20 or so meters back, you can see there is a specific wooden support beam that is structured within this tunnel. And on that beam, elements of it are painted black. And she goes, "This is the perimeter in which the siphon devours magic inward."
Marisha: How big is it? How big is it, roughly?
Matt: What, the--?
Marisha: Perimeter.
Matt: "I'd say it'd take a half-mile?"
Marisha: Damn, this place is really big. And it's encased in stone, yeah? Kind of, right? Were we encased in whitestone? Right?
Taliesin: In stone. I've got a terrible idea.
Marisha: Tell me!
Taliesin: What happens to magical creatures when they enter the circle? Have we experimented at all to find out what would happen to a magical creature? A creature whose very essence is magic?
Matt: "I don't know."
Taliesin: (sighs) There's no humane way to do this.
Sam: Sure there is! Kiki, get a fey creature in here.
Laura: Yeah, that's what I was thinking, send him in.
Marisha: Oh yeah, they die and they go right back to their plane.
Sam: No, I think they just die.
Taliesin: And even if they do go back to their plane, they may not be able to in there, they may wither and actually die. I just wanted to put that on the table.
Marisha: Are you trying to make me feel better about any of this?
Taliesin: I don't want to lie to you about this. I've been practicing intense levels of honesty, if not telling the whole truth.
Travis: Sidebar. Do we have all the Vestiges that the sphinx told us about?
Sam: No.
Travis: What else is there?
Sam: There's one in the Fire Plane.
Liam: Something for Pickle.
Marisha: The Dawn Martyr. Dawn Martyr?
Travis: I know I'm not the smartest one in the group, but we don't know what the fuck we're talking about with this little sphere. Why don't we go find that last Vestige and see what it turns up?
Laura: I don't know if we have a lot of time--
Taliesin: We have time. In a day.
Marisha: I mean, only if we--
Taliesin: In a day she returns. We chose a place, we move our forces in there. We have days where she could be looking for us, and then when she disappears it's going to take a day or two for him to really find out. It will be about three to four days before anything actually happens.
Sam: What are we doing, going after this Vestige when-- can any of us even use it?
Marisha: Pike.
Laura: Pike.
Travis: Well, I can. Kima might. I'm not much for poetry, but it seems sort of poetic that Thordak came from the Fire Plane, and the last Vestige we're looking for is in the Fire Plane.
Marisha: Also, we might be able to find some information on the stone.
Laura: This is true.
Sam: The Fire Plane isn't just like Dallas.
Taliesin: It actually is quite like Dallas. I think that's a very reasonable comparison.
Sam: It's a horrible place where we could all die.
Travis: Well, so was the Feywild, and we didn't--
Sam: We're risking our hides for something that might benefit one of us, maybe.
Laura: Well, that's what we've been doing this entire time.
Travis: That's basically all of our choices at this point.
Marisha: We could go in with the rest of the Fire Ashari that are there. We can meet up with Cerkonos. Is this whole ziggurat encased in whitestone?
Matt: The ziggurat itself is built from stone, and then the upper exterior of it is covered in this green glass-like substance that is distilled whitestone residuum.
Taliesin: I have a plan. It will take a little bit of time, but it's vicious.
Marisha: What?
Taliesin: It probably wouldn't work. Well, let's find out what happens to a creature inside here before we--
Travis: A regular creature or a Feywild creature?
Marisha: Okay, I actually do have Conjure Woodland Beings.
Laura: That's not a magic creature though, it's a woodland being.
Marisha: No, woodland beings can be like fey creatures.
Laura: Really?
Marisha: Mm-hmm.
Taliesin: Something small.
Travis: Do it! Oh my god, do it!
Laura: Just a fairy. Just a teeny little fairy.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: What level's that? That is--
Marisha: Third level.
Travis: Wait, if you like conjure it outside and walk in, is it going to go poof and disappear?
Laura: Potentially. We'll find out.
Matt: A fourth level, you mean.
Marisha: Sorry, fourth level.
Matt: Yeah, so you can create some fey creatures, yeah. What are you summoning?
Marisha: What makes sense?
Travis: What's going to squeal?
Taliesin: We're on one side of the line. Send it to the other, see what happens.
Marisha: I'll summon a--
Sam: Little pixie!
Marisha: A little-- (stutters) A little pixie.
Laura: (copying Marisha) Lalittle lilittle li-- A little pixie.
Marisha: A lillul lillul pixie.
Sam: Hi, little pixie! Go in that room!
Taliesin: This may be, by the way, how we deal with Raishan.
Marisha: What?
Matt: Okay. So you conjure a pixie?
Marisha: Sure. And I send her in.
Matt: Pixie flies in. Continues to fly in. Nothing happens.
Taliesin: Pixie's fine?
Matt: Pixie seems fine.
Sam: Pixie's not a magical creature, I guess.
Laura: Isn't it, though?
Sam: Has magic, maybe. Isn't a magical being.
Taliesin: Can you make the pixie do something? Try and have the pixie do something magical.
Marisha: Yeah. I have them. Can't they cast like Confusion or something like that? Or can they cast--?
Sam: Polymorph.
Matt: They can cast Confusion, they can cast Polymorph, they can cast things like that.
Marisha: Hey! Try and Polymorph me!
Matt: Pixie turns around and nothing happens.
Marisha: Nothing?
Matt: Pixie looks confused. "What? Sorry."
Taliesin: It's all right, you did very well. How do you feel? Do you feel all right?
Matt: Technically, this pixie--
Travis: Touch it.
Matt: We'll say for the purposes of this, sure. There is very basic communication. The pixie is--
Taliesin: Tinkerbell.
Matt: Yeah, Sylvan is the language that it speaks, so it is close enough to Elvish that those who speak Elvish can like interpret elements of it.
Marisha: Oh, I know Sylvan. I know Sylvan. Hey! How do you feel?
Matt: "A little queasy, that's all."
Marisha: Queasy? Yeah?
Matt: "It's weird."
Marisha: Hmm. Hey, will you do me a favor and don't hold it against me?
Taliesin: Why don't you let it leave?
Travis: Just go do it! Just do it!
Marisha: Will you go touch that black orb?
Taliesin: No no no, don't do that!
Travis: Yeah yeah yeah, go touch it. She meant what she said.
Matt: I mean, she's only listening to her, so--
Liam: Yeah, it doesn't matter what Percy says.
Travis: Do it. Fucking do it.
Sam: Let's see if it goes to the other world.
Laura: You don't know where it goes.
Taliesin: That's right, I don't know.
Liam: No, you don't know what she's talking about. It's Esperanto.
Travis: You don't speak Sylvan.
Taliesin: I've already done my dumb stuff for the day.
Laura: Stab stab stab.
Taliesin: It would've been so badass!
Matt: All right, so yeah. You continue to walk as the pixie floats up towards the top of the ziggurat. You get to the top and you notice that no, all the bodies have been removed. It's been cleaned up.
Laura: It's just an empty pyramid-y thing now.
Matt: Yeah, it's like this empty platform now with the walls, encased within a small colosseum. And there it is, the general spinning black marble. The pixie approaches and like--
Laura: (whines worriedly)
Taliesin: (whines worriedly)
Marisha: Yeah! Yeah. You got this.
Matt: Touches it, and you watch the pixie go-- and is gone.
Marisha: Hmm. So as we expected, yeah.
Travis: Well, hold on. Wait.
Laura: Wait.
Marisha: I don't think she's coming back, yeah.
Laura: Hey Allura, how many things did you throw in the orb?
Matt: You see her in the back leaning against the wall like she's seen this a hundred times. "Oh, many things. Chairs, outfits, pieces of stone, metals. We've put all kinds of things."
Sam: Any animals?
Liam: Anything alive?
Matt: "No, nothing living!"
Travis: What was the biggest thing you put in there?
Matt: "Your desk chair. Cassandra said it would be all right."
Taliesin: (sighs) Yes.
Laura: Have you put a box around it? Just encapsulated it completely?
Matt: "We tried, and upon moving it, once it contacted it did not move with the box. It just crushed and absorbed the box itself."
Taliesin: So. I have an interesting request which may end up being too complicated. I'm not sure.
Travis: Probably.
Taliesin: Can we build a teleportation sigil directly above it? Outside of its range?
Matt: "Given the better part of a year, yes."
Liam: So you're saying there's a chance?
Taliesin: Can we build one in the hallway leading to this room?
Matt: "A temporary one, as in like a--"
Marisha: Like a spell.
Matt: "Like a brief spell, yes. I can do that now. It's the permanent installation of one that takes an exorbitant period of time."
Taliesin: As long as we have some way of knowing what point at which we re-enter this room. Then we at least have a way of having it chase us into its range.
Marisha: Oh man.
Taliesin: Or better still, if we run one way and it runs the other.
Marisha: Have you been in contact? Have you attempted to scry, or do a Locate Object spell on anything that you've thrown in? Probably?
Matt: "Yes, but unfortunately there's been no way of connecting anything that goes through. It just vanishes."
Sam: I think that's a fucking terrible idea.
Travis: (chanting) Fire Plane.
Sam: What are you talking about? We can't lure a dragon into a teleportation circle big enough to get a dragon through, and then somehow assume that the dragon's going to keep running into the room with no magic? And then what are we also going to assume? That it's going to jump into the crazy Vecna circle and become a ninth level of hell after that? We have no idea! That's a terrible idea! I'm vetoing it.
Travis: I third that.
Taliesin: The cereal shiller has a point.
Liam: That idea's not grrreat! (laughter)
Laura: You've been waiting! Waiting to find a time to say it, haven't you?
Liam: Nope! Just drunkenly popped in my head.
Taliesin: Yes, Grog. You have a point?
Travis: Fire Plane.
Taliesin: If we are going to do the Fire Plane, if that is going to happen, then we cannot go until preparations start getting made for the place at which we're going to have this confrontation. We need to pick a point, preferably far from here. Is there a ruined city?
Sam: What, for us to lure Raishan-slash-Thordak to?
Laura: What about Fort Daxio?
Sam: Fort Daxio's near Emon. And so is Kymal.
Matt: "Well, it's north of Emon. Kymal's east of it. And the Ironsea Ridge. But Kymal's filled with civilians."
Laura: Fort Daxio has an army gathering there already, right?
Matt: "Well, Fort Daxio has a piece of an army. Most of it went to Syngorn and we haven't heard since."
Taliesin: Fort Daxio at least does have soldiers already.
Laura: Well, Syngorn is gathering their forces as well.
Matt: "Have you reached out to Syngorn, let them know this was going to happen? You mentioned that they were coming to power?"
Laura: We have.
Matt: "Well, we need to reach out to the resources we have and call them in."
Laura: Yes.
Liam: Yes.
Taliesin: Everyone, is Fort Daxio where this confrontation is going to happen?
Laura: We haven't been to Fort Daxio.
Sam: We should probably go check it out. But everyone wants to go to the Fire Plane, get some armor.
Taliesin: We go to Fort Daxio to start everything up. While they prepare, we can maybe make a trip to the Fire Plane once things are prepared. They will not need us to organize the armies and gather forces.
Marisha: It's really frustrating. I feel like we have all the pieces here. I just can't figure it out.
Taliesin: We have all the pieces buried underneath every civilian.
Marisha: I'm really obsessed on this ziggurat thing. Have you thrown any whitestone into the ziggurat?
Taliesin: No, don't do that.
Laura: I'm sure they already have.
Matt: "We have."
Sam: It's going to be fine, Keyleth. After we kill Thordak and Raishan becomes super-powerful, Raishan will come here and get the Vecna orb and unleash all sorts of hells on the world, and then we'll know what it was!
Liam: I mean, that's basically what's going to happen.
Taliesin: That's a very good plan.
Sam: Yeah, I mean, we can't really do anything about it.
Marisha: Which is why it's frustrating, because I feel like we can beat her to the fucking punch.
Liam: Yeah, I think Thordak's a fucking meathead and we should take care of Raishan ahead of time.
Marisha: You already know how I feel.
Taliesin: I think you're mad to think we can do that. I think that you're mad to think we're actually going to see her again before the final confrontation.
Travis: Yeah, we're not going to see her.
Taliesin: I think she's going to stay far, far away.
Laura: No. She knows.
Taliesin: I took that shot specifically to see where she was sitting and see where we were sitting with her.
Laura: You took that shot specifically to stab her three times in the back, Percy.
Taliesin: It also worked that we found out she wasn't there.
Liam: Yes, revisionist history.
Laura: I thought you were practicing honesty.
Travis: That's like saying I farted because my stomach hurt, and then I found out it stunk as well.
Taliesin: I was aware it could go horribly wrong, which is why I was prepared to say something.
Liam: Likely, there's a master plan; we understand.
Taliesin: I'm not saying it was the best plan.
Travis: Cool. Fort Daxio then? Check it out?
Taliesin: Does anybody else have anything to say to this?
Marisha: We basically don't have a plan. We're going somewhere until we come up with a plan in the meantime.
Taliesin: No, we're preparing all of our forces at Fort Daxio.
Matt: Cassandra says, "If Fort Daxio is to be the place where this is to go down, then that will be the place we'll send our allies."
Marisha: Jesus. Let's put all of our eggs in one basket.
Sam: Yeah. But what else are we saving them for? This is it.
Taliesin: This is the omelette. Where do we want our allies? Far away from the red dragon?
Marisha: You don't feel like we are stepping into every trap that Raishan has laid?
Sam: What else can we do?
Marisha: Kill Raishan first!
Sam: You can't heal the disease. We can't control this orb. There's nothing else we can do.
Marisha: It doesn't matter! We just need her to believe that I can cure her disease.
Laura: Let's be honest. Raishan wants Thordak dead. That's her endgame as well.
Liam: That's the only thing we can count on.
Taliesin: Because right now Raishan could have us all dead.
Travis: Are you saying you want Raishan to go with you one-on-one so you can do the Melora thing, and then maybe you take her out? And you want a shot at it before we try anything else? Because I'll grant you that.
Marisha: I could try. That's what I was trying to bait her into.
Laura: She's not going to show up.
Matt: Allura brings her hand up, "I've done plenty of research on these. I mean no offense to you, Keyleth, but you convincing an entity that exists on deception through deception to believe you in that regard? And based on that conversation, she already seems to see through that ruse. I would not recommend it."
Liam: Allura, any chance you know the Gate spell?
Matt: "No, that is far beyond my capabilities."
Travis: Yeah. Rare spell, that.
Taliesin: I'm not mad in thinking that trusting this creature is the only option available at this point. I say "trust". Walking in this direction is the only direction available at the moment. Any attempt to counter her at this point leads to our destruction. She has us.
Travis: Yeah, no, we got that. So does anybody want to do anything else before we go to Daxio?
Sam: The only thing else that we can do before we go to Daxio is to send word to our allies. I think we should grab Kash, send him out a quick list of who we need to contact. Ravenites. Feywild wolves.
Laura: Syngorn.
Liam: Syngorn.
Liam: Zahra, Kash.
Laura: Your people, Keyleth.
Liam: Kima. Allura.
Travis: Wolves are on another plane. Herd is wandering.
Laura: J'mon.
Sam: That's by flute. Wait. What about our brotherhood of-- what do we belong to? Not the Clasp--
Liam: Slayer's Take.
Sam: The Slayer's Take! We can get them too, right? We have money, we can hire them! We have a hundred thousand gold!
Taliesin: You want to hire them... Oh.
Laura: We could take out a contract against the red dragon.
Sam: Sure.
Laura: We can hire them to kill a red dragon.
Liam: Yeah. What are we going to do with that money when we're dead? Nothing.
Marisha: We are sending everyone we know into one centralized location. Do we really feel like that's a good idea?
Sam: Yes, this is what we've built towards.
Marisha: Is it?
Taliesin: We're building a trap. Where would you put them?
Marisha: We didn't talk about throwing everyone we loved into the frying pan. That was not the trap.
Sam: What did you think we were making allegiances for? Just to hang out with them? We need them to fight and die for us!
Marisha: I'm down for the cause of the war. Just not when it's a stupid fucking plan!
Sam: We're going to be there too!
Marisha: We don't have a plan! We're just asking everyone to meet in one location.
Liam: Well, we're talking about building an army.
Marisha: And then doing what with them?
Liam: To kill the general.
Marisha: And then doing what? They're just going to be sitting there! They're going to be sitting ducks!
Taliesin: They're not going to be sitting there. We're going to make tactical decisions about where to place everyone in and around the fort.
Marisha: I've accepted that people are going to die. I've accepted that. I do not condone sending people to their slaughter when we don't have a goddamn plan.
Taliesin: Well, what's your counter proposal? Because I feel like we're making a plan here.
Marisha: I don't think that it's smart to put every potential ally we know in one spot. Can we not divide it up? Can we not find places nearby?
Taliesin: They won't all just be in the fort. Everyone is going to be placed.
Sam: Once we get there and survey the area, we can come up with a comfortable plan. You can make some caverns for them to hide in.
Taliesin: We're going to also create ways of making sure the dragon can't take flight. We're going to make sure that everyone has a purpose and a place. It will not be just a giant swath of people ready to die.
Sam: We're just getting them in the right county.
Taliesin: We just need everybody in the city.
Marisha: But we also know that Raishan knows everything that we're going to do.
Laura: She doesn't know Fort Daxio. She doesn't know any of that.
Taliesin: She doesn't know Fort Daxio. Honestly, she's going to have to know. She's going to have to send them. There's nothing we can do about it.
Laura: She doesn't know about J'mon Sa Ord.
Marisha: I don't trust that she doesn't know anything. I'm going to assume that she knows everything.
Taliesin: That's a good assumption.
Travis: Yeah, that's fair.
Taliesin: Even so, there's nothing that she's not going to know, because she is what is luring him out. If we fought him here, she already knows where we are. Right now she knows where we are. She knows everybody that's here.
Sam: I go behind Keyleth and stab three times. (laughter)
Taliesin: Is this happening? Are we doing this? I'm so excited. Yeah!
Sam: No! I would so lose.
Marisha: Bring it! She's on edge, all right?
Taliesin: We have to play this the way we have to play it. It's dangerous, but we have to assume that she will most likely not betray us until the end.
Sam: Right now, somewhere, there's a man on an airship going, "Do you see it yet?"
Laura: They're keeping an eye out at this point, all right?
Taliesin: They're being good. We have to assume that she has not betrayed where we are yet, which would have been so simple. It would have been so simple just to raze this city to the ground.
Marisha: Look at what we did with Ripley. We walked into every trap she set for us blindly. We got cocky. We got bold. We fell for all of that.
Laura: Keyleth, we have to fight eventually. We're not trying to be cocky about it; we're trying to set up an army!
Sam: Might I point out, Keyleth, that Raishan wanted us to go to Emon and face Thordak, and we are already not following that plan.
Laura: This is true.
Taliesin: That is the other option. Go there.
Liam: We can count on her to be duplicitous. We gather forces; we take out Thordak. We'll figure out how we're going to do it. We're not saying throw every spaghetti at the wall. We figure that out. Then we talk about the real enemy.
Taliesin: It's a fort. We prepare the fort. It is what a fort is for.
Laura: If the opportunity arrives to take out Raishan, then we do it. Beforehand. If not, immediately after Thordak is dead.
Marisha: We could all be dead.
Taliesin: Why are we not dead right now? Explain to me why we are not dead right now.
Marisha: I honestly don't know.
Taliesin: Because this fight is going to happen. That is why we are not dead right now. It's the only possible explanation that I can conceive of. This fight is inevitable. Once this fight has happened? Oh, we're dead. After this fight, I have no doubt that we are in grave danger.
Laura: After this fight, there won't be enough people to bring us back anymore. (laughter)
Taliesin: But this fight, this first fight, is going to happen. And we need our forces, and we need them prepared, and we need them not marching into a city. We need them in a city holding siege. Preparing to tackle, to grapple, and to subdue as best we can. To be difficult to find, to be surrounding. We need all of these things, and we cannot do any of these things unless we bring him to a place where all of our power is.
Marisha: Let's go check out Fort Daxio.
Travis: Hey! (laughter)
Taliesin: Hey! (laughter)
Taliesin: Isn't it interesting that we all feel the need to convince her, no matter what? I'm just pointing that out.
Liam: Well, I don't know how we're going to get the king out of the castle, but yeah.
Laura: We need to figure out if Fort Daxio is the place to send everyone, all right? We got to fucking check it out.
Travis: Let's put one foot in front of the other first, shall we?
Liam: Let's go buy some black powder. This is the time.
Sam: How do we get there? We don't know of any trees there.
Matt: (as Victor) "No!"
Marisha: I can scry.
Taliesin: Ironically, any town where you go to buy black powder, it's always him. It's really interesting. I don't know why.
Liam: And he's in 16-bit every time! (laughter)
Sam: Do we know anyone in Daxio? Can you scry there to find a tree?
Marisha: I can scry there regardless and find a tree, yes.
Taliesin: Does the rest of the council approve of this ridiculous plan?
Travis: Yes, I approve.
Marisha: This non-plan.
Matt: Allura says, "Yes. I mean, I don't know anyone in Daxio at the moment. Riskel was the only one. Or Riskel was the one I knew with a connection there, and his father, Mikael, was in Syngorn."
Taliesin: Do you think that they will be agreeable to this plan?
Matt: "Who? Those who are there, most likely. Here, I'll give you a written..." and she pulls out a small little side scroll pouch. Scribbling a note and says, "This is a decree from the council. They'll have to listen to you." She finishes writing it, rolls it up, "So they'll be at your disposal. It's not the army; it's the reserves."
Taliesin: Any powers that you can think of, let them know where we are heading. Do not let them know the plan. But let them know that if there are forces to gather, they are gathering in that direction.
Sam: And don't share our carefully crafted plan with anyone. The details are so precise and exact! You must keep them secret.
Taliesin: The more precise details you have in a war plan, the more things that will inevitably go wrong in the first ten seconds.
Sam: Hey, how about we go to Daxio, and then you guys can catch up? The airship arrives in a couple of days.
Matt: "We'll do that. And then we're meeting you at Daxio, correct?"
Travis: Yeah. (chants) Dax-i-o. Dax-i-o.
Taliesin: (chants) Dax-i-o. Daxio!
Matt: "Very well. Daxio it is. We'll see you soon."
Sam: On the morrow.
Taliesin: No, we plan.
Sam: Be pleased.
Liam: Beep beep.
Laura: Beep beep.
Matt: Beep beep. Bidet.
Marisha: Bidet. (laughter)
Matt: And with that, we'll finish the night's session, picking up here for next week.
Marisha: We're finishing it now?
Matt: Well, yeah. It's 10 30.
Travis: What was under that blanket?
Matt: I don't know. You'll find out, I guess.
Liam: Dumbfuck ending.
Marisha: Sorry, guys.
Taliesin: I tried to stab a dragon. I swear, I tried.
Travis: No, we know you did.
Taliesin: I tried to end the game. I thought the game could totally have been ended right there.
Liam: You've got that gunslinger sneak attack times ten damage against a green dragon.
Taliesin: Man, I did the math on what that could have done.
Matt: It could have been nasty, had it been a less tricksy dragon, maybe.
Taliesin: Had it been a less tricksy dragon, that would have been...
Liam: Matt, you've got a little something right--
Matt: (as Victor) There? Here?
Laura: Right there.
Liam: You got it. (laughter)
Laura: You got it. (laughter)
Matt: (as Victor) I get to enjoy this for a little bit, at least.
Travis: We should have him walk down the street and take bets on how long it takes him to get arrested. (laughter)
Liam: Just put him on Melrose.
Marisha: Those YouTube videos of social experiments? Just send out Matt.
Matt: (as Victor) Two cheeseburgers. Couple of fry.
Taliesin: Filet of fish!
Matt: (as Victor) Filet of fish! (normal voice) Oh, man. All right. We'll be back next week. For whatever the hell your final plan is going to be for this.
Taliesin: This is a great plan. I am behind this plan 100%.
Matt: I am so excited.
Travis: Thank you, Loot Crate.
Matt: Thank you, Loot Crate.
Sam: Come on, Loot Crate.
Matt: I'm excited for the countdown to Thordak that we're now embarking on.
Taliesin: Maybe there will be time to run to the Fire Plane really quick.
Marisha: I was going to say, sorry for being a pain in the ass. It takes a lot for me to sacrifice all my people when a fourth of us have already been sacrificed.
Taliesin: We'll go to the Fire Plane and get them and we'll pick up an object and we'll fight a dragon. It will be great.
Travis: It's cool. I have an internal timer, and if you don't meet it, I'm going to kill all your people. (laughter)
Taliesin: The glasses make that weirdly threatening.
Liam: (singing) It's Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Heart Club Band.
Marisha: New at Sundance!
Matt: Cool, guys. Thank you so much. Everyone looks awesome. Happy Halloween, everyone!
All: Happy Halloween!
Sam: Hashtag Critical Costumes!
Taliesin: Get candy from strangers.
Marisha: Yeah, go knock on strangers' doors and get candy from them.
Taliesin: Do it! It's good for America. Eat candy from strangers.
Marisha: Totally inflated.
Matt: Rest well. We'll see you next week. (as Victor) Is it Thursday yet? [music]

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello, everyone, and welcome to Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons & Dragons. And get the somewhat adjusted, altered countdown to us going live.
Travis: False start, offense.
Matt: It's great. But yes, welcome. We have just a couple of announcements to do tonight. Nothing too long and crazy. First and--
Sam: Mine's really long, Matt.
Matt: Okay, Sam's is really long. Speaking of which, let's go ahead and get us into our wonderful sponsor for tonight, Loot Crate.
All: Loot Crate!
Matt: Thank you so much, Loot Crate. Sam, if you want to tell us a little about Loot Crate.
Sam: You guys, Loot Crate. The theme this month is Magical. Brands included Dr. Strange, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, and more. Please make a special call out to the below Dr. Strange Q-Fig Loot Crate has announced will be in this month's crate. I just did. (laughter)
Sam: But tonight I've prepared, because we all need just some theater today. I've prepared for us a small radio play.
All: Ooh!
Sam: I'd like each of you to read a part in.
Liam: Pass 'em down, pass 'em down.
Sam: Pass it down, keep passing it down. I didn't know Ashley was going to be here, so, Ashley, you can read with Travis. You are both--
Marisha: Sam!
Sam: You are both doing it together.
Marisha: The first line--
Sam: Guys, calm down. It's sort of a Dust Bowl type of a play I wrote.
Marisha: Sam!
Sam: I wrote a play, okay?
Marisha: Do I have to say this?
Sam: Yes! You do! Come on! Guys, okay, I'll be reading stage direction, Taliesin is playing Junior, Marisha is playing Mama, Liam is Pa, Laura is playing Sam Riegel. And Travis and Laura are-- Travis and Ashley are the radio sound effects duo. Let's see how this goes. August, 1929, the Badlands, South Dakota. Lights up on the McCallister Farm. Mama, a sturdy, country woman, comes in from the windy, dusty farm and slams the door. Sound effects!
Ashley: (wind noises)
Travis: (ke-thunk)
Marisha: "Junior? Junior! Git yer slowpoke, molasses ass down here."
Sam: Oh! That's me! Enter Junior, a simpleton, down the stairs.
Travis: (ke-kunk, ke-kunk, ke-kunk, ke-kunk)
Sam: Good sound effects, guys.
Taliesin: "Sorry I didn't do no chores, Mama. I'm a simpleton!" What are you doing to me?
Marisha: "You'll be sorry when I run this cat-o-nine tails over your rear end."
Ashley: (whip sound)
Sam: Yeah, good sound effect, good sound effect.
Taliesin: "It ain't my fault because school was late because Teacher Sally died the evening before last."
Sam: Come on! Project, project!
Taliesin: "It ain't my fault school was late because, well, Teacher Sally died this evening before last."
Marisha: "Not sweet, sweet Sally. My rear end, I'm going to miss her. What did her in?" I don't even know what the fuck--
Sam: Enter Pa, a drunk. He smashes a beer bottle against the family cat.
Liam: (thumps)
Laura: No, you're not the sound effects.
Travis: (glass shattering)
Ashley: (cat snarling)
Sam: There you go. (laughter)
Liam: "Oh, same thing that kills us all around here. Dust poisoning. As we all know the Dust Bowl's full of radioactive dust. It melts your face clean off of the bone."
Marisha: "It's true. And dust ebola is the second leading cause of death in the dust bowl. My rear end just can't stand this dusty dust. Deadly dust."
Sam: It should be noted that the playwright did no historical research on the Dust Bowl. (laughter)
Sam: Junior.
Taliesin: "Here, Ma, I found your bagpipes to play at the dust funeral."
Ashley: (awful yet great impression of bagpipes) (laughter)
Sam: Good sound effects!
Liam: "Oh, Lord, what will we ever do with this dust?!"
Sam: Enter Sam Riegel, a strapping traveling salesman from the big city, played by Laura.
Laura: "Hi, folks! Handsome Sam Riegel here. Only thing more handsome than me is this here Loot Crate, featuring X-X-X."
Sam: I was supposed to put in actual stuff. Promo link "lootcrate.com/criticalrole." Keep going. (laughter)
Laura: "Once you enjoy the geeky gear inside, you can use the box to clean up, well, all this dust!"
Marisha: "Can it be? A box than can cure our woes and pick us up back onto our dusty rear ends?" What's with-- why?
All: Hooray!
Sam: And so the McCallisters used a dusty old vacuum cleaner--
Travis: (vacuum noises)
Sam: And their Loot Crates to clean up all the dust in the Dust Bowl. Thus saving their farm and the American Dream. (cheering)
Travis: Holy shit. It keeps getting better.
Sam: I'm a playwright, guys.
Marisha: A few on the fly rewrites there.
Matt: And you know, based on our viewership tonight, it's a pretty good opening night. (laughter)
Matt: Far better than most playwrights.
Sam: Thank you.
Matt: So, well done, Sam.
Sam: Good sound effects, guys.
Laura: Yeah, that was good sound effects.
Matt: Awesome. Well. Next up, we have a quick announcement that a special guest is going to come in here and tag me out. We have Brian Foster. Go ahead and tag. Boom! (cheering)
Brian: Hello, hello, hello. Man, it's been a Chris Hardweek, hasn't it?
All: Oh!
Brian: There's a giant note here that says, "Kill Grog. He's gotten too powerful." All right, so we're going to talk about Talks Machina, which is the new Critical Role after-slash-talk show. (cheering)
Brian: We've all been working on this along with a lot of people at Geek & Sundry for a super long time. So we're super excited about it. It's going to start this Tuesday at 7:00pm. You can watch it on Twitch for the first four episodes, and then those are going to be available on the VOD for Twitch and on the Geek & Sundry website. You can also watch it on a website called Pro-ject Alpha dot com. (laughter)
Brian: We're going to have two or three members of the cast on every single week. Mostly from this cast. We're also going to have celebrity guests-- previous guests from Critical Role. We're going to let them back out. We're going to let 'em back out. And we're also going to have some super fans that are going to be able to be on the show. We're going to get all dirty and nerdy. We're going to talk about the previous week's episode. We're going to give away prizes every single week. We're also going to have the near-impossible task of picking out your fanart and gifs-- I said "gifs" because "jif" sounds so mushy. It's "gif", right? Yeah, yeah.
Marisha: Yeah, living language; we decide.
Brian: It's been decided and decreed, ladies and gentlemen. So here's what we need from you-- We're going to give out a bunch of Critical Role merch, we're going to give out a bunch of D&D merch, we're going to give out stuff from our friends at Wyrmwood. (cheering)
Brian: We're going to give out, it says here, a shirtless picture of Travis Willingham riding a mechanical bull.
Laura: Oh!
Travis: The photoshoot is still TBD.
Brian: Oh, I see. Yes. (singing) He's waiting for an open tanning bed. Because we get so many-- there's so many thousands of tweets every Thursday night that go out about this amazing and weird and horrible show, we are asking that if you guys want to tweet a question for us to ask the cast live on the air, we're asking that you tweet @TalksMachina, which is the official Twitter handle for our show. And use the hashtag #AskTalksMachina because that way we can track 'em, make sure we get as many of your questions as we can on the show. Send your fanart and gifs to talksmachina@gmail.com anytime between Thursday nights during the show and Tuesdays at 9:00am Pacific Time. We're trying to feature fanart and gifs from each week's episodes since we're going to be talking about those episodes on the show on Tuesdays. So send those in. That's it. We're going to see you guys this Tuesday at 7:00pm on Twitch and Pro-ject Alpha dot com. Until then, it's high noon! (laughter)
Sam: Fix your mic there, Matt.
Travis: Yes! Look at the jaw, it's so forced.
Matt: Motherfucker. Didn't get enough of that at BlizzCon this past weekend. Okay, then. (laughs) Thank you, Brian Foster.
Ashley: That guy's hot! Is he single?
Matt: He's taken, unfortunately.
Ashley: Aw.
Matt: By you? All right, so, anyway we have one more quick announcement, Liam, if you want to take over for this.
Liam: Well it's not really an announcement, I'm just a willing accomplice with one of my favorite artist buddies. Sedona Parnham has sent something she has made specifically for Sam Riegel.
Sam: Oh, me? Oh. Why?
Liam: So it was sent to me on the sly, because you're so dear. To all of us.
Sam: Is it a radio play?
Liam: So dear. So charming. And now you will be well-rested. Please accept this gift.
Taliesin: Oh, I'm so excited.
Sam: What is this? Do I read it?
Liam: No, don't read-- it's nothing to read. Just open it up and show us all what you find.
Taliesin: Oh, my-- (laughter)
Sam: It's a pillow case. It's a pillow case.
Marisha: It's size appropriate.
Sam: The chest hair, the nipples. It's adorable, guys.
Laura: He's so cute!
Sam: This is 400 count Egyptian cotton here. (laughter)
Liam: There's only one other copy of that pillowcase, and it is mine. (laughter)
Travis: Gross. Gross.
Sam: Are we going to be sleeping on the same pillows at night?
Liam: Yeah. I mean, we need a blanket as well.
All: (singing) Somewhere out there, (simultaneous) someone's saying a prayer! (simultaneous) if love will see us through!
Travis: You're in different parts of the song.
Matt: For all you Critters who are under the age of 35, you have know idea what we're singing. I'm sorry.
Travis: Go watch American Tail and Land Before Time.
Liam: So that was from Sedona who is known as @anodesu on Twitter. She's done a ton of great art for this show. She's one of my favorites; she's a buddy now.
Sam: She's my favorite now.
Matt: Well, thank you, guys. Unless you have anything else to kick forward, I think we jump back into the chaos of the City of Brass and the elemental plane of fire on tonight's episode of Critical Role. [dramatic music]
Matt: Hello, and welcome back, everyone. Sorry, you waited too long, Taliesin. So, last we left off, Vox Machina was slowly making their way toward the final confrontation with Thordak, the Cinder King, as well as the end of the Chroma Conclave, hopefully, or the end of modern Tal'Dorei as we know it. One way or the other. You found yourselves preparing Fort Daxio for some sort of a plot to draw Thordak out. In the process, you took the rest of your intrepid adventurers to the fire elemental plane in search of the final Vestige that you had referred to yourself by the androsphinx earlier in your adventure. Upon arriving here, you spoke with a number of efreet that ran the outskirts of the City of Brass. Entered, found yourselves immediately traced and followed, and discovering that the society here is, well, very different than ones that you're used to. You managed to barely escape a confrontation in an alleyway with two efreet. You escaped on the path of two seemingly recent-made allies for the time being, led into their establishment in which jewelry is crafted, and with a plot to hopefully find whoever this fire giant is that holds onto the Plate of the Dawnmartyr. Many of you allowed chains to be affixed to your neck and wrists so you could pass as slaves in a society where they're relatively normal under the efreet that run the city. Your new friends, Senokir and Uten, are to help guide you in the direction of the next part of your venture. So. Picking up where we left off. You guys have been led out into this main street, watching the giant lava fountain that pours out into this deeply carved pit in the center of the ground. You see flickers of flame that occasionally burst out between the various bits of stonework that make up the floor in the center of the streets here. Looking up into the sky, you can see the deep reddish-orange hue of the skyline and one burning hot sun in the sky that doesn't seem to move from its position, but grows slightly dimmer as the day goes on. You are all led out into the street with Senokir and Uten leading you out into the main area. Senokir turns back to the rest of you, this slight half-smile on his face. "So, we are to find our way to the first giant you requested. This was the one named Whaska. Is that correct?"
Laura: (whispering) Whaska. (louder) Mm-hmm.
Matt: "Let us find our way to the Zenith Forge where he does most of his work."
Travis: Forge?
Matt: "Zenith Forge. Now come. Follow me." And he tugs the chains with a sudden burst and pulls you along. As you begin walking, he begins to talk about how: "Whaska is one of the few giants that still maintains the privilege of freedom. There was a coup within their people a few years ago, seemingly orchestrated by some of their own. As such most of the fire giants in the city either were cast out or were placed in chains. And the few that remain, one of which you'll speak with on this day, is one of the ones that sold them out. So. I hope you have your questions ready."
Travis: Yeah, for you? Shitloads.
Matt: "Shh."
Travis: Sorry.
Matt: Don't talk to your master in public.
Travis: That was hot. (laughter)
Liam: I feel like you're working some shit out, here. (laughter)
Travis: Do we have a safety word?
Matt: You did not establish one. (laughter)
Laura: Oh, no.
Travis: (weakly) Oklahoma. (laughter)
All: (singing) Oklahoma.
Matt: You're led through a multitude of streets, led along the outside of this large place that he points out to you that he refers to as the furnace. "That is where the Charcoal Palace exists and the sultan of the entire city. We won't be going there."
Laura: The Chuckle Palace?
Sam: The Chocolate Palace.
Matt: "The Charcoal Palace. You are listening; you are not supposed to speak."
Laura: (whispers) I'm sorry.
Liam: Like charcoal.
Matt: "Charcoal Palace." The air itself here, as you're spending more time outside-- and the interior of these buildings aren't meant to detract heat or cool either. Most if not all of the denizens here are well-tempered against the heat. As you guys are being dragged along, I need all of you who do not have fire resistance to go ahead and make another constitution saving throw.
Taliesin: Damn it.
Travis: I'm a master of a good burn. Does that give me fire resistance?
Matt: Nope! So I think that you don't have to worry about it.
Marisha: I had cast fire resistance on me.
Matt: Yes, and how long does that last?
Marisha: It lasts an hour. Has it been an hour?
Matt: It's been about an hour now, so that's past.
Marisha: I'll recast.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: I'm going to do a reroll.
Sam: This is a saving throw, or--?
Matt: A saving throw, yes. Constitution saving throw.
Sam: Am I allowed to inspire myself on a saving throw?
Matt: Only on ability checks, sorry.
Sam: 11.
Matt: 11, okay.
Taliesin: 16.
Matt: All right. Vex?
Laura: Oh, 15.
Matt: All right.
Ashley: Seven. I burn to death.
Matt: All of you manage for the most part to resist the heat. Your sweat is starting to become more of a prevalent downpour across your face. Pike, you take a point of exhaustion.
All: Oh no!
Ashley: I'm just feeling so tired.
Matt: So you are currently at disadvantage on ability checks.
Marisha: The heat makes you lethargic.
Travis: I'm very familiar with that.
Laura: Well, it does.
Matt: Travis can work you through the exhaustion levels.
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: Heading past the buildings and constructs you see these spires that come into these rounded point towers all made from some colored glass, some dark greens and blacks. You begin to see there are deep, carved, and well-manufactured waterways or what would be considered waterways in other cities. Except here, the actual molten lava from the Sea of Fire pours through. So there are large bridges that lead over these constantly bubbling and churning long aqueducts that are filled with molten rock.
Travis: In the ground or raised or--?
Matt: In the ground. Similar to how you see most city aqueducts constructed, except for the Sea of Fire spills into it. Anything going over there is uncomfortable as the heat grows astronomically as you pass over each bridge and the air itself becomes more sulfurous. And you find yourselves coughing autonomically as the fumes reach your lungs. You begin to pass by--
Liam: We're walking out in public at this point, right? And there's people about? We see other beings about?
Matt: You do. You see as the sun which--and you've been here for two hours now so you have some time. It's still very busy in the city. And as you pass by, you see many efreet on their own business. Some coasting at different levels of height, some just traversing through. Occasionally you come across strange, horned devil-like entities that work, walk in clusters.
Liam: So, question, because I put on the Ring of Invisibility before we left.
Matt: Yes.
Liam: But Senokir, I think, might have chuckled when I gave my sister a wet willie. So as we're walking, and I've got the ring on, as we pass people I'm doing this and looking to see if anyone is reacting to that.
Matt: No one else reacts except for Senokir. Who looks back towards you with this-- (laughter)
Taliesin: Oh, God, that face.
Laura: Oh, no, he's so weird. I can hear you moving around me.
Liam: (fart noise)
Laura: Blends in with the sulfur; I don't care.
Matt: Being led through the street you eventually see two large, lithe gray-fleshed creatures that stalk by with these large hooked tails that bend over in front. You can see barbs sticking out of parts of their body and they move in clusters of three or four.
Laura: Wait, were they walking on two feet or--?
Matt: Two feet. They're bipedal. And they're stalking through--
Sam: Three feet.
Travis: With like big-ass scorpion tails?
Matt: It resembles that. The more you push into the city, the more diverse the populace becomes. And you do see the occasional human, the occasional elf, not being subjugated, though they do usually carry some sort of a bodyguard or a handful of servants at their side as well. But you do see devils walking amongst the people here. And many, many efreet that are all walking the streets with large scimitars at their side and with a uniform, a long silk vest of a dull grey charcoal pattern. And it looks to be a pendant that hangs around their neck that constantly churns with a flame. And it's a uniform for each of these, and you get the sense as they walk around singularly or in pairs, that these probably act as the patrol, as the guard of the city.
Travis: Those that are walkin' around that don't like have a bodyguard and don't seem to be enslaved, are they still wearing that white and gold cloak-y thing that our strange bit is wearing?
Matt: No. They are very diverse in their attire.
Travis: Really?
Matt: You get the sense that at least the outfits they're wearing is their signature outfit. But you also have a hard time grasping what the cultural intricacies are of the City of Brass. Being that you're Grog.
Travis: Hey, man.
Matt: As you're passing by these various aspects-- do you have a question?
Laura: Oh, I just wanted to whisper  Vax?
Liam: (coughs)
Laura: Can you pick these locks as we're walking?
Liam: (softly) Yeah.
Laura: Do it then. Subtly.
Liam: I will stealthily pick my sister's locks.
Matt: Okay. As you guys are walking past, and at this point Senokir is talking and he mentions off to the side, "We are now passing the street of artisans and the city market. This is what we call the Pyraklum. This is where we're going to find Whaska. This is where we're going to find the Zenith Forge and hopefully the end of your journey. But we can work out the specifics later." As this is happening, I need you to make a sleight of hand roll.
Liam: Get behind Grog.
Sam: (whispers) Sleight of hand roll, boy!
Liam: Well, I'm going to Luck that sucker.
Laura: Oh, God.
Liam: It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter. It's a 20.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and make a lockpicking check.
Liam: Okay. Okay, that's fine as well. That's 25.
Matt: Okay. It takes you the better part of about four or five blocks to very carefully, walking with your sister, keeping in pace with her gait, making sure not to rustle the chains or anything to distract Senokir or Uten as they walk along-- and Uten is being very, you know, very careful with his watch. Not just on you, but on the city overall. It's not like they're, you know, honed in on you per se, but very observant of the atmosphere. And you get the sense that Uten definitely, as far as the partnership goes, seems to be the more paranoid of the two of them. However as time goes on you eventually (click) hear the gentle release of the lock on one of her arm manacles and then slowly the other.
Liam: As I trail backwards behind her you hear twins, motherfucker! (laughter)
Matt: As you begin to approach a large black and gray building built from heavy, heavy stones--
Marisha: Can I talk to Uten a little bit while we're walking?
Travis: Is she picking your nose?
Liam: I thought the same thing! It's a scratch, no pick!
Marisha: So, do you play tour guide often to newcomers in this town?
Matt: Uten says, "It is not often that we take newcomers under our wing like this. Usually they are either customers or, well, to be arrested shortly. So, no, this is probably the first tour we've given. Senokir seems to strangely enjoy it."
Marisha: Playing tour guide?
Matt: "Apparently!" Motions over and Senokir, other hand out, is like, "And around this way, you can see the Fenstral Spire, which is a wonderful craft fair that happens once every two weeks!" Uten goes back to you.
Laura: He's making shit up as he's walking.
Marisha: Seems he has quite a love for the City of Brass. How long have you all been residents here?
Matt: "We've been in business together for about the better part of ten years. I've only been here about 12. It was a very dangerous scavenge to begin, but at least the laws of the normal world do not apply here. I have no idea how long Senokir's been here. He keeps a lot to himself, that one, but I trust him."
Marisha: And your business mainly deals in--
Matt: "Fine jewelry. I showed you our establishment."
Marisha: Well, as you mentioned, people ending in arrest, are you bounty hunters?
Matt: "No! I must admit, our life is not as interesting as you might be expecting, and I am sorry for that. I will say, probably should not be talking so much right now."
Marisha: Sure. Go, slaves! Walk! Forward! Like you do!
Travis: Why are you talking to us like that?
Marisha: Because-- shut up, slave! And I smack Grog with the flail.
Matt: Doesn't physically hurt, but emotionally, there's a scar.
Travis: I'm wounded! I've been gashed open!
Marisha: Forward march! (whip crack)
Taliesin: To be fair, he didn't say Oklahoma.
Marisha: You never said Oklahoma.
Travis: It's dangerous to keep a race car at a red, I'm just saying, I'm a race car at a fucking red. Pulp Fiction!
Matt: As you continue pushing forward, eventually you come to that gray building with heavy gray and dark stones. It's large, square in shape, and you see an oversized chimney that bellows out constant black smoke that pours upward into infinity. There are a number of stacks like that throughout the entirety of the city, hundreds that all eventually bleed together as they all mingle and join in the atmosphere, whatever this atmosphere is consisting of. The large doors are partially open, they're about 20 feet tall and about 20 feet as wide as well. They are made from a very dark wood, but as you get close, it's just a textured stone. You see a dull light from the inside.
Sam: Where are we, Master?
Matt: "Welcome to the Zenith Forge. So, once we enter, I would have to be the one to ask all the questions, but that would be difficult for us to do. So the choice is yours. Either we try and find a careful way to funnel questions, or we put our cards on the table and you do the talking."
Marisha: Well, I can alter myself to look like you, if you can hang back.
Matt: "You already look like Uten and other compatriots. You can still speak, I just want to make sure that, well, our slaves don't talk out of turn."
Marisha: Sure.
Travis: Have you spoken with a fire giant before?
Matt: "It's been a while. Since the upset socially, I found it best to not deal with them outside of a customer-patron relationship."
Travis: So weird. Are they good conversationalists?
Matt: "They're curious."
Ashley: You seem a little bit nervous. I can't really tell because you're so strange in a wonderful way. (laughter)
Matt: "You're sweet, little one."
Ashley: Thank you.
Matt: "They're very big."
Ashley: Okay.
Matt: "And consider that since they kept their freedom, they're probably rather cunning."
Ashley: Bigger than him?
Matt: "You'll see."
Ashley: Oh.
Matt: As he begins to tug the chains and pull you through the doorway.
Sam: Shit. What questions are we asking?
Laura: I guess we have to ask, like, hey do you have any cool collections? Do you play cards? Have you won a lot? Stuff like that.
Marisha: Yeah. What's going to make him give us this thing anyway? Do we have anything to give him?
Laura: Well, aren't we going to try and steal it once we see it? Or are we really going to try and purchase it?
Travis: Maybe he's got beef with somebody in the city and we'll go out and jack 'em up if he'll tell us where--
Laura: Or maybe if we see that he has it then we can challenge him to a game of cards?
Marisha: Or maybe-- oh!
Sam: If we see that he has it. How do we know that he has it?
Travis: Yeah, he might not have it.
Marisha: Yeah, he might not have it.
Liam: You could also chat with him and I could walk over and take it.
Marisha: Well maybe he won't know its value.
Travis: It's a suit of armor, though.
Laura: That he can't fit into because he's huge and it's for normal people.
Marisha: You still have your Locate Item, correct?
Laura: I do! Oh yeah!
Sam: Use it. Now!
Laura: Okay! I use it.
Taliesin: Now!
Matt: You're going to stop as you're being pulled into the foyer of this building in chains, and you're going to begin to cast the spell.
Laura: Oh, do I have to stop? I can't do it as we're walking?
Matt: I mean you can do it, it's a visual thing.
Taliesin: We can hold him.
Marisha: Senokir, hold?
Taliesin: One moment!
Marisha: Senokir?
Matt: "Yes?"
Taliesin: We're going to--
Marisha: Hang on, a little bit of preparation on our end, if you don't mind.
Matt: "All right. Then decide. I mean, if you wish to progress--"
Laura: As he's talking I start doing it. (laughter)
Matt: All right, it's really quick. And you basically have to pull out your component from the side there, it's a little twig and you snap it. And you continue the ritual. All right. You concentrate for a second as he's talking, and currently no. You do not sense it.
Laura: Okay. And that lasts for ten minutes?
Marisha: But it can point us in the right direction.
Matt: It lasts for up to ten minutes, yeah.
Travis: Was it 1000 feet?
Matt: 1000 feet.
Travis: Radius.
Laura: Senokir, how large is the forge?
Matt: "Well, here it's a few rooms. It's large enough to house Whaska and his servants to construct the crafts that they are good at."
Travis: What do they construct?
Matt: "As far as I know, arms, armor. You see, fire giants, they find their sense of self-worth in society by their craftsmanship. So it's a very important thing for some."
Travis: Right. Yeah. So, like, wheels? Or like weapons? Arms? You said arms.
Matt: "I said arms."
Travis: I have a hard time listening when you talk like that.
Matt: "Would you like me to speak slower?"
Travis: It might help, you know--
Laura: No! That's all right.
Taliesin: No. That's just fine.
Matt: "So. Are you to funnel questions, or do you wish to ask as a troupe?"
Travis: Funnel them.
Taliesin: Funnel them.
Laura: Funnel them.
Matt: "Then decide on your questions now, or covertly speak once we enter. But we cannot stay here in the open and continue to talk long."
Sam: Three questions, quick.
Travis: Yeah. Has he heard of the Dawnmartyr?
Taliesin: We're looking for a suit of armor he may have won in a card game.
Laura: Yeah.
Marisha: Looking--
Travis: And maybe he didn't win it, but has he seen it, heard of it--
Laura: Right. Has he seen a suit of armor--
Taliesin: --that vanished during a card game?
Travis: Question two. Does he know where it may be?
Taliesin: It has great emotional value.
Travis: And question three, if he doesn't want to tell us where, is there someone that he has an errand that he need run in exchange for--
Marisha: Do we mention the Suutan bloodline or do you think that would be bad blood? Is that bad?
Travis: (singing) Hey maybe now we've got--
All: (singing) --bad blood!
Laura: I don't know. Does Senokir think that that would be bad?
Marisha: Is it a bad idea to mention the Suutan bloodline?
Matt: "I don't know." (laughter)
Marisha: I'm sorry, you just seem to know so much about this fine city.
Matt: "I know enough. But I don't know of the bloodline specifically. I've heard of it. You can certainly inquire within. That's why we're here!"
Travis: Yeah, that's three! Has he heard of them, does he know where it is and if he won't tell us, does he need an errand run, and Suutan bloodline.
Laura: Senokir, where are you from originally?
Matt: "These questions aren't pertinent at the moment."
Laura: That's true. I was just curious; you're so interesting.
Matt: "Thank you. Now, shall we?"
Marisha: Yeah.
Taliesin: Yes, let's.
Matt: Gives a tug on the chain, leads you guys inside.
Marisha: Sorry, guys.
Matt: The interior is very dimly lit. Thankfully, most of you have some form of darkvision. This is an open, heavy hall where, in the distance, you can see four different forges that are burning simultaneously. They are being fed by a small trail of the exterior sea of lava that is being funneled into the back corner. Within, you can see there is a large anvil in the center of the room as well as a number of smaller anvils off to the side. It appears to be four human-sized figures-- you can make out the shadow of them in the darkness. They appear to be human or human-like and they're in the process of moving things behind. They have troughs of water so they can quench the heated weapons. There at the center anvil, you see a large, hulking figure standing. Dark black leather apron across the torso, currently holding with heavy tongs this large, superheated piece of metal. Red sparks fly and illuminate the room with one hit. The second splash of light, as you see this piece of metal being slowly rotated from side to side. It's beaten into a heavier shape, the dark metal having a bladed edge to it, the actual length of it probably twice the size of Grog.
Liam: What's the guesstimate on this fella's height?
Matt: I'd say in the neighborhood of 20 feet. 16 to 20 feet from this vantage point.
Laura: I guess he's the size of the zombie giants we fought.
Marisha: In Whitestone.
Matt: (hammering) "So? Go."
Marisha: You want me to talk first? Yeah, no, okay.
Matt: "Well, you're the one who wants to ask questions."
Marisha: Yeah. I got this.
Travis: Don't fuck it up.
Laura: Don't fuck it up.
Marisha: Thanks, guys.
Sam: I'm hanging back behind Percy here.
Marisha: Does this guy have a name, Senokir?
Laura: Whaska.
Marisha: Right. Sorry. Good day, fair Whaska. Strong Whaska.
Matt: The last hit strikes the blade before the hammer pulls back. The currently hunched and focused fire giant suddenly pulls back, and is standing. You see the glowing iron metal off the side, gently gliding across the ground and scraping the stone before it comes to rest at the side. The giant stands at its full height. You can see the heavily red bearded chin of itself gently singed on the edges. The dark gray ash-like skin of the face looks down at you, the eyes glowing with piercing red dots through the shadow. "Yes?"
Marisha: Hi. I am Keyleth of the Ashari druids. Sorry. I was curious if I could ask you a few questions and just take a moment of your time, which I'm sure is very valuable.
Matt: The metal blade lifts and smacks the ground with a resounding (ting) sound that rings. All the other individuals working at the forges stop their work and look up.
Marisha: We promise we can make it worth your time.
Matt: The giant looks back. Does this with his hand, you hear the wind resistance across his massive arm, and all the rest of the servants gather their materials and begin to finish what they're doing quickly and set them aside. As they begin to go about finishing up their business, Whaska takes the large, unfinished metal blade and sets it onto the anvil, puts the tongs down with this heavy, echoing clack in this large chamber. The apron gets removed and tossed over the rest of the materials and tools and walks up (slow, heavy footsteps) and stands there looking straight down at all of you, towering over your group, backlit from the glow of the red forge hue behind him. "You may ask your questions."
Marisha: We are in search of a piece of armor, something that holds great weight and many legends behind it.
Matt: "Then I have probably made it." (chuckles)
Marisha: Maybe you have. It is called the Plate of the Dawnmartyr. Are you familiar with this?
Matt: His eyes squint a bit. "I am not familiar with this. I did not make this armor you ask."
Marisha: I don't believe it is from this realm, but it resides here. It was won by a fire giant, as yourself, in a game of cards.
Matt: "A game of cards?"
Marisha: Or some call them card games. (sighs and laughter)
Matt: "I may know who you would actually be seeking."
Marisha: Really? That would be phenomenal information.
Matt: "This information that would lead you to this powerful, legendary, sought-after armor you seek-- is it worth a lot to you?"
Marisha: Well look, you shouldn't compare it to you or the things you've made, right? I'm sure--
Matt: He crosses his arms. You hear the clatter of the metal bracers he has on cling against each other as his muscles tense.
Marisha: Yes, it's very valuable for us to find it! Yes.
Matt: "Then--" He begins to walk over to the side (footsteps) grabs something in the shadow and you hear this scraping sound (creak) of heavy wood being dragged across stone as he lifts up and slams in front of you a table. A little bit larger height than you, you can look just above it, but it's a relatively large table. (boom) "Then make your offer."
Marisha: I'm assuming you don't want me to--
Travis: (coughs) Jewels.
Marisha: Right. (quietly) Do we still have all those jewels?
Laura: Ask Senokir what he means.
Marisha: I look at Whaska and I say  Let me confer with my other masters. Hey, Senokir, what does he want? What do you think is fair here?
Matt: "Well, usually as a craftsman, they want something of their craft, perhaps."
Marisha: Craft? They want something-- okay.
Matt: "Or you could always ask."
Marisha: Sure. Yeah. I'll ask. Whaska!
Matt: "Yes?"
Marisha: In speaking with my fellow masters, we want to make sure we give you something that is fair and desired. Is there anything that you might have on your wish list?
Matt: He reaches forwards and rummages through a small pouch that's affixed to the side of his belt. When I say a small pouch, small by his comparison, the pouch is about the size of you, Keyleth, and as his fingers dig around inside you hear the clanging of heavy metal and various other objects slamming into each other. As he pulls out some sort of strange, small cylinder, he lifts it to his eye and peers through it.
Marisha: Oh, he's looking to see what we got!
Matt: Scans through.
Laura: Oh no!
Matt: "For servants you all walk with many enchanted, powerful, and desirable affixions to yourselves."
Marisha: You are a very intelligent and observant man.
Matt: Puts away the cylinder into the pouch.
Marisha: Giant, fire, respected fire giant.
Matt: "Offer me some of what you could give up. And should it be worth the information you seek, it will be yours."
Marisha: Let me once again confer with my masters and enchanted servants. Okay, guys, what have we got?
Taliesin: I've got a Ring of Lightning Resistance.
Laura: Don't you have a lot of fucking weapons in your Bag of Holding?
Travis: They're just normal weapons. There's a Greatsword of Frenzy, but--
Laura: That's not bad. Greatsword of Frenzy!
Marisha: Yeah, Greatsword of Frenzy, yeah. Whatever. And you said, a ring?
Taliesin: I've got a Ring of Lightning Resistance.
Travis: Oh! My war mask! My war helmet.
Marisha: It's not magical, though.
Sam: You built that thing!
Laura: Oh, that's right, the helmet.
Travis: It's crafted, though. It's like--
Sam: But it's so ugly.
Laura: Yeah, but it's hideous. And they said they didn't do it very well.
Taliesin: We did okay.
Travis: It's inscripted. It's got my title on the inside.
Marisha: I've got my magic choker.
Sam: That won't even fit his thumb!
Taliesin: I would put it on Pinterest. Maybe we could tell him it's a thimble. We could tell him it's a handcrafted thimble.
Liam: How high up is that side?
Matt: It's about eight feet up.
Travis: Don't fucking-- don't even.
Liam: All right, that's pretty tall, that's pretty high.
Matt: Yeah, you'd have to leap for that, man. You're not pickpocketing a giant without some high rolls. Mind you, you can certainly try. I would love for you to try.
Travis: Got to feed those forges with something!
Marisha: Okay. I have a Ring of Protection +1 that no one's been using because it's just a Ring of Protection +1. Which is good, by the way.
Taliesin: And I have the Ring of Lightning Resistance.
Liam: I have two Vestiges.
Laura: Do you want to try this Greatsword of Frenzy?
Marisha: Yeah, let's do the Greatsword.
Travis: What about the Alchemy Jug?
Taliesin: No!
Liam: No way!
Travis: Which we have used-- what?
Laura: Doesn't matter, it's too cool! You make mayonnaise out of that all the time!
Marisha: And I have my +1 magic necklace.
Taliesin: Are you using that?
Marisha: No.
Taliesin: Okay.
Matt: You hear the heavy foot taps of an impatient--
Marisha: Okay, all right. Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to take the Greatsword and the Ring of Lightning Resistance and put it on the table.
Matt: Can someone run that to me real fast, if you don't mind?
Sam: Coming!
Taliesin: (hums "Yakety Sax")
Marisha: I'm glad we didn't sell any of this stuff over the course of time.
Matt: So you take the big Greatsword and (crash) put it on there, and take the ring, place it up there with it. Both of his large, meaty fire giant hands grasp the side of the table as he leans down and looks them over very intently. Takes the blade, holds it in his hands. "This is a very good start."
Marisha: Oh, yeah. Well, lucky you! I also happen to have this awesome Magic Choker +1.
Travis: Choker? Did you offer the fire giant a fucking choker?
Taliesin: He can wear it as a pinkie ring.
Marisha: I also offered him a tiny ring. He's going to use it.
Taliesin: It's going to be like a little eyebrow piercing.
Matt: As you place it there, he glances at it for a second. The little, burning pupils of the giant look up towards you. "It was a strong start. Not a very strong follow up." As he leans back up, he says--
Marisha: Wait! That's a two-for-one deal, because it also comes with this Ring of Protection. You just hadn't let me get that far yet.
Travis: Arms, arms!
Laura: He doesn't want jewelry, he wants arms!
Marisha: Oh, he wants arms, right. It's a Ring of Protection. That's cool.
Laura: Yeah, but it's not weapons.
Matt: He seems unmoved by the presentation of the ring. He says, "You are to make one more offer. If you do not, I will tell the Illuminated of the dubious outsiders masquerading as servants. Slaves sent to undermine the rule of the The Grand Sultan of the Efreet, The Lord of the Flame, The Potentate Incandescent, The Tempering and Eternal Flame of Truth, The Most Puissant of Hunters, Marshall of the Order of the Fiery Heart, The Smoldering Dictator, The Crimson Firebrand Marrake al-Sidaan al-Hariq ben Lazan."
Travis: God bless you.
Matt: "So. What is your final offer?"
Marisha: Was that one man's resume?
Travis: Vax, give him all of your Vestiges! (laughter)
Marisha: What if we give him some of the dragon scales?
Travis: What about the black sapphire?
Laura: I mean, we do have dragon scales. We do have a fuck-ton of dragon scales.
Sam: But he wants arms!
Marisha: Hang on! Whaska! A great craftsman such as yourself deserves only the finest of materials. How about some (whispers) dragon scales? Dragonhide? White dragon, what kind of dragonhide? White dragonhide.
Matt: One large hard raises up, and begins to tug at the edge of his beard.
Marisha: A lot of white dragonhide. I think we even have a fair amount.
Travis: Leave it.
Laura: Just let it go.
Matt: "Make your offer."
Laura: Get it out of the bag of holding.
Matt: His finger taps the edge of the table.
Sam: Put it on the table, people.
Laura: Give him, like, 40 pounds of white dragonhide.
Marisha: Yeah, he needs a lot. He's gonna have a big loincloth. A really big loincloth.
Taliesin: That's going to be weird.
Travis: 40 pounds of white dragonhide.
Laura: Right? Can we do it like that?
Matt: Yeah. You go ahead and unveil and put 40 pounds of white dragonhide--
Marisha: I want to make sure it's like, "One, two, three, four, five--" Five minutes later, "37--"
Laura: But it's better if it's one big piece, as opposed to a bunch of tiny little pieces.
Matt: You manage to pull all of the hide out. With flourish. As you finish, Whaska's mouth turns into this wide grin, as his arms go out (thump) scoop it all to his end of the table. "Your respect will be remembered." He takes the handfuls of it, and the sword, puts the rings into the pouch, takes the sword and jams it into his belt, takes the hide, and walks over to the side and opens this large chest. Throws everything into the side of it. Closes it. And begins to walk over. As he walks away from it you hear this heavy metal click when he's about 15, 20 feet from the chest. He steps to the table. "Now--" He then rests his elbows on the table, folding his hands under his chin, leaning forward towards you, and looks over the rest of the troupe. "There are two other fire giants here. One is Sugan. Sugan, well, was the brains behind our positions. I have this foundry and this forge because Sugan led us against our people. He currently enslaved most of our kin, with my help, and with the help of Juuraiel, and her late husband, Guras. Sugan, he currently resides within the foundry itself, as a respected chain lord to the rest of his kind. Do not speak to Sugan. You seek Juuraiel. Juuraiel runs a powerful slag mine in the pits. Her home is outside the Shrine to Surtr, called the Smoking Hammer Shrine. Look for the spiraling tower of black iron and copper. If there is any problems--" And he reaches back, and pulls forward a small, square, metal icon. And he flicks it over towards you. It looks like a small piece of copper in his thumb. But as he flicks it in your direction, you reach out instinctively to grab it, Keyleth, and then realize, "Oh, shit!" And you have to back out of the way as it (loud thud). Roughly the size of a manhole cover.
Marisha: It's a ring?
Matt: It's a large piece of square metal. You look at it and it has a series of runes that you recognize as being Giant imprinted into the metal. "This will grant you respect and conversation with Juuraiel. Should she show any resistance, just tell her I gave it to you."
Marisha: Thank you. I go over and I start trying to (grunts) pick it up.
Matt: Make a strength check. (laughter)
Travis: Use your legs. Bend the knees.
Taliesin: Oh, no!
Liam: Pull a hammie?
Marisha: Eight total.
Matt: You can get it a few inches off the ground--
Marisha: Or just a check, right? Just a straight check?
Matt: Yeah, just with your modifier.
Marisha: Okay, then five.
Matt: You get it a few inches off the ground before it (crashing sound) hits the ground with a resounding clang.
Marisha: (hisses in pain)
Matt: Almost got your finger, but you're fine.
Marisha: Okay.
Travis: Do you want me to?
Marisha: Yeah.
Travis: C'mon, Beast Mode!
Laura: You're so strong, Pike.
Ashley: I'll give it a try.
Sam: C'mon, Pike! Lift that thing!
Laura: Get it!
Ashley: Oh, definitely not. Just doesn't even move. That's a seven.
Matt: Between the two of you, given about five minutes, you guys could eventually carry it.
Marisha: You wouldn't happen to have a wallet version, would you? Don't worry about it!
Taliesin: Can we put it in the Bag of Holding?
Matt: Grabs the table and moves it back to the space he got it. (thunderous claps) "Our business is done. Good luck. And should you find yourself in any trouble, you never heard my name." Turns back to the anvil, slowly puts on the apron, and goes right back to work. (metal ringing) Holds the metal over into the large furnace to the side to let it glow to a brighter orange, to white at the tip, and begins hammering once more. As you guys gather the rest of your strength to pull that along with you.
Laura: Sexiest fire giant I ever did see.
Liam: Who was that?
Matt: There is this awkward pause. Whaska stops and looks over. (laughter)
Travis: She's touched. Just don't worry about her.
Marisha: Oh, Whaska! Is it okay if I ask one last question?
Matt: "Depends on the question. What do you ask?"
Marisha: How do fire giants feel about the name, the Suutan-- Oh, wait. I already asked him that. Never mind. You know what, been a huge help. (laughter)
Travis: You're not going to fist-bump, or anything?
Matt: (metal ringing) Goes right back to hammering.
Sam: Have you heard of the Plate of the Dawnmartyr?
Marisha: Is it too late to roll an insight check to make sure he was telling us the whole story?
Matt: You could roll one now to gain his current composure while he's hammering the large sword.
Marisha: That's pretty good. 25.
Matt: He seems focused on his work and cares less about your presence now than he did when you entered.
Travis: How heavy is that thing?
Marisha: You know, it's more cumbersome? It's awkward.
Sam: Doesn't have handles.
Marisha: It's very wide. I can't really--
Sam: Like picking up a box.
Marisha: Yes. But it's not that heavy.
Travis: You guys are doing a great job with that, really.
Marisha: Thank you.
Taliesin: It's like a piece of pre-packaged Ikea furniture.
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: How is it they didn't design this to fit into a car.
Matt: As Keyleth and Pike carry it along at an angle because of height difference.
Ashley: Got to take a second to switch hands.
Matt: Wait, wait, oh oh oh!
Marisha: You walk backwards.
Taliesin: We bought the new bed frame. It's called the "Nupe."
Travis: No you go first, you go first.
Ashley: I'll go backwards, I'll go backwards.
Travis: Turn it over!
Marisha: Are you okay going down the stairs? Okay, okay.
Ashley: Okay. (clanging sound effects)
Liam: As we leave, I give the saddest puppy stare to that wallet on the side of his belt and wish upon a star. And then I leave.
Matt: All right. You guys make your way out into the main thoroughfare. Senokir turns back. "Very well. I know where this shrine is, so follow me."
Laura: (imitates Senokir) Great. We will.
Ashley: (imitates Senokir) Great.
Travis: (whispers) Weird.
Matt: "Are you mocking me?"
Laura: What? What are you talking about?
Matt: "Right. Continue, please." Pulls the chains a little bit.
Travis: (choking noise)
Matt: An extended period of time to make it towards where the mines and the pits are for the next hour or so, walking through the streets. As you're heading in this northward direction, you pass by a series of intersections where a lot of these lava rivers merge and splinter off. You can see there are individuals that are taking elements of it and carrying off large metallic buckets. You also notice in the distance one very terrifying-looking structure. All the rest have this beautiful, grandiose design to them. There is one that looks like it is made of curved obsidian spikes, like a series of giant, clawed hands climbing up over themselves. It forms a bastion in the center of the city. This is on the outskirts of the furnace that you walked past or saw in the distance when you first left Senokir's establishment. Pressing beyond that, you notice that there is a heavy number of nasty-looking devilish entities that seem to be running patrol around the outside of that building. You get the essence that there's a heavy devil presence in the City of Brass. Devils of multiple kinds, you gather. Many you've never seen before. But they seem to be gathering around and have that same terrifying essence to them. You see some that are humanoid, but covered in long chains with hooks at the end, dragging on the ground behind them. You see some that are these nasty little impish looking creatures that leap from section to section and usually travel in packs. But they all have business; they carry small satchels at their side. They mingle with the rest of the efreet and the other denizens of the city unmolested, unbothered, unprovoked.
Liam: I wave at a couple. Quietly.
Matt: From a distance, you're not getting too close. No one seems to pay mind.
Laura: Senokir, what is that place?
Matt: "That is the embassy. We shouldn't go by there."
Travis: Why? What's in the embassy?
Matt: "Well, that's where the ambassadors to the Nine Hells reside."
Travis: Right. Nine. That's a lot.
Marisha: Is it like a cityscape?
Sam: We have diplomatic immunity.
Travis: Senokir, did that exchange go about the way you thought it would?
Matt: "Sure." (laughter)
Travis: Good.
Liam: This guy likes to party.
Matt: As you continue, eventually you come upon the outside of this beautiful temple that is made of hundreds of heavy, dark iron and metal hammers that are all molded together in this mish-mash that forms this giant archway. As you walk past it, Senokir pipes up again, "And that is the Smoking Hammer Shrine that was spoken of. Which means--" And he points over to the right. There you can see-- it resembles a home that is conical in its advancement. It's thick at the base, and it spirals upward, made of black metallic substance. Rough around the edges, like it's been pushed together, similar to the shrine you saw. But it's this spiral that continues upward. This very thick spiral that quickly tapers off into a point. You see there are levels to it, and there appear to be openings and windows. This is an abode of some kind. A very massive abode, and to a certain extent one of the more impressive buildings you've seen in this immediate vicinity.
Laura: Big enough for a giant to live in?
Matt: Easily. As you get to the front of the building, there are no windows that lead to the bottom floor. There is one very heavy door that is a half-circle. You're not sure how, where, or from which direction it opens, but it is this big, round, metal slab that stands there at the front. You do see a brass knob in the center of it, that is roughly about eye-height to you, Grog. And that's the extent of it. As you approach, Senokir turns around, "So I believe we've found our way to the home of Juuraiel, as you acquired the information about. Your turn."
Marisha: Yes, we know. Sorry.
Matt: "So? What is your intent here?"
Sam: Well, gang. I don't feel like we should say the name of the thing that we want, in case she doesn't know what it is?
Laura: Maybe describe it? I feel like the more we make it seem like it's valuable to us, the more they're going to ask in return. So maybe make it seem less valuable?
Liam: She won it in a card game and hung it on the wall as a decoration.
Laura: She could think it's a fucking trinket. It could be like nothing. It could be like a candlestick.
Travis: Do I know if giants have any natural enemies that they hate?
Matt: Other giants. Well, they have, depending on the type of giant, many natural enemies, usually that exist within the topography they're used to. You only really know about stone giants in the Cliffkeep. And maybe hill giants. There is no specific, sworn, vengeful enemies to the stone giants that you're aware of.
Travis: Did he say that Sugan, being the brains of the two, enslaved other giants?
Matt: You got the essence that there was a large coup. There was a larger free citizenship of fire giants that existed within the city. Through some circumstance, these three currently remaining giants sold the rest of their kind within the city into slavery or had them ousted. The three that did so elevated their social status and became more powerful figures within the City of Brass.
Travis: I think you might have to play him in a game of cards.
Sam: Yeah.
Marisha: Yeah.
Sam: Wait, Keyleth will?
Marisha: No. I will not.
Laura: Scanlan will.
Marisha: That's a Scanlan or a Percy thing.
Sam: Me?!
Travis: (singing) You're a hustler, baby!
Liam: I don't want to do anything. I want you to win this in a game of cards. But I'll be a plan B. They're not going to see me.
Taliesin: If you have the magic still, we could find out precisely where the armor is.
Marisha: That's true. That spell lasts for ten minutes, the Locate Item spell.
Laura: So I'd have to cast it again. I only have one more level two spell because I don't have very many spells.
Marisha: I can cast it, because I shouldn't speak here.
Travis: You did so good, though.
Marisha: Thanks!
Travis: Oh, fair fire giant! Fair? Hammering at an anvil. 20 feet tall. Oh, fair, gentle fire giant!
Marisha: Oh, giant. My fair giant.
Travis: Do we do the spell when we get up there, or now?
Laura: Do it now, because it's 1,000 feet.
Marisha: I'll cast Locate Item.
Matt: All right. As you go and pull up your component, you snap a twig.
Marisha: No one's around and going to maim me, right?
Matt: You take a moment to wait until there's no immediate approaching individuals that might see it. As far as spells go, it still requires a lot of physical action, but you can keep it condensed. As soon as you finish, you feel the immediate glowing beacon of your intent within that structure.
Marisha: It's here.
Taliesin: Is it on the ground floor? Or does it feel like it's above us?
Matt: It appears to be maybe 25 feet up from where you currently are at an angle, on the inside of the building.
Marisha: It's going to be right on the inside, hanging on the wall.
Travis: Can't Vax do some Spider-Man shit and check out the windows? He's all invisible.
Sam: It's risky.
Travis: Why? If he falls, nobody will see it. We'll just hear it.
Liam: Yeah! And then you pretend like you tripped!
Marisha: Are there really high windows?
Matt: There are no windows on the bottom floor. On the second floor up, there are, yes. Which is about 40 feet up.
Laura: No, it's definitely on the first floor.
Marisha: They're 20 feet high, so, high up.
Laura: That's what it is. It's on the first floor, up high.
Liam: So let me go.
Sam: Yeah, dude! This is what you do!
Laura: He just said there were windows on the second floor.
Liam: I'm already climbing. Would this be acrobatics?
Matt: For climbing, this would be athletics.
Liam: Athletics. Dang it, Bobby. That's a 16.
Matt: Dang it, Bobby! All right. Thanks to the rough construction of this building, it isn't too difficult to find handholds, though there are certain moments where you have to leap and catch to get there. It takes you probably the better part of 15 minutes to eventually get up to that area. The first opening you see, even though it's a window, is an oval porthole in the side of that structure. As you glance inside, getting your arm up in there, you are inside a servants' quarters, but even the servants' quarters are very large. It's simple. You see two beds in there, but the beds are 30 feet long, 20 feet wide with various hides and furs that have been patched together in this quilt-like fashion, but haphazard in their stitching. Other than that, it's not very pretty.
Liam: I think there might be a lot of giants potentially in here at any one time.
Matt: You see two very large metallic pissing pots that currently reside at the edge of each bed.
Laura: Eww, you could take a swim in it! (disgusted noises)
Matt: Were you so inclined, you definitely could.
Liam: But nobody in here now?
Matt: Nobody in here now, no.
Liam: Are there any other windows along from where I am? I know they would be a ways off.
Matt: It's a ways off to the next one, but you could try to climb over if you'd like to.
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: I need you to make another athletics check for me.
Liam: That's a 19.
Matt: You slowly shimmy over. While the rest of you guys are waiting, as you're sitting there, you can't see what's happening; you occasionally see a pebble (thunk) and a bit of dust fall. Senokir's like, "Well, how about we walk around for a moment, so we aren't looking weirdly in public doing nothing."
Sam: You're right. If you think we're looking weird, we should trust that.
Matt: "Well said." Tugs the chain, and you guys begin to be dragged in a heavy circle around the nearby street.
Marisha: I radio over the earpiece to Vax and say, hey, we're going to walk the block.
Liam: Yeah cool, I'm just hanging.
Matt: All right. You leap over, grasping, lose your hand for a second, and get back up there. The soreness is starting to kick in; you're not used to this much physical activity of this type of strength, and it's kicking your ass.
Liam: So fast, but so weak.
Matt: So fast, but so weak. It's already hot here, and the beads of sweat are pouring down your face at this point.
Liam: I have little indoor fans, like I'm a baseball mascot.
Matt: Yeah, basically. Thankfully you have fire resistance so you don't have to worry about the heat getting too much on you. It's more of the physical exertion that's getting you. You do eventually pull over to the next window. As you get to it, you pull up into the lip, and as you reach out to grab, your hand hits something. You look up, and you see that this particular opening has an imperfect, thick glass window or at least a glass surface that is currently blocking the entrance. This is actually a window that is closed.
Liam: Is it transparent?
Matt: Somewhat transparent, yes.
Liam: So it's just cloudy?
Matt: It's somewhat opaque, because of the nature of its creation it wasn't perfect glass. It's about that thick, and the entire oval is about six feet high, and about four feet wide.
Liam: Can I check for traps?
Matt: Sure, go for it. Make an investigation check.
Liam: Okay, oh good, 27.
Matt: All right. This window is trapped. As you glance around, you can see that it is. It is a window that has a slot on the side. The glass is wider than the window in a slot that's pulled up through chains that you gather would probably lift it from the inside, like a winch that would pull it open or closed. However, on the bottom, you can see along the edge. On the very bottom edge, you can see some sort of slight bit of material that doesn't match both the glass or the blackened iron structure of this building. It's a silver plate that rests where the glass sits down. As soon as it would move, a weight would shift, and something would happen.
Liam: Looking at it, do I think I could disarm it from this side? Or is it something from the inside of the room?
Matt: It would need to be something from the inside. Even if you were to attempt to do it from the inside, you would have to be at the base of the structure. From this side, it's too big for you to do anything, really.
Liam: Okay, and I can't see shit.
Matt: Make a perception check.
Liam: Natural 20.
Matt: Which gives you a total of?
Liam: Oh, perception? A total of 32.
Matt: All right. As you peer in and close your eye on the inside, you can see another bedroom similar to the one over there that you just passed by. But this one is exorbitant in its decor. You see beautiful deep red tapestries along each wall that are the full length of it. The bed itself is a canopy bed that is 40 feet tall with heavy dark silks and fabrics that dangle from it. This is a gaudy bedroom for some sort of a giant.
Liam: Any armor on the walls?
Matt: No armor visible from this perspective, no. You do see small pieces of art. There are other metallic trinkets that are built into the wall. But nothing that resembles armor, unfortunately.
Liam: Well, my arms are starting to do this thing so I'm going to start going down.
Taliesin: There's a giant velvet Elvis.
Matt: You eventually make your way down and wait for the rest of your group to return. You guys had a nice awkward walk being led quietly through the street and back around.
Travis: Can we be the monks from Monty Python?
Taliesin: Pie Iesu Domine. Dona Eis Requiem.
Matt: As you guys begin chanting to yourselves, Senokir goes, "Actually... sure, go ahead," and keeps pulling you along as you guys chant in whatever phrases you decide upon. You come back around and you see the rest of them arriving at the door, although they cannot see you. Senokir does glance over in your direction. "Ah, it appears that our walk was just enough time."
Laura: Oh shit, you can see him?
Matt: "I have my ways, yes."
Ashley: What kind of ways?
Matt: "Your brother is a fun character."
Laura: You mean a dick?
Matt: "From your standards, yes. Being from where I'm standing, I find it hilarious." (clipped laughter)
Travis: Oh god, his laugh's the worst.
Matt: "Now shall we?"
Ashley: Let's?
Sam: We don't even know how this door works. What if it's like a DeLorean and flips up or something?
Laura: Do you know how to open this door?
Ashley: Do we just knock?
Matt: "Well, let's try. I have not been here." Just knocks on it. It barely makes a noise.
Travis: Sounds like bubbles popping.
Matt: It's like the knuckle against the stonework; it's making this dull, awful sound. Nothing.
Travis: Should I knock? Do you want me to knock, or do you just want me to knock?
Sam: Knock.
Taliesin: Knock.
Marisha: Knock.
Travis: Which one was that, I don't know. (laughter)
Sam: The big one.
Travis: Okay. Can I lean back and slug the door using siege?
Matt: Yes, you can. Go ahead and roll an attack. No weapon bonus though, just your strength.
Travis: Yeah, so that's a 15.
Matt: Okay. So that's your strength bonus and your proficiency modifier?
Travis: Not my proficiency modifier.
Matt: So that would be 20. You reach back (heavy impact) and you watch as his hand hits the section where the engraved metal door is, dents inward, and leaves this big heavy dent in the front and the impact is like a dull thunderous clap of lightning. You hear it echo on the inside.
Ashley: It's engraved with something?
Matt: There was some very faint texture or pattern to it. Yeah, a design that was built into it.
Travis: Knuckles. By the way, can I see that manhole cover you guys have been carrying around this whole time?
Marisha: Yeah, sure.
Travis: It's got Giant runes on it. Runes of Giant.
Marisha: Help me. Hey, Pike, can you help prop it up on that side?
Travis: Do I recognize any of these runes?
Matt: You recognize it's Giant. You cannot read.
Travis: Yep. This is very important script. It says that you must carry this at all times, and if you let it go prematurely you will die.
Marisha: What?
Ashley: I don't think he's telling the truth.
Taliesin: Better safe than sorry, though.
Matt: Grog, make a deception check.
Ashley: We'll hold it.
Travis: Natural 20!
Marisha: What! Bullshit! Goddamn it.
Matt: Which is a grand total of?
Travis: It's a grand total of 21.
Matt: Keyleth, Pike, I need you guys to both roll insight checks.
Taliesin: This is the first time that actual Travis has really leaked into Grog.
Laura: Yeah, no shit.
Marisha: Natural one!
Taliesin: Wow.
Travis: The stars are aligning.
Ashley: That's a 14.
Matt: Okay. Suddenly, as Grog says this, you realize, him being of giant kin and the seriousness in his eyes, and the stark intensity in the way he describes this: If you drop this, something terrible is going to happen!
Marisha: Pike, I need to readjust my grip! Here, I want to put it on my back.
Ashley: Grog, maybe you should hold it then because we're not as strong as you.
Marisha: Yeah, I don't want to drop it. Will it kill all of us? Is it a blast radius thing?
Travis: The fable goes on to say that if you hand it to one of your friends, you will shit everywhere. Immediate bowel loss. Green apple splatters all over your feet, just awful.
Ashley: That doesn't sound true.
Travis: The giant tales are to be respected.
Matt: You probably don't believe the second half, but you do believe the first half.
Travis: It is a fable.
Sam: So it could be metaphor.
Ashley: Safe than sorry, we'll just hold it.
Matt: It's at this point you hear this (thunk) and you hear this heavy, low (clicking) as the sound of chains being tightened and winding forward are followed by the large doorway rising up.
Laura: Oh, it lifts!
Liam: Does it get stuck with the dent?
Matt: You watch as it rises, and there is a small carved slit where the knob itself rises up and fits as the door entirely lifts into the structure leaving the front walkway open and there standing, you see with arms off to the side apparently finishing the rotation of this chain--
Sam: A wench.
Matt: No, you see two male fire giants, fully armored with large blocky black metal swords staring down at you from each side.
Marisha: What are they wearing?
Matt: They are both wearing dark plated scale mail, and both of them have these black bands of metal across their neck that have a small, pulsing red gem in the center.
Sam: But Matthew, are they fuckable, though? Those guards? Would you do them?
Matt: Scanlan, that's up to you, man. You've done some freaky shit in your time. Although in this circumstance you'd be the gerbil.
Sam: I'm the gerbil.
Marisha: Lemmiwinks!
Matt: You are Lemmiwinks in this. If you want to gain some experience, that's up to you.
Taliesin: And really interesting fanart.
Matt: Anyway. They both stand there expectantly, saying nothing.
Travis: Is this where we let the master do the talking?
Marisha: We're here to speak with Juuraiel.
Matt: There's a small pause. You hear a voice echo from further back in the room, though you see no source for it, "What is your business with this Juuraiel?"
Marisha: We have a deal we'd like to make. We have a token of our-- We want to play cards?
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Marisha: Oh Jesus.
Travis: Why are you talking? Persuasion check?
Marisha: I'm the only one not in chains! I'm the only one who can! It's bullshit!
Laura: You could have made any of us look like not--
Marisha: No, I can't. It's only a self spell or else I would've. Oh, that's not too bad. Persuasion? 18.
Matt: There's a pause and you hear a few heavy footfalls, getting louder as they go. Emerging from around the side, you see now a tall, broad-shouldered, female fire giant with a very strong square jaw. Her hair is pulled into this long red braid that dangles past her lower back and you can see it drifting behind her with this large metal ring that it's braided into at the bottom. She's not wearing any armor at the moment, just wearing casual clothes, and these clothes are lined with gold and platinum. This is a very expensive ware that she has on, as well as rings that encrust both of her hands. As she steps forward and looks out towards you. "So you want to play cards and make a deal you say?"
Marisha: I lift with Pike the big manhole cover.
Matt: She reaches over and grabs it, from both of you.
Travis: The fables were a lie!
Ashley: We're safe.
Matt: She glances over it, and puts it over in her hands. "So, you have spoken with Whaska?"
Marisha: Yes.
Matt: "Okay, I will hear what you have to say. Let's hear your deal. Let them in!" She turns around and walks across to the end of the room, as the two giants step to the side, removing their crossed swords from the entryway that scrape across the stone. And you may enter the premises.
Laura: I want to look around immediately, all the walls.
Matt: Make a perception check.
Liam: 25.
Laura: 29.
Matt: As you guys walk in this central chamber, the foyer, if you will, it's beautiful. The use of autumn colors mixed with various golds and metallics to create this archway that is a band of brass, a band of gold, a band of platinum, a band of brass, and repeats itself onward. It has this tunnel-like feel, and within each of these walls, there are a number of weapons. Large, giant-sized weapons that are bolted into the wall and have beautiful runes inscribed within, and wooden plaques on the bottom that contain language that only you recognize, but can't read. There are shelves that contain large books that are locked up behind glass and chains roped across it. This is a collection. This is like a small personal museum. To your size, it is huge. To Juuraiel's size, it's like a nice den.
Liam: Are there any pieces of armor with a sun on it?
Matt: As you guys continue inward, there is a large desk on the opposite side, as well as a few comfortable chairs off to the sides and a staircase that spirals upward to a second floor. There are very bright red burning torches that the flame itself would be a heavy bonfire by comparison to any of you. It burns and licks the edge of the interior without any damage done to the beautiful construct of the foyer. This desk at the end, which she has now walked around and sat on the opposite side, is made up of beautiful dark green wood and has gold leaf designs all throughout the legs. Everything here speaks of projected affluence. Juuraiel, this fire giant you have come across, makes a statement with her wealth, with everything she presents. The other two giants that you saw at the entryway, who had the binding on their necks, close the door behind them, place their weapons up leaning against the wall, and both lumber behind you as you walk in, slowly keeping watch as you progress inward. Juuraiel raises her finger and says, "Could you please bring a means of my guests to speak eye to eye?" And the two giants diverge slightly, both grab two of the chairs and scoot them in, up to the edge of the desk. These chairs are about head height to both of you at the resting point, so you'll have to climb up into them, and then probably get to be up at the desk level.
Liam: The cards are going to be like giant novelty cards.
Travis: Can I ask a question? In my bag, I have two vials of fox's cunning. Is that a potion?
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: Can I drink one?
Matt: If you'd like to.
Travis: It's so hot outside! I'm so thirsty! I would like just a sip. I had it made because I'm an idiot. Just in case the sewer plate says "eat these and enjoy" or something.
Laura: Yeah. She already took it, though. I'm looking at the walls at around 20 to 25 feet. Do I see it, up high on the ceiling? Because I've been looking.
Matt: As you guys get to the desk itself, on the back wall behind the desk, above her shoulder, you see a beautiful ruby shield that refracts the light in the room. It's roughly, from head to toe, Grog's size. It's pointed at the bottom and rises up almost like it's designed to look like a flame. It has this uneven, flickering, frozen in time of the construct of the top of the shield. On the other side of her other shoulder, you see, much smaller in size, but a beautiful set of-- make sure I get the description right on this-- beautiful brass armor with priceless cut rubies all across the rest of the silver inlay of the armor itself.
Laura: You're going to be blinging out; we got to get it!
Liam: How many feet up the wall?
Matt: It is about 25 to 30 feet up the wall. It's up where it's resting about the top height of the shield, so there's an even point and it's about five feet down from the ceiling.
Laura: Should we let just Keyleth and Senokir up on the chairs?
Sam: I would like a seat at the table, if that's all right?
Marisha: Let me get us out of this. Juuraiel? Do you mind if we speak candidly and dispose of our guises that led us here?
Matt: "But of course. You've already presented trust from one of my allies. You are safe within here."
Laura: Can I roll an insight check on the whole allies thing?
Matt: You may.
Laura: I was having difficulty choosing. 19?
Travis: I told you the fables were true!
Sam: Oh yeah, you know, like Loot Crate and stuff.
Taliesin: Loot Crate. Magical Loot Crate.
Sam: Doctor Strange. Use 'criticalrole' for 10% off your Loot Crate guys, code 'criticalrole'!
Matt: You drank the potion, Grog?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: So you have advantage on intelligence checks.
Travis: Nice. Do I gain any temporary intelligence?
Matt: There's a clarity in your mind that hasn't been there in a while, not since being an eagle.
Travis: Do I look over at the symbols and do they all of a sudden start to mean something?
Matt: No?
Laura: Oh no, you can't read still.
Matt: You need to learn to read still.
Taliesin: You have a deeper understanding of the tragedy of that.
Travis: I got to A, B, C. We'll work on it.
Liam: While you don't recognize them as letters, they're like little characters that you're familiar with: the burly guy, and then the cross guy, he's holding swords.
Travis: Yeah, that's the tree. Yep, that one's the wiener.
Sam: Keyleth, may I speak?
Marisha: I said we'd dropped our guises so yes, everyone, you can take your slave robes off now.
Sam: We're all chained.
Travis: Not wearing robes.
Matt: You see Senokir looks over at Uten.
Marisha: Senokir, can we--?
Matt: "Not to worry. Uten, if you don't mind." Uten pulls out the ring of keys that he has and goes through and begins undoing your guys' shackles. This will take a little while.
Travis: Did the door to the room close?
Matt: It's closed. The two servant giants closed it. Juuraiel leans forward with a grin, "So, please. What do you come here requesting?"
Sam: Hello. Hi, there. Hi.
Matt: "Even smaller!" And now leans in real close to the edge of the desk. The massive size of her face and the breath; it's delightful. It's a combination of rotting vegetation and very dry earth. But her teeth are gleaming. The smile is interested in whatever you're about to say.
Sam: Hi there. I'm a bit of a gambler. I'm known around the worlds as being one of the luckiest men with a deck of cards you've ever met. I've won games in many of the different planes. I see that you collect many treasures that you've won in matches as well. Is that true?
Matt: Eyes shift back and forth over the rest of you here, "I have an interest in games of chance on occasion, yes. So, you come all this way to play games?"
Sam: Yes, I have. I spend my life just playing games. It's my livelihood. I've won many things over the years. In fact, all of these great people, large and small next to me, I won in various card games around the planes. That one over there, the big one, I won him in a game of Gin Rummy in the Feywild. This guy I picked up in a game of Fish. I'm here to collect, possibly, one of your items, if that's all right with you?
Matt: Make a deception check.
Sam: 32. (laughter)
Matt: Leans even farther forward, to where it's about two feet between you and her large eyes that have come in, and her chin is scraping against the wood to get a really good look at you. She looks over, her red pupils slowly inspecting you. The grin grows even wider as she leans back, "Well, you intrigue me, small one. If your luck has been so great as to collect these fine specimens of strangers and you bring them all with you to such a place. Where do you hail from, if I might ask?"
Sam: Places. That information is not relevant right now.
Matt: "Fair enough. So! You come to play me for what?"
Sam: Maybe I'll decide after our match.
Matt: "Well, I need to know what the ante is, so I can ask for a suitable request for my side."
Sam: Certainly.
Taliesin: I'm going to lean in and-- (no vocals)
Sam: There's a large ruby shield back there, is that true?
Matt: "Ah, yes."
Sam: He wants that, but I think his taste sucks. So I'm going to go for that brass piece of armor back there.
Matt: "Ah, interesting. So you wish to play for the armor?"
Sam: Sure, I'm a little man, and it might help me in a fight someday if I ever lose.
Matt: "Fair enough. So." She leans behind and pulls out a wooden box from a small cubby. And you now look behind the desk and there are a series of cubbies that are embedded in the wall. And there are different things that she's thrown in there. She pulls out this wooden box, unlocks it with her heavy fingers, and opens it. She pulls out a deck of cards that is larger than what you're used to playing with, but small enough that you could functionally hold a hand. Small from her perspective. Kind of. (laughter)
Sam: Let me cut the cards.
Travis: And you die.
Matt: She takes it and closes the box. Begins to shuffle them, without even looking away from you. As she looks at you, she cocks a bit of a half-smile to one side and says, "So for that, do you know the history of this? For you to come so far to play a game, there may be a reason you come. And the thing you select for the game we play has much value to you."
Sam: Honestly, the game itself is what's of value to me. I am just happy to win and keep my winning streak alive. What I get out of it is meaningless.
Matt: "Okay."
Sam: But if you'd like to enlighten me on that object--
Matt: "We will play three hands. The winner of two takes the pot."
Laura: (dry heaves)
Matt: "Request the armor. Me, I request your friends."
Laura: I knew that's where she was going to go with this.
Sam: Well, I was going to offer one of your choosing. But you've only offered me one of your items.
Matt: "Take it or leave it. If you truly have no idea what this armor is worth, perhaps you wish to choose another thing to ante."
Sam: You seem attached to it. I want it. I'll have it.
Matt: "How badly do you want it?"
Sam: Certainly badly enough to risk these scoundrels.
Matt: "Then we have an accord."
Sam: We do.
Marisha: Hell yeah! Let's do this!
Travis: I've never been an ante before.
Liam: Stone-cold gnome.
Taliesin: So many bad ideas start with--
Laura: Do we need to all sit on the table, then?
Marisha: Does it work like Vegas? Are all the odds on the house?
Travis: Is it wizard's chess?
Sam: May I ask what game we're playing? Blackjack? Are we playing--
Travis: Strip poker!
Sam: Strip poker? Five-card stud? (laughter)
Matt: "We refer to it as the Tinder Start. But you probably know of it as the Gambit of Ord."
Sam: We've played this before?
Marisha: Wait, did we end up playing it?
Matt: This is the thing you didn't end up playing.
Marisha: Fucking fuck! We didn't end up playing this. But wait, we remember the rules?
Matt: You didn't play it. You, make an intelligence check. Being a bard that you are. And add a +2 to it.
Travis: Get the Hand Cone out!
Sam: 21.
Matt: You have played this game.
Laura: Thank god! Do you suck at it?
Sam: I suck at everything.
Matt: The hand is represented. Each of you roll a d8, but you keep the die hidden. Then you both roll a d6, and then keep it secret. Then you both roll a d4, and then reveal them all together. But you can raise it as you wish.
Travis: You raise after each roll?
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: What's the goal? What are you trying to get to?
Matt: The highest number between the three rolls. But you can fold if you want to. This usually is done in a betting type circumstance, so we'll see how things go from here. Anyway, finishes shuffling. Tosses you a series of cards. Takes a couple cards for herself. Sets the deck aside, right in front of her. The two guards in the back, by the way, we hear them stepping away and retrieve their weapons, and head back behind you guys. Just keeping them at their sides.
Liam: So in this room, let's say you're her, and we're all where we are, and the giants are behind the group, is that about right?
Matt: Yes.
Liam: And how much room is there behind her and the wall?
Matt: Maybe 15 feet, 20 feet.
Liam: I'm going to slowly tippie-toe around the side of the wall, carefully avoiding giants. I want to stand not directly behind her, but off at an angle.
Matt: Make a stealth check.
Liam: 30.
Matt: Okay. You both take a look at your hands. Go ahead and roll a d8. Okay.
Sam: And now?
Matt: So, for this circumstance, we'll go ahead and take a d6. Roll it and put it next to the die. All right. And now take a d4.
Sam: And if we fold, do we start over?
Matt: If you fold, you lose the round.
Sam: Oh, well then it's just a number.
Laura: So it's just numbers, at this point?
Matt: At this point, yeah. You walked into a game of her choice.
Laura: There's no way to cheat.
Liam: So there's three rolls in a row, and she's done two. Can we see them from where I am?
Matt: You currently went around the table?
Liam: Yeah, I'm at an angle, but I'm a lot lower than she is.
Matt: Make a perception check.
Liam: Luck. That's fine. 22.
Matt: You get a good glance at the first two cards, yes.
Liam: Can I (mutters inaudibly) in the earring, as quiet as a mouse? Can I just breathe it?
Matt: Make a stealth check.
Liam: With advantage?
Matt: Not with advantage because it's an audio thing.
Liam: Is it three rolls? I don't understand the game.
Laura: There's no way we can cheat! Because the ante's already on the table!
Liam: Yeah, I'm going to wait.
Laura: Right, there's no way to cheat?
Matt: That you can think of.
Laura: Unless you can fudge the dice!
Marisha: But that's risky.
Laura: It's technically cards.
Matt: It's cards. The dice is just the mechanic for it. Take a look at your hand.
Sam: I know my hand. Wait, am I rolling the d4 or no?
Matt: We rolled the d8 and the d6. She looks down and goes, "All right. So, to make this even more interesting. I'll wait. Let us see how the first hand goes, shall we?" And she puts her third card in front of her, face down. Roll now.
Sam: (quietly) Not good, you guys.
Matt: "And call." And she turns the cards over. "Four, six, one." A total of 11.
Sam: One, five, two. Total of eight.
Matt: "That is an unfortunate way to open it, my small friend. But you seem keen on winning, and I respect that." She takes the cards, places them to the side. Deals out a new hand, brings it back to her. "Shall we begin?" Go ahead and roll your d8.
Sam: Oh, man, this is just straight rolls.
Travis: We're going to kill everybody in this motherfucking house!
Laura: There's no way to fucking sleight of hand this shit, is there?
Marisha: Can he add his Bardic Inspiration?
Matt: No, this isn't an ability check.
Ashley: If I cast Enhance Ability on him?
Laura: Maybe, can you pray for Sarenrae?
Matt: This is quite literally a game of chance. If you wanted to try and fuck around with a creative way to cheat, you're welcome to try. That could also go very poorly, depending on how it goes. Before you do the next one, she stops and goes, "So, as I was going to say before. How about, as your friends are the ante on the table, throw yourself in as well?"
Sam: And what will you give me if I win?
Matt: "Perhaps the ruby shield?"
Sam: I love myself a lot. A lot more than a bunch of rubies and a handle, I'll tell you that much. If I'm giving myself to slavery forever, I want something a hell of a lot better than that. I'm a man who's won 500 straight card games in a row. You think these slaves are something? You should see what I have at home.
Matt: Make a deception check.
Sam: 32.
Travis: Uh-oh.
Laura: Oh no.
Matt: She nods.
Sam: I'll give you myself as a slave if you do not draw your next card and skip straight to the third, and that's your number. I get all three.
Matt: "Very well."
Travis: Oh, nice, dude!
Laura: Oh, hopefully she didn't roll an eight on that first one.
Matt: She rolled, the first die is placed there.
Laura: She rolled an eight?!?
Travis: She rolled an eight?!?
Sam: Oh, fucking balls. Fuck balls. (laughter)
Laura: We have to be ready to fight. Grab it and then Jenga out.
Matt: She rolled her last card but is not showing.
Ashley: But take the shield, too, though. Take the shield!
Sam: (whispers) Pretty bad.
Taliesin: No, we're good. Tell her to show her last card.
Laura: Maybe it's a one.
Matt: It's a two. "A ten. What did you roll?"
Taliesin: I cast Minor Illusion on the first card, to turn the three into an eight.
Matt: As you begin to mutter the incantation under your breath, she says, "I would not recommend bringing incantations into our game of chance."
Sam: Before I reveal my cards, I have one more proposal.
Matt: "Yes?"
Sam: (whispers) I don't know what it is. (laughter)
Laura: Maybe we can perform for her?
Sam: I'll come clean with you. We know exactly what that fucking piece of armor is.
Matt: "I had a feeling." (laughter)
Sam: We want it. We're not leaving here without it. I'm sorry, I'm not going to show you my cards. Because before I do, you'll be dead. Sorry, guys.
Matt: She turns her head to the side, "You do not want to walk this path, do you? Because if you truly cherish the lives that you and your friends here have, based on your current change in tone, this tells me that they now belong to me. Perhaps you would wish to continue to make this agreement you came to make. Show me your card."
Sam: I drew a three, and a three, and a three.
Travis: Oh, that sucks!
Matt: "By one each time. Perhaps it was time for you to lose cards after all. Based on our agreement, you and your friends are now property of Juuraiel. However, I see that you are traveled. You seem capable. You are bold. You walk in here after acquiring the will of Whaska. So, you want freedom, yes?"
Sam: Yes?
Matt: "Then perhaps there is a favor you can do for me. In exchange for this favor, I will nullify our contract, and you will be free to go. Does this sound viable?"
Sam: Possibly. Is it a card game?
Matt: "The other choice is you are now mine. Or, as you threatened boldly before, that I was to die. But I can say, given the current place that you reside, the enchantments I have on this room, the friends of mine that I have at your back, you will not have the outcome you wish."
Sam: What is your offer?
Matt: "Do you agree?"
Laura: Did you ever meet a dragon named Thordak?
Matt: "No."
Laura: Fuck. Big red guy? Took a lot of fire giants with him?
Matt: "There are a number of red dragons that walk."
Laura: This one was special. He had an enormous jewel in his chest.
Matt: "Sounds worthwhile. But do you agree to our arrangement?"
Sam: Just curious, can we draw the third hand? I just want to feel what it feels like to win once.
Ashley: What about best out of five? You're probably so bored with life; why not?
Sam: My slave speaks the truth.
Matt: "You are full of spunk and life. And you are foolish. Do you agree to our accord?"
Sam: I'm really curious about this last hand. If you beat me in this last hand, I agree.
Matt: "If I beat you in this hand, you agree. Otherwise, what? I still own you?"
Sam: Yes. Well, that's the deal.
Travis: Yeah, I like that. Maybe you'll win one.
Ashley: One more hand?
Matt: "We will see who wins this hand for your own sake."
Sam: Thank you. That would make me feel so much better about myself.
Matt: "It does not change our deal." First die. Second. And third. She reveals four, four, four. Literally rolled all fours.
Travis: God! Matt! You!
Taliesin: Wow.
Marisha: Wow.
Sam: I'm really just bad at everything.
Travis: Did you roll an 11?
Sam: I rolled an 11.
Matt: Oh my God!
Travis: You are a deity.
Matt: I wish I had this luck in Vegas! Like, literal gambling.
Travis: It's just four hours.
Sam: Best seven out of 13! (laughter)
Matt: "You have agreed to our accord as per the agreement."
Sam: I have agreed. I'm already your slave, so I couldn't really say no. So yes, I agree to our accord. What favor can I grant you?
Matt: "You will have your freedom and the armor you seek. My lover does not live because of an altercation with one who frequents the city. My partner, Drogat, died needlessly in the streets of an innocent altercation with Ghurrix, a pit fiend that lives at the embassy."
Laura: (groaning) Ah jeez.
Sam: Sorry, we're not supposed to go to the embassy. We were told so by our tour guide.
Matt: "Oh, you should never go to the embassy. But this Ghurrix is tied up with a lot of politics in this city. As much as I would love to squeeze what infernal life he has, I fear it would cause the execution of me and mine. So, I sit and fester with the need of vengeance. I need you, if you're as capable as you promise, to go and find Ghurrix, in whatever way you see fit, and carve the life from his body. Now, Ghurrix frequents the Arches, which is the slave market of the city, where he finds rare and unique servants for the Nine Hells and his masters there. Goes about once a week and is probably due there in a day or two. Go, slay Ghurrix, and return to me with no mention and no trace that can be brought back to my home. Then the armor is yours, as is your freedom. There is no agreement. You've already agreed. So go."
Sam: Yes, we accept. Thank you, my master, we will go do so right away. Two days, you say?
Matt: "Two days, yes."
Laura: Does that mean we don't have to answer to you anymore? You're equal to us?
Sam: Yes.
Marisha: High five, yeah!
Sam: I release you from your slavery.
Marisha: And into another one.
Sam: What does he look like?
Matt: She reaches down to the side of the desk, and pulls out a very small book, relative size, and flips through, and opens a page to turn towards you. "This is what I seek to see destroyed. You can tell, Ghurrix wears a symbol of his station. It is a thick, black chain. And at the bottom, it has the symbol of two manacles intertwined within a red symbol that pulses with anger. That is your mark."
Sam: Are you sure you don't want just a game of Pinochle instead?
Matt: "You try my patience, small one."
Sam: Please, call me Kenny Rogers.
Matt: "Two days. Go!"
Sam: Let's go, slaves! I'm sorry, equals, peers, let's go!
Matt: As you guys step down, the two giant guards step back and begin to walk towards the door to let you out.
Laura: Actually, madam, master. Do you have any symbols that you can give us, like something we could show people so they don't try to claim us for themselves? Because we're a lot smaller than everyone else here. Something that shows that we're your slaves?
Matt: "Hmm." She gets up from behind the desk, and walks up the stairs for a moment.
Laura: Is she out of the room?
Matt: She's out of the room, currently.
Laura: And two other giants are behind us?
Matt: Yes.
Laura: What are they doing?
Matt: They're standing watching all of you.
Laura: All of us except for--
Liam: I'm standing there, but I'm not--
Laura: Jump up and fucking see how it's attached to the wall!
Travis: How big is the suit of armor, the Dawnmartyr?
Matt: It would fit a human. A minute passes. You hear the footfalls return. As she comes down the stairs, with her hand in a fist, she throws her hand open. Hitting the ground, and scattering across the stonework, some of them stopping at your feet or beyond, a series of black, metal rings that match the ones that the two giants wear around their neck.
Travis: But smaller.
Matt: But smaller. Various sizes. There's probably like a dozen or so you can pick from. Some will fit better than others. "These I had made, but I had no need for servants of your size until today. So, go. These should be enough."
Laura: Thank you. They're lovely.
Travis: Yeah, I put mine on. I like it a lot.
Sam: Have a lovely afternoon.
Matt: "You as well. Good luck. Please, kill it. Return."
Travis: Do we want to stay the night here?
Marisha: Yeah, I was going to ask that.
Sam: Gross, but okay, go ahead.
Travis: A quick query. We're, like, visitors. We don't really have a place to stay. Now that we're yours, do you have like a broom cupboard?
Matt: Senokir pipes up and goes, "Actually, you're welcome to stay at our place. We have facilities that could function. Besides, it's a lot of chain we have to carry back now."
Taliesin: It's true.
Laura: We'll do you the favor, Senokir, of carrying this chain back to your place.
Matt: "That's wonderful, thank you."
Laura: A favor for a favor. (giggles)
Matt: "Indeed. We'll talk soon about mine."
Travis: He's going to wear us like winter coats. Going to make a suit out of our skin.
Marisha: Nice lampshade.
Laura: Ooh, his eyebrows literally going up when you said that. I think he wants to do it.
Matt: So, the door is lifted. You guys are led back out onto the street. Closes behind you. The time that has passed now, I need everyone once again to roll another constitution saving throw.
Travis: But I drank that Fox's Cunning.
Marisha: Am I okay?
Taliesin: We're going to be fine, anyway. We have the mansion.
Travis: 24.
Taliesin: 11.
Sam: 20.
Marisha: Do I still have fire resist?
Matt: Your fire resist would have gone away. You could cast it again.
Marisha: I'll just roll this time. It's just straight constitution?
Laura: Saving throw.
Ashley: With a saving throw?
Matt: Yeah.
Ashley: So roll another.
Matt: Well, no. You roll and then you add your saving throw bonus.
Marisha: Seven.
Matt: Vex?
Laura: Four.
Ashley: Three!
Matt: All right. Pike, Vex, Keyleth, and Percy all suffer a point of exhaustion. Pike, your speed is halved right now.
Laura: Oh no, Pike, but you're already so little!
Ashley: My what's halved?
Matt: Your speed is halved, so you are trailing behind everybody.
Laura: Grog, pick her up, she looks like she needs some water.
Ashley: Grog, I'm just so tired.
Travis: You look so mopey.
Ashley: I feel very mopey.
Travis: Did you want a piggyback ride?
Ashley: Yeah.
Travis: All right, I pick her up and I put her on my shoulder.
Matt: You guys eventually make your way back, being led by Senokir back to his establishment. Let's go ahead and take a little break for now. Go ahead and use the restroom--
Travis: You looked like the creepy guy was saying we should take a break for just a second.
Matt: "That would be frightening, wouldn't it?" All right, guys, we'll be back in just a few minutes, we'll see you in a second. [break]
Matt: Welcome back everyone to Critical Role. That was terrible.
Travis: The timing. Well, she's been gone.
Matt: She's been gone a while. It's okay, welcome back.
Ashley: I'm sorry.
Matt: Ashley, you're amazing.
Ashley: I'm just not working right now.
Matt: That's okay. So. You guys have returned to Senokir and Uten's establishment to rest until you feel is necessary to undertake this endeavor. But it is your guys' prerogative as to if you want to wait over the next day, day and a half to jump to it or is there anything you want to do to prepare for this circumstance? What do you want to do?
Taliesin: Let's sleep in the mansion so we can gain some of our--
Laura: Yeah let's sleep in the mansion till we can at least get rid of this heat.
Sam: If it's a day or two, we could go back to Daxio and check and come back. But then we'd have to get back into the city. That's probably a terrible idea.
Marisha: Can I bamf right here? What's your name? What is Simma sina--
Travis: Sequin.
Marisha: Senokir. Took a ten-minute break and that's it. Senokir, is there a way we could-- If I wanted to Plane Shift home, is there a way that I could Plane Shift right back here and not get, you know, our heads chopped off for it?
Matt: "I don't know. Is there?"
Marisha: Let me check, guys. You know, let me check the druidic texts and see what they say.
Matt: Specifically, you can choose a target in general terms. It'll probably bring you right back to where you arrived here. So you'd be back to the outside of the city.
Liam: At the respawn point.
Marisha: Well, I can't say Senokir's jewelry shop in the City of Brass?
Matt: You can specify a target or destination in general terms. So the City of Brass or Dispater on the second level of the Nine Hells. You appear in or near that destination.
Sam: No guarantee that we'd be back in. So we should stay.
Matt: Up to you. Crapshoot, it's possible.
Laura: As long as we know that Allura will send us a message if something goes wrong.
Liam: Did it get dark out at all? Or no?
Matt: Actually, by this time, as you guys have gotten back and ended this rest you guys have really come to get really thirsty, and as the exhaustion hits in, you all continue to reach for your waterskins and they're dried up.
Taliesin: We should go back into the mansion.
Sam: I agree.
Matt: The sun, however, has gone to a darker red color, like a soft eclipse almost. And as it does, the heat remains but the light gets dimmer and dimmer into a red twilight. And as it does, the city shuts down. Everybody goes home, locks up, and nothing but the efreet that you saw wandering the streets earlier with the little flaming brooches or amulets in the uniform outfit wander the streets.
Laura: Why doesn't anyone go outside at night?
Matt: Pardon me. (sneezes)
Marisha: Bless you.
Laura: Bless you, Senokir.
Matt: (sneezes)
Travis: Give me a third one.
Marisha: Bless you again.
Matt: Fuck you. Hate you so much. Live gaming. You ask this to Senokir?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: "That's largely because the Illuminated maintain a curfew. And if you don't follow the curfew, you'll wind up in chains."
Laura: Okay. Different chains than regular chains?
Matt: "At first, yes."
Laura: Okay.
Travis: Waterskins from our servants--
Liam: Who's that guy? What is that guy?
Offscreen: Thanks, Gov'ner.
Laura: What are we at?
Matt: "Kill him." (laughter)
Matt: "If you require water I can procure that for you, if you like."
Laura: Hmm?
Matt: "If you want water I can procure that for you."
Taliesin: Can we get water from the--
Sam: Well, we have water in his fucking jug.
Laura: Yeah. We've got so much water.
Marisha: I can also create water.
Laura: Yeah, but he's got a jug full of it.
Marisha: Pike and I can create water. Me and Pike both can.
Travis: I can create water. Don't say it like it's cool.
Taliesin: They're not speaking in metaphor. We know you can create water.
Matt: All right, so, what do you guys wish to do?
Liam: I mean, are we in a hurry, do we want to try to make this happen tonight?
Taliesin: Let's mansion for the night and then I think in the morning. We can't find him tonight. Can we?
Liam: I'm not talking about him, I'm talking about doubling back to the house and trying to get through the servants' window.
Sam: You really want to try to break into this fire giant's house?
Liam: If we're in a hurry, I mean we've killed some pretty gnarly things, I know they're big. So are we.
Laura: She could be gnarlier than the giants that we've fought.
Travis: And there might be an unbelievable amount of fire giants in that building.
Sam: Or traps.
Marisha: Or allies nearby. It's in the middle of a city.
Liam: Yeah. And I'm sure the other thing will be super easy.
Laura: The pit fiend?
Liam: It's on the table. I mean, whatever, you know. I'm going to follow your lead.
Sam: You want to do a smash and grab?
Laura: Run in, grab the armor, Plane Shift out. Can they chase us down if we do that?
Marisha: Classic B&E? Plane Shift takes a minute--
Laura: No, it's instant. Remember, we checked it.
Matt: It's an action.
Marisha: It takes an action. As long as we're all in a circle holding hands.
Travis: Oh shit.
Taliesin: And what happens if you can't Plane Shift out of that house? We probably want to get out of the house and then Plane Shift.
Marisha: In case it's magically locked down?
Taliesin: In case it's magically locked down.
Laura: Yeah, that's pretty smart.
Taliesin: In which the phrase, "I have many enchantments upon my home," led me to believe there's probably--
Travis: I mean, I really don't see what the problem is, right? Hellfiend goes, "Oh, time to go shopping for slaves." He walks up to the Arches, we set a trap, Vax goes stabby-stab-stab, Percy goes (gunshot), Pike goes, (high-pitched) "Hi", and like, donesky!
Taliesin: You're writing the best children's book ever.
Laura: I mean, I'm down, I think that's a great plan, Grog.
Marisha: He also said that the pit fiend could be there in one to two days.
Laura: Yes.
Sam: Could be there tomorrow?
Marisha: Also, do we know how much time passes in the fire plane versus the real world?
Matt: You're not entirely certain, comparatively the time. You feel like you've been here for, I mean, a while. By the cycle of the sun-like light source in the sky here on the plane, it seems like you've been here for about a day.
Laura: Oh, shit.
Marisha: Do we remember any type of relative time jump when we were here last time in and out?
Matt: No, but you were only here for maybe a handful of hours last time you guys came here.
Travis: Were you worried about being away from Fort Daxio for too long?
Liam: Yeah, that's what I was suggesting.
Marisha: Yeah, I mean we could come back to Thordak just destroyed everything.
Travis: Can't we scry on the fort?
Marisha: I can't scry between dimensions.
Matt: It has to be on the same plane.
Laura: Can you scry on the pit fiend?
Marisha: Yeah.
Sam: We know what it looks like.
Laura: And you know like a thing for him, right? We know his name.
Travis: Thank you, watering boy.
Marisha: Yes, I could.
Sam: Cabin boy, thank you.
Travis: That's what I meant! That's what I wanted to say!
Marisha: Yeah, can I use the scrying eye to try and scry on the pit fiend?
Matt: You certainly can. So you have secondhand knowledge of the pit fiend.
Marisha: And trying to imagine his emblem that she described with the two manacles and the black chain, because that was pretty cool.
Matt: So, focusing on the emblem that you were described, you close your eyes and concentrate, holding the orb of scrying within your grasp. Okay. What's your spell DC?
Marisha: 19.
Matt: What's the spell DC of the scrying orb?
Marisha: It doesn't say.
Matt: It would be 15. Unless you cast the spell, right?
Marisha: Yeah, I get to do it, so it should still be mine, right?
Matt: Usually it would be set for the item, but for the purposes of this it won't make a huge difference. What's your spell DC?
Marisha: 19.
Matt: 19, okay yeah, so it won't make a difference. You close your eyes and you see a brief fuzzy vision of the city from your perspective and then your vision jumps suddenly and comes to fire, then comes to black, then comes to a quick view of that weird citadel, carved out of black obsidian hands reaching over each other, the one that you saw earlier, the embassy. Then you feel a wall and you're thrust through a series of walls, not able to really take in any visuals, the process is so fast, wall after wall, then you come to a darkened room, a wide chamber that contains a long series of papers and scrolls that are laid out in a specific format. You can see, chained to the walls, individuals moaning and crying. And you see, sitting in this small circle in the center of the floor, a humanoid-- a humanoid in the sense that it has arms or legs-- but you see the pit fiend sitting there, almost meditating, eyes closed, large teeth, jagged and pointed, coming out of its large jaw, dark red horns that curve behind its head, these large wings that are folded around it from the back as it sits its knees out, crosslegged, its arms resting upon the edges, eyes closed. It appears to be sleeping. Or at least resting.
Marisha: Can I get a focus on what the slaves look like?
Matt: Unfortunately you can't, the target of your scry is about the most you can focus on; you can give a blurry atmosphere around them, you can barely pick up the aspect of their presence, but that's the most you can do with the scry spell.
Marisha: Okay. Well, he appears to be in his bedroom, definitely in the citadel. As she said.
Laura: Does he have any, like, cuts on him, anything that looks weak?
Marisha: He had big gnarly teeth and slaves.
Ashley: Did he look scary?
Marisha: He looked very unpleasant.
Travis: But it's just him, right? One dude?
Sam: We could take one dude!
Marisha: Well, he also had a bunch of people chained to the wall, and this was after my vision being slammed through several walls. It seemed to be very deep in the labyrinth that is the embassy, which seems like a labyrinth.
Laura: So we'll have to wait until he comes out.
Taliesin: Can we trick him into the mansion?
Sam: The mansion door, I think, is only ten feet tall.
Laura: How tall is he?
Sam: 20?
Matt: Best that you could tell, probably close to 15 feet.
Laura: He could duck in.
Marisha: He's a little taller than Grog.
Ashley: What kind of slaves did it look like he had? All types?
Marisha: I tried to look. I couldn't tell. Looked like a nice variety.
Laura: If we said, "Hey, I heard there's really good slaves up in this mansion--"
Sam: And then what do we do in the mansion?
Taliesin: We can quietly attack him from all sides. Have a fight that won't draw the attention of the guards.
Sam: Something tells me that people fight in this city a lot.
Laura: Yeah, but I don't think the slaves attack the owners very often.
Taliesin: There's nothing we could damage in there that would remain damaged.
Marisha: Unless we tried to use ourselves as slave bait again, put a few of us on the auction.
Liam: You seemed to be able to talk Yenk into doing whatever you wanted. Do you think you could do that with this guy?
Sam: I could certainly make an appearance of Yenk.
Liam: I meant convince him to come inside.
Sam: You mean Dominate him?
Laura: He could be much more intelligent than Yenk was, though.
Liam: Could be.
Sam: I can try.
Taliesin: He wears jewelry.
Marisha: He has a logo.
Travis: He meditates.
Laura: He meditates?
Travis: Yep.
Taliesin: Bikram yoga.
Laura: Is that the hot one?
Taliesin: That is the hot one.
Travis: Should we go recon on the auction as slave shopping or whatever it is?
Laura: In the morning. Not now.
Travis: Set up the door outside of the market or whatever.
Sam: So, he's going to the auction to slave shop?
Taliesin: Yes.
Travis: Unique slaves. He likes unique slaves.
Sam: Seems crazy that a gigantic fucking pit boss, whatever he is, would be like, "Oh, sure, I'll step into this creepy door, weird stranger!"
Laura: The mansion door is rather creepy, isn't it?
Sam: Yeah, for sure! Everything about me is creepy, guys!
Travis: But it's unique, and what if inside the door we make it look even more unique?
Laura: Yeah, can't you make the mansion look like anything you want?
Matt: Within reason.
Travis: That's important to say.
Matt: There are limitations. It's still a mansion.
Laura: I mean, if it looks like a sexy den or something.
Travis: Yeah, and if he doesn't come in the door, then we kill him.
Sam: This seems like a plan C to me. Convincing a giant killing machine to step into a nice house seems like it's a desperate plan of people without anything at all.
Taliesin: He's not a giant killing machine, he's a businessman looking to purchase--
Travis: What, do we go and make a deal with the devil? (goofy chuckle)
Sam: The deal is we just attack him and kill him! What's the big deal? We were sent on a killing mission here.
Taliesin: Where are we going to kill him?
Sam: Wherever we see him! Let's talk to Sonny here, creepy Sonny.
Liam: What about this? This is a terrible idea. Could one of us goad him into following us out of his abode or some building, somewhere, and you plop the mansion door outside the actual door? So he goes to try to leave the tavern or whatever the fuck, he goes into our house?
Laura: Ultimately, if we can get him in a building and then back out of the building, great. But if we can get him in that building, why can't we get him in the fucking mansion?
Matt: As far as you understand, for a person to walk into the mansion, they have to know they're walking into the mansion.
Sam: So we can definitely entice them. You guys can pose as slaves and show him some amazing feats and say, "There's more where that came from, inside the mansion!" but if he says no, then what's our plan?
Matt: Senokir pipes up at this point. He's been listening in to this whole conversation off to the side. He goes, "If you are indeed going to fight a creature of this esteem, I will request to not be present. Thus, you will be masterless in this city. I don't know how to protect you the way you look."
Travis: Don't we have the neck rings, the collars, to mock that we're--
Matt: "Perhaps. That will be helpful. Just make sure you have a solid story, or another way of masking yourself. Otherwise--"
Sam: I can make us all look different. What would make us passable in the city?
Matt: "Well, dressed more like us, or the others who are free. It all depends on what you can look like."
Travis: Less appealing. Less different.
Matt: "Or, at least, amongst the elite of this city, where you won't be bothered."
Sam: I can make us all robes and stuff.
Ashley: Don't we want to look unique for him to want--
Laura: One of us.
Marisha: Seeming allows you to tailor us, right?
Sam: Sure, sure.
Matt: Actually, what does Seeming allow?
Sam: I can shrink or grow us by a foot, change our general appearance and clothing.
Marisha: How about we do a little bit of both? We can have a few of us, maybe two, as slaves, the rest as masters, walking around incognito. Once one of us gets sold off, we track him back so we're not fighting a member of the Embassy of the City of Brass in the middle of the market.
Laura: That would be bad.
Liam: I like the mansion idea. What if we pitched the mansion as a traveling magical boutique slave shop? Artisan slave shop? We lube this guy up in a loincloth and this guy after a hard day's tinkering, and we sell them! This guy can sell anything! This guy could sell a hunk of shit to the Emperor of Emon.
Marisha: These people have seen a lot of shit, not just one hunk of shit.
Laura: What if you and I dressed in exact, identical clothing, and then we're unique? We're, you know, twin slaves?
Taliesin: I was actually going to say quintuplets. We could all look the same.
Marisha: Is that a fantasy that people have?
Taliesin: It is now.
Liam: That's the plan!
Sam: I'm sorry, what's going on? We're all looking like you?
Liam: We're septuplets! Sextuplets! And you're the salesman.
Sam: I'm selling a group of identical sextuplet slaves and the advantage is just that they look cool? "Check out my slaves; they all look alike!"
Travis: If you give us one order, we all understand the order!
Taliesin: Somehow, a stamp with an upside-down airplane is worth a fortune. This, obviously, is more rare.
Sam: I could make you all other ways unique.
Liam: I mean, we're fairly attractive! I feel like six of us would be worth the price of admission.
Laura: Although you can only grow us or shrink us by a foot, so this would be a really little--
Taliesin: We'll make her taller and you two shorter.
Marisha: Can I also throw out that maybe six might be pushing it a little? Maybe we should drop it down to, like, quadruplets?
Taliesin: No! Because six is what he's walking around with! He's got more back in his shop!
Liam: It's got the word "sex" right in it! Sextuplets! Sex sells! Sextuplets sell!
Travis: You can do it. Magic door, sextuplets.
Sam: I love this idea, don't get me wrong, but I feel like convincing him that you are able-bodied slaves with magical abilities might be even more of icing on the cake than, "Hey, they look alike!"
Travis: I like that! You vamp, baby, you do whatever. Do what you do. SAM; All right, and when it doesn't work, Sonny, can we fight him right there in the Arches? Will people be like, "What the fuck's going on? Arrest them all!"
Matt: "He is a known entity in this city. If you wish to fight him in the open, I would recommend having a way of perhaps having the Illuminated on your side."
Sam: That's the guards?
Matt: "That is the guard."
Liam: Artisanal half-elf slaves.
Laura: Wait. If we can convince them that he's broken a law of some sort--
Travis: Bribes.
Laura: Bribes.
Sam: We could also try to convince them that he's broken a law or done something horrible.
Laura: What's against the law here?
Matt: "Well, going against the sultan is the most grievous of things. He is a paranoid one."
Laura: He's the one in the big-- no.
Matt: "In the Charcoal Palace."
Sam: I could make the image of our mark standing out there in the middle of the Arches, cursing the sultan's name and pissing all over the place.
Travis: Right, but listen, I don't know if we have enough to bribe all the efreet. What if we went to the Charcoal Palace, spewed a tale, and said that this pit fiend is plotting to overthrow the Charcoal Palace and all we want is to remove the problem for him?
Matt: "I can really recommend you not go near that palace."
Laura: Yeah, let's not do that.
Travis: So, we do it.
Laura: No, let's not.
Matt: "They have wards to pierce through lies. You will find yourselves never heard from again, if you have falsehood in your midst."
Taliesin: Does the sultan mark his slaves?
Matt: "The sultan, I imagine, would, though I am not aware of it myself."
Taliesin: Does he have a seal?
Matt: "I believe so."
Taliesin: If we were to sell ourselves as slaves, we could be marked as the property of the sultan.
Sam: And then what?
Taliesin: And then we could claim that he was trying to steal property of the sultan.
Sam: Are we still sextuplets in this scenario?
Taliesin: You don't get to negotiate that aspect. Even if we're just sneaking back into the house and stealing the armor, we're doing it as identical sextuplets. There's no fighting that anymore.
Liam: One addendum. Our sizes don't change, right?
Sam: I can make you a foot taller or smaller.
Liam: We could be the Matryoshka nesting dolls. From biggest to smallest. That's unique!
Sam: That is unique.
Marisha: I feel like we're spending a lot of time on this, and maybe not enough time on our battle plan.
Liam: Oh, that would go to shit anyway.
Sam: Okay, so far, let's recap. Recap, vote, and move on.
Laura: Senokir, if you saw a bunch of people who looked the same, that went from small to big, wouldn't you want them as slaves?
Matt: "Depending."
Laura: They were totally hot, too.
Matt: "Probably."
Ashley: And also, if they had skills, each of them had a separate skill?
Matt: "Most likely. There are many unique slaves that pass through the Arches."
Laura: Oh, really? What's the most unique one you've ever seen?
Matt: "They've had a few celestials through before. Those generally fetch a pretty penny with the individuals you're speaking about. The winged ones, they apparently are very sought-after by the Nine Hells."
Laura: Wings! You have wings!
Marisha: Or we could Seeming wings?
Laura: Yeah, but they could probably see through that shit! His are real!
Liam: So far, only Cinnabons here has been able to see through my shit.
Laura: I feel like they'd be able to tell. But whatever.
Taliesin: If each of the sextuplets-- I'm never going to get tired of saying that-- were unique in their own way, and yours was that you had a trace of celestial which is why you have wings?
Travis: Do we still want to try and get him in the mansion?
Taliesin: Yes.
Sam: So wait, I'm going to recap these plans, here. Plan A, making us all sextuplets and trying to get him into the mansion.
Travis: Celestial sextuplets.
Sam: Plan B, we're all sextuplets--
Matt: Seeming does not add wings. It has the same arrangement of body parts. But if one of them has wings, you could change those wings into a different color.
Marisha: Can I use Alter Self, because Alter Self gives-- because I can give myself gills and stuff like that.
Sam: So, Plan A, again, sextuplets, slaves, mansion. Plan B, we're still sextuplets, but this time, we're somehow framing him for dishonoring the sultan and then attacking him in the middle of the square.
Taliesin: Which is why Plan A is much better.
Sam: Plan C, still sextuplets, that doesn't change, but now we're just ambushing him in the center of the Arches and we've paid off the guards to turn a blind eye.
Taliesin: We don't have enough money to pay off the guards.
Sam: We have tons of money!
Laura: We don't have that much money.
Sam: I mean, we could bribe them with six identical slaves. So what's it going to be? Plan A, the mansion that's certainly going to fail? Plan B, the framing job? Or Plan C, the bribery slash ambush?
Laura: Plan A, into plan B if it doesn't work!
Sam: All right, great!
Taliesin: Remember, we're just to show off. You've got more.
Sam: Of course I've got more.
Laura: What is the sultan's name?
Matt: "The sultan's name is the Grand Sultan of the Efreet, the Lord of Flame, the Potentate Incandescent, the Tempering and Eternal Flame of Truth, the Most Puissant of Hunters, Marshal of the Order of the Fiery Heart, the Smoldering Dictator, the Crimson Firebrand, Marrake al-Sidan al-Hariq ben Lazen."
Marisha: It's like when you start the little Halloween sing-y things.
Laura: I almost got it memorized though.
Travis: I thought Percy's was long, shit.
Taliesin: Mine's better.
Liam: Scan-Man, can you rearrange the inside of the mansion to look like whatever you want--
Sam: Yeah, what would it be? A slave auction house?
Liam: Could it be a theater for presentation, or a ring to show off amazing skills? Wings, arrows?
Sam: A circus side-show thing?
Taliesin: Somewhere between the Folies Bergere and Caligula's living room.
Sam: Caligula's living room, I can do.
Marisha: Maybe have a little side area with hookah and some nice dancers, you know? As he watches, to add to the atmosphere?
Sam: I mean, sure, I can do some of these things. Within reason. Right?
Matt: Maybe.
Sam: Once the mansion is built, does it stay built? It rebuilds every time?
Taliesin: I think it's like a Windows PC. You can change the desktop settings.
Marisha: What if the ladies went on a redecorating tear really fast?
Laura: They hung a bunch of fabric up and lit some candles?
Marisha: Dim the lights.
Matt: It's still a mansion. You have an indoor foyer. You can customize any other floor plan you like, and the decor of it, but it still looks like a mansion.
Laura: So we can put pieces of fabric up.
Ashley: Opium den style.
Liam: Can we build a stage out of chickens?
Taliesin: You could have little slave chickens.
Sam: I mean, that sounds so great. I'm on board. Let's try this stupid, crazy plan. So, we're going to go to the Arches tomorrow, disguised as the slaves of what's-her-butt?
Laura: Juuraiel?
Taliesin: You've already made a sale, and you have more back at the--
Sam: Sure. So, you're slaves, I'm a slave-master. What do I look like?
Laura: Whatever you want to look like.
Sam: No, I've got to look like a slave-master. Senny, what would I look like?
Matt: "I would recommend not being a pink-skinned gnome like yourself. Perhaps something that could live in this city."
Laura: Like maybe an imp!
Matt: "An imp would be interesting."
Sam: An imp with jewelry and such?
Matt: "However, an imp would not be solo and would probably still be behooven to the Nine Hells, and would work and be considered a subordinate to a pit fiend. I would not recommend an imp."
Sam: Give me a thing.
Laura: Something little.
Matt: "Perhaps an azer."
Laura: What is that?
Matt: "Well, as you would consider, close to them-- a dwarf. You may have seen a few." You've seen a couple of strange individuals throughout the city as you've walked by. They're dwarf-like, they're thick, they're muscular. They look like a dwarf, except for instead of hair and a beard, it's fire. A wreath of fire across dark grey, almost obsidian skin.
Taliesin: Baby Ghost Rider.
Laura: Awesome! Be one of those!
Matt: To give you a specific visual, to give you a feel for what I'm talking about here, when I say--
Taliesin: That's baby Ghost Rider!
Laura: That is awesome!
Sam: I'm in.
Liam: (high-pitched) Flames!
Liam: (high-pitched) Flames on the side of my face! Heaving, heaving breaths.
Taliesin: (high-pitched) Flames on the side of my face! Heaving, heaving breaths.
Matt: (high-pitched) Flames on the side of my face! Heaving, heaving breaths.
Sam: I'll make a mansion for the night. We'll all take a rest and then go tomorrow.
Matt: "I was going to make some beds. We have--"
Laura: Oh, that's so kind of you! But we have beds that are specific to us, and we--
Taliesin: Just the break from the heat is the only thing that would force us to deny your hospitality.
Matt: "Very well."
Taliesin: But we will keep the door to our rooms, of course, in your abode.
Matt: "Of course. We'll discuss soon our arrangement. Good night."
Taliesin: Why does he keep doing that?!
Ashley: Should one of us sleep in his house?
Laura: No, nobody should!
Taliesin: There's something wrong in it. There's something in the basement.
Travis: I have a quick request. Before I go to sleep, can I try and find Pike and see if she will teach me the alphabet, before my fox's cunning wears off?
Taliesin: That's the saddest thing I've ever heard.
Matt: You go and find Pike in her room. She comes to the door, already groggy, no pun intended. Sorry about that. You open your door and you see Grog standing there, looking a little sheepish.
Ashley: Grog, what's wrong?
Travis: Yeah, look, I had trouble sleeping, and I actually know Giant, but I can't read it. Do you think maybe, before this fancy smart-potion wears off, you could teach me some letters?
Ashley: Well, if we have a book or something, I could. A Beginning to Read Giant, is there anything like that where I could know what the letters are?
Travis: Well no, I don't see a lot of Giant, just even Common or--
Ashley: Just Common letters? Yes, I can show you the alphabet. I'll write it out. Okay? Do you know how to spell your name? Okay. It's very easy. You have four letters in your name, but there are two of the same letter. So you really only have three letters in your name.
Travis: How many-- I'm not so hot on the numbers, either.
Ashley: Okay, well, we won't talk about numbers. Okay, what's the first letter of the alphabet? This you know.
Travis: G.
Ashley: That's the first letter of your name.
Travis: Oh, it is!
Ashley: Yes, but that's not the first letter of the alphabet. You've said it before. Ah--
Travis: Ah-- I. Hey!
Ashley: Oh! It's the first letter, well, you wouldn't know that, because you don't know how to spell.
Travis: Fucking A, this is tough.
Ashley: Oh! You said it!
Travis: Fucking? A?
Ashley: A! A is the first letter of the alphabet.
Travis: A. Ay. A. A.
Ashley: And we can keep going-- (laughter)
Matt: Okay, for the purposes of the narrative, you spend the next few hours with Pike in your room, beginning to learn elements of the alphabet of Common. You go through enough of it where you pick up some of it and as the potion fades, so does the memory of the last three hours. (yelling)
Marisha: That's so mean!
Matt: This is Flowers for Grogernon. But it wouldn't have mattered because the Common alphabet and Giant runics are totally different things.
Travis: Yeah, totally. I just wanted to know something.
Ashley: Did I at least teach him how to spell his name?
Matt: Make an intelligence check, Grog.
Travis: Do I still-- no, it wore off, right? I don't have advantage.
Laura: You can do it, Grog! Roll a natural 20!
Matt: I'll say, as you feel the potion fading from you--
Travis: I burp, and I get a little bubble?
Matt: Sure. Go ahead and roll an intelligence check.
Travis: Oh, that's even worse. Aw, minus two, fuck! Twelve.
Matt: You get "Gr--" and that's where it ends.
Travis: My cursive is sweet. I'm so tired. You know, I've learned all of these but I'm really sleepy.
Ashley: We'll keep working on it.
Travis: I'm not sure we will. But yeah, keep working. Good night. Thank you, Pike.
Ashley: You sleep so well, okay?
Liam: Smash cut to a year later where he's going, "See. Kevdak. Run."
Ashley: No! That's so cute! Before I go to sleep, I am going to cast Lesser Restoration on myself, to maybe get rid of one point of exhaustion.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: Out of curiosity, sleeping outside of the effects of the heat should make--
Matt: That'd the Greater Restoration, technically, to try and--
Liam: There's AC in here, isn't there?
Taliesin: There's AC.
Laura: In the mansion. Not in the studio. (laughter)
Matt: Greater Restoration reduces exhaustion. But you can do that as well.
Ashley: I'll cast Greater Restoration before bed.
Matt: Okay. So you reduce a level of exhaustion.
Taliesin: I am going to send a little time working on a couple things for the fort when we get back. Netting ammo for the trebuchet, just a sketch. To start to design a very simple bolo for the trebuchet.
Matt: Okay. Just designing?
Taliesin: Just penciling and then penciling-- I've got a notion for a watch tower that's super super simple. Platform for two people, tops, with a rope that connects to a bell so when you start heading down it, it goes (high voice) Fuck!
Matt: Great. All right. So, as you guys all come to consciousness the next day, you gather your things and you step out of the mansion into the center of Senokir's shop.
Marisha: Do we recover our point of exhaustion when we sleep?
Matt: With the long rest, you recover a point of exhaustion, so you'll all back to baseline, including you, Pike, because your Greater Restoration. Your spells are recovered, HP is recovered, if there was any loss of it. So, the day is yours, what do you wish to do?
Sam: Go to The Arches. The golden arches. Wait, first we've got to cast Seeming.
Marisha: Are we going to scout-- I guess we still need Seeming.
Ashley: So we're all going to look like Vax?
Laura: And Vex.
Ashley: And Vex. All the girls are going to look like Vex.
Liam: Three Vex's, I mean, it's kind of the same.
Laura: I mean, yeah, but one's got boobs.
Liam: Which one?
Laura: Which one? (laughter)
Sam: We're going, right? All right. So, yes, I'll cast Seeming on everyone. Making them various level heights of Vex and Vax, I guess. (laughter)
Laura: (shouting) This is awesome.
Sam: And they're slaves, right? They're slaves. Tattered clothing.
Laura: No. No, make us look like good slaves.
Taliesin: Simple white robes.
Sam: All right. Simple tattered white robes. (laughter)
Laura: No, I want to look pretty.
Ashley: You're so rich, you want us clean.
Laura: Make us clean, like pretty slaves.
Sam: You're clean. That's right. You're the best of the best. You would have the best robes. Right?
Ashley: Like Princess Leia, Jabba the Hut.
Sam: Totally right. The best, finest simple white.
Travis: And we still have the neck thing.
Sam: Absolutely. And wait, am I making him celestial-ish?
Laura: Oh yeah, make his wings, when they come out, like white wings.
Sam: Is that a celestial? What does a celestial look like? Do they glow all the time?
Taliesin: They have white wings, correct?
Matt: Most angelic entities have white or gold wings.
Marisha: Did we find out if I could Alter Self wings?
Matt: You could not. It has to be the same physical structure.
Travis: Wait a minute. We don't want him walking through the streets, to The Arches, as a celestial. We want to get him in the house.
Taliesin: When he pops his wings, the wings will be gold.
Travis: Yeah, we haven't started walking though.
Liam: Can they be gold, delayed later, when they pop out?
Matt: We'll find out.
Liam: Oh, shit. Well.
Ashley: Can you hide them under a cape?
Sam: I don't know where you hide them normally.
Laura: They only last for an hour.
Liam: In my shoulder blades.
Sam: They're in you? Ew.
Liam: Yeah, well, it feels that way.
Sam: Are you Wolverine?
Taliesin: We are learning way too much about everyone.
Travis: So Seeming on everybody but Vax, right?
Sam: No.
Laura: No. Why?
Liam: The Seeming on us-- We look like us already.
Laura: It's just clothes, though.
Travis: Have we headed to The Arches yet?
Sam: We're walking there right now.
Travis: We're going to walk with a celestial in the middle of the streets?
Laura: No, we're saying we're not making his wings look like that yet, dude.
Matt: You guys are not sure where The Arches are.
Laura: Oh. Senokir?
Matt: "Yes?"
Marisha: Should we maybe go scout the location first as regular slaves?
Laura: No.
Sam: No.
Taliesin: No.
Matt: "What do you require?"
Laura: Hi, where are The Arches?
Matt: "Do you require guidance there? Uten, why don't you bring them to The Arches. I will not be joining you."
Taliesin: That's very fair.
Matt: "I wish not to get involved with a pit fiend. I will ask though, just to be safe, if I could have, of your choice, one small bauble to remember you by. As we still have an arrangement to discuss, and knowing, to an extent, your capabilities, there's a chance that you might escape without returning to me."
Liam: Is that for memories or for some voodoo shit?
Laura: It's voodoo shit.
Matt: "It is to make sure that should you abscond without upholding your end of the deal, I can find you."
Liam: From each of us or--
Travis: I can give him one of the Sandkheg bottles.
Marisha: No, it's okay. I Druidcraft a band around his arm.
Matt: "Thank you. That'll die soon."
Marisha: You can, like, preserve it.
Travis: No, it's going to die, Keyleth. Don't--
Matt: "It'll still function. It just will be lifeless. So, continue please. Stay safe."
Taliesin: Okay.
Sam: Yeah, great.
Travis: We go.
Matt: Uten is like, "Okay, follow me. I will lead you." Even he is looking a little weird over at Senokir.
Sam: And when I cast Seeming, I also cast it on myself, making myself look like an azer?
Matt: An azer. The flaming beard dwarf.
Sam: Yeah, I don't know if I can make flames with Seeming.
Matt: We'll say for the purposes of the illusion you can pull off something that resembles flames enough to the point where it should pass.
Sam: All right, great.
Matt: All right, so, as you guys walk out into the city, you are lead by Uten on a similar path that led you by the Pyriculum where you met Whaska, but you continue past that in the northeast direction heading towards, as he tells you as you pass, near the naval grounds of the Sea of Fire. Beyond that, you guys find the streets become wider and the network of clusters of metal cages begin to adorn portions of the center street islands. Within these cages, you see humanoids of all walks of life, creatures, beasts; it's a collection, a veritable zoo of entities from all the planes, all bound to various cages, chains, and other elements, whereas efreeti individually bark from top in a language you don't understand. You see large banners and streamers set across elements of the road to mark various segments of this area, and at this point Uten turns to you and goes, "Well, you have officially reached The Arches. I will bid you adieu as I also will not want to deal with a pit fiend. Good luck."
Laura: Wait, Uten.
Matt: (sighs) "Yes."
Laura: So what happens? Are these all for sale then and--?
Matt: "All the ones that do not look like they're yelling for you to buy something. Most likely."
Laura: Okay, and then other people come through. So, if you like do the door thing here then this could potentially be a market.
Marisha: Is it okay to just set up shop?
Matt: "If you are convincing enough."
Laura: Convincing enough?
Liam: Do we need a shingle to put out front?
Sam: A sign?
Liam: Flowers to make it look pretty?
Taliesin: Keyleth, can you shape something?
Liam: Oh my god, you look just like my sister! You look just like me! That is fucking weird-- (laughter)
Liam: I'm going to go stand over by Grog. I'll talk to you later, never mind.
Matt: You go walk over to Grog and look up at a much larger, slightly butcher version of yourself staring down at you.
Liam: Yeah! Slightly? Completely butcher! (laughter)
Travis: What's up, me?
Sam: Are we going to pose and start selling?
Laura: I mean, we'll set up shop and only sell to him.
Marisha: I could also, theoretically-- I just don't know well these things can see through other things. I could do Hallucinatory Terrain right around this and make us look like a little legit kiosk. With a little entrance incorporating your door.
Sam: How much can you change the--
Marisha: I can control it as much as I want.
Taliesin: Can you grow a gazebo?
Laura: Yeah, but people will see the gazebo appear out of nowhere.
Taliesin: It's a magical tent.
Sam: What do we need to sell people? We just need a slab to put them up on. To say, "Look here, there's this one for sale."
Laura: Yeah, but we need the mansion door to get him inside so we're not going to have us outside. Are we?
Sam: Yeah, of course, we're going to have you guys outside. How else are we going to convince him that there is more good stuff inside?
Laura: Oh, I understand.
Liam: We're the showroom window.
Taliesin: Can you grow a gazebo out of grapevines?
Sam: Or just a stone slab? We don't need much. Let's not break the bank.
Marisha: I mean, I could do some Druidcraft but that's minor. Growing a gazebo out of vines, that's Plant Growth. I guess I could do Plant Growth fairly instantly, without the full-- because it's a one or the other kind of a thing.
Laura: I thought you said Hallucinatory Terrain?
Sam: Why do we need a fucking gazebo?
Laura: Let's just fucking stand here.
Liam: We don't want to look like Three Card Monte guys with a cardboard box--
Laura: What if we danced?
Sam: Matthew, what does everyone else have around them?
Marisha: I still feel like if we are a crowd of slaves at a door--
Sam: What are the other kiosks? Are there any?
Matt: There are many scenarios in which you see people being sold. You find elevated wooden platforms, you find metallic stages that are being lifted by slaves, held up, where the barker shouts out among them. There are all sorts of presentations, each person is trying to shout over the other. Many of the various humanoids and efreeti you see in the vicinity are all yelling over each other and trying to catch attention. It's this weird constant barking, almost auction type atmosphere, where it's a lot of din, noise, music, and voices shouting over each other. It's also very crowded in this area. There are a couple small parts, there's like an alleyway nearby where there is a little more of an opening. Like if there was a spot to set up it would be there, if not there's-- probably could traverse the rest of the vicinity of the slave market but currently where you are that's the one space that's not too close to an existing shop.
Travis: Set up there.
Laura: Yeah, set up there. Then Grog, you lift him up and make him look super tall and we're doing this around him.
Travis: The celestial will sell itself. We don't need anything fancy.
Liam: In a row, in a row.
Laura: In a row, doing the same move.
Marisha: Can I Druidcraft some nice inviting looking bushes?
Travis: Shrubs?
Marisha: Shrubs, yeah.
Matt: Sure, which will definitely catch attention because no vegetation exists here for the most part.
Marisha: Never mind, then.
Matt: I'm just saying it would catch attention if you want people to look in your area.
Taliesin: No, it will be fancy. I think it will be fancy.
Marisha: What?
Taliesin: Plants where there are no plants is fancy.
Travis: What?
Ashley: And if a slave can do that, that's pretty special.
Travis: Maybe we wait until we see him so we don't get unwanted buyers.
Ashley: Maybe you can do some flair as people are walking by.
Sam: Should we sit here and wait for a while?
Travis: Yup.
Taliesin: Let's keep an eye out. Why doesn't whichever one of us is the one that can be sneaky and look around.
Liam: We all need to be voguing.
Travis: We're staying together.
Laura: We'll look as we're voguing.
Taliesin: All right. All right.
Travis: We wait to see if the pit fiend shows himself.
Sam: Can you guys all do like the Robert Palmer video? (laughter)
Matt: (singing) Simply irresistible.
Laura: Do you want to give us instruments and we'll all play something?
Sam: Sure, sure. I'll play a little ditty. We'll jam to it.
Matt: There is a series of smaller buildings in the area. There is the main street that runs through here and across that street is where there are many of the various slave blocks and larger platforms set. You guys find the entrance to this alley way, which curves around behind you and there is a large wall that leads to another section beyond that. This is where you begin to set up or where you're planning to set up shop. So you guys wait there for a while. Looking about, you can see, most of the people that are selling slaves there-- some of them are humanoid, some of them are kobold servants, some of them are worse for wear, looking like they are hoping to get sold soon before they expire. You do see, across the way, two young boys maybe about 15 or so years old, light blue-- (laughter)
Matt: No, Scanlan, no. (laughter)
Matt: Light blue skin and pupil-less. They are held by red-colored chains and they look broken of spirit and they are both sitting with a hunch.
Laura: Aw, can we get them? Go get them.
Sam: Poor Nightcrawler.
Laura: Go get them and see if we can get them.
Travis: Are they celestials?
Sam: I am going to go over there and buy these two kids? For what?
Laura: Maybe and then we can set them free once we're out of here.
Sam: All right.
Travis: What?
Taliesin: What?
Travis: No, leave them alone.
Sam: This isn't our fight.
Travis: Stay on target.
Sam: Do one of you want to go over there and say hi, slave to slave?
Laura: Yeah, I'll go over there.
Sam: Yeah, sure, go on.
Matt: Okay, Vex, by the way, your alignment's back up to Chaotic Good.
Laura: Oh! (fake sobs)
Matt: That was the last little push there with that instance.
Liam: I murder an old lady. (laughter)
Liam: Welcome back.
Matt: All right, so what are you doing?
Sam: I'll walk over with her so it doesn't seem weird that my slave is wandering around, I suppose. I guess?
Laura: Yeah, talk to the guy and I'll talk to the slaves.
Sam: They have an owner?
Matt: Yeah, as you approach the two of them, with the red chain around their necks and arms and they are leaning over the edge of the small wooden platform looking dejected at the ground. And approaching them, the skin itself is like a soft white porcelain with a slight translucent blue hue to it, white pupiless eyes. They look human, but they are beautiful and out of place here. Even in their destitution, you can't help but be struck by their presence. Both their chains are currently locked to this stump that is in the center of this wooden platform and behind it you see this grotesque-looking dwarf in very fine clothing that is very very dirty and old. He stands there clutching the edges of his lapel going, "All right, we've got here before you two, two I found and kept beneath my will. For sale. With angel blood within them."
Sam: (French accent) Hello, I am slave master Francois Australia and I am curious about your two angel boys. (laughter)
Matt: "Well, if you're looking to purchase, these will both set you back about 10,000 gold apiece or 18 for the set."
Sam: (French accent) What can they do? I would be curious to find out.
Matt: (whispering) "Whatever the fuck they can do I don't know. I wasn't selling them for their skillset. I was selling them for their uniqueness."
Sam: (French accent) How do you know anything about these boys? How did you get them?
Matt: "What's it to you, small one?"
Sam: (French accent) I like to see a chain of ownership so I know that the previous owner will not hunt me down and kill me in the night!
Matt: "There is no previous owner! I went and got them myself! The chain of ownership is this chain right here." He points to the one on the stump. You can see greasy black hair that is parted in the middle, mustache comes down into a weirdly fluffy beard that has weird oily portions of it. He's an awful-looking dwarf. "So, are you going to buy or shall I wait for the ones I'm looking for?"
Sam: (French accent) Which ones are those? (laughter)
Matt: "Piss off."
Laura: (whispering) Offer him 15 for the pair.
Sam: (French accent) (whispering) Merci. (normal volume) Would you take 15 for both of them?
Matt: "Are your ears clogged? I said ten each or 18 for the bundle!"
Sam: (French accent) Yes, but you don't seem to know where they come from, who they belonged to before. It's a risk that is possibly worth 3,000 gold.
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Liam: This is how Sam wooed me in 2008. (laughter)
Sam: Is this persuasion, solely? 20.
Matt: "Cash on hand? 15. (whispering) Don't tell anyone I said that."
Sam: (French accent) Oui. Oh, slave, can I have the gold? (laughter)
Sam: (normal voice) Are we really going to do this?
Laura: Yeah, we are going to buy them. We are buying them!
Travis: We're taking in everything.
Laura: They're so young! They're innocents.
Taliesin: And then we have extra slaves, it's beautiful.
Matt: "Haha. Well, it's been fine doing business with you." He puts the coins away, pulls out a piece of paper. "What's your full name?"
Sam: (French accent) Francois Bertrand Jean-Luc Australia. (laugher)
Matt: "Here you are. Transference of ownership." Grabs the chains, unhooks them, takes the lock and hands it to you. "They're yours to take. Now you two shove off! Do what the man says."
Sam: (French accent) Do they have names?
Matt: "No! It's your choice to name them!"
Sam: Au revoir.
Matt: So as the two of you walk back with these two chained boys who walk behind you--
Laura: Do you speak Common?
Matt: (stuttering) "Yes."
Laura: How did he find you?
Matt: "Well, we--" They both look at each other. "It doesn't matter, it's you who own us now."
Laura: It matters, dear.
Taliesin: Let's not have this conversation with them yet, sister, until all has been taken care of.
Laura: Ugh. (retching)
Travis: I see why we got them now. Even better bait.
Laura: Come stand over with us.
Taliesin: What, sister?
Liam: (retching)
Marisha: This is what we are now.
Liam: Grog, slap me really hard across the face right now.
Travis: Done.
Matt: Oh! He hits you and it's numb for minute. You realize, why is the world sideways? He knocked you to the ground.
Liam: Sweet, sweet ignorance.
Taliesin: Do you need a hand up, brother?
Travis: Stop hitting yourself.
Liam: I'm taking off a hit point.
Matt: The two children follow you back. They are chained and you have them at your disposal. What are you guys going to do?
Travis: We're waiting.
Sam: We're just waiting, I guess.
Laura: Do we have the mansion up?
Sam: Not yet. I'll say to the boys  You two, have you been for sale for more than a day or two?
Matt: "He's had us here for three days. Sorry."
Sam: It's all right. In that time have you seen a large red thing with big wings?
Matt: They both recoil, "No, no!"
Sam: Okay, all right. Thank you. We just wait, I suppose.
Laura: Yeah, I guess so.
Sam: You want to go buy a few more?
Laura: No, no, no, sorry. I'm sorry.
Ashley: You could just say, Angels for sale!
Liam: Wait, did you drop a bunch of gold on them?
Laura: No! No, no, no, we got an amazing deal.
Liam: Like how much?
Laura: Like, 50 gold. It was so affordable.
Taliesin: I want to do an insight check on that.
Matt: Go for it.
Taliesin: Insight check, okay, that's 22.
Matt: Make a deception check.
Laura: With my gold. Yikes, no, I don't win.
Matt: She is lying through her teeth.
Taliesin: You're an idiot and I'm very proud of you. Don't do that again.
Laura: Don't talk to me right now. Just don't. (laughter)
Taliesin: What if I were to do a very strange accent?
Laura: No, also not attractive.
Sam: (Vex impersonation) What if you were to talk like Vex?
Laura: Don't! Stop. (laughter)
Liam: I have found, put your hand up here like this when you're talking to them because Percival sounds like Percival.
Matt: While they're talking, Keyleth, you notice, across the way, the dwarf they had spoken to and purchased these two from has packed up his things and looks around, pulls a wand out, does a large circle, and him and his kiosk vanishes.
Liam: We fit right in.
Marisha: See, there are a lot of pop-up vendors here, guys.
Taliesin: Good to know. So if you summon your magical room--
Marisha: Maybe you'll be more impressive.
Sam: Makes sense.
Travis: Can I survey the road in the direction of the embassy. Do we see anything?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Travis: Natural one.
Laura: Aw, man!
Matt: You look over in the direction of the embassy and you stare at the embassy and from this far away it's hard to make out the shape but--
Travis: It looks like the letter ah--
Taliesin: You only know two. Pick one. (laughter)
Travis: And I stay there.
Taliesin: G and R, that's what you've got.
Laura: That is so sad.
Marisha: I could try and scry on him while we wait.
Sam: Yeah, scry again.
Travis: Nobody else wants to check the road?
Marisha: There is an alley behind us that we set up in front of?
Matt: Yes, there is an alley behind you for about 20 or so feet and then it curves off.
Marisha: Does anyone seem to be behind the alley?
Matt: From what you can see currently, no.
Marisha: Scanlan.
Sam: Oi?
Marisha: Do you want to come with me back into the alley for a little bit and watch, in case anyone sees? You could be giving me a good firm scolding, just in case.
Laura: Scanlan should be visible at all times.
Marisha: Well, it takes a minute to do the Scrying.
Sam: Vax, Vex, don't argue, we'll get through this. I mean, I'm going to go back with you so--
Marisha: Stand guard, I'll be right back.
Sam: Sure, I'll stand watch.
Marisha: I go back to a little dark corner and I pull out the Scrying Eye.
Taliesin: Pike--
Ashley: No, no, my name is Vex.
Taliesin: Vex, sister, do you want to perhaps do a walk around with the two boys and see if we can't attract some attention?
Ashley: Sure.
Sam: We're splitting the party.
Taliesin: I'm not getting far but I'm going to take the two boys--
Laura: You be careful with them.
Taliesin: I'll be very careful with them. I'm going to say, don't talk to anyone, don't look anyone in the eye, and don't answer any questions without my permission, do you understand?
Matt: "Yes."
Ashley: And don't be scared.
Matt: "Okay."
Taliesin: I've got a plan, follow my lead. This should be interesting.
Matt: As you guys begin to wander off with the two boys, Keyleth, you hold the scry crystal in your hand and, as you focus, you see this flash of heat in your mind and then darkness again. The spell has no effect.
Laura: He's not even here.
Sam: Or he's blocking it somehow.
Laura: No, I bet he's in the fucking Nine Hells right now.
Sam: Getting some money to go and come to the slave market.
Laura: Yeah, he's probably sold all the people that were hanging out with him last time.
Matt: Just so you're aware, the scry spell fails if they're not on your plane of existence or if they succeed their saving throw.
Sam: Ah!
Taliesin: You can try again in ten minutes.
Marisha: I can try again.
Taliesin: I'm going to look around for something interesting.
Matt: Okay, you begin to walk around, you hear the barking of various heavy-throated creatures. You come across this large, it looks almost like a wolf or dog but the face is a little less pronounced like a wolf and a little more humanoid in the front, but it is still bestial and monstrous. The coat is gray and matted and you can see these long fangs protruding. It barks and snarls but every single time it reaches for the bars-- and the bars themselves look like a flimsy wood-- but as it tries to tear at them or bite there is a spark of arcane energy and it backs up and seems to recoil from the attack and begins to pace back and forth in its cage again.
Taliesin: I try and discern who runs this establishment.
Matt: You also see behind that, there are two more cages that contain these very large insect-like creatures that have very long bodies with multiple legs, looks like a set of eight or so legs, almost like an oversized praying mantis, the giant pincers in the front, but they are currently collapsed on the ground within their cages resting in the heat. Behind them you see an individual that appears to be a similar racial background as Senokir, but is older with this red and graying goatee that comes to a very defined point at the end of the chin and is currently sitting, sipping off of a wine skin and watching you. (slurp)
Taliesin: Most humble greetings, good master.
Ashley: I'll bow as well.
Taliesin: My sister and I have been sent by our owner to peruse the market for things that he might enjoy and I have been asked to inquire upon the nature of what you're selling and your suggested price. Never making eye contact.
Matt: "Very well. We have today, and today only, two ankhegs for sale. Mind you, not bound. The will is yours to break. And one barghest at the front. The prices: the ankhegs are 500 gold apiece, the barghest, 8,000 gold."
Taliesin: My master is always interested in creatures of unusual disposition and he will be excited to know what you have for sale. I thank you for your time. May I please leave your-- I've lost my brain.
Matt: "Yes, please, go."
Taliesin: I bow, I back off properly. What are you feeding me in this cup? (laughter)
Matt: As time progresses and you guys have been wandering around, eventually the image does come across your mind as you wish to-- You wanted to Scry again?
Marisha: Yeah, whenever I can.
Matt: Okay. Still no success, unfortunately.
Taliesin: I'm making sure that the whole market knows that there is someone perusing and purchasing for unusual creatures and making sure they see the weird twins and the two angelic-- I'm making a show of it. And I'm making a show of our non-chained obedience.
Matt: As it progresses, the actual twins, you notice far up the way to where The Arches begin, you see a sight you've been seeking this entire time. You see a large, deep red entity begin strolling down the street with its burly rippling armored muscles, its giant red wings flared out behind it, its horned head and crest piercing the sky behind it as its burning eyes and fanged jaw and mouth. He lumps forward with each step, and as it does, you begin to see the essence of the necklace that had been described previously, dangling around its neck.
Liam: Preemptive jenga.
Sam: All right, we go back to the sales area.
Taliesin: We're not going to hurry. We're going to meander so that maybe we get seen.
Ashley: He gets a glimpse, yeah.
Liam: Can I tell you something really quick? I am super impressed with you. That was very kind. That's it. Get ready.
Matt: As you guys wait in the spot that you've chosen, the pit fiend, as you've rightfully designated it at this point, begins walking through and slowly making its way through the crowd. As it glances around, you can see it strolling up to a few bars and running its claws across. You hear the (clanking) sound of it-- thank you, Criss Angel. You see it running its claws across the bars with a heavy (clanking). It seems disinterested by many of the creatures that it passes by.
Marisha: Should I do something theatrical? Magicky?
Sam: I'll play a song. (singing) Hot in the city, hot in the city tonight! Tonight!
Matt: Make a perform check.
Sam: 23.
Matt: (heavy footsteps) It begins to eventually cross paths with the alley where you guys are situated. It turns its head and looks down to you, with your flaming beard and fire-wreathed head, playing your song. It slows its gait ever so slightly. It is an imposing and frightening entity. Even just being in its presence, even as you play the best you can, you feel everything almost slowed down in its proximity as its sheer immensity passes you, leaving you in its shadow for a momentary bit of time. In that moment, you feel the back of your neck stand on end. All the hairs immediately come to full point. You feel cold and alone as it sets its eyes upon you. It moves its gaze beyond and continues walking.
Taliesin: I'm going to walk by with the slaves.
Matt: Okay, so you come by, the other direction, as you guys finish your meandering. As you walk by, it (footsteps stopping). Looks at the two boys that you've procured and slows.
Sam: I'll call out to Percy  (French accent) It's no use! No one has enough money for our slaves! Forget it. We should clean up and go home.
Taliesin: Of course, master.
Ashley: Of course, sir. We tried so hard.
Matt: The pit fiend has turned about and is standing there with its arms crossed, watching this transpire maybe halfway up the block where you guys had set up. Its eyes narrow with a bright spark of yellow light that situates where its face is. (heavy footsteps) It saunters up in your direction, looks over to where the rest of you are, and where the two--
Sam: Is he coming over?
Matt: He's heading in your direction.
Sam: Okay, I'll summon the magnificent mansion door, and I'll say to the slaves: (French accent) All right, it was worth a try, but we must pack it in.
Matt: As you're saying this, the pit fiend puts a hand up. Its mouth doesn't move but you hear a voice piercing deep inside your head. It says, "Stop. I have discourse to make with you, small one."
Sam: But of course. I am here to sell, if you are here to buy.
Matt: "I have interest with your aasimar."
Sam: (French accent) They are for sale, for a good price.
Taliesin: I've already brought them into the mansion. I've already handed them off and said: Put them very far downstairs. Hide them.
Matt: You bring them into the mansion?
Taliesin: Oh yeah. I've brought them into the mansion and have put them downstairs. The servants are taking them down.
Sam: (French accent) We have already packed up for the day, but if this is a serious business proposal, well, I can go in and fetch them.
Matt: The creature leans down toward you, the pit fiend's very presence itself almost causing the air to vibrate around you. Though it is not the largest creature that you've faced, there is something about its presence that is purely evil. A bastion of power across all elements of the cosmos that you haven't had stare you down at this proximity. As it leans forward, the voice once again pierces the center of your brain. "It would do well to bring them forth."
Sam: (French accent) I cannot just communicate with them. Would you join me inside my shop? There you will see many other fine specimens.
Matt: "What is your price?"
Sam: (French accent) Well, you haven't seen what I have to offer.
Matt: "I have seen enough."
Sam: (French accent) So you are not interested in the naga, the goristro, the other celestial beings? The orcs?
Matt: Make a deception check.
Travis: Deceiving the devil, come on, baby!
Sam: 31.
Liam: (airhorn noises)
Matt: "Perhaps in time, but now I seek the aasimar in your possession."
Liam: But I did the airhorn!
Sam: (French accent) If you please, and with due respect, I do not see any jewelry or fineries on your person. Can you afford such prices that I will quote you?
Matt: As you say this, the eyes narrow. It leans back as its head cocks slightly. "Have you never done business in this city before?"
Sam: (French accent) I'm afraid that I haven't. But if you are serious, and it seems that you are by the way that you are not moving your mouth--
Matt: He begins walking away from you.
Sam: (French accent) Wait! Would you like to come inside with me and see them for yourself?
Matt: It has completely written you off and is walking northward, back from whence it came.
Travis: Quick, throw a price out!
Sam: (French accent) 30,000 apiece!
Matt: (footsteps) Slows its gait, turns around, (footsteps) keeps walking.
Sam: (French accent) 10,000!
Matt: It stops. Turns around and starts heading back toward you. (footsteps) The voice once again pierces, this time even more intense, more oppressive. You've seen shadow. You've never really felt it inside you before. The voice itself presses against your will. You hear it say, "Your price is acceptable. You know the Embassy is good to pay. Present the charges, and I will take them."
Laura: Can I come out and bow before Scanlan and say, "Forgive me, master, for interrupting, but the female aasimar is fighting back."
Sam: (French accent) Well, put her-- ugh-- I'm so sorry, sir. I must go deal with this. I don't want to make you wait here. You are clearly a man of respect.
Matt: "I will wait." It stays there, across the way, with its arms crossed, about ten feet from you.
Sam: (French accent) I will be right back, I promise.
Laura: I know she is much more powerful than the boys, but we cannot control her.
Sam: Did she use the magic?
Laura: All of it, my master! All of the magic!
Sam: Oh my god. Oh my god! I run into the mansion.
Matt: I would like you to make a deception check and you to make a deception check, please.
Travis: (laughing) Did she use the magic?
Sam: Can I inspire myself? Can I, after I know my roll?
Matt: Yeah, that's part of what's good about it.
Sam: Oh. Well, then fucking yes, I'll inspire myself. That helps.
Matt: What'd you roll?
Sam: One.
Matt: That's an auto-fail.
Laura: I rolled a 28.
Sam: Hey, she's good!
Matt: Well, as you charge in, and you're staying outside of the door? You watch as the creature, staring at Scanlan-- or his persona-- talk to you and then charge through the doorway. The pit fiend (sniffs) looks over to you.
Sam: Inside the mansion, I run up to Grog and I say: Cut me! Cut my face, cut my arms, cut me. Right now.
Travis: Okay, I pick him up by the top of his head and I do a one, two, three!
Laura: While I'm outside, I say  Could I offer you some refreshments, great master?
Matt: The voice echoes through your head in a way that is genuinely the stuff of nightmares. You feel your will crack slightly at its presence. It says, "No."
Laura: (small voice) Okay.
Travis: I also spit in your eye so it starts to water.
Sam: Great. I run out of the mansion. (French accent) Oh my god! Oh! It's incredible in there! She is so powerful! She cut me with her mind! Please, come with me, I will need help with this.
Matt: The voice says, "Your deceptions are angering and useless. If there is no business to be had, I will let the embassy know. You will not have business in this city ever again."
Liam: I slowly flex out my black wings, slowly, and lower them, and take a step half-covering you, and say, Are you all right, master? Do you need my help?
Sam: I think so? I'll say to the young man  All right, I am sorry to play these games and haggle with prices. I will go fetch them immediately. I'll go in the mansion and yell: Fucking jenga! We've got to fucking kill this guy! We've got to go kill him right now! Come on! Let's go!
Travis: Well, we're inside. Do we want to set up a sneak attack? Can we?
Laura: It's too late!
Travis: Why?
Laura: Because he's outside, dude! I'm out there with him. So is Vax.
Travis: Who's inside the mansion?
Marisha: We didn't really specify.
Matt: Yeah, you're in the alleyway still.
Marisha: I'm in the alleyway with the twins.
Liam: How are the twins and boss-man here arranged in the alley, or outside the door?
Matt: The doorway is in the alley. It's right where the alley meets the street. Keyleth is behind the alley. The twins are on the sides of the doorway, so you guys are along the sidewalk of the street. Grog is inside, along with Scanlan, Percy, and Pike.
Liam: What's our proximity to him?
Matt: He's about 15 feet from you guys. He's across the street, at this point, with his arms crossed, keeping a distance.
Marisha: 15 feet across the street?
Sam: I can go out with the two angels, get him to come over and look at them, at least. Then you guys can pour out? I don't know.
Travis: You can bring them out in front of the house if you want to. Then when he walks over we can--
Sam: Yeah, bring them up.
Laura: I don't want him to hurt them.
Marisha: I packed this, just in case.
Sam: You want to be an angel?
Marisha: No, I packed Feeblemind.
Laura: What does that do?
Sam: It could maybe work.
Marisha: It's an 8th-level spell, and it makes him stupid.
Sam: Can you look like an angel?
Marisha: No. Well, I could use Alter Self.
Laura: Can you make yourself step out-- no, I said there was a female.
Marisha: As one of the female aasimar?
Matt: You guys are having this conversation over your earpiece?
Sam: No, but we're in the-- oh shit. She's not there.
Matt: I was going to say. But you're in direct line of sight to the pit fiend.
Laura: So I'm not saying anything. I'm sorry.
Marisha: This guy has to make an intelligence saving throw.
Sam: All right, you do whatever you want. Give me the angels. I'm going to go back out there.
Marisha: Do you want me to try and make this guy stupid?
Sam: Yeah, if you can! Do whatever you can! All I'm trying to do is get him to stay long enough for you guys to do something.
Travis: Yeah, get him to come toward the door.
Marisha: He's 15 feet away?
Sam: Are you inside the mansion?
Marisha: No, I'm outside. I'm in the alleyway. How many feet away am I from him?
Matt: From him right now? About 35 feet.
Marisha: Is he aware of my presence?
Matt: You don't know.
Marisha: I'm going to saunter further down the alleyway. This has a 150-foot range.
Matt: Okay, so you pull even further back? Okay, make a stealth check.
Marisha: Ooh, that's good. 21.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: I've got the angels. I'm walking back out. Right?
Laura: No!
Ashley: I'll be behind them.
Matt: Okay, so Pike is coming out with the two aasimar.
Laura: Fuck.
Travis: I'll exit the mansion too, and start walking toward the embassy a few steps, slowly. Just to get distance.
Laura: I get ready. The minute, well, never mind.
Marisha: Okay. So wait, what are you doing?
Sam: I'm going outside with the two angels.
Matt: So, you exit with the reddish chains in hand and both of the boys exit with you. As soon as they walk out of the portal and they see, across the way, the pit fiend standing there with his arms crossed, they both (gasps) you hear the breath escape their lungs as the fear hits them. The pit fiend's arms go lax. You can see a bit of a smile on its face, now. It looks like its pensive frustration in waiting has been expended. The voice says, "You will be paid."
Sam: All right.
Taliesin: Money first.
Sam: I don't want to fucking bargain with this thing.
Marisha: As he goes to hand over the chains, right as he goes to reach for it, I'm going to do Feeblemind.
Matt: Feeblemind, okay.
Marisha: Jesus fucking Christ!
Sam: Don't miss and hit me, babe!
Matt: All righty, what's the DC on this?
Marisha: He's got to make an intelligence saving throw.
Matt: Correct, and what's your spell DC?
Marisha: 19.
Matt: 19. Okay.
Laura: Oh god. Natural one, natural one.
Marisha: Come on, come on.
Matt: All right. As it takes one step forward toward Scanlan, you, in the back of the alleyway, extend your finger. You watch as this slight shift of light travels forward, like a slight ripple, almost like a miniature breaking of the sound barrier. Strikes across the air. Seems to collide with the front of the pit fiend. As it hits, the energy (fizzling) dissipates, not affecting its form. You watch as the pit fiend suddenly, its attention--
Marisha: He takes 4d6 psychic damage.
Matt: He does.
Liam: Was Scanlan walking toward him, or had they gotten right up against each other?
Laura: I release Trinket from my crystal necklace.
Marisha: He saved from it, didn't he?
Matt: He does not appear affected by the ability.
Marisha: He's not affected by the ability?!
Matt: I mean, he took damage, but the Feeblemind did not seem to alter him.
Laura: Are there any of the efreeti guards around?
Matt: Currently, you do not see any. However, let's go ahead and pick up this confrontation next week. It's 11:00. If we jump into this now, we'll be here past midnight.
Taliesin: No, yeah, we're calling it.
Marisha: Gives us time to think.
Laura: We took too long.
Matt: It's all good.
Taliesin: This got wonderfully bad.
Liam: I'm going to forget by next week. Is Scanlan walking toward him, or had Scanlan gotten right next to him?
Matt: Scanlan stepped out of the door and walked out just enough-- Scanlan is probably ten feet from the door, there, right behind him, just emerged from the doorway. He's about ten feet from Scanlan, and 15 from-- Correct. I'll set up the arrangement for next week. I'll put something together for you guys so you know what we're going to start with next week. But yeah, we're going to jump in, next Thursday, into a mid-street City of Brass battle.
Liam: Sextuplets!
Sam: Vex, Vax, Vax, Vex, Vex, and Vax!
Matt: Here's the one thing I'm going to leave you with, because I feel this is important. As soon as you guys watch this slight dissipation of arcane energy splash across the torso and head of the pit fiend, and it steps onto its back foot, and you all realize this is the Jenga moment. As you're preparing to go into combat, you watch as the pit fiend narrows its eyes and, from immediately to its left, a small, localized gateway tears open and out from it you watch a humanoid female with large, red, feathered wings, carrying some sort of glowing lasso or rope at her side, armor, and a large weapon, with a bow slung across her shoulder, flies out next to the pit fiend. "You rang?"
Laura: Aw, fuck.
Matt: And that's where we'll pick up next week.
Laura: We're doomed.
Matt: So, we'll see you guys next week. Thank you very much. Thank you, Ashley, for coming and playing.
Ashley: I won't be here next week.
Matt: You won't be here next week? Aw, you're filming Thursday? Aw.
Liam: What you going to be working on?
Ashley: I don't know. Stuffs and stuffs.
Travis: Yay, Pike!
Marisha: We'll get you that armor!
Matt: Well, guys, thank you very much. Have a good night, rest well. Thank you, Loot Crate. Is it Thursday yet? See you guys soon. [music]

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of nerdy-ass voice actors and awesome writing guest play Dungeons and Dragons. Before we get into the chaos for tonight's episode, let's go ahead and knock through our announcements. First and foremost, tonight's episode is brought to you by Magic Puzzle Quest. (all cheer)
Sam: Marvel Puzzle Quest!
Matt: It was written "Magic" on here. Marvel Puzzle Quest.
Sam: Mazel tov Puzzle Quest.
Matt: Yay! Marvel Puzzle Quest, our sponsor for tonight. Sam, you had a few words?
Sam: Marvel Puzzle Quest is available now on Apple and Android devices. The latest update adds Riri Williams, a.k.a. Ironheart. You can check it out at bit.ly/criticalmpq-- that'll be posted all over the place, but I got a chance to play this game, and let me just tell you, I'm a pretty good gamer. I just loved being able to play this game through. I tried it on a PS4, I tried it on a PS3, I tried it on Xbox 360, because I'm a 1337 gamer. I tried it on Steam Engine, because that's how you get games, and it was amazing. You can play as all your favorite Marvel characters, like the Avengers. The Avengers include characters like Elrond Man, Nick Furry, Red White and Blue Shield Guy, the Hulch, and there's other characters like Lord Star, Dice Man, Carnage, Aunt Man, Professor Triple X, and the Medical Team; that's what I call these characters called Dr. Doom, Dr. Strange, and Dr. Octopus; they're all medical doctors and they all fight for good. There's Kamala Chaka Khan, there's Juggs or Not-- (all laugh)
Sam: You can play as the Human Porch, he just relaxes. Nic Cage. One of my favorite X-Men is Jennifer Grey, from Dirty Dancing. There's Rocket and Poot and everybody's favorite Canadian tough-guy, Walford Rains. Snicket! Yeah. And you solve puzzles and it's really addictive.
Matt: Thank you, Sam.
Travis: Oh my god. Jugs or Not.
Marisha: We're like the only show that a sponsor's going to let us get away with botching their product.
Sam: That's the names! You haven't played like I have. That's the names of the characters, I'm pretty sure.
Patrick rothfuss: I love the team of Professor Triple X and Dr. Strange.
Sam: They all have PhDs. It makes sense.
Taliesin: They're pronounced Centennials, actually.
Marisha: I don't like millennials. I'm a Centennial.
Matt: Thank you very much, not Magic, but Marvel Puzzle Quest, for being our awesome sponsor tonight. Check out their stuff. All right, also, Marisha, do you want to talk a bit about the promo code?
Marisha: If you watched Talks Machina this week on Tuesday night, you saw that we gave away a promo code, hashtag-- no, no hashtags. It's just a code. Just the code "TALKS." Like if you're talking, like I'm doing right now. "TALKS" as in Talks Machina, and that gives you 30 days free trial on Alpha, so if you're a good gamer like Sam is--
Sam: I'm 1337.
Marisha: You know that those things stack, so you can use your free subscription from Amazon Prime, and then use another 30 days, and then it's only 30 more days before your checks expire and then they're not good anymore.
Sam: Is this like a Columbia House thing where you keep doing a new subscription?
Liam: You're dating us.
Taliesin: I think our audience gets the joke. The camera's laughing.
Marisha: Anyway, yes. Promo code "TALKS."
Patrick rothfuss: Columbia House is where the X-Men used to live. Before it was the mansion, it was Columbia House.
Marisha: Oh! You should also go watch Talks Machina, too.
Matt: It's our crazy little aftershow. We have silly discussions, answer community questions, and generally just hang out and make fools of ourselves for your entertainment.
Marisha: It's good fun.
Laura: Along with Brian W. Foster!
Matt: Laura, Travis, me, and Marisha once again will be guests at Anime Milwaukee next month. We'll be up there Friday through Sunday doing panels, signings, all kinds of chaos. Come see us, come say hi. Bring things we'll sign them. Bring questions and we'll answer them. Bring handshakes and we'll touch them.
Laura: What are those dates again?
Travis: February 17th through the 19th.
Matt: February 17th through the 19th. Yes.
Travis: Or whatever the dates say.
Matt: Sorry, I'm going off what I have. And merchandise, Laura.
Laura: Hey, guess what?
Matt: What?
Travis: What?
Laura: There's some merchandise! (all cheer)
Liam: Can you buy it?
Laura: You can buy it in the shop on Geek and Sundry. There's nothing new this week, but there's all the stuff that I talked about last week, like socks and hoodies and hats and bracelets and pens--
Sam: Wait, we have socks now?
Laura: Oh, you missed it!
Sam: Socks Machina?
Laura: Socks Machina!
Marisha: So we have Critical Role socks, which apparently they've done really good, we've already sold half, and people are already super excited for us to have character-driven socks.
Taliesin: They're really comfy, but then I took them off and my cats found them and now they will not give them back.
Matt: Don't give them to your cats.
Taliesin: No, this is really true, they've taken them and they're not giving them back.
Matt: For context, Socks Machina was a joke of ours over a year ago, and now it's happening.
Sam: It sounds pretty stupid.
Travis: They're really nice, man.
Marisha: We came up with Socks Machina at the same time that we came up with Lox Machina, which is our branded smoked salmon.
Laura: That's someday soon, guys. I'm hoping for that in the store.
Travis: There'll be Grog socks with just tons of holes in them.
Matt: Perfect.
Travis: Made by me.
Laura: Gross, really stinky. No, they should look like barbarian boots, fur-lined boots since you're--
Travis: Not as cool.
Marisha: Oh, with little fur on top?
Travis: They're going to smell like balsamic vinaigrette or something.
Sam: Can mine have garter belts?
Laura: If you want.
Sam: Thank you.
Matt: All righty. And last but not least, we have International Tabletop Day coming up April 29th, where we here are going to be celebrating everything tabletop. We'll have more announcements as the week gets closer and closer to it, but we're excited for it. A bunch of us, if not all of us, are going to be involved in some way or another, and just keep an eye out for announcements as they roll out. So mark it on your calendar. April 29th.
Travis: April 29th.
Matt: I think that's it, if anyone has anything else they want to announce?
Liam: Oh, I got a quick one. Taliesin and I were playing Ubisoft's game For Honor this morning for Nerdist and Geek and Sundry.
Taliesin: And it was fun!
Liam: It was fun.
Taliesin: It was nuts.
Liam: There'll be more of it tomorrow. We got a couple of warriors in there. I'm playing the knight. The chivalrous knight in that game.
Travis: I play a viking.
Taliesin: No, it's good fun. I'm back in tomorrow morning. Actually, you can see me tomorrow morning at 9AM Pacific Time.
Liam: You got a major renfaire boner playing that game today.
Taliesin: It's hot. It's pretty hot. It's great. I want to collect all the things and basically use it as a play on the little Renaissance-era barbie doll. And just paint him and put things on and change armors.
Travis: Okay, all right, okay. Jeez.
Matt: PVP Renfaire adventure. For Honor. That's awesome, cool. Anything else? All right. Then let's go ahead and jump into tonight's episode of Critical Role. [INTRO]
Matt: Welcome back, everyone. So, picking up where we left off from my esteemed panel of extremely mature--
Travis: No one can hear it, man. It doesn't exist.
Sam: (singing) In the morning.
Matt: Anyway. Bringing us into tonight's episode, leading up to where we are currently in the story: Vox Machina, having spent a period of time battling with the Chroma Conclave, a collection of evil and allied chromatic dragons that terrorized the Tal'Dorei countryside, have acquired artifacts called the Vestiges of Divergence. After traversing the planes and locations to gather allies, they made war on the current occupying armies of Thordak the Cinder King in the center of the capital city of Emon, managed to eke out a victory, destroying Thordak, and apparently go into battle with a dragon they'd made an alliance with, known as Raishan, the Diseased Deceiver, a member of the Conclave with which they had a very tenuous agreement to work together. After being nearly killed by Raishan as she flew the coop, essentially, you managed to collect the remaining armies of the city, made sure everyone was okay. You ran into an old friend from Westruun, Kerrek, who had brought a number of his able-bodied warriors with him to aid in this battle. You then made your way to Whitestone with Kerrek to ascertain the location of Raishan, the Diseased Deceiver, of which apparently she had absconded to what's called the island of Viskon. It used to belong to a necromancer and then briefly became the lair of Thordak the Cinder King before his original attack on Tal'Dorei roughly 16 years ago. You then gathered your weapons, your armor, and your reserve strength, and with a couple of allies traversed through teleportation all the way to this island, managed to battle your way through a deep dungeon that once this necromancer called home, going past traps and chasms filled with undead, and gravity reversed through magical means. You made your way into a small tunnel just past this area into what seemed to split into two sides. Behind that, what appeared to be the necromancer's sanctum, some sort of necrotic laboratory, where you discovered there within two of the eggs of Thordak's lair that were taken by Raishan, the corpse of Thordak, folded in the corner, and apparently Raishan's female human form, currently poring through books and rummaging through what currently appears to be the relatively untouched necropolis chamber. So, last we left off, the two twins had snuck ahead to take a look and take in the information of this vicinity, while the rest of the party began to slowly approach from behind. As the rest of the party is coming behind, I would like everybody else to make a stealth check, please.
Marisha: Do we have Pass Without a Trace?
Laura: Yes. No.
Matt: I don't believe you cast it. Did you?
Taliesin: Ages ago.
Liam: Yeah, ages ago. I just don't know how long it lasts.
Travis: Yeah, it's been a while.
Matt: You've lost concentration since then.
Laura: Yeah, I don't think I've cast it since we came out the other side.
Liam: Flying up on the broom, all that.
Laura: Natural 20 for Pike!
Travis: That's a good thing.
Matt: Great. She has disadvantage because of her armor. Roll again. Well, no, she put on the elven boots, didn't she?
Laura: No, Kima did.
Matt: That's right. So yeah, roll again.
Liam: Just roll another 20.
Travis: Just do it again. Here we go. Hi! Hey!
Marisha: We've done it before and we can do it again.
Travis: Not as great.
Liam: Never mind.
Travis: What is it?
Laura: Four?
Matt: Four.
Travis: Plus? Plus?
Laura: Nothing.
Travis: Cool. 13.
Taliesin: Eight with a natural one.
Marisha: Ten total.
Sam: Not good.
Travis: Let's be honest, she fucking knows we're here.
Patrick rothfuss: This was my one 20 of the night, folks, everyone else--
Laura: Failed you.
Marisha: It just means you won't die first.
Taliesin: She doesn't know you're here.
Laura: Yeah, you're invisible. You have an invisibility ring.
Patrick rothfuss: I put on the ring and I just leave. (all laugh)
Patrick rothfuss: Just gone.
Matt: One step.
Taliesin: And that's how Bilbo's insurance company started. Just going home. We can start again with a real job. I'm done.
Liam: 30.
Matt: 30?
Laura: Wait, the twins are rolling too? I should've taken that 20 for myself, then.
Liam: Yeah, I thought you did.
Matt: You guys are still on the same stealth roll as last time. You're fine. Grog?
Travis: 13.
Matt: 13.
Liam: What the fuck was that?
Laura: I don't know. Trinket's still in my necklace.
Matt: Trinket's still in your necklace.
Laura: I left him in because he healed. He's in my necklace.
Matt: He is.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: All right, so. As you guys turn the corner on the right side of this hallway, you saw this laboratory filled with bookshelves, chains, candelabras on the walls, a large door across the back wall. There are two pillars in the center of the room that are strewn with various magical engravings. You see this bunch of books scattered across the ground, pulled out of the bookcase, and there's one that's opened against this book-holding platform. You see two cages in the back of each corner that seem to contain some sort of slumped corpse or body of some kind. It's hard to see in the low light of this room because the only light you're getting is from the candelabras in the space. There you see the woman with long, dark green hair, silverish pale skin, robes, piercing eyes of yellow and emerald. As the rest of your party catches up from behind you with the ever-so-subtle sounds of metallic footfalls and plated armor against plated armor, the female figure seems unfazed by it and just continues to turn a page and grab another book. Takes a book and reads a passage of it and throws it off in the corner. There's a pause before the female figure stops, and still facing away, begins to speak out into the air of the room. "Well, you certainly proved quicker than I anticipated, but I unfortunately have business here, and I would kindly ask you all to leave. The Conclave has served its purpose, as you have served yours. We have nothing more to discuss." Turns another page of the book and continues facing away.
Liam: Can I look at the ceiling, every other part of this room except for where she is, to see if she's also somewhere else?
Matt: Sure, make a perception check.
Travis: I think we should just leave. (all laugh)
Liam: 22.
Matt: Okay. Glancing about, even with your low-light vision, the halls here are roughly 20 to 25 feet wide and about as much in height as well, 25 to 30 feet tall, carved arches. You don't see any other alcoves or hidden spaces. It appears to be just this figure in this room amongst the rotting corpse of Thordak and the two eggs tossed to the side.
Patrick rothfuss: I'm going to burn my final Divine Sense, just because I've never been exposed to this creature at all. She's got a lot of extra names like "the Diseased" and "the Corrupter" and whatever, so I don't know if she might be-- I have no idea. I'm just trying to draw a bead on whatever's in the room.
Matt: Right.
Patrick rothfuss: It's 60 feet, and I think it's fiends, corrupted, and undead. Location and type.
Matt: Correct, okay. So as you hear these words echoing through the hallway around you, the rest of the group, the tension rising. You watch as just through a quick glance, each ally in the room, their bodies just instinctually tighten, their muscles getting ready for anything at this point in time. You close your eyes and focus on the presence around you. You do not sense anything.
Patrick rothfuss: Okay.
Matt: No celestials, no fiends, no undead.
Laura: Did the party, as they were clomping along, did they catch up with us at all, or are they still that far back?
Matt: They're still this far back, nobody has-- this is where you guys stopped upon the discussion happening, so the twins are still up ahead. The rest of the party is halfway through this unit here. The actual chasm ends over on this side here, and this is the entranceway with the fountain you had discovered.
Travis: Somebody should roll off to the left.
Laura: Before any of that happens, though, I want to get Pike to step forward so she's within 30 feet of everybody. As many people as possible. Can she be right in the middle?
Matt: That's about as close to middle as she can get right now.
Marisha: Can we all move up a little bit?
Taliesin: I'm going to peel off a little bit to the left--
Laura: But wait just a fucking second so she can cast Beacon of Hope on everybody! Just one second. She's trying to help you.
Taliesin: I just got yelled at in my earpiece, so I will not--
Laura: Pike's like, "Just a fucking second! Let me cast Beacon of Hope!"
Taliesin: Sorry, sorry.
Travis: Pike swore.
Marisha: Pike!
Matt: What's the range on Beacon of Hope?
Laura: 30 feet.
Matt: 30 feet. All right. So that would get... that would be everybody. Everybody is currently under the effect of Beacon of Hope.
Sam: What does that mean?
Patrick rothfuss: Which is...
Sam: We are very hopeful now.
Laura: Which means that you are hopeful and vital.
Matt: Is it a perpetual radius of her, or does it affect each person at the time of casting?
Laura: It affects everybody at the time of casting.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: I think. It just says range is 30 feet. Choose any number of creatures within range. For the duration, each target has advantage on wisdom saving throws and death saving throws, and regains the maximum number of hit points when healed.
Matt: Yes, that's correct. All of you guys have this effect on you as long as she maintains concentration. So keep tabs on maximum healing and wisdom saves and death saves.
Taliesin: Is she really there, or is that an illusion?
Laura: I can't tell. Can I tell if it's really an illusion, or does it look like she's really there?
Marisha: Can you sense her?
Taliesin: Yeah, try to sense.
Laura: Well, I couldn't sense her before when she was in her human form, so I'm assuming I can't sense her now.
Marisha: Like she's got something masking her, that whole thing?
Laura: Yeah, I mean.
Travis: She's the Deceiver.
Laura: I did the dragon-sense right before we came down this hallway and I sensed three dragons down here.
Taliesin: Okay.
Marisha: Right. Okay.
Matt: Okay. In the time it's taken you guys to deliberate and discuss this, and the long awkward pause that's transpired after Raishan said the previous thing she did, her voice picks up once again and says, "Whereabouts is your brass pet?"
Laura: Whereabouts are you?
Matt: No response.
Marisha: Keyleth steps forward a little bit towards the twins.
Travis: Percy and Grog are going to roll off to the left.
Taliesin: We're peeling off to the left, and I'm going to wall-walk. I'm going to keep going until I'm on line-of-sight with the red eggs against the back wall.
Matt: You can get there.
Travis: Cool.
Taliesin: Not that far, not even that far, like there. Yeah.
Liam: I would like to move across from my sister and move forward up to-- I can't tell from the overview, but a little bit of rock's right there?
Matt: Right there, yeah.
Liam: And stay hidden.
Matt: There?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: All righty.
Marisha: Keyleth just says, "Did you find what you were looking for?"
Matt: "I did, actually. I discovered Thordak's original intent. Before the soul anchor drove him insane and he lost sight of his purpose. Well, it appears that it holds the same answer that I've been seeking as well. So. In a word: yes."
Marisha: And this is the answer to your... disease you were looking for? Your curse?
Matt: "Perhaps."
Marisha: I'm assuming it has something to do with the soul gem. Do you think you can resist the same type of madman mentality that Thordak fell victim to when you anchor yourself?
Matt: Still facing away, you see the shoulders shift with a chuckle. "I would not dare touch such a piece. It is far too dangerous. The soul gem is destroyed. It is of no use to me."
Laura: While that conversation's going on, I want to bamf Trinket out and send him around the other way.
Travis: To the left?
Matt: Around this way?
Laura: With Grog.
Matt: Okay, have Trinket roll a stealth check, if you could.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: Being a big bear.
Laura: Come on, Trinket! You're so quiet-- ooh! Trinket rolls a 19.
Travis: Why a stealth check?
Sam: Maybe the lair or something.
Laura: Well maybe she doesn't know Trinket's here.
Patrick rothfuss: I'll move up a little bit, too.
Matt: To how far?
Patrick rothfuss: Enough so that hopefully I can get as many people within ten feet as possible, and ideally within 30 feet, if I need to rush and attack.
Matt: Okay. Currently, you are in a space to get three people in your area. You could either move forward with them, or if you wish to push forward on your own, you are currently not visible.
Patrick rothfuss: Right, yeah.
Matt: Okay. Kima is going to follow along with Grog and Trinket. Allura feels the lack of magical force on this side, is going to follow up behind you guys as well.
Travis: I'm over there. (all laugh)
Matt: Even with her hood up, she gives you a glance like--
Travis: Stay behind me.
Matt: Well, of course I am, that's part of the reason.
Marisha: Magic Grog, the Magic Mike sequel.
Matt: Scanlan?
Sam: I'll inch up a little, still hiding behind those outcroppings there, and then I'm going to call out the dog.
Laura: Ooh, nice! Pike's going to walk to the middle, where she's in between the two parties.
Taliesin: Ooh, that's really clever.
Sam: I'm going to summon the dog. I just say, "Good doggy!" Right? And I throw the figurine.
Liam: (posh voice) Hello. (all laugh)
Laura: Like Reginald or something? What was his name?
Sam: I forget-- we never figured out his name. We know it, or something. You said-- it was very cryptic.
Marisha: I did write it down at one point in time, but I'm not going to look for it right now.
Matt: The dog hops out. I'll use this badger for the time being.
Sam: You put a badger down?
Matt: I couldn't find an actual dog figure.
Marisha: The badger? That's even better!
Liam: I've got a mastiff. I'll donate it.
Matt: It still works fine!
Sam: Badger doesn't give a shit.
Laura: And then Pike wants to walk in between the two parties, so hiding behind that wall outcropping.
Matt: Okay. All right. At this point, the air itself is still very still, and the closer you get to this as you approach, the smell of decay is as overwhelming as it was in the chasm that you crossed before. Raishan continues to speak and says, "You may also come to notice a curiosity about this island that explains a lot of the legends around it. Sadly, the pressures of time left me forgetting until I arrived, which has limited my options. I had only used the glyph once before, years ago, but... it is as it is. So I ask you once again: we made a deal. You rescinded on that deal and punishment was required. You survive only by my grace and your stubborn need to cling to your insignificant lives. Regardless, I have what I sought now, and I offer you this opportunity to leave freely. Decline, and you choose your resting place here, away from your loved ones, to be forgotten and join the undying dregs of a long-passed madman's fancy."
Travis: Somebody do something.
Sam: Maybe we should just leave.
Marisha: Keyleth steps forward again, a little bit more, and says--
Matt: You bump into the shoulders--
Marisha: "Excuse me. Sorry. I just want to, I just, okay." I want to keep walking up to her as much as I can.
Matt: Okay. So you step out of the shadows.
Marisha: Yes.
Patrick rothfuss: Shit, I've got to follow-- if I see her moving-- I can't. I'm not good with that.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: I would also, on the other side, like to advance as far as I can without reaching her eyeline.
Matt: You would be about there. Kima sneaks up behind you, Trinket follows up behind there, and Allura stays just to one side there.
Marisha: While all this is happening, Keyleth is speaking to try and keep her attention. "You know, Raishan, you've taught me a lot about myself, these past few weeks; arguably more than I've learned about myself my entire years of living."
Matt: "Good. I'm glad I could enlighten and inspire in these final moments."
Marisha: Inspiration's a word I guess you could use. I would say more of a cautionary tale. In an odd way, I hope I never become you. All those years of long life That some many call a blessing. I'm sure there are many lonely moments, and I hope, in my darkest of times, I don't turn to rage and anger and selfish actions the way you did.
Matt: "You know nothing about me, child. Nothing."
Marisha: That may be true.
Matt: She turns around for the first time to meet your eyes, and you can see the gleam of bright, sickly yellow and dark, deep emerald green for pupils as she turns with a slight smile just curling across her porcelain skin.
Marisha: I see I have your attention after all.
Matt: "You've had my attention since you entered this place. You aren't the subtlest of adventurers."
Marisha: No. We... I mean, we know. (all laugh)
Taliesin: That's what I was waiting for. Thank you.
Marisha: Touche.
Matt: "So what is it? You've come here to speak on your enlightenment and die? Or do we wish to maintain the agreement we had, go our own separate ways--"
Sam: I'm going to really quickly whisper to the dog, "Do you see anything that we don't?"
Matt: The dog looks around. "No."
Sam: Good doggy.
Marisha: You're correct. We reneged on our deal, just as you did on your end. There was a mutual distrust. We knew that from the beginning.
Matt: "That makes us even, then, does it not?"
Marisha: It does. But, in terms of negotiation, you presented your deal, so we will now present ours.
Laura: I'm backing up, but I'm drawing an arrow and just notching it and waiting to see if she does anything to Keyleth.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: My want for revenge against you, while still strong and very palpable, I now understand was ultimately selfish only in the sense that everyone else in Tal'Dorei should share in the revelry of bringing you to justice. I am not the only one-- we are not the only ones-- who have felt the ramifications of your destructive actions. And as much as I would like to make do on my promise that I told you weeks ago, and end your life right now, I desperately want the rest of Tal'Dorei to feel that satisfaction as well. So. You surrender now, you come with us under means of temporary control, we take you back to Emon-- maybe the Fire Ashari; we'll work that out, we're going to take you and you face trial amongst the Tal'Dorei Council, the people of the Ashari, and on behalf of the rest of the citizens of Exandria. If you choose to not take this offer, then I guess we will see whose final resting place it will be in this cave.
Matt: The book that she currently had in her hands closes in her grasp as her eyes don't flicker or shift or blink from your connection. She looks to you with her chin raised a bit.
Marisha: I mirror her. Puff up a little bit.
Matt: You act as though the laws of the anthill affect the foot that crushes it. You speak words of importance, but I've seen laws and people come and go, change, die, turn to dust and rise again. People kill neighbor. Families die from the inside and out. You see, I'm diseased, but look upon you. You insignificant creatures. You do more to your own people than I've done in an entire lifetime.
Marisha: That might be true, but at least that is the fate of our own consequences and our own doing, not some outwardly force forcing their repercussions on us. And you should know, Raishan, I've stepped on plenty of anthills in my day. Those that don't die revolt. And guess what? There are some pretty nasty stings from some ants out there.
Laura: They'll leave a welt. You'll itch for days.
Marisha: The strength of a colony is stronger than the individual of one great diseased foot.
Matt: "You are truly not intending to leave me be, are you?"
Marisha: Nope.
Matt: "Well, that is such an unfortunate disposition on your part. Interestingly enough--" And she thumbs a couple of pages in the next book, closes it, and throws it to the side. "My needs do happen to call for a handful of powerful magic-users. And there are proper tools within these caverns to keep you in line. So we shall call your foolishness kismet."
Marisha: I guess we can say the same for yours. I guess it's a matter of who wins, now.
Matt: Very well.
Marisha: I'm giving you one last shot.
Laura: I Hunter's Mark her. At 2nd level, because that's what I have.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Same.
Matt: What do you do?
Liam: Hunter's Mark.
Marisha: Surrender, and if you choose not to, at least we can go forward in our consciences and know that we gave you a choice.
Matt: So as you guys are casting the spell and she's saying this, Raishan responds with, "I shall relish closing the final chapter on your brief, pitiful tales, and beginning a fresh, new chapter of my own." As you guys both mark, the spell has no effect, takes no root in the space. You maintain concentration, but nothing was marked. There is nothing there, physical.
Taliesin: The dog, in theory, sees invisible things, by the way.
Sam: It's not invisible. She's not there.
Marisha: Is she a hologram? Is she an illusion?
Travis: What are we doing?
Matt: What are you doing? Aside from rolling initiative, which I think probably would be a good thing to do right now. So let's go ahead and roll initiative now.
Marisha: Wait. That's the dead body of Thordak, right?
Matt: Correct.
Marisha: She's not possessing Thordak, is she? She's speaking through him--
Liam: No, the paladin checked for undead.
Laura: I sensed three dragons.
Marisha: Oh, undead, that's right.
Patrick rothfuss: I would've probably sensed, unless there's some sort of masking going on here.
Laura: Which she's good at.
Matt: (laughs)
Laura: Oh man, I don't like hearing that.
Marisha: Lucky green, lucky green, come on!
Taliesin: (laughs) I'm sorry.
Marisha: Ah, if it wasn't so ironic...
Laura: That's a bad Taliesin laugh.
Taliesin: (singing) It's like rain...
Taliesin: (singing) On your wedding day!
Marisha: (singing) On your wedding day!
Travis: Please do not sing that song.
Taliesin: We'll be doomed to die if we sing that song any further.
Matt: So. Folks. Initiative tracking going down now. We have 25 to 20.
Liam: 25.
Laura: 24.
Taliesin: 22.
Sam: 21.
Patrick rothfuss: Jeez!
Marisha: Thank god you guys are alive. Thank fuck.
Matt: 25, 24?
Sam: 21.
Matt: 21.
Taliesin: 22.
Matt: 22. All right. 20 to 15?
Travis: 16.
Patrick rothfuss: Did you roll for Pike?
Laura: Yeah, I did, I rolled for Pike. She got eight, Pike got eight.
Matt: Pike got eight. Keyleth, what did you get?
Marisha: Four!
Matt: Kerrek?
Patrick rothfuss: You don't add proficiency bonus. It's only a dex bonus, right?
Matt: Just dex bonus, correct.
Patrick rothfuss: Then 11.
Matt: Okay. So we have...
Taliesin: You don't add proficiency bonus?
Patrick rothfuss: That's what I was asking about for dex. For initiative, rather.
Marisha: I think that's you, because you're a fancy fighter.
Taliesin: I'm weird, okay. That's a weird thing.
Travis: So Keyleth got the lowest? You got the lowest one?
Marisha: Yeah.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Marisha: I was talking. I was giving a very compelling speech.
Travis: Yeah, I was writing it down. With my inability to write.
Matt: All righty. So. Top of the round, currently. Vax, what are you doing?
Liam: And we see nothing.
Matt: You see nothing now. You just see the apparently not-physically-there humanoid form of Raishan, still standing on the opposite side.
Liam: And two eggs.
Matt: Two eggs here, and the corpse.
Liam: All right, I'm going to cross back across, north, to the-- I mean, I click on the Boots of Haste. I'm going to move straight towards you, Matt, across the hall so I'm by the corner there.
Matt: Over here?
Liam: No, not that far. No, closer to me. Right there. And I'm going to throw at the eggs.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: And it's... I'm going first, so with Assassinate, I get advantage on all these because I'm the first to go in combat? Yes? Yep.
Matt: Sure.
Liam: Starting at third level, you are deadly, so you get the drop on your enemies. You have advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn in the combat yet.
Matt: Okay. Sure. The eggs have not taken a turn in the combat yet.
Liam: That's great. And I'm going to use sharpshooter, so I get a negative five on these.
Travis: The eggs have't taken a turn yet.
Matt: Vax'ildan, the Egg Assassin.
Liam: Yeah! 21 for the first.
Matt: That hits.
Liam: Okay.
Travis: (trailer voice) This Easter, the eggs have not taken a turn.
Matt: (trailer voice) Prepare to be scrambled.
Liam: (laughing) The second one is 18.
Matt: 18 hits.
Liam: Okay. And that is-- oh, that's not that good. Is 14.
Matt: 14? Okay.
Liam: Do they all three hit, or just the first two?
Matt: First two.
Liam: First two. Okay. So the first one gets sneak attack damage.
Laura: Those eggs don't even know you're coming.
Liam: That's right. What, you want them to take less damage?
Laura: Oh no.
Liam: Yeah yeah. Yeah yeah yeah.
Matt: These eggs are caught unaware.
Taliesin: This'll be over easy.
Travis: Taliesin.
Taliesin: I'm so proud. So proud. (all laugh)
Liam: 32 for that one.
Patrick rothfuss: Eggcellent. (all groan)
Patrick rothfuss: I didn't start this, but I will finish it.
Liam: And what the heck, I'm going to poison that egg, so that is (laughing) Seven. That egg has to make a DC 15 success against poison. (all laugh)
Matt: Succeeds with a natural 17.
Liam: So, does it get half? Or... half, right? Or none? I don't know. I've never killed an egg before.
Matt: I mean, it still takes the full sneak attack damage, and it is not poisoned.
Liam: Not poisoned. So give it another seven hit points of damage from the dagger itself.
Matt: A total of...?
Liam: Seven for that second attack. The earlier one was 32. Isn't Dungeons and Dragons fun?
Laura: Eggs, you guys. Eggs.
Matt: So as you rush past, and careening around the corner, throwing these three daggers out to the side, the first one just smacks into the side, and the egg, which had already been previously damaged structure-wise by a somewhat resistant but still impactful burst of druidic magic energy in the previous conflict, the first dagger cuts through like a hot knife through butter, out the side of the egg. You watch as the shell on the other side just scatters, causing this splatter of some sort of thick liquid against the wall. The other two daggers, one just careens off to the side, the second one that does impact continues and causes the egg to actually crack and fold in on itself, causing it to leak out the side of the shell as it collapses in on itself somewhat.
Sam: That's one egg down?
Matt: So that egg there I will mark as currently--
Laura: Scrambled.
Marisha: Sunny side up.
Matt: Destroyed.
Taliesin: Florentine.
Travis: Benedict.
Laura: Poached.
Matt: There you go. That one is destroyed.
Taliesin: Poached.
Matt: All right. Does that end your turn?
Liam: Yeah, I'll stick with it.
Matt: Okay. Next up is Vex.
Laura: That's me. I'm going to immediately say over the earring, "I don't think she's really there," and then try to look and see anything, any sign of her that I can spot. Can I see anything?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Laura: 30.
Matt: 30. Glancing around you in the current space, that is definitively an illusion, and in fact the way it shimmers-- and you look at the books that it was using and messing with. While you were keeping more of an eye on the area, you notice now that the books that she dropped just vanished.
Laura: Oh.
Matt: It was all part of the illusion. Definitely not there, but you don't see anything around you that resembles a hidden or stealthed dragon-sized creature.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: What else would you like to do with your turn?
Laura: Fuck. I think I'm going to save-- I'm going to back up against the wall, just straight back.
Matt: Right here?
Laura: Yeah. Because I feel very uncomfortable with the situation and I'm going to save my attack for if Thordak moves, if anything moves at all, I'm going to wait to attack it.
Matt: Attack it? So you're holding your attack action in case something moves.
Laura: Yeah. In case Thordak moves or I see Raishan or something.
Matt: Okay, cool. Percival. Still on this back wall here.
Taliesin: Okay. First things first. I'm going to take a shot with Bad News at the remaining egg.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: So let's just do that. Why are you doing that? Okay, good. That's a 22 to hit?
Matt: That hits.
Taliesin: So that's... ooh, that's nice. 25 points of damage.
Matt: All righty. The first shot hits. You see the front of the egg spider-crack inward, like how you shot in the Thordak battle, but the egg still holds firm. As you begin loading for your next shot, you watch as part of the egg begins to crack outward, like something's pushing out from the inside of the egg.
Taliesin: Okay, never mind. Then I'm going to take another-- okay, I'm going to take another Sharpshooter shot at it. I'm going to try to hit it and kill it dead. Yeah, I'm having a weird premonition that's making me really uncomfortable. 16?
Matt: 16 to hit?
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: With its armor, that probably won't hit, unfortunately. The bullet ricochets off the outside of the hardened eggshell and just (ricochet sound).
Liam: I don't know if it makes a difference, I called Sharpshooter on my shots before but forgot to add the additional ten per attack.
Matt: You destroyed the egg. You threw them all simultaneously at a single egg.
Liam: Okay.
Marisha: Did you add ten to yours just now?
Taliesin: No, sharpshooter I lose five to hit, which is why I didn't hit it, but I get ten extra points of damage. I'm feeling like now is the time to take this out of play, so I'm going to burn an... Action Surge right now. I'm going to burn an Action Surge.
Matt: Sure, buddy.
Taliesin: And I'm going to take another shot with Bad News. (nerdy voice) Action Surge.
Matt: Go for it.
Taliesin: Same thing, sharpshooter shot.
Matt: Do it.
Travis: (nerdy voice) It's time for an Action Surge.
Liam: (nerdy voice) Raishan! (all laugh)
Taliesin: That misses.
Matt: Ricochets off again.
Taliesin: Oh man, regular shot, because fuck it.
Marisha: That's better!
Taliesin: That hits. That's 32 to hit. I should've just taken it. But that's okay, we'll see what we do damage-wise. That's not bad. 22 points of damage.
Matt: With the second shot, you tear the top half of the egg off. As it goes splattering to the side of it, you can watch as what looks to be some sort of a very, very young primordial dragon like the ones that you had yanked out of the eggs before that was trying to pull its way out of the egg, slumps lifelessly over the side of the egg you destroyed.
Sam: Aw. You're terrible, Taliesin. You're so hard-boiled.
Matt: That's awful.
Taliesin: I don't suppose I have time to run a weird perception check, do I? Really quickly? Do I have a moment for a perception check?
Matt: You've used all your action and your bonus action...
Taliesin: I haven't burned any movement, though.
Matt: What are you looking for?
Taliesin: Is that center wall real?
Matt: This center wall here? This would be an investigation check.
Taliesin: Yeah, I'm calling that. 23?
Matt: 23. Glancing over across the way, best you can tell, the wall appears to be solid and is an actual, natural barrier in the cavern.
Taliesin: Okay, just wanted to have my moment.
Laura: Oh my god, that would've been so smart, though.
Taliesin: I had a moment of horror like, oh god, that's dragon-sized. Okay, cool.
Marisha: Yeah, that's her. It could still be her.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Marisha: He could've just not rolled high enough.
Matt: So that ends your turn. At the end of Percy's turn, the human figure across the way with the dark green hair gives a deep bow.
Laura: Oh no.
Matt: And then vanishes from the field.
Laura: No.
Travis: That wasn't so bad.
Sam: We won!
Laura: Good job, guys.
Marisha: We just made her leave.
Matt: The dog turns around and faces this direction and starts barking.
Sam: Yes. Yes!
Taliesin: Good boy.
Matt: You just hear (heavy footsteps) and then suddenly (flapping wings), there's suddenly a torrent of wind blowing within the area as something is disturbing the air quite heavily. So that's that.
Laura: I am holding my action until Raishan does anything. I hope she attacks-- well no, I hope we get to attack her soon.
Matt: That's going to be the end of Raishan's turn.
Travis: Really? Just the sound?
Matt: Yeah. You all of a sudden hear the mastiff barking over and over again in this direction.
Laura: Do I see, did I-- oh god, I can't, it's not my turn.
Matt: But you don't see anything.
Laura: No. Did my hair go whoosh?
Matt: A little bit.
Laura: Okay.
Liam: It's kind of always doing that a little bit, though.
Laura: I mean, a little bit.
Matt: Scanlan, it's your turn.
Sam: I turn to face in the direction that my dog is looking. And... shitballs. Who's that near me back there?
Matt: This is Vex. That's Pike.
Sam: Okay. Vex I will inspire with a quick limerick.
Laura: Oh?
Sam: Gern Blanston wept and wept-o, his wonderful broom had been swept-o, first our Vex spied it, then she Shanghai'd it, because it turns out she's a total klepto. (all laugh)
Matt: You can take your d12 inspiration.
Laura: Bringing it back.
Sam: And then I will-- balls. I want to hold my thing to-- but I'm not going to. I'm going to hope this works and the dragon's coming at us. Maybe. I'm going to step forward as much as I can towards the sound I heard and blow my horn of fog just everywhere.
Liam: Can't you put that drug pipe down for like five seconds?
Sam: Don't take it away from me, man!
Travis: Blow one note.
Sam: It's for tobacco, okay? (all laugh)
Matt: All righty.
Patrick rothfuss: This is going to settle a lot of bets on who vapes.
Matt: All right, so yeah, 20-foot radius... so you create this area here, and obscures it. So currently, this whole tunnel is just filled with fog. You have no vision beyond the outside of it, right where you are.
Sam: All right. Good. But if something comes through, it will disturb the fog, correct?
Matt: It may.
Sam: Oh, shit. (all laugh)
Taliesin: Congratulations, we can play Laser Tag now.
Matt: All right. That ends your turn, Scanlan?
Sam: Yeah, I'll just say, "I think she's over here, guys!" And that's it.
Matt: All right, Grog, your turn.
Travis: I rage and-- I would like to rage.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: With my 50 feet of speed, can I try to make it to Thordak's corpse? See how far I get?
Marisha: Yes, yes, get it. Get it!
Matt: You get right up to it, yeah.
Travis: Okay, cool. Can I take-- I found out that the hammer, the dwarven thrower, is a versatile weapon.
Matt: Yeah, you can hold it with two hands if you'd like.
Travis: With two hands, can I take a shot at his big stupid cranium?
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: Okay. I want to squash the watermelon.
Matt: All right, roll for it.
Travis: Oh, reckless.
Matt: Sure. You didn't need it, but go for it.
Travis: Oh. Okay. Come on, crit on the dead skull-- natural 20!
Matt: Natural 20. (all laugh)
Travis: It's like a beached whale.
Matt: How do you want to do this, Grog?
Travis: I talk to the new dwarven thrower-hammer. "This is the beginning of a beautiful relationship!"
Matt: As you leap in the air, using the momentum of your leap, you smash the dwarven thrower down onto the already partially-destroyed skull of Thordak's corpse, the skull immediately caving inward with the force of the blow. As it hits and curves inward, it releases this sudden burst of heavy ash into your face that fills your lungs and burns your eyes, and you cough. As you pull back, you try and wedge the hammer out, and as you do, you can see there is actual molten rock still dripping off the outside of the hammer. Any sort of general normal unenchanted metal would probably be slightly bowing or melting in the presence of such heat. It looks like even in its dead state after a day of rest, Thordak's corpse still maintained some sort of internal volcanic life as it slowly subsided, but the skull is destroyed. You see bits of the upper palate just scattered like bone chunks across the stonework of the floor, stopping at the outside of one of the cages. Thordak's head is thoroughly destroyed.
Liam: J-E-L-L-O.
Travis: Well played. I have another hit, but I want to get close enough for it. With my bonus action, can I use the Boots of Feral Leaping to make a horizontal leap 20 feet towards the remaining egg?
Patrick rothfuss: Oh, the second egg did get destroyed.
Travis: Oh, they're all toast.
Matt: But you're welcome to, if you'd like.
Travis: I want to leap.
Laura: There's potentially corpses in those cages that could be something.
Travis: I'm focused on the egg, all right?
Laura: All right, sorry.
Travis: I leap toward the eggs.
Matt: Okay, how far can you leap?
Travis: 20 feet.
Matt: All right.
Travis: And I have to make a DC 16 athletics check.
Matt: Go for it.
Travis: 18.
Matt: All right. So you (leaping sound). Not as far as you'd like, but that egg is staring you down. There is an unmoving baby dragon corpse that is-- you've got a date with your hammer.
Travis: If I touch down, may I throw the dwarven hammer at baby egg corpse?
Matt: Go for it. (all laugh)
Travis: Reckless.
Matt: Yeah, advantage. All your attacks are reckless, man.
Travis: Yes! Do it again! No, not quite.
Laura: That's okay, it's dead. It probably hits.
Travis: 24. (all laugh)
Matt: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
Travis: But this is just a d8 because it's one-handed, right?
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: 21--
Matt: Plus an additional d8 because you threw it.
Liam: I don't know if we're going to kill Raishan, but we smoked those eggs.
Matt: It's part of the enchantment of the hammer.
Travis: I think it's just if it's a giant it's a 2d8. Yeah, you're right. Ranged attack. So that's 26 total.
Matt: 26 total. The currently-lifeless limp corpse of this nearly-hatched primordial dragon-- whatever this new entity was through the merger of the power of the soul anchor in the fire elemental plane and Thordak, the ancient red dragon, this remaining dragonkin-- is turned into red oatmeal against the table and the stone wall behind it.
Travis: Yeah! Start the morning right. Come back from that, bitches!
Matt: Well done, Grog.
Travis: No? We're not worried about that?
Taliesin: No, you're good.
Laura: Trinket's fighting every urge to go lick up the egg. (all laugh)
Taliesin: Oh, don't eat that. Don't eat that. No.
Laura: Come on, he's a bear.
Travis: I'm good.
Matt: You're good, all right. At the end of your turn--
Liam: That hall looks dangerous right where he is.
Matt: Let's see here.
Liam: There's two magical columns right there.
Travis: Those aren't even there at all.
Matt: Scanlan, you feel a strange, warm sensation in your chest--
Laura: Oh, you've been dispelled.
Marisha: Bitch.
Matt: Also at the end of your turn, Grog, or as soon as your turn ends, you hear this (undead inhale) strange sucking breath-like sound.
Travis: Don't do it. Listen, I like you the way you are. Don't--
Matt: (laughing) Make a perception check.
Travis: Oh yeah, that's a fucking five.
Matt: Five. You are talking fervently at your hammer. "Please--"
Travis: Please don't. Look, come on. In my previous relationship, I've been burned before. Okay? I want to start fresh.
Sam: Then I also lose my--
Taliesin: No, that's only-- well, that may be something else. That's Beacon of Hope. That's a different thing.
Matt: That'll do it.
Marisha: But is it still dispelled?
Taliesin: It depends on what she dispelled.
Matt: The time you're focusing on the hammer, you aren't paying attention to your surroundings until you just see the shadows coalescing closer to you than you expect, and by the time you look up, you watch as two black smoked, wraith-like entities that had slowly pulled themselves out of the two cages on the sides have shifted beside and lashed out at you.
Travis: (shrieks) I scream like I'm in a haunted house. (all laugh)
Sam: You are in a haunted house.
Marisha: Yeah, I was just going to say, I've seen that. That's legit.
Travis: I jump like a bitch. The Boots of Feral Leaping are nothing, y'all.
Marisha: Halloween Horror Nights is only fun when watching him.
Matt: 19 to hit.
Travis: Oh, that hits.
Matt: They have advantage against you. I forgot. So 19 and the other hit is two and a 22.
Travis: Both hit.
Matt: So both hit you. All righty. You suffer 21 points of necrotic damage from the first hit.
Travis: Necrotic, huh?
Sam: You don't have anything against that.
Travis: I'm going to Forrest Gump up this bitch. Real quick.
Matt: And 20 points of necrotic damage, so a total of?
Travis: 42.
Matt: 41 points of necrotic damage.
Travis: 41, 21 and 20.
Matt: I need you to make two constitution saving throws.
Patrick rothfuss: Which I think we have advantage on right now.
Travis: Is this a saving throw or just a constitution--
Laura: Oh yeah. Well, wisdom.
Matt: You have advantage on wisdom. This is a constitution save.
Patrick rothfuss: It was from the Hero's Feast.
Matt: Hero's Feast isn't constitution, it's wisdom.
Patrick rothfuss: Okay, sorry.
Travis: Minus two to everything, right?
Matt: You're at minus two to everything.
Travis: That is a three minus two equals one.
Liam: It's not a natural one, though.
Matt: And the second hit?
Travis: Is an 11.
Matt: All right. So your maximum hit points are also reduced by 41 as both of the wraiths drain the life force out of you, their claws rake through your body like it's nothing, and as they pull back, you feel the breath sucked from your lungs, and you instinctually cough for a second, almost stumbling to one knee, as both the wraiths chuckle at the side of your face.
Laura: I feel like we aren't taking this seriously enough, you guys. 'Cause I feel like this could be really bad, right now.
Sam: No, no, we made some good omelets.
Laura: Oh my god.
Matt: All righty. Kerr.
Sam: This is important work.
Liam: The room was empty.
Matt: You watched this happen.
Patrick rothfuss: Oh yeah, oh yeah.
Matt: Over here, as well as seeing the fog cloud suddenly fill the opposite side of the cavern, and for a brief moment, you're-- you feel like you're a little bit out of your element, but you click in and your combat sense kicks in. What do you want to do?
Patrick rothfuss: This is my game, right there. Horrible things from beyond the grave. Plus--
Marisha: What up, paladin!
Patrick rothfuss: -- my new boyfriend is in a bad way, so.
Travis: That's me. This guy.
Sam: I missed one episode.
Travis: Total Kerr-bear.
Patrick rothfuss: I've got movement of 30, that'll get me up there?
Liam: Play-date!
Matt: Yeah. You have five, ten, 15, 20, 25, you can get right-- you can go 30 and get right next to both of them, if you'd like.
Patrick rothfuss: There's probably advantages to that.
Matt: Up to you. Doesn't matter.
Taliesin: There's advantages to both.
Taliesin: There's advantages to both. (all laugh)
Marisha: There's advantages to both. (all laugh)
Patrick rothfuss: I will make one attack, the one closer to me for lack of a better choice.
Matt: Go for it.
Patrick rothfuss: 25.
Matt: 25 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
Patrick rothfuss: Okay, now, I'm not going out on a limb here thinking that this is an undead creature?
Matt: This-- in your time, and you've come across quite a few undead creatures, based on what you've walked through in this endeavor? You-- while he did not see it, you watched these things rise out of the pile of corpses that are jammed at the bottom of each of these small cages. You have a pretty good sense that these are undead.
Patrick rothfuss: I misjudged the scale before, I thought my Divine Sense was big enough to cover this whole area.
Matt: Right.
Patrick rothfuss: So I am going to use my paladin ability, and I'm going to burn a first-level spell slot for my special paladin ability.
Matt: Divine Smite?
Patrick rothfuss: Yes, Divine Smite.
Matt: All righty. So that is 2d8--
Patrick rothfuss: Plus a d8 because they're undead.
Matt: Undead, so plus 3d8 to your attack damage.
Marisha: Oh, hell yeah.
Patrick rothfuss: Yeah, so.
Travis: Dammit.
Patrick rothfuss: Four, and then another 11 is 15 plus one more is... 31 radiant damage.
Marisha: Fuck yeah.
Matt: Ooh. So as you rush in--
Liam: But he's only seventh-level!
Matt: From your perspective, Keyleth, you watch as this flash of light, and from thin air you watch armored Kerrek just streak down with his glowing-headed warhammer, and slamming the side of this wraith-like entity. As it hits, you watch as the creature turns, the radiant energy just consuming part of its torso in the blast, and it shrieks out in pain as the radiant energy tends to burn the side of its undead form with a secondary flash as the divine energy bursts outward. That-- you watched the wraith go from eager and smooth to looking like it's shimmering in place and its form is starting to shake and hold itself present.
Marisha: Keyleth just says, "I've never seen a gardener do that." (all laugh)
Taliesin: Landscaper.
Marisha: (laughs) Landscaper.
Patrick rothfuss: And I will take my second attack.
Matt: Same one?
Patrick rothfuss: Yeah.
Matt: All right, go for it.
Taliesin: Jesus.
Patrick rothfuss: That is not as good. Now, if I'm coming in invisible, do I get advantage due to surprise?
Matt: On the first strike you would've, yes.
Patrick rothfuss: Only the first, okay. So this is a 17.
Matt: 17 still hits.
Patrick rothfuss: Yay. And I will burn another spell slot.
Matt: Go for it.
Patrick rothfuss: I don't want these hanging around.
Matt: So weapon damage plus 3d8.
Liam: Divern Smert!
Patrick rothfuss: Eight... 16-- oh! um. 16 plus 13, somebody help out the English major.
Matt: 29.
Liam: Oh, good roll.
Patrick rothfuss: And 35. And, just to let you know, the Dusk Hammer also gives me plus 1d8 against undead. So I'm taking that extra one too. So those of you at home see I'm not fucking around.
Matt: Yeah, it's actually the ability of the weapon. Okay, so.
Patrick rothfuss: 35 radiant.
Sam: Rothfuss.
Matt: Nice.
Sam: OP.
Patrick rothfuss: That's how we do at level seven, folks. (all laugh)
Matt: As the second strike, using the momentum of the first swing, you pull back and backhand it right in the face. As it cuts clean through with no resistance, the wraith seems to scatter, and the shadow reforms in the space it was, but barely. It's like--
Patrick rothfuss: Oh, you're kidding me.
Matt: You're watching as part of it is flickering and bits of shadow are dripping and disappearing into the stonework behind, and its original kind of chuckling evil hungry visage is now this fearful "oh shit" look on its spectral, skeletal face.
Travis: (singing) My boyfriend's back and you're going to be in trouble.
All: (singing with terrible harmonizing) Hey-na hey-na my boyfriend's back. (all laugh)
Matt: That got weird.
Laura: That was like the Addams Family version of 'My Boyfriend's Back'.
Taliesin: I am so pleased that got so awful.
Matt: Really terrible.
Travis: Somebody's cat at home just died. That was awful.
Marisha: Just exploded.
Taliesin: I might get my socks back, I'm very excited.
Matt: That ends Kerrek's turn--
Marisha: They have only five hit points. We know this. Kitten damage.
Patrick rothfuss: When Invisibility goes off, is my displacer cloak still in effect? Do those things layer or--
Matt: Yeah, they're still in effect.
Patrick rothfuss: Okay.
Matt: You have three things you could attune to, and so--
Patrick rothfuss: Right.
Matt: While the ring is no longer invisible and--
Patrick rothfuss: I know that'll be out for a while.
Matt: That's out for a while, but the cloak is still in effect, and your hammer is still in effect.
Patrick rothfuss: Okay.
Liam: The way that cloak goes is they're at disadvantage if they hit you once, then it goes away until the start of your next round.
Patrick rothfuss: Next turn.
Liam: It keeps resetting.
Patrick rothfuss: I was mostly wondering, if I was invisible and displaced, if they can detect invisible do they see me displaced? But let's not worry about that until it becomes an issue.
Matt: Yeah, yeah. Well, in this circumstance, since you're no longer, since you are visible for the foreseeable future, it won't make any difference.
Patrick rothfuss: Okay.
Matt: But if you were invisible, the invisibility would take over, they'd have disadvantage against attacking you anyway, but they'd have to know where you were to even try and make an attack, is how it would work.
Patrick rothfuss: Okay.
Taliesin: Just somebody somewhere is dropping the bass.
Matt: Okay. So ending Kerr's turn... Pike feels--
Sam: Oh shit.
Matt: A warm sensation within her chest, a familiar one.
Sam: Oh boy.
Matt: Let's see here.
Sam: What just got dispelled?
Laura: Probably the feast.
Liam: Maybe.
Laura: That's what happened before.
Matt: So that's Kima's turn.
Laura: And the Beacon of Hope.
Matt: Kima's currently seeing these wraith- like entities start rushing into the room. One two three four five...
Travis: Oh yeah, this is her wheelhouse.
Matt: She--
Laura: Oh yeah, good thing we brought Kima.
Matt: -- movement-wise can't quite get all the way up to where they are now, but she gets her hammer at the ready, and Kima's going to go ahead and... let's see.
Liam: Oh, we got three paladins.
Matt: She's going to go ahead and cast Crusader's Mantle on herself.
Travis: What was it? Crusader's Mantle?
Matt: Crusader's Mantle is the ability. While she maintains concentration on it-- actually, you know what? No, I take that back. She's going to cast Aura of Vitality, which means she can use her bonus action to heal an ally within 30 feet for 2d6 damage.
Laura: Nice.
Matt: Um, so she casts that on herself. She's going to-- seeing you damaged, Grog--
Travis: Yeah!
Matt: -- she's going to use her bonus action to attempt to heal you 2d6, however, your maximum hit points have been lowered, so it has no effect on you, and she realizes this as she reaches out and, "Grog!" This bit of divine energy streaks from her hand, hits you, and seems to just peter out on impact. "Shit." And she steels herself with her weapon, getting ready for the next round of onslaught. Finishing Kima's turn, it is now Allura's turn.
Patrick rothfuss: Luckily, though, because of Pike's spell, the damage you didn't heal was maximum.
Travis: Oh, that's good.
Liam: (laughs)
Laura: Yeah.
Sam: Well that's just math.
Laura: I didn't follow any of that.
Liam: Silver lining, silver lining.
Travis: I replied in a positive way because I didn't know any better.
Laura: (laughs)
Taliesin: We're probably going to want to destroy those cages, by the way.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Destroy them?
Taliesin: I think that we're going to get more wraiths.
Marisha: Just coming out--
Liam: Did they come out of the cages?
Patrick rothfuss: They came out of the corpses in the-- I think there's only one corpse in each cage.
Liam: I think they're like gauntlet generators and they're just like--
Taliesin: Quick point of order--
Matt: Yes?
Marisha: Spawners.
Taliesin: Is there like corpse soup in those cages, or is it one corpse per cage?
Matt: You can't really see from your perspective this far away.
Taliesin: Well, fair.
Patrick rothfuss: I wondered that same thing. (all laugh)
Matt: For the sake of paying attention, go ahead and make a perception check.
Patrick rothfuss: Okay.
Taliesin: I'm heading that way anyway, so.
Patrick rothfuss: 11-ish.
Matt: 11. It's hard to tell in the low light from the candelabra. It does look like, from the view here, there's at least two corpses in one of the cages. Like a pile. There's one that's slumped forward, but you can see more than two legs.
Marisha: Total spawn location.
Matt: All right, so for Allura's turn she is going to--
Patrick rothfuss: My god, was that the Gauntlet?
Matt: --walk away from this area, Kima's got this, she steps over to this side, knowing that with the dog barking off to the side, that's definitely a sign that the dragon's coming from this direction. She pulls her hood back and she will cast-- she's actually going to hold her action. She's going to begin casting-- what would be a good one for this one? She's going to begin casting Disintegrate once something attempts to move by.
Liam: Savage.
Travis: Page out of Gilmore's book.
Matt: She's going to hold that as an action. All right, that brings us to Pike's turn.
Laura: (Pike voice) Yeah! Pike is going to cast--
Travis: (Pike voice) Yeah!
Laura: (Pike voice) Yeah!
Liam: (Pike voice) I'm going to--
Laura: (Pike voice) I'm going to-- Pike's going to cast Spiritual Weapon at level four.
Marisha: She would totally do that.
Laura: Right?
Taliesin: Yeah.
Liam: (Pike voice) In the shape of a--
Matt: She's putting it where?
Laura: She's putting it right in the middle of the hallway.
Matt: There?
Laura: (Pike voice) Yeah.
Matt: All righty. Radiant sword appears in the center of the air.
Sam: Right behind me.
Matt: Right behind you, yeah.
Sam: That's disconcerting.
Laura: And then-- oh no, it's protection, Scanlan.
Sam: Ah, okay.
Laura: And then she's going to use-- I guess that's only within ten feet.
Liam: Can she move?
Laura: She's going to cast Light. Just to create a little bit of better vision. On that pile of rocks in the middle of that.
Matt: Here?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Okay. So it's now a very bright--
Laura: Very bright!
Matt: -- area here now in the center of the hallway. All righty.
Laura: I'm thinking maybe that'll help spot Raishan or something.
Sam: Sure, yeah, yeah, great--
Matt: That ends Pike's turn.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: Okey-dokey. Whatcha doing?
Taliesin: I was just trying to see if I could actually get, it was giving me a problem.
Marisha: To get it to work? Is that like a stalactite?
Patrick rothfuss: Yeah.
Marisha: Interesting. Okay. Keyleth is going to move a couple closer to the wall, that's she's close--
Matt: This wall here?
Marisha: Yes. Two. Forward a little bit, going towards this tunnel. Other way, other way.
Matt: Other way.
Travis: Taliesin literally has the laser pointer.
Marisha: Right there's good, that's good. Thank you. He is literally-- yeah. Can I take my bonus action to do a perception check and see if I can sense any faint movements, fog being moved, pebbles being kicked?
Matt: Go for it.
Laura: Gotta get a natural twenty on that.
Marisha: 21.
Matt: 21, okay. You can see the fog cloud, there is a heavy swirling in the cloud. Looks like the fog, which is stationary because the magical effect of the spell creates it within a vicinity, the fog itself is (whooshing noises). And occasionally you see what looks to be almost a big gust rapidly right at the outskirts of it.
Marisha: I got you, bitch. All right. I want to do right overtop of Scanlan's fog cloud, I want to do Faerie Fire. Glitterbomb.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: Glitterbomb, yeah.
Marisha: Glitterbomb.
Laura: Ugh, so annoying!
Taliesin: Oh god, it's everywhere.
Laura: Jesus, we're never going to get it off!
Marisha: Oh, man. I'm never going to Labyrinth again.
Taliesin: The next three bathtubs, glitter.
Matt: As you step out of the way, coming towards the fog cloud, you focus it and you begin to bring your fingers across to deliver the incantation of Faerie Fire, and you watch a sudden slow blue spark of energy from inside the fog cloud. Just within, so it's like a little firework in a cloud, and when it happens, your spell fizzles at the tip of your fingers.
Marisha: She fucking counterspelled me.
Sam: Or legendaried it away.
Marisha: Or legendaried it away. She's in the fucking cloud, you guys.
Sam: Seems like it.
Marisha: She's uploaded herself to the cloud.
Liam: Druid's going country.
Marisha: Look. Never forget your roots.
Travis: Going country!
Taliesin: This is why you never upload anything to the cloud.
Matt: That brings us to the top of the round--
Marisha: Yeah, the cloud could get hacked.
Matt: Vax, you're up.
Marisha: It's a Black Mirror episode all of a sudden.
Liam: Uh... shite. Are there still dead things with Groggy?
Matt: Correct, there are two of them flanking him currently.
Patrick rothfuss: They're full of piss and vinegar.
Liam: I'm going to attack them. I'm going to throw, but I'm going to go one dagger at the one above him.
Matt: This one?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: All right.
Patrick rothfuss: I think the one on this side is the one that's hurt most.
Liam: On this side.
Patrick rothfuss: Yeah.
Liam: Okay.
Patrick rothfuss: Yeah, that's the one that I roughed up real bad.
Liam: They were both roughed up real bad.
Patrick rothfuss: No, I hit one of them twice.
Matt: He attacked one, one is untouched, one is flickering.
Liam: So the one that's fucked up I will attack.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: So I'll throw one at that. That is good. That is a 31.
Matt: 31 hits.
Patrick rothfuss: Jeez.
Travis: Pretty sure.
Liam: Yep. And I'll throw-- yeah, I'll throw another one at that one.
Matt: Same one? The damaged one?
Liam: Yeah.
Travis: Don't you want to see how much damage--
Liam: That is 18. Can I wait and see how much damage I do?
Matt: Yeah, you can roll damage.
Liam: Oh, then yeah, then I'll just attack one at a time, I'll save that roll, though, for the next. So that is two plus eight is ten. Plus...
Laura: Is there anything standing next to it?
Patrick rothfuss: Yeah, a bunch of us.
Liam: Oh, Grog is, so it's flanked!
Laura: So it's Sneak Attack!
Liam: So it's Sneak Attack. Thanks, buddy.
Laura: (whispering) I'm your sister.
Liam: You're also my buddy. 16.
Marisha: You ain't my guy, friend.
Taliesin: You ain't my friend.
Liam: I mean, it's got to be gone.
Laura: Whoa.
Patrick rothfuss: A bajillionty damage.
Matt: Yeah. It screams as its shadowed form is sent to join the rest of the shadows in the room, unmoving, cold, and without life or undeath.
Liam: Okay, then the next two--
Matt: Go for it.
Liam: The first one gets 18.
Matt: 18 hits. Vex, you're up next, by the way.
Liam: And then the second one is a 17.
Matt: Also hits.
Liam: Okay, so there it goes. I'm going to roll this one. That's three plus eight is 11 plus the psychic damage has gone missing--
Marisha: Oh, fuck!
Liam: Where is everything, where's my dice? 18 for the first.
Matt: 18 damage.
Liam: Eight for the second.
Matt: Eight damage?
Travis: Help me!
Matt: Eight damage for the second one, without the attack modifier, right?
Liam: Without the attack?
Matt: So you don't add your dex, you don't add your dex bonus for the offhand attack.
Liam: Oh, sorry, so, well if I rolled a two, okay. So then just two.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: So 18 plus two, 20.
Matt: Okay. So both of the daggers, after destroying the one, slam into it, and the magical effect of them manages to cause the form to shimmer slightly with the impact as the daggers pass through and then vanish on the opposite side of the room, returning to your side. The creature seems to have taken a few hits, but it's still strong and still swirling around Grog as Grog's trying to find a way to get a bead on it so he can smack it with the hammer.
Liam: Okay. And I see that Grog is in pretty good hands with Kerrek, so I'm going to use my movement, which is hasted, to slide around this way and crouch ten feet in front of Keyleth. There.
Patrick rothfuss: I think that's Keyleth you're moving. Oh no, I'm sorry.
Liam: Ahead of Keyleth. Between Raishan and her.
Matt: Right there?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: Cool. All right. Vex, you're up.
Sam: We're just in a nice line.
Laura: Okay, I'm going to-- I saw Keyleth say that she was in fog, so can I come around that corner and see her?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Marisha: Come on, come on, dragon sense and shit.
Liam: Smell that dragon.
Liam: Yeah!
Travis: Yeah!
Laura: 31.
Marisha: Yeah!
Matt: You can see within the fog, as difficult as it is, a winged form swirling in there. So you can make your attacks, it's still at a disadvantage because it's invisible, but you can actually attack her right now, yes.
Laura: Okay, I'm going to attack her, and I'm going to try to do Bramble Shot.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: With the Blazing Bowstring.
Matt: Okay. Before you do that, you still have Hunter's Mark up.
Laura: Oh yeah!
Matt: It's concentration.
Laura: Okay-- Bramble Shot isn't concentration, though. Can I shift it over to her?
Matt: You can, technically, yeah.
Travis: Didn't your Hunter's Mark just disappear because she wasn't there?
Laura: No, no, it was up.
Matt: It's still up. It's concentration, you just have to choose another target, use your bonus action to shift it over.
Marisha: Because the illusion isn't considered a target?
Laura: So once I-- it's like up. So once I knew where she was I could shift it.
Liam: So sorry, since I'm new with Hunter's Mark, later I can take my floating Hunter's Mark and bring it over to Raishan?
Matt: Eventually, once you have a bead on where she is, yes.
Liam: Sweet.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: So now you can take your attack. Go for it.
Laura: Okay.
Marisha: Big money, no whammies, come on.
Liam: That's good.
Laura: Okay, that's good, that's a-- what is that? 30. Or something.
Liam: 32.
Laura: 32.
Matt: Rolling with disadvantage, right?
Laura: That was-- okay, that's--
Liam: That's okay.
Laura: 26?
Matt: 26, uh. 26 hits, yeah.
Laura: Okay. So that's a Bramble Shot.
Travis: Just hits, or hits?
Matt: It hits.
Laura: Bramble Shot with the Blazing Bowstring.
Matt: All right, so go ahead and roll damage. And then let me know what the saving throw is.
Laura: Oh, wait. Let me (Scottish accent) get my d8s out here.
Sam: Wow, good Indian accent.
Laura: Thank you. (all laugh)
Travis: She was at 24 last time.
Laura: 28 plus two lightning damage plus... six for Hunter's Mark.
Travis: 34.
Laura: 34. Plus the blazing bowstring is nine. So 43.
Travis: 43.
Laura: Points of damage.
Matt: All right.
Laura: And then she has to do a strength saving throw of--
Matt: Well, first a concentration check. She succeeds, yeah, okay. And then what's the--
Laura: And then a strength saving throw.
Matt: That is a nine.
Laura: Oh, so she's restrained!
Matt: She is.
Marisha: Shut up! Shut up.
Sam: She's still invisible, though. She's still invisible, we can't see her.
Marisha: You badass!
Laura: But she's restrained in the fog.
Marisha: You badass!
Matt: You hear a (growl and impact). (All yell and cheer.)
Matt: You watch as some of the fog billows out. You can still vaguely make out the form, as she (struggling sounds).
Laura: All right. I'm going to pull out a sleep arrow and do my second attack with a sleep arrow through the Blazing Bowstring.
Matt: Okay, go for it. Invisible gives you disadvantage, but because she is currently restrained, that gives you advantage, so it's just a straight roll.
Laura: Just straight? 26.
Matt: That hits.
Liam: You will be a golden god if this works.
Laura: 14 plus one lightning plus two for sneak attack... so four more. And then, oh, and then a sleep arrow.
Matt: What's the total damage?
Travis: 18.
Matt: 18.
Laura: Thank you.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Thanks, you math genius, you.
Marisha: Do those arrows work like the spell?
Matt: She maintains concentration. So for the purposes of the spell...
Travis: (heavy breathing)
Marisha: I know, I know.
Matt: Roll 5d8.
Laura: 5d8?
Marisha: Oh, I think you have to beat her hit points.
Liam: Higher than her hit points, yeah.
Matt: Yep.
Liam: Well, that's--
Marisha: That's going to be tough.
Liam: Yeah.
Marisha: But she's diseased. And whatnot.
Travis: She got that Hep C, y'all. (all laugh)
Laura: 18?
Matt: 18.
Liam: No way.
Matt: You fire the arrow, but you still hear thrashing about.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: It does not seem to be--
Laura: Well, it was worth a try.
Taliesin: It was valiant.
Matt: All right. That ends--
Laura: Oh, and then I'm going to use the rest of my move to duck around that corner and back up.
Matt: Duck around this corner here?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: That's as far as you can get right there.
Laura: I want to be behind that stalactite or whatever--
Matt: There?
Laura: Yeah. Mite. Stalagmite.
Matt: Yeah, like mite.
Liam: You might what?
Matt: All right, cool.
Laura: I might hide behind that stalagmite.
Matt: That ends your turn. Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: Did I see this go down?
Matt: You're over here watching the egg off in the distance, and you watch her fire a couple arrows and then rush around the corner, and you hear the slam into the ground. Though you can see the fog moving around and there's thrashing. If you wanted to try and attack something, you'd have to roll a perception check.
Taliesin: All right. I'm making my way along the wall anyway in that direction, so while I'm walking I'm going to see if anything looks worth shooting at over there.
Matt: Okay, go for it.
Taliesin: Perception check. Hey! Let's call that a 25.
Matt: 25, you can just make out the outline of a form thrashing within the fog cloud, so yes, I would allow you to take attacks, with disadvantage.
Taliesin: I'm going to cast Hex.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: And she now has disadvantage on strength saving throws.
Matt: (laughs) Okay.
Patrick rothfuss: (laughs) Nice.
Taliesin: Yeah, I'm being a dick.
Marisha: Strength saving throws, hell yeah.
Taliesin: So I'm going to burn a grit to cancel out the disadvantage.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: Better mark that like a clever person. And I'm just going to try and take a shot and see what happens.
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: So this is with Bad News. That's a 21.
Matt: 21? Vanishes into the mist. Does not seem to have made an impact.
Travis: I think it's 23.
Laura: Really?
Taliesin: One more shot. Oh, yeah. 29.
Matt: 29 does hit. That's with disadvantage?
Taliesin: Yeah. No, that's with a grit to cancel out the disadvantage.
Matt: Oh, gotcha. Then yeah, that does hit.
Taliesin: So, okay, I'm going to use that, since it hit I'm also going to shove all six of my charges through that shot as well.
Matt: Okay, then.
Taliesin: For fun.
Patrick rothfuss: Actually, does he have disadvantage because she's bound? Didn't those cancel out when she attacked?
Laura: She's invisible, though.
Patrick rothfuss: Invisible but restrained.
Matt: Right, so you would've had... so it would've been just a straight attack.
Liam: So you don't need the grit.
Laura: So you don't need to burn the grit, that's great.
Taliesin: I'll get that back later, okay.
Matt: Good call, thank you.
Taliesin: So. Thank you, thank you, that's going to make life better later. So that's--
Matt: Just roll damage and then pump 6d6 lightning damage from your cloak into the hit.
Laura: Holy moly!
Taliesin: So that's-- oh god, I got to get more dice, I didn't even think this through.
Marisha: Do you need d6s? I've got a line.
Taliesin: Sure.
Marisha: Here's some d6s.
Taliesin: I just need three more.
Marisha: One two-three.
Travis: Here's all of them.
Marisha: Here's all of them.
Taliesin: So 6d6 plus... d12s plus... one more 1d6 because there's some necro there.
Marisha: Yeah.
Taliesin: Thank you. Okay. That'll do. Here we go.
Liam: Necro.
Taliesin: Oh wow. Okay. I'm going to make that the necro because that's fun.
Marisha: That's hot!
Taliesin: Yeah, that's pretty good. I wish I had your power to do that crazy. All right, let's see how we did.
Laura: C'mon Percival!
Taliesin: That's... hahaha. (all laugh)
Travis: The most random line-fillers.
Taliesin: 23 points of normal damage.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: 23 points of normal damage, six points of necrotic damage.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: And 25 points of lightning damage.
Matt: Nice, that's a total of 54 points of damage.
Taliesin: Oh yeah, that felt good.
Matt: She still makes her save for her maintaining concentration.
Taliesin: Wow, all right.
Marisha: How?
Matt: Dragons have really high constitution.
Taliesin: I'm going to keep moving my maximum move in that direction along the wall.
Matt: Dragons have high constitution. It's plus 14 modifier.
Taliesin: If I can move any further I will, but that's--
Matt: You can move, from where you were? No, that's as far as you can go, unfortunately, yeah.
Taliesin: That's fine. I just call over the headpiece, "She's down and vulnerable!"
Matt: All right. As you finish your turn, you watch as the fog shifts and you hear (footsteps) and a voice retorts out, "Not as down and not as vulnerable as you think."
Taliesin: Oh, shit.
Matt: Backs up into the fog.
Marisha: Oh, jeez.
Matt: You just barely see, Scanlan, as it steps away, this form vanish into-- well, you said you were holding your action for something?
Sam: I was not holding my action. I thought about it.
Matt: That's right, that's right. So you watch the figure back away into the fog ever-so-slightly going (soft chanting).
Laura: She's casting something.
Taliesin: Did she-- even with disadvantage on her strength check on that one?
Matt: Hm? Well, she can't move anywhere, because she's restrained.
Laura: Oh, she is still restrained?
Matt: Correct. She can't move.
Marisha: She's switching form?
Laura: Oh.
Sam: She's still restrained?
Matt: She's still restrained. For the item, what does it say? Is it a saving throw at the end of the turn, or is it has to use an action to break free?
Laura: Let me find out, because let's see. You wrote it, I mean.
Matt: I know, but I haven't looked at it in a while.
Laura: The restrained target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns.
Matt: Okay, cool. So. So yes.
Laura: Oh, and it's a DC of 17. Not 16. I have it written down wrong.
Matt: Okay, that's fine, she still rolled poorly for that one. As the face pulls back into the mist, you feel this shaking within the room as the ceilings of the cavern begin to shift and form into what appear to be small rifts.
Sam: Oh shit. What's all that?
Travis: The air conditioning?
Sam: Yeah, that's what it is. Central.
Marisha: HVAC.
Laura: Oh no. Oh no!
Matt: You hear the sound of rocketing stone and flame being pulled from a realm or plane beyond the material--
Marisha: She's doing a Meteor Swarm. She's doing a Meteor Swarm!
Liam: Final Fantasy.
Laura: There's nowhere to take cover, is there?
Marisha: Hold onto your butts.
Laura: Hold onto your knickers!
Matt: One... two...
Marisha: Yeah, that's fair.
Matt: Actually, it would be two... three... four. All of you.
Taliesin: Four?
Marisha: One day, I'll have that spell.
Taliesin: Four?
Laura: Scanlan even got hit? Scanlan got hit in there?
Sam: I was on the edge of one of them.
Laura: Ah, balls.
Matt: Yep, everybody got hit. So. I need everybody... Go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw, please.
Travis: Nobody can counter that or anything, hey?
Liam: Natural 20!
Patrick rothfuss: Grog, you get a plus three from me.
Travis: Oh, nice.
Patrick rothfuss: Who else is next to me there? Is she close enough to be within my aura?
Matt: Who, Kima?
Patrick rothfuss: Yes.
Matt: Kima has her own aura, thankfully.
Patrick rothfuss: Okay.
Matt: She's a paladin as well.
Patrick rothfuss: Am I close enough to get hers?
Matt: So it's ten feet, you guys are not close enough to affect each other, no. So you do not get to receive each other's bonus, unfortunately. All right. So. Scanlan.
Sam: Eight.
Matt: (laughs) Eight. Okay. You suffer... that's 118 points of damage. (Incredulous laughter.)
Matt: Bludgeoning--
Sam: I'm immune to meteors. (all laugh)
Matt: It's 20d6 fire damage and 20d6 bludgeoning damage, and half as much on half. So yeah, so that's 118 points--
Sam: Tell me this  do I have-- how many hit points do I have, because when she dispelled the Hero's Feast, do I lose those temporary hit points?
Matt: You do.
Sam: Okay. So... got it.
Marisha: So you're unconscious, aren't you?
Sam: No.
Taliesin: No.
Marisha: No?
Matt: He's a hardy little gnome, man.
Laura: Wow, that's impressive.
Matt: Percy.
Taliesin: 18.
Matt: 18. You suffer 118 points of damage.
Taliesin: 19, I'm sorry, 19.
Matt: Still suffer it.
Taliesin: Okay. That's fine. 118.
Sam: When she dispelled things, did I also lose my Pike advantages things?
Laura: The Beacon of Hope?
Sam: Beacon of Hope?
Laura: Or was it just the one?
Matt: No. No, the only thing she dispelled was a single specific effect, which was the Hero's Feast.
Marisha: So you have to pick an effect.
Sam: So you have to tell what you're dispelling? Okay.
Matt: You have to pick a singular effect.
Marisha: Okay. That's good.
Matt: Yeah. And Raishan is well aware that you guys prepare with a Hero's Feast.
Sam: Okay.
Matt: Keyleth.
Marisha: 24.
Matt: 24. You suffer 59 points of damage.
Marisha: Okay, that's half. That's half. Nothing better. Don't you guys wish you were me?
Travis: Well, yeah, yes.
Taliesin: Really, we do. That's genuinely a thing.
Marisha: 54? 59?
Matt: 59 points.
Marisha: Okay.
Taliesin: I'm alive. Nice.
Matt: Oof.
Laura: This is like instant run away (laughs). One spell she does.
Matt: Kima is already down, unconscious.
Laura: No, Kima!
Matt: Sorry, Allura is down, Kima is still up.
Patrick rothfuss: Christ.
Marisha: I'm at 57 hit points.
Matt: Kerrek.
Travis: She started to cast.
Patrick rothfuss: Just no, not even close.
Laura: That's right, wasn't she saving her action?
Travis: Allura, wasn't she preparing Disintegrate?
Sam: Yeah, until she saw something.
Matt: She never saw something come through. So that--
Sam: Is that like a hand-grenade where you fall and--
Travis: And it goes ting-ting-ting (explosion).
Matt: Not so much.
Laura: I'm disintegrated.
Patrick rothfuss: Six.
Matt: Six. Kerrek, you suffer 118 points of damage.
Patrick rothfuss: Yes I do.
Sam: What's he down--
Matt: Kerrek is unconscious.
Patrick rothfuss: I am unconscious.
Sam: I mean, how far down?
Liam: There is no negative, he's just down.
Laura: No, no, it's not like that.
Sam: It's not like past--
Liam: You have to surpass your total--
Sam: I know, that's what I'm asking.
Patrick rothfuss: I'm not that bad, not that bad.
Taliesin: The world's cruel.
Matt: All right. Next up is--
Liam: Natural 20.
Matt: So zero damage to Vax.
Liam: Hip hop hippity hop.
Laura: 22.
Patrick rothfuss: You have Evasion?
Liam: Yep.
Matt: 22, you suffer 59 points of damage.
Patrick rothfuss: I got so used to playing a rogue, nothing can stick on you.
Matt: The DC is 22 for the spell.
Laura: Oh my god.
Marisha: 22, wow.
Laura: Trinket got three. But he is, he is resistant to magical bludgeoning damage.
Sam: Is that true?
Laura: Or bludgeoning damage, rather.
Taliesin: Wait a minute. Is this magical damage?
Matt: Yes?
Taliesin: Does Cabal's absorb it?
Matt: What's it say for Cabal?
Marisha: Oh, come on.
Taliesin: You keep going, I'll let you know, I'm going to read.
Sam: You have advantage.
Matt: So Trinket takes...
Liam: A skillion hit points.
Matt: So Trinket failed the save, Trinket would actually take 85 points of damage.
Laura: Oh, he's unconscious and in my necklace. Good job, Trinket. He was within 100 feet of me, right?
Matt: Yes, he was. He was over here.
Laura: I'm glad I moved back. (gasps) Would he have been further than 100 feet if I hadn't moved back?
Matt: No, he'd have to be pretty far to be further than 100 feet from you.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: Grog?
Travis: 11.
Matt: 11. You take 118 points of damage.
Travis: Now, is it-- do I halve the bludgeoning because of raging?
Matt: You know what? I believe you do, yes. So you actually suffer the same, eighty--
Laura: 85, you said.
Matt: 85.
Laura: Okay, and Pike got a nine.
Sam: This is the big one.
Matt: Pike takes 118 points of damage.
Laura: But she's fire resistant.
Matt: Right, so that's true. So she takes 87 points of damage.
Laura: All right.
Marisha: She still up?
Laura: She's still up.
Taliesin: I'll wait until you guys are done. I'll wait until they're done and then I'll pop in with my reaction.
Travis: That's the single most powerful attack we've ever had hit, right?
Patrick rothfuss: Actually, I'm really glad to hear that, because if I'm going to go out--
Travis: You might as well go out with the ace, man.
Taliesin: Literally in a hail of bullets.
Travis: That had some stank on it.
Taliesin: I'm going to activate-- I'm going to use my reaction to activate Cabal's Ruin. I'm going to absorb the spell and the damage I take is halved and the cloak gains the number of charges equal to the spell's level, the level of the triggering shot.
Matt: Yes, it does.
Laura: Wow, that is a clutch--
Liam: Yeah, Perce!
Laura: That is major.
Matt: Which, it's a ninth-level spell.
Taliesin: Yeah, I don't get all nine, do I, because-- does the spell hold nine charges?
Matt: The cloak holds six charges. However, as you absorb the spell, the cloak flares out and actually grows an additional six inches in length. The inside begins to sparkle with electric energy as it pulls one of the meteors into the cloak itself. It arcs inward and vanishes into the side. It bursts behind you, and the damage is taken, but the cloak now is shimmering with a very vibrant but continuous spark of arcane energy.
Laura: My eyes are like--
Sam: It awoke, it awoke!
Matt: Pass this over, please.
Laura: You got upgraded! (All sing.)
Taliesin: Oh shit. What! Okay, so.
Sam: 'Exalted', it says. Not just awoken. Exalted.
Marisha: It has ten charges in it.
Laura: Oh my god. I'm so jealous! What do I do?
Taliesin: So I'm at nine, the damage is still halved?
Laura: What if I die without upgrading my bow?
Matt: The damage is still halved, yeah. So you took a total of 59 points of damage.
Taliesin: 59 points of damage, okay. So I'm going to add 59 hitpoints to that.
Liam: De Rolo just went full peacock. He suddenly has a giant cowboy hat on.
Sam: It says anyone who wears the exalted Cabal's Ruin has permanently oiled skin. (all laugh)
Matt: It's a full paragraph descriptor of it on the actual item.
Taliesin: I'm back at 81 points, so that's nice. And I have nine charges in the cloak.
Matt: Yes you do.
Taliesin: Okay, that's awesome.
Sam: You should've used that shit.
Taliesin: It's never come up.
Matt: All right. Now, Raishan, trying-- so by the way, I don't think it's possible for you to have spells up to even make the concentration saving throw on this, because of the sheer amount of damage you took. Make a concentration saving throw, Percy? Yeah, Kima lost hers.
Sam: Did Pike lose hers?
Matt: Pike-- roll a constitution saving throw for Pike.
Marisha: You have to do over the damage you did.
Taliesin: That's 16 is my concentration save.
Matt: Yeah, so your--
Taliesin: My Hex--
Matt: Your Hex is gone.
Liam: Am I good with my Hunter's Mark?
Matt: You didn't take any damage, so you're fine.
Taliesin: I was busy.
Laura: You're fine, you're fucking fine. I can't believe you haven't taken any damage.
Matt: You haven't tagged her with it yet, but you've still got it up.
Laura: I mean, you'd better save all of us when we all die when you're flying around like--
Liam: Our relationship is very complicated.
Laura: I guess just like walking around.
Matt: What was Pike's saving throw?
Laura: No, she didn't make it, she got five.
Matt: All right, so yeah, her spell is gone as well.
Laura: Great.
Matt: And Vex, I need you to make your concentration saving throw.
Taliesin: Oh shit, okay.
Matt: Constitution.
Laura: Nope.
Matt: Lose your Hunter's Mark as well. All righty.
Travis: Yeah, get rid of that one now.
Matt: And Raishan's going to make a strength saving throw--
Sam: Ooh. Ooh.
Matt: That is a 19, so she is no longer restrained.
Marisha: Fucking fuck.
Sam: Did the dog get hit?
Matt: Oh, the dog got hit.
Travis: No! Not McGruff!
Matt: As the impact hits you and you're like--
Sam: Can I roll for the dog?
Matt: It won't even matter.
Sam: Okay.
Travis: He is smoked.
Matt: The dog takes enough damage to immediately revert back to the onyx figure that it was, but the impact sends it careening through the room like a pinball.
Sam: Every time we use this dog that's what happens.
Patrick rothfuss: Imagine his life. (all laugh)
Patrick rothfuss: Just moments of like-- (explosions)
Travis: How's it going? (barking, explosion)
Sam: I think we've only brought him out twice and he's been blown up both times.
Laura: He's been exploded, yeah. It's so sad.
Patrick rothfuss: It's worse if you imagine how a dog always greets you when you come home.
Laura: He's just so happy.
Patrick rothfuss: Imagine-- that's how he comes out, it's like, hey! Hey!
Marisha: I'm so happy to see you!
Matt: (explosion)
Laura: No, he's a bit of a snooty dog, actually.
Patrick rothfuss: Oh, okay.
Taliesin: Kind of a snooty dog.
Liam: We need a scene with the dog and Trinket commiserating over a bowl of--
Travis: Earl Grey.
Liam: Constantly getting blasted up.
Marisha: Kibbles and bits for you too?
Matt: All righty. So, ending Raishan's turn. Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: Oh man, that smarted.
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: Um. Okay, is Kerrek around me?
Matt: Kerrek is way back here, so he's about 100 feet from you.
Sam: 100 feet.
Matt: Yes, roughly.
Patrick rothfuss: There's a paladin over there that'll probably-- hopefully--
Sam: Well, I can't reach you anyway, so.
Matt: Allura's down, and everyone around you is pretty--
Sam: Oh, can I see Allura from where I am?
Matt: Allura is right over here, so yeah, you can see Allura.
Marisha: So the only people who've gone down are Allura and Kerrek?
Matt: Kerrek. Everyone else seems to still be standing.
Marisha: Okay.
Laura: Barely, but standing.
Taliesin: The wraiths didn't take any damage, did they?
Matt: The one wraith that was there... yes, actually, that wraith was destroyed. Thank you for the reminder.
Taliesin: Silver lining.
Marisha: Silver lining.
Travis: Second one is still there, right?
Laura: The other one was--
Matt: The other one just got destroyed by the Meteor Swarm.
Laura: And Thordak is just even more watermelon.
Matt: Yeah. It is just-- the room already had old carnage on it, now it has new carnage.
Taliesin: Fresh paint.
Matt: It looks kind of like the Butcher in Diablo I, when you get to his room and it's just covered.
Liam: It's everything he deserves.
Matt: All right. So, Scanlan, what are you doing?
Sam: I'm going to heal Allura.
Matt: Okay, you'll have to get a little closer if you're doing-- is it 30 or 60 feet for your--
Sam: It's 30.
Matt: 30? So you'll have to be a little closer.
Sam: Well then, I'll walk that way as much as I can, actually.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Yeah, right there.
Matt: As you pull back--
Marisha: What? No!
Taliesin: No.
Sam: Sure.
Travis: High five? High five me, bro?
Matt: Yeah, high five you with the claw. Raishan takes an attack of opportunity on you, her invisible form right at the edge of that fog cloud. Oh, that is a 15.
Sam: Yeah, that hits. Unless I Cutting Words it.
Matt: That's up to you.
Marisha: Yeah yeah yeah! Do the thing, do the thing.
Sam: Shit. I'll Cutting Words it. Sorry, Allura. Oh wait, no, that's not a bonus action--
Matt: That's your reaction.
Sam: --that's a reaction. So yes, I will Cutting Words. I will yell at the claw I see coming out of the cloud of smoke, I will say, "You're so dumb, you get your yearly checkup from Dr. Dranzel." (Weak laughter.)
Matt: Roll a d12.
Travis: That was like some six-week-old orange juice.
Sam: Two.
Matt: That reduces it to 13.
Sam: That does not hit.
Matt: So you hear this voice go, "Wait, who?" (all laugh)
Matt: From the fog, and this wisp of wind just misses you A claw just catches the back of a hair. But yeah, you move fine and you are within range now.
Sam: Jesus Christ. Okay, so I will do a Healing Word on Allura.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: I will sing to her, (singing) "Scanlan singing in the dead of night, take your broken bones and learn to fly" That's all I got.
Marisha: I love that song.
Matt: (singing) "You were only waiting to get up and cast a spell."
Sam: Yes! Do I roll?
Matt: Yes, you roll for that.
Sam: Yes. d4, right?
Matt: d4 plus six.
Sam: Four! That's ten!
Matt: All right. She is at ten hit points. Conscious.
Sam: Double-dig.
Matt: Allura now (gasps). "Oh dear."
Laura: I look down at her like--
Matt: (nervous laugh)
Sam: I will also boopadeeboopboop (raspberry sounds). Yeah. So I still have an action, right?
Matt: You do.
Sam: And when I saw the form rise up in the cloud, it did not move away, it just rose up.
Matt: Correct, yeah. It was right at the cusp of the fog.
Sam: So I have a vicinity. I saw a claw, I saw something like--
Matt: Kind of, yeah.
Sam: I can take a shot.
Matt: If you want to.
Sam: Yeah, I'm going to take a shot.
Matt: What're you doing?
Sam: I am going to cast-- let's do Bigby's Hand at level six.
Matt: Okay!
Sam: Yeah.
Travis: Yeah, dude. Yeah!
Sam: Sure.
Travis: Commitment.
Matt: Right at the outside of the radius? Where the dragon is?
Sam: I mean, it's probably got to punch into the cloud a little bit to get--
Matt: Yeah, but it's right, it's right at the cusp of where you saw the dragon's form moving.
Sam: Yeah.
Matt: Okay. And so at level six? So for that-- and you're using the punching?
Sam: Yes, please.
Matt: All righty. So go ahead and roll a d20, adding your spell attack modifier.
Sam: That was a cocked roll, but I'll take it, because I'm a man of honor, and it did not work. 13.
Matt: 13, no, that misses.
Travis: Was it cocked?
Laura: But if it was cocked, then it doesn't count.
Sam: Didn't actually roll. It hit the side of my box.
Matt: It's still a roll, it's fine. So the fist-- whoosh-- into the fog, just manages to move past the form, does not actually hit the side of it.
Sam: Balls. All right.
Matt: Does not hit balls either. But Bigby's fist is up and around.
Sam: Okay, good.
Matt: All right, that ends your turn.
Patrick rothfuss: Oh, what about the radiant weapon, did that-- was that a concentration spell?
Laura: It was.
Patrick rothfuss: Oh.
Laura: Oh wait, no, it's not a concentration. No.
Matt: Yeah, that's still around.
Laura: Spiritual Weapon's still up?
Matt: When it comes to Pike's turn, Pike can still do that.
Patrick rothfuss: Okay.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Good looking out.
Travis: (singing) Stay alive...
Matt: That's going to be the end of your turn. Raishan is going to use two legendary actions to--
Taliesin: Burn 'em, baby.
Marisha: How many does she have?
Taliesin: Too many.
Matt: Four per turn.
Marisha: Four per turn? Jeez.
Matt: Is going to go ahead and cast Disintegrate at Pike.
Laura: What? Disintegrate? What'd he say?
Liam: Disintegrate toward Pike.
Laura: No!
Taliesin: No.
Laura: No.
Sam: Is that bad?
Laura: Please tell me that's a natural one that you just rolled and you're taking a picture of it.
Marisha: I know, right? Yeah.
Matt: I'm taking a picture of it right now.
Travis: Throw the laser pointer over here.
Taliesin: He somehow rolled a 46 and they're trying to figure out what to do about it.
Travis: Laser pointer!
Taliesin: Laser pointer?
Liam: Pass it.
Taliesin: Okay, fine.
Matt: I'm checking to make sure this is how the spell works.
Travis: Blind him. Blind him!
Matt: This is going to be really funny. Don't blind me, I'm trying to help.
Travis: Take the shot!
Taliesin: I have the shot.
Matt: Oh, has to make a dexterity saving throw, so that roll wouldn't matter. I rolled a one, but it doesn't matter because it's not an attack. Dexterity saving throw on Pike, please.
Liam: Fuck.
Laura: I don't want to roll it, it's too much pressure.
Marisha: Can we just pretend that one was like a nat 20 for Pike?
Liam: I'll roll it, one of us has to roll it. Here's what it is, this is what it is. It's a 14.
Laura: 14?
Matt: Total 14? That's not enough.
Patrick rothfuss: Is she by anyone with the paladin radius? We got a bunch of pallies here.
Laura: She's not by any of the paladins.
Matt: Uh, you know what? Actually, Allura is conscious on the ground. Allura is going to attempt to counterspell that. That is a sixth-level spell. 'Cause Allura's going to try and get that out at the last minute. So.
Laura: With Disintegrate, does the body go away? I don't understand.
Liam: Yeah.
Travis: Yeah, it ain't good.
Taliesin: Will the armor retort that or no?
Sam: Yeah, the armor brings her back to one point, doesn't it?
Matt: Okay, fourth or higher... DC equals 10 plus the spell level. Allura's spell modifier is five, so-- That is an eight. That's not enough. She rolled an eight plus five, that's not enough to counter the spell. Okay, so that goes to... Pike suffers, so that's 72 points of force damage.
Laura: Well, she's knocked unconscious, but the armor should bring her back.
Matt: Pike, as the beam hits her, you watch her flesh begin to turn to dust as the fingers begin to disperse... as a burst of flame from the armor flares outward, bringing her back to her feet at whatever the effect of the armor is, so she gets up.
Sam: Is it five?
Liam: She gets like one hit point, I think.
Travis: What's the effect of the armor?
Laura: The effect of the armor--
Liam: She's up, she's up. She's not dead.
Laura: Brings her back to five hit points.
Matt: I had forgotten she had that.
Laura: And she's on her feet.
Matt: So she's on her feet.
Laura: Is-- no, Raishan's not within 15 feet of her, is she?
Matt: No.
Laura: Okay.
Liam: Okay, she's not dust.
Matt: She's not dust. Okay. That brings us to--
Sam: (laughs) Oh, Jesus.
Laura: I can't, if Ashley's not here, you can't kill her when she's not here.
Matt: Grog, you're up.
Sam: She's not dead, she's walking around.
Matt: She's not-- I'm acting like she would!
Marisha: That would be the worst fucking phone call, Matt.
Matt: I know!
Laura: If Ashley dies when she's not here--
Matt: She's also the cleric, that's exactly what Raishan would do! Grog, you're up.
Travis: I take out the cask of ale and I start drinking. (all laugh)
Travis: No. Now that I don't have any more wraiths, I'm going to run towards this wall if I can. This one.
Matt: This one over here?
Travis: Yeah, right there.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: 50 feet, and I'll leap the rest, just to get up to the--
Matt: That's as far as you can get, there.
Travis: Yeah. And that is--
Matt: So go ahead and roll your athletics check to leap.
Travis: 22.
Matt: Yeah, that's fine. So you can leap 20 feet. Yeah, Mr. Badger, you're gone, you are scattered. All righty.
Travis: Oh, I can throw!
Matt: Well, you have to roll a perception check to see if you can see the invisible form in there.
Travis: Oh, this'll go well.
Laura: Natural 20.
Travis: Nope.
Laura: Damn.
Sam: Oh, when Bigby's Hand went at rest, it just started to just-- yeah.
Matt: Just pointing. (all laugh)
Matt: Here! Perfect.
Travis: That is a 16.
Matt: Okay. I'll say between that roll and the Bigby's Hand pointing at where the dragon is, I'll let you make your attacks, but they're at disadvantage.
Travis: Awesome. Well, I'll make 'em Reckless, so I'll zero them out. Can I throw the dwarven thrower?
Matt: Yes you can.
Travis: Okay. One roll. 21.
Matt: Nope. The hammer just disappears into the fog and returns back to your grasp.
Travis: That's better. 31.
Matt: That does hit.
Travis: 18 points of damage.
Matt: 18 points of damage?
Travis: Oh, thrown.
Matt: Yeah, plus the--
Travis: 20.
Matt: 20. Okay. Constitution saving throw, yeah, makes the concentration one. Are you Frenzied or not?
Travis: I would like to go into a Frenzied Rage.
Matt: Yeah, Frenzied Rage, so make your bonus attack strike now.
Sam: Was that a saving throw?
Matt: Yeah, it has to maintain concentration on Greater Invisibility every time it takes damage.
Sam: Technically, disadvantage because of Cutting Words.
Matt: That's true. And that would be a 19. Still makes it, yeah.
Sam: Damn.
Matt: It needs to make more damage.
Travis: 28.
Matt: 28 damage.
Travis: No, no, 28 to hit on the third throw.
Matt: Oh, that does hit, yeah.
Travis: 22 points of damage.
Matt: 22. Saving throw. Yeah, it succeeds, so it maintains invisibility. All right. Ending your turn, Grog?
Travis: Yeah, it does.
Patrick rothfuss: Does the Cutting Word-- how long does that last?
Sam: Just the next saving throw.
Patrick rothfuss: The next saving throw.
Sam: That's it.
Patrick rothfuss: That's cool.
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: Words are mean, man.
Patrick rothfuss: Words hurt.
Sam: Well, that's not from words, that's from the sword.
Taliesin: That's the sword?
Sam: From my Mythcarver.
Taliesin: Oh, shit.
Matt: At the end of your turn, Grog, she's going to use her other two legendary actions here to go ahead and cast Cone of Cold.
Travis: Not that shit again, I didn't do well on that last time.
Sam: Cone of Cold? Again. I die.
Matt: So that's everybody there. I need Scanlan, Vex, Pike, Vax, Grog, and Keyleth, and Allura, to all make constitution saving throws. Constitution, yes.
Travis: (nervous laughter)
Patrick rothfuss: Not with your plus nine?
Travis: No no no.
Matt: Keyleth?
Marisha: 13.
Matt: 13. You take 42 points of cold damage.
Travis: How much?
Matt: 42.
Travis: Cool.
Marisha: Is that the full damage, or did I--
Matt: That's the full damage.
Taliesin: You're up.
Marisha: I'm walking.
Matt: Vax.
Liam: 16.
Matt: 16, you take 42 points of cold damage. Vex?
Laura: 12.
Matt: 12, you take 42 points of cold damage.
Travis: Seven.
Patrick rothfuss: Don't you have Evasion?
Liam: It's a constitution saving throw.
Sam: Am I in there?
Matt: You are as well. What'd you roll?
Sam: 15.
Matt: 42 points of cold damage.
Laura: 20 for Pike.
Matt: Pike takes 42 points of cold damage.
Sam: Shit.
Matt: So Pike is unconscious. Who else is unconscious?
Sam: I am unconscious.
Marisha: Fuck.
Matt: You are unconscious. Bigby's Hand is gone.
Travis: Grab that popcorn, this movie's interesting.
Taliesin: Nothing I have is useful.
Sam: (belches) Oh, I forgot we're on TV. (all laugh)
Laura: What did you do? Did you just burp really gross?
Sam: Burped, yeah.
Matt: Allura is unconscious again.
Marisha: This isn't TV, this is the internet.
Travis: At least people can't smell it.
Marisha: The wild west.
Matt: So Allura's unconscious, Vex, you still up?
Laura: I'm still up.
Marisha: Allura's down again?
Laura: Yep.
Matt: Allura's down again, yeah, she got hit.
Laura: Pike's down.
Matt: Pike's down.
Marisha: Fucking--
Matt: All right. That is all of her legendary actions this turn. Ending Grog's turn, all righty. That brings us to Kerrek. I need you to go ahead and roll a death saving throw.
Patrick rothfuss: I've been down this road before.
Travis: (said extremely quickly) Don't you get advantage on those death saving throws?
Patrick rothfuss: (laughs) What was that?
Matt: Unfortunately, the spell that did that faded.
Sam: I think he's auctioning something over there.
Travis: (auctioneer's babble)
Patrick rothfuss: Now, is that just a straight-up--
Liam: Straight roll.
Matt: Just a straight d20.
Liam: Seven.
Patrick rothfuss: Straight d20. Seven.
Matt: So that's one fail. So you've failed one death saving throw.
Patrick rothfuss: Well, you could call that a failure... it really depends on what I'm trying to accomplish here.
Marisha: Don't call it a comeback.
Sam: In the Hindu faith, you would welcome it.
Patrick rothfuss: Yes, you know. If what I'm trying to accomplish is a lot of drama, I consider that a great success in a roll.
Matt: All right, so Kima, as it's now Kima's turn, sees you on the ground, convulsing from the blast of the impact, the giant crater in the ground where the meteors struck, and hearing these blasts of arcane energy around the other side, she has practically no vision of what's happening right now. All she sees is you down, and Grog run off, and she says, "C'mon, my bearded friend." Runs up and is going to go ahead and hit you with Lay on Hands for... let's see, for Kima she can do up to-- she's going to give you 30 hit points.
Patrick rothfuss: Oh, that's nice.
Matt: As you come to consciousness, you see the scarred halfling paladin in her golden armor and half-cocked grin. "Come on, we still have work to do." Puts her hand down to try and lift you up.
Patrick rothfuss: Okay.
Matt: We'll say for the sake of the fun of it, bonus action pulls you to your feet.
Patrick rothfuss: Okay, thank you.
Matt: All righty. That ends Kima's turn.
Travis: Shit.
Matt: Allura has to make a death saving throw.
Travis: No!
Matt: With a seven, that is a failure.
Travis: Fuck!
Marisha: Fuck!
Matt: She loses a death saving throw. That brings us to Pike. Pike I need to make roll a death saving throw.
Liam: Do you want to do it? I'll do it.
Travis: I could do it.
Liam: Go for it.
Travis: It's a five.
Taliesin: God damn it.
Matt: Pike fails a death saving throw.
Laura: Okay. Okay. Nobody else just willy-nilly make some rolls, okay.
Matt: Keyleth, it's your turn.
Marisha: (nervous laughter) That's nice.
Sam: Do I need to make a death saving throw? No.
Matt: When it gets to your turn, you do.
Sam: Okay.
Liam: New campaign next week. (all laugh)
Marisha: Shut your fucking face right fucking now. Fuck me. Okay.
Travis: Who's got the This Is A Bad Dream spell?
Marisha: Okay.
Taliesin: The Dallas? I don't have a Dallas left.
Matt: There is a spell for that. It's called Wish.
Laura: Do we have any wishes?
Sam: Don't move, just heal.
Marisha: Laser pointer, laser pointer. Just shut up, laser pointer.
Matt: You going to try and draw a card?
Taliesin: Travis.
Marisha: Anybody laser pointer!
Travis: Oh, sorry. (Impressed noises.)
Matt: That's my girl.
Marisha: Who's-- shhh-- who's that?
Matt: That is the water fountain. (all laugh)
Marisha: All right, fuck that water fountain! All right.
Taliesin: I've been wondering this whole time.
Travis: Who's that? It's a fountain.
Marisha: Who's that?
Taliesin: It was very lifelike.
Marisha: Okay. Keyleth is very not okay, comes around the corner, and I'm going to do, with my staff, and I'm going to pray to Melora and be like, "I know you hate this bitch as much as I do," and use my staff to do Firestorm right where I know she is.
Matt: Over here? All righty.
Marisha: Just boof-boof-boof-boof--
Matt: Sure.
Sam: What's the radius?
Marisha: I get to pick.
Sam: Oh, thank god.
Matt: So you send fire sneaking all through there--
Marisha: All of that, all through this area, just that whole tunnel gets lit up.
Matt: I'll say for the purposes of the Fog spell versus a seventh-level fire spell and the item, the fog cloud is just burned off, it is done, it is gone. All right, so roll that 7d10 fire damage. Saving throw... that is a failed save. She will use her first legendary resistance.
Laura: First?
Marisha: First?
Matt: To ignore that.
Taliesin: Burn 'em up.
Marisha: 7d10?
Matt: 7d10 fire damage.
Marisha: Five... do you have two more?
Taliesin: I do.
Laura: Did she gain them all back? Did she heal all the way? I mean, what's going on?
Matt: Yeah, she rested, she got 'em all back. You guys rested a whole night to get your shit back, so did she.
Laura: Well, fine.
Matt: It's like enemies can do that too.
Laura: That's stupid.
Matt: Don't forget your staff's ability--
Marisha: Reroll ones!
Matt: Yep.
Marisha: Which I have one that I will reroll, and it's a one. Do I get to reroll it again?
Matt: So you get to reroll it, yeah.
Marisha: Fuck yeah.
Taliesin: There are no ones here.
Marisha: That's better.
Taliesin: That's much better.
Marisha: Nine... 12...
Laura: I like how red your face is getting.
Marisha: Is it? Am I hot? I'm pale. I'm a redhead, so I show everything that happens. It's true. 17...
Sam: I don't think that came out right.
Marisha: Don't worry about it. I'm distracted. God damn it. Now I'm distracted out of my math. 17 plus four is 21, correct? Plus another five is 26 plus another four is 30, plus another four is 34. 34 damage.
Matt: 34 damage. 17 points of fire damage.
Marisha: Did you get hit?
Sam: No, that's half of 34.
Taliesin: No, that's half.
Marisha: Oh, that's right. She saved.
Matt: So yeah, it succeeds.
Marisha: Does it being a staff of Melora do anything?
Matt: No, other than the mention of the name caused the sound of growling in the distance. "Why won't you all just stay down and die with dignity?"
Laura: We don't do anything with dignity. (all laugh)
Sam: Scanlan's lifeless corpse has a pool of urine around it. (all laugh)
Matt: All righty. Is that the end of your turn, Keyleth? Are you going to move forward?
Marisha: I'm going to-- can I see Pike?
Matt: Pike is right there next to you, yeah.
Marisha: Okay, I'm going to reach around the corner and do a Healing Word.
Matt: All right, Healing Word.
Marisha: What, is it because I said "reach around"?
Laura: No, no.
Matt: Not at all.
Marisha: Jesus! Everything I say. Everything I say.
Matt: Level one, level two? What do you do?
Marisha: Level one. Because I'm pale and I just show everything.
Matt: d4 plus six.
Marisha: Nine.
Matt: Nine. So Pike heals nine hit points and is conscious.
Taliesin: Clapping from the void.
Travis: It's because of that saving throw.
Patrick rothfuss: And that resets the death saving throw?
Taliesin: Yeah, everything pops back.
Matt: All right. Bringing us back up to the top, Vax, you're up.
Liam: Now, with the boots of haste, one of the extra actions has to be for an attack, right? I couldn't do--
Matt: Correct. Well, it's attack, disengage, or dash, I think. It should say on the card.
Liam: Yeah, it says the extra action can be used to attack, dash, disengage, or hide. Shite. So I'm going to... balls. I'm going to go to the gnome on the ground and I'm going to cast Lay on Hands--
Laura: Which one?
Liam: Pike is up, isn't she?
Matt: Pike is conscious.
Liam: Conscious is what I mean. To Scanlan.
Matt: There you go.
Liam: And one hit point, just to get you up.
Matt: You're conscious.
Sam: Is this my urine or someone else's?
Patrick rothfuss: Someone peed on me while I was dead! (all laugh)
Travis: (laughing) Is this my urine or someone else's?
Sam: I don't know which is worse.
Taliesin: Only one way to find out. Does it taste like anything you've had recently?
Sam: Asparagus. That's me.
Matt: Oh, god. All right.
Liam: I'm going to use a little more movement to move to the same spot that Bigby's was before it was gone. Maybe into the-- the cloud's gone, right?
Matt: Cloud's gone, it got burned off in the Firestorm.
Liam: Maybe I'll even go ten more feet forward--
Matt: Okay, you slam into the physical form.
Liam: Vow of Enmity.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: As a bonus action.
Matt: All righty.
Liam: And I will use the extra action to disengage and get the fuck out.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: Whoa!
Marisha: What's that? What's that? What'd you do?
Matt: Back up how far?
Liam: I'm going to go that way. Back towards Scanlan.
Matt: This way? Okay.
Liam: I should have 60 feet of movement hasted.
Matt: Yes, and as you back up--
Liam: Disengage.
Matt: Yeah, disengage, yeah.
Patrick rothfuss: Nicely done.
Liam: I will actually go along the wall.
Matt: So you'll be like over here.
Liam: Yeah, yeah.
Matt: Okay. All right, that ends your turn. Vex, you're up.
Laura: Okay. I'm going to... Jesus Christ. I'm going to run over to Allura and I'm going to cast 3rd-level Cure Wounds on her.
Matt: Okay. Healing her--
Laura: 3d8 plus three. Fifteen points.
Matt: All right.
Laura: And then... 30 feet, no. Fuck! That's my action, isn't it?
Matt: Mm-hm.
Laura: I guess as a bonus action I'm going to... hide? I'm such a loser.
Matt: So you're going to move over here and hide?
Laura: Yeah? I guess?
Matt: Okay, so go ahead and roll a stealth check.
Laura: Okay, let me see if I have any health potions left, though. I have a regular healing potion left.
Matt: Go for it.
Laura: So I'm going to take that.
Matt: It's 2d4 plus two.
Laura: Ooh! Eight points healed.
Matt: All right. Percy, you're up.
Laura: And a stealth check.
Matt: Stealth check, yes.
Taliesin: Do I still have any theory of where she is, or do I have to roll another perception check?
Matt: I mean, just where she was previously standing.
Patrick rothfuss: He just bumped into something.
Liam: Yeah, you would've seen me go--
Taliesin: So yeah, again, as I'm scootching further and further back along the wall, I'm going to pull out the Animus box and take a few shots in there to see what happens.
Matt: Okay, disadvantage on all these strikes because she is invisible.
Taliesin: Because she is invisible.
Liam: Get it nerd, get it.
Taliesin: Yeah, I'm going to burn a grit for the first one to neutralize that.
Laura: Can I not have gone back behind the stalagmite, I want to go around the corner. Yeah, like that.
Matt: That's as far as you can get, unfortunately.
Laura: Okay. That's fine. I rolled a 16.
Taliesin: So, shot number one. Natural 20.
Matt: Is this with disadvantage, or did you use the grit point?
Taliesin: I used the grit point to cancel out the disadvantage.
Matt: You did, all right. All right. Roll some damage.
Taliesin: And that will not affect the Cabal's Ruin damage I was going to add to it, because that's a different thing, right?
Matt: Um.
Taliesin: Because that seems unfair because I can add that later.
Matt: Yeah, adding that to a crit is a little intense. I'd say no.
Taliesin: Okay, I'm just going to add the standard damage. I'm not going to crit the Cabal's Ruin damage, but I'm adding--
Matt: Correct.
Liam: The dragon doesn't blow up?
Taliesin: That's a thing.
Matt: The benefit is you can choose to apply it after the hit.
Taliesin: After the hit.
Matt: The downside is you can't add it to the crit.
Taliesin: Totally worth it.
Matt: So you never waste it.
Taliesin: No. So that's, let's see, that's six points of psychic damage.
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: And 18 points of normal damage.
Matt: So 24.
Taliesin: And then I'm going to add three points of Cabal's Ruin, which is--
Sam: Whoa!
Taliesin: 14 points of lightning damage.
Matt: 38.
Taliesin: Yep.
Sam: Does all that double because it was a crit?
Taliesin: No. No, that is doubled.
Matt: That's 38 points to that first hit. She's going to make a concentration check.
Taliesin: And I also get my grit point back because I critted.
Matt: It's true.
Laura: I think it's time for some Advil. (all laugh)
Laura: Critical Role, brought to you by Advil.
Matt: Fails the concentration check on the invisibility.
Taliesin: Yes!
Matt: Is going to spend another legendary resistance to succeed it.
Marisha: So she's spent two?
Matt: She's spent two.
Laura: That's good, that's good.
Taliesin: That's fine. Now for my second shot, I'm going to spend a second point to-- oh, she's not visible, she's--
Matt: Correct, she maintained concentration.
Sam: Did she blink into visibility?
Matt: No.
Taliesin: So I still have disadvantage so I still need to--
Matt: You do.
Taliesin: Okay, that's fine.
Matt: Are you doing another grit point to cancel it?
Taliesin: Yep.
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: Not quite as good, but still good. 27.
Matt: 27 hits.
Taliesin: So that's, ooh, that's nice. That's 17 points of normal damage.
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: Two points of psychic damage.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: And ten points of lightning damage.
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: For my next shot--
Matt: Natural 20 on the save, so she saves concentration. It's maintained.
Taliesin: I'm doing the same thing again, so I'm at two grit points.
Marisha: Kill that resistance, kill that legendary resistance.
Taliesin: I'm trying.
Marisha: Come on, Percy.
Taliesin: Not going to hit, that's going to be 19 to hit. That doesn't hit.
Matt: No.
Taliesin: So that one misses. I still have three Cabal's Ruin, though, so that's nice. I'm going to use my bonus action for a heal surge, for my little healing, my little pick-me-up.
Matt: Great.
Taliesin: So that's going to give me back 16 points of healing points, so that's 16 to me, so that's... 105, I'm at 105. And I'm going to keep just scooting back along the wall. I want to keep where I'm shooting in my line of sight, but I just want to get there. Yeah, and still on the wall.
Matt: Okay, gotcha. That ends your turn, Percy?
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: All righty.
Marisha: Good turn, man, good turn.
Taliesin: Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Matt: It is now Raishan's turn.
Sam: Oh balls.
Matt: Let's see here.
Taliesin: Look, every time I have a reaction I can do something. That's crazy. This is mean.
Patrick rothfuss: Can I see that?
Matt: Uh... hm. Raishan is fed up with this whole down-then-up, down-then-up yo-yoing.
Travis: Good, flee, do it again!
Matt: Raishan, Scanlan, as you're on the ground, just getting your bearings back to consciousness, you watch as your head is across the ground, the rocks kind of (impact sound), and something seems to hit the ground right next to you. Raishan's going to do a full round of just physical attacks on you.
Sam: Great. It won't take very much since I've got the one hit point. But maybe my 14 AC will protect me.
Matt: You are prone, so attack rolls on you have advantage within five feet, which is good, because the first attack was a one. And an 18 plus... so the first hit, which is its bite, hits you for 13 plus eight--
Sam: I mean, I'm unconscious now.
Taliesin: Do you have any reactions you can do?
Sam: I don't know. I can't remember when the last time I used a reaction was. Was it this round or the round before?
Matt: Round before.
Laura: So you could.
Matt: Well, your turn's next, so you have used it... no, you're right, it was, it has been since the last time. So yeah. It was an 18 to hit.
Liam: This could be the difference between--
Marisha: Yeah, life and death.
Liam: Because one or two death saves, three death saves.
Sam: All right.
Laura: Because a full round is four attacks? Or three attacks?
Matt: For Raishan? You don't know.
Laura: I bet it's four attacks.
Liam: This is down to the wire, dude.
Laura: This could be it, Scanlan!
Marisha: Yeah, do it, do it. Do all you can.
Sam: Okay, I'll say to Raishan this time, "You so dumb, when thieves stole your horse, you chased them down and said, 'You forgot the saddle!'" (all laugh)
Matt: He utters, with a weak breath on the floor of the necromancer's sanctum.
Laura: These could be Scanlan's final words.
Matt: Go ahead and roll a d12, please.
Marisha: Come on, Scanlan.
Sam: Six.
Matt: So it's 18 minus six is a 12. (All cheer.)
Matt: So whoosh.
Marisha: You did it with your shitty retort.
Sam: Now just three more attacks to dodge and I'll be okay.
Liam: That was the bite, wasn't it?
Matt: There's two more claw attacks.
Laura: Raishan gets four attacks, so if you would've failed that, your instant death save would've failed.
Matt: So that's 21 to hit.
Sam: Oh, that'll hit, sure.
Matt: So with that you take 4d6 plus eight.
Taliesin: Let's just call it.
Matt: Yeah, you're unconscious. And the final claw attack has advantage, which hits you, and it's a crit. So you lose two death saving throws.
Taliesin: We're going to have to deal with that very, very quickly.
Travis: Where are you? Can you point to him on the map?
Sam: I'm the pink one.
Matt: Right there. And the impact seems to be coming from this area, here.
Sam: So wait, they can see my body sort of like moving?
Matt: Yeah, getting hit on the ground.
Marisha: We can see him getting beat the shit out of.
Matt: Getting mangled by something that's not currently there. And then (whooshing sounds), the wind kicks up as something seems to shift the air.
Laura: Can anybody feel it flying past?
Matt: You can feel it move in this direction.
Laura: Great.
Matt: With that, yeah, I can just make it through without an attack of opportunity--
Liam: Yeah, can I do an attack of opportunity as it flies by?
Travis: Yeah, I'm right there too.
Matt: You sense it not far enough from you to be able to attack something with an attack of opportunity.
Liam: All right.
Matt: That ends Raishan's turn. Scanlan. Death saving throw.
Laura: Oh my god, oh my god.
Sam: Three.
Matt: And with that, the breath escapes Scanlan's lungs, the smile across his face, as life leaves his form.
Sam: This time I died with a bad joke and piss all over me. (All laughing.)
Matt: He died as he lived  hard or after a bad joke with piss all over him. All right. That ends Scanlan's turn. Grog, you're up.
Travis: Yeah. Uh. Dragon moved. Scanlan dead. (raspberry) Did I detect which direction el dragon flew in?
Matt: Roll a perception check.
Travis: Yeah. Sure. Three.
Matt: You're not entirely certain. You just saw something (whoosh) through the air in this vicinity.
Travis: I am just going to throw a hammer in that direction.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: In there.
Matt: Roll with disadvantage.
Travis: Yup. Can I make it reckless?
Matt: Sure.
Travis: One roll? Does that zero out the disadvantage?
Matt: Yep.
Travis: Okay.
Matt: She has a higher AC because she's technically heavily obscured.
Travis: Right. 27.
Matt: 27? 27 just hits. You got lucky and just flung it out in the middle of nowhere, because of the AC bonus of her being heavily obscured. So yeah, go ahead and roll damage.
Travis: Nice. That's good.
Patrick rothfuss: Now you have a better idea of where she is.
Travis: Yeah, can I keep track of where it hit her--
Liam: Can we all see the hammer fly through the air?
Matt: You can see the hammer impact somewhere, and you watch it somewhere right up here.
Laura: Great.
Matt: Like, right above you.
Travis: 23.
Matt: 23 damage.
Travis: 23 damage.
Matt: Okay. Maintains concentration. Hammer comes back.
Travis: Can I be thrilled that I hit something that I didn't see and smash the Titanstone Knuckles together to enlarge?
Matt: Sure. With that, your hammer grows in size as well.
Travis: Can I try and throw the hammer again?
Matt: You can.
Travis: At the same general area. One roll. Unless I know where she is now, but I doubt that.
Matt: I mean, you're still at disadvantage on the attacks. But you're going reckless, so it's all just straight hits.
Travis: That's a one, so I'm, no.
Matt: On both? With reckless?
Travis: I thought I couldn't see her, so it was disadvantage, reckless advantage, so just a single--
Matt: Oh right, yeah. Misses past, breaks into the rock and stone off the wall.
Travis: That's better. 31.
Matt: That hits.
Travis: Okay. 18... 26... plus four for enlarged... 25. 25 damage.
Matt: 25 damage.
Travis: Yeah, yeah, I'm freaking out right now.
Matt: She fails her saving throw. Concentration... no, she wants to maintain that spell, so that's her last legendary resistance.
Marisha: Yeah, Grog! Yeah!
Matt: But she maintains concentration on the invisibility. So that was 25.
Travis: 25, I think.
Matt: Yeah, I got it. So that's the end of your turn, Grog?
Travis: Yes, it is.
Matt: Okay. You can move if you'd like. You just threw, it's all you did.
Travis: Oh, right. Yeah, I'm going to move in the direction that she flew.
Matt: Something hits your head as you get about there.
Travis: Ah! I get angry again.
Matt: All right, that ends your turn, Grog. At the... hm. Yeah. At the end of your turn...
Travis: Not a word. Not a word. (Nervous laughing.)
Matt: It's going to go ahead and--
Sam: Surrender.
Laura: She surrenders.
Matt: It's too close now. Yeah, just, we're done!
Liam: Sorry, sorry, I'm sorry, so sorry.
Patrick rothfuss: Did we mention that this is all subduing damage?
Matt: (laughs)
Patrick rothfuss: So glad you got that joke.
Matt: Ah, subdual damage. Back in the day.
Taliesin: It was a kinder, gentler world.
Matt: I know. She's not going to use that ability yet. Instead is going to... oh, everyone's kind of moving around her.
Taliesin: I'd give money for a popcorn grenade right now.
Matt: Okay, you know? Is going to use two legendary actions to use a wing attack.
Travis: Two legendary actions.
Matt: So the wings start beating furiously in the air. I need Vax, Kima, Grog, and Vex to make a dexterity saving throw.
Travis: Minus two, because, yeah. But advantage.
Matt: Wow. Allura actually made it.
Sam: Vex. (coughs) Inspiration.
Laura: Doesn't matter.
Sam: What?
Matt: That is a shitty roll. All right, so.
Liam: 27.
Matt: 27, so.
Liam: Zero.
Matt: You take no damage. Vex? One! You take 13 points of bludgeoning damage and you are knocked prone.
Sam: Are you still alive?
Laura: I'm still alive, you guys!
Sam: Wow.
Laura: Still standing. I'm not standing. Still--
Matt: Allura succeeds and takes no damage. Grog, what'd you roll?
Travis: 17.
Matt: 17. Grog, you also, you take 13 points of bludgeoning damage and you're knocked prone.
Travis: Halved, halved.
Matt: Yes.
Travis: Six.
Laura: Did you say 21 points of damage?
Matt: 13.
Laura: Oh, that's it? 13.
Matt: Yep. And the dragon moves half its flying speed.
Liam: Is it close, ah.
Matt: Yeah, just moves away at--
Taliesin: Do I get an attack of opportunity?
Matt: People who are not prone, yes. So Vax, you get to make an attack of opportunity with disadvantage.
Liam: Oh, okay.
Laura: Oh, damn it. Sucks that you were knocked prone.
Travis: I know.
Liam: I'm going to use one Luck.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: What does that mean, if I use luck? Disadvantage, and then I rolled a six and--
Matt: Your Vow of Enmity gives it advantage, though, doesn't it?
Liam: Say again?
Matt: Your Vow of Enmity?
Liam: That's right, it does. So that cancels out. So the first one-- but I'm still using Luck, so the first one was a six, the second one was a 31.
Matt: 31 hits. Yeah.
Laura: Yay!
Travis: Hit him!
Sam: Her.
Laura: Hit her!
Travis: Her!
Liam: Nine plus psychic damage... ten. 25.
Matt: 25 points of damage.
Patrick rothfuss: One more.
Travis: Kill all the other dice.
Matt: Yeah, maintains concentration and pulls away.
Taliesin: Do I get an attack of opportunity?
Matt: No. She hasn't moved past you.
Taliesin: She has not moved past me.
Matt: Nope. All right. That ends that turn. Kerrek, you're up.
Patrick rothfuss: I'm assuming-- yeah, I've got to be hearing that over on that side.
Matt: Yeah, you're hearing all the impacts, the slashing, the battle on this side.
Patrick rothfuss: Okay. Boy, 30 move. I can dash, right?
Matt: You can, yeah, as an action, so you can do twice your movement.
Patrick rothfuss: Oh, so you just-- it's a movement, and then I burn my action to do another movement?
Matt: Correct, yeah.
Patrick rothfuss: How far over does... how far over does 30 get me there?
Matt: 30 would just get around the corner here.
Patrick rothfuss: Can I get 25 and just-- actually, I don't know she's invisible. So I go, dragon's coming around the corner, I want to hang at the corner and then effectively wait to attack.
Matt: So you're holding your action in case something shows up that you can hit.
Patrick rothfuss: Yep. Well, actually, I'm going to be around this corner, waiting for it to come into this.
Matt: Right there? Okay.
Patrick rothfuss: Gosh, I think... I think that's all I got.
Matt: Okay. All right, that ends Kerrek's turn. Let's see here. Kima sees you doing this and is going to go ahead and back you up right there. Sorry, Percy.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: Spiderclimb makes you so easy to knock over. Kima, on her turn... is going to use Aura of Vitality again on herself and, utilizing that as a bonus action, is going to heal you for 2d6, Kerrek. So-- oh, not bad. 11 hit points. All righty. That ends Kima's turn. Allura. Allura, who is barely conscious with 15 hit points, is going to get to her feet. Perception check... natural 20.
Marisha: Allura is bae! (all laugh)
Matt: And is going to-- no, not third-level. She's going to go ahead and cast a fifth-level Dispel Magic.
Marisha: Yeah yeah yeah.
Matt: Which would-- yeah, it's just dispelled. And with that.
Laura: Finally!
Matt: Finally revealed on the field.
Laura: And she's just like covered in blood, she's just so beat-up.
Marisha: Yeah, she's barely hanging on.
Liam: She's looking pretty rough.
Marisha: She's got a single tear coming from her eye.
Laura: Oh god, she's like right there.
Taliesin: (nervous exclamation)
Liam: Look out, Perce.
Taliesin: I get the idea.
Liam: Put a counterweight.
Matt: Further over, just appears right in front of your face, Percival.
Laura: Just her butt.
Matt: (menacing growl, wing-sounds) And then Allura, using the rest of her movement, is going to here, here, here, and then actually Misty Step over here next to Keyleth to get out of the area. (breathing hard) "Keyleth, you have to finish this."
Marisha: Okay?!
Matt: That's going to end Allura's turn. Pike is up.
Laura: Pike. Okay.
Marisha: Is she still unconscious?
Laura: No, she's up. She's going to stand up and, if she uses her sprinter's boots, can she run over to Scanlan and cast Revivify? Would she be able to get to him?
Matt: She would just get to his side, yeah.
Laura: Okay, then she's going to cast Revivify on Scanlan.
Matt: All right, so. Go ahead and roll a d20 and add her wisdom modifier.
Taliesin: Do you also have inspiration still?
Laura: Pike didn't have it.
Taliesin: No, Pike, oh-- okay.
Matt: He died twice, the DC is 12.
Laura: So...
Liam: Plus her wisdom, whatever you roll plus the wisdom.
Matt: Yeah, so d20 plus five.
Laura: (small voice) Nine.
Matt: Nine, okay.
Travis: What?
Matt: So the Revivify fails. Reaches out and doesn't hit.
Laura: God fucking damn it!
Matt: You're still dead. You're not permanently dead, but you cannot be revived for the remainder of this battle. You can only use a ritual to return, and the DC does go up to a 13.
Taliesin: Okay, okay.
Sam: Ritual of return?
Taliesin: It's the last-ditch.
Sam: Okay.
Matt: Currently, you get-- Pike touches and releases the energy of the spell into Scanlan's body, and you feel the necrotic essence of this necromancer's sanctum, the very dark nature of this place, is preventing the connection between the spirit and the body of Scanlan at the moment. The spell having no effect. Pike still has a bonus action if she'd like.
Laura: She's going to throw Sacred Flame at Raishan.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: And that's at 17th level, which she's at now, right?
Matt: Sacred Flame is an action.
Laura: It is.
Matt: Needs to be a bonus action, unfortunately.
Laura: Balls. Great. Tight. She-- can she do like a heal--
Matt: She can do a Healing Word.
Laura: Healing Word, tight. She's going to do that on herself, then.
Matt: Level two?
Laura: Sure.
Matt: All right, so 2d4 plus five.
Laura: 11.
Matt: 11. All righty, so that heals her up.
Patrick rothfuss: God. If I can just fucking get close enough to stick one on her.
Taliesin: I'm going to get stupid, so.
Marisha: I know, samesies.
Matt: All right, that ends Pike's turn. Keyleth, you're up.
Taliesin: Well. Things have gotten simpler.
Marisha: Okay. Hearing Allura's words and seeing Scanlan down, can I get a movement to where I can get over here and see her? Keep going, keep going.
Matt: You can see her there.
Marisha: I can see her there?
Matt: Yes.
Marisha: I'm assuming she's within 150 feet of me.
Matt: Yes.
Marisha: This is kind of like a hail mary. Oh, jesus fuck. All right. I am going to cast... (laughs) my one 8th-level spell, and I'm going to attempt to Feeblemind her.
Patrick rothfuss: Oh, she's used up all her legendary saves.
Marisha: Exactly. Exactly.
Matt: All righty. And it is an intelligence saving throw--
Laura: Oh, she's really smart.
Marisha: Yes, which she's really good at, but we could get lucky.
Matt: Four plus four. Rolled a four. She has an intelligence modifier of four, and it is not one of her saving throws.
Marisha: Shut up!
Matt: Her intelligence and charisma become one, cannot cast spells, cannot activate magical items.
Patrick rothfuss: Up top, up top!
Marisha: Oh my god! Oh my god! Oh my god!
Travis: Did that really happen? Did that work?
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: It's permanent, right? For 30 days.
Marisha: She can keep saving from it.
Matt: Yeah, at the end of every 30 days she can repeat the saving throw. (Cheers and yelling.)
Travis: Oh my god, she fell, she fell off.
Taliesin: Holy fuck. That looks painful.
Laura: Are you okay?
Liam: Marisha, what a beautiful moment! Get it, get it!
Taliesin: We've still got problems.
Marisha: We still have problems.
Matt: As you reach out, you watch as the tendrils of nature's energy begin to spill out of the cracks in the vicinity.
Marisha: And I just say, "Melora, come on, girl! Come on, Melora!"
Matt: You watch as Raishan chuckles. One of the tendrils lashes out and wraps around the throat. And as they wrap and begin to strengthen around the neck, pouring into the cracks of the flesh where the disease currently holds her throat, her brow begins to sink, the jaw hangs open, and slobber begins to drip from her jaw as Raishan just, as opposed to speaking, now does a guttural (heavy breaths and growling).
Liam: Poetic justice, motherfucker!
Travis: Still got a dragon. Still got a dragon.
Marisha: She can still attack. "Grog! Grog, get her down!" Is all I can scream before I just, my mind is blown.
Matt: Okay, so is that the end of your turn?
Marisha: And then, panicking--
Matt: You still have a bonus action, right?
Marisha: I do.
Matt: And technically ten more feet of movement.
Marisha: Uh-huh. I'm going to go back towards Allura. Huh?
Matt: All these spells. Cannot use them now.
Liam: That's right, Matt! That's right.
Marisha: (yells) Okay. I'm going to go--
Laura: That's karma for trying to kill Pike while she's not here.
Marisha: Towards Allura, and heal the fuck out of myself.
Travis: You killed one of our gnomes!
Matt: I didn't, the dragon did.
Marisha: I going to do a-- Jesus, I can't speak. I'm going to do a third-level Cure Wounds on myself--
Matt: You can only do up to second level because you cast an eighth-level.
Marisha: I'm sorry. I'm going to do.
Matt: It's a Healing Word, bonus action.
Marisha: Oh right, it's a bonus action. I'm sorry. I will do a second-level Healing Word.
Matt: All right. 2d4 plus six.
Liam: Wow. Wow.
Travis: Wow.
Matt: That brings us to the top. Vax, you're up.
Liam: I'm just going to unload on her.
Matt: Except for, at the end of your turn, actually, going to go ahead and use a legendary action to do a tail attack against you, Percy.
Taliesin: Do I get a reaction against that?
Matt: A reaction?
Taliesin: I can't react to her attack. Okay, she's just going to do a legendary attack against me.
Matt: Yeah.
Taliesin: Okay.
Matt: I mean. That is 23 to hit.
Taliesin: Oh, that hits.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Keyleth is at 28 hit points.
Matt: You take 21 points of bludgeoning damage. All right. Now, what are you doing, Vax?
Liam: I'm unloading, dagger-dagger-dagger.
Matt: Go for it.
Liam: At advantage on all of it. And can I do-- I've got two spells left, so can I do Smite and Smite? Because it just says on melee attacks, it doesn't say how many a round or anything. I don't know, I've never tried to do it.
Matt: No, on each attack you can do Smite, that's fine.
Liam: All right, so. First attack is-- hits, it's 32. Second attack--
Matt: With a melee weapon attack.
Liam: Oh, okay.
Matt: So you have to be up next to her.
Liam: Well, let's just say I Whisper onto her neck.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: He's whispering sweet nothings.
Taliesin: Into her neck?
Marisha: Into her neck.
Laura: Her feeble little mind.
Marisha: Into her feeble mind.
Taliesin: It's called a hickey.
Liam: So that's the first attack, and I get Smite. Second attack is a 27.
Matt: That hits.
Liam: I'm just going to do dagger-dagger, actually.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: And the first attack--
Matt: Neither of these are sharpshooter because they're melee.
Liam: That's all right. I didn't ask for that. So that's one plus eight is nine, plus the psychic damage makes it 12, plus Smite is... 22, plus sneakies. Yes, yes, yes. (counting) 53 is the first attack.
Matt: 53 points of damage.
Travis: Come on, come on.
Laura: Come on!
Liam: Second attack is also getting, okay, so one, just one, okay. Plus five and... eight. All right. And I'm going to use my bonus action to disengage and just leap away from her and just tumble-crash to the ground.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: Does she still have an attack of opportunity against disengagement, or did that legendary action--
Matt: No, disengage doesn't have to. Make an acrobatics check, though.
Liam: Okay.
Taliesin: Well, I'm just curious because I'm going to have a problem in a moment.
Liam: 25.
Matt: 25, you land on both feet without an issue.
Marisha: I got really excited and forgot to roll the damage that Feeblemind does. Which is 4d6 psychic damage.
Matt: Oh. You did.
Marisha: I just got real excited that it worked. I'm sorry.
Travis: You fell off a bench!
Laura: You're going to have a big ol' bump on the back of your head.
Matt: Roll 4d6. Go for it.
Marisha: Okay. It'll be fine. The adrenaline-- I don't feel it right now. 4d6.
Matt: 4d6.
Liam: And I have 60 of movement, so leaping off and rolling, does that use it all up, or can I move against the wall? Just keep going after I disengage from her?
Matt: You can move against the wall and get there.
Liam: Thanks. Tuck and roll.
Taliesin: Technically, wasn't she flanked, too?
Liam: I already get advantage.
Marisha: 13 points of psychic damage.
Matt: No, because you were-- how much?
Marisha: 13.
Matt: 13? All right.
Liam: I got the paladin eyes on her.
Taliesin: Okay.
Matt: All righty. That ends your turn. All right, at the end of her turn she's going to use her last legendary action to attack Percy once more. That is a 27 to hit.
Taliesin: Oh, yeah.
Matt: All right.
Marisha: She's just whaling on you.
Taliesin: I'm the only thing within reach.
Matt: 23 points of bludgeoning damage.
Taliesin: Okay.
Marisha: You're doing okay.
Laura: Jeez, how are you?
Patrick rothfuss: You're pretty good.
Taliesin: I'm fine.
Laura: Oh yeah, he was in the hundreds.
Taliesin: 23 points... 61 right now. I'm at 61. Not wonderful but, you know.
Liam: That is the most perfect, poetic moment.
Marisha: It's like you and Thordak, man.
Liam: Could not have been better.
Matt: All right. Vex, you're up.
Laura: Okay. Using disengage, can you run past them with disengage?
Matt: Yeah, essentially disengage, you go into combat and then you can leave combat without getting an attack of opportunity on you.
Laura: Okay, but I'm already in range of her.
Matt: You are just outside of her range, technically.
Laura: Oh, really?
Matt: Yeah, her reach-- actually, with the tail? No, but she's up in the air. I'll say you're just out of the range of the tail.
Laura: Okay. How far away, if I ran past her, would I be able to get? If I ran to the other side of her.
Matt: You can get just to the side of Kerrek.
Laura: Okay, then I'm just going to back up.
Matt: Okay, so half your movement there to get up from prone, so you can move fifteen more-- you've got three more squares you can move.
Laura: I'm just going to back up into that-- dink dink dink--
Matt: To there?
Laura: Yeah, and I'm going to shoot her.
Matt: Go for it.
Laura: Yeah, I already used blazing bowstring.
Matt: That Feeblemind.
Laura: Okay. 17.
Matt: 17 does not hit, no. Or the arrow hits and it just splinters across the outside of her body.
Laura: Oh my god. I'm just doomed today. 18.
Matt: 18. The second arrow does manage to strike the side of the shoulder, and then the arrow actually breaks against the dragon's hide and scales. That's going to end your turn. You still have a bonus action if you want to do something else.
Laura: I'm going to use-- well, I didn't use disengage.
Matt: You didn't use disengage.
Laura: Well, that's okay, I'll use my bonus action, fuck it, to do Grasping Vine. It's a bonus action.
Matt: All righty. From where and to where?
Laura: From the ground. I'm going to grab Raishan and pull her to the ground.
Matt: Pull her down? Okay. All righty. So Grasping Vine, here, that's going to be a dexterity saving throw.
Laura: Mm-hm.
Matt: That is a five plus nine, that is 14. What is your spell DC?
Laura: 15! (All cheer.)
Matt: All right. So.
Taliesin: Do I get an attack of opportunity on this one?
Matt: No, because it is forced down. Raishan is pulled to the ground there.
Marisha: Like a dog who just peed on the carpet.
Matt: All righty.
Laura: I say, "You stay down, bitch!" And I'm going to go to the bathroom.
Marisha: I am too. (all laugh)
Marisha: I'm going to go too, while she's going.
Liam: In character, in character.
Travis: Leave the Mario way. (Mario sound effects)
Matt: All righty.
Patrick rothfuss: Just out of curiosity, I see there's-- from here, I can see there's plexiglass around there. How close is that, like, the edge of her character to me?
Matt: Right now, she would be ten feet from you.
Patrick rothfuss: Okay.
Matt: All right. That brings us to Percy's turn.
Taliesin: Weird question.
Matt: Yes.
Taliesin: Am I still-- if I try to disengage right now, would I get attacked?
Matt: Yes. You are in melee.
Taliesin: I'm in melee. Okay. That's fine. I'm going to run around, I'm going to hit her with my sword. I'm pulling-- putting the gun away, pulling out the sword, and just taking some shots.
Travis: The Dragonslayer, right?
Taliesin: Yep. Okay. Let's see. The first one definitely missed, which is a 19, did not hit.
Matt: 19 misses, unfortunately. (guttural growling)
Taliesin: 22?
Matt: 22 just hits.
Taliesin: Okay. 22 and the other one is a 28, so I got two shots.
Matt: Yes, so two ones hit.
Taliesin: So let's do the first one, which is...
Travis: You aristocratic bastard.
Taliesin: 22 points of damage plus... 10 points of lightning damage.
Matt: All righty.
Travis: Total of 32.
Taliesin: Total of 32. And the second slash is... 21 points of damage.
Matt: Nice. Okay.
Sam: He was aiming at the eggs, though.
Taliesin: The whole time.
Matt: The entire time. That's perfect.
Taliesin: So I'm... I'm now going to disengage, I'm going to let him take that shot and I'm going to run towards--
Patrick rothfuss: If you can pull her towards us?
Taliesin: We'll see. I'm heading towards the eggs.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: Full speed.
Matt: So as you go rushing, she's going to go ahead and make a claw swipe at you.
Sam: I died again.
Matt: That is--
Patrick rothfuss: (laughs) You died again.
Matt: That is a natural 20.
Taliesin: Okay, that hits.
Matt: Sorry, buddy.
Taliesin: That's okay. I regret nothing.
Liam: No, no, no.
Laura: No, stop it, stop it.
Taliesin: Stop making noises, it's not polite. Stop counting.
Matt: 40 points of piercing damage.
Taliesin: Okay.
Matt: As the claw strikes you from behind.
Travis: So like, retaliated against it?
Matt: So. Where are you going now?
Taliesin: I'm running six spaces towards the eggs and turning around and pulling the gun back out and sitting on the wall like Spiderman, like an angry Spiderman.
Matt: All righty. That ends your turn, Percy?
Taliesin: Anything I can do with my bonus action? No.
Sam: Drink something.
Patrick rothfuss: Before she goes-- because I'm not familiar with the hold action rules. I was waiting around the corner for the dragon to show up.
Matt: Correct. It's not in range to you. The moment the dragon comes into range, you can strike.
Patrick rothfuss: Okay, so that's the deciding factor--
Matt: Correct.
Patrick rothfuss: -- even though she showed up, I can't finish my move that I delayed?
Matt: Unfortunately, with the fifth edition rules, they make it so it's like a quick reaction.
Patrick rothfuss: Okay.
Matt: However, the dragon does fly past to get around the edge to this side here.
Laura: God, she's just going after Percy. She had a crush on you, man.
Taliesin: I... no. She may vaguely remember that I was not cool.
Travis: You tried to kill her, yeah.
Liam: In this state, she's just going to mount you.
Matt: You do get to make your attack as she comes into range, flying past for you.
Patrick rothfuss: Oh, okay. That's all I need, just a chance.
Laura: My hand-dragon's on your shoulder.
Liam: Not like this. Not like this.
Laura: (laughing) Not like this.
Sam: Guys, now that I don't have to play, I'm playing Marvel Puzzle Quest. (all laugh)
Sam: It's addictive!
Laura: Like seriously, Sam has stacked up his binder, he's closed everything like he's getting ready to go.
Marisha: This is sad. This is sad.
Sam: I can't do anything.
Taliesin: No, this is the rest of the day for him, there's nowhere to go for-- yeah.
Liam: Just put your head down on the desk, student.
Taliesin: Think about what you've done.
Marisha: Heads up, seven up.
Liam: Heads up, seven up.
Sam: It was not your fault, Laura. It was Ashley's.
Patrick rothfuss: 20, which is not going to make it, I'm guessing?
Matt: A total of twenty? No, unfortunately.
Laura: (tearfully) I just rolled bad, I'm sorry.
Patrick rothfuss: Mother. Fucker. I miss with both. Got no juice to throw on it either.
Matt: First swing just goes wide, the second one hits the side, but you haven't hit hard ancient dragon hide before, and it scrapes across the outside with no noticeable damage and a little seed of fear wells in your heart once more.
Patrick rothfuss: Yep, that's okay. I got to use these actions that were going to be wasted anyway.
Matt: All right. As Raishan slams down onto the ground--
Patrick rothfuss: Was she holding action alongside me?
Matt: No, she cast a spell to heal you last turn as a bonus action.
Patrick rothfuss: Okay.
Matt: Raishan is going to unleash upon you, Percy, who has avoided the Meteor Swarm, who has shot her in the face, and right now in her feral state is just focused on what's closest and angry at her.
Taliesin: Okay, yeah, all right.
Matt: First strike, that is a 26 to hit.
Taliesin: Oh Jesus, how is this happening?
Matt: With the bite. That is 17 plus eight... 25 points of piercing damage.
Taliesin: Oh, I'm out.
Marisha: Oh no, oh no.
Matt: So you fall to the ground.
Taliesin: Yep.
Marisha: No no no no no.
Travis: Here we go. (clears throat) Jenga?
Matt: So you lose a death save.
Taliesin: I know. Oh, is that lose a death save? I was only a few feet up, it wasn't like a-- it wasn't-- okay. All right.
Matt: You were just a few feet up? As opposed to?
Taliesin: I mean, I was-- yeah.
Liam: I mean, an eight-foot drop on your head is pretty bad.
Taliesin: Yeah, it's pretty bad. I'm taking it.
Patrick rothfuss: You could leave him with one foot stuck to the wall.
Taliesin: Ow. Ow. (all laugh)
Taliesin: Like a punching bag.
Sam: It's going to be Shorthalt and de Rolo in heaven, just--
Taliesin: Oh, it's so cute that you think either of us are going to heaven.
Matt: Going to angrily take a claw attack at your body, which hits, a critical, that's two death saving throws--
Patrick rothfuss: A critical?
Matt: Percy, you're dead.
Taliesin: I'm out.
Matt: As the bite knocks you to the ground, the claw slams down onto your torso, and just tears out the side of your body, your entrails scattered across the stone floor--
Sam: You're up, Laura. Roll good.
Matt: -- and your breath just escapes out. Kerrek, you and Kima both there watch this happen as Percy is now partially spread across the stone immediately to the right of you.
Taliesin: The blood is in fact blue.
Matt: And Raishan gets her legendary actions back. That's going to end Raishan's turn. Grog, you're up.
Travis: Yeah! Grog would like to get up.
Liam: Stand up.
Travis: What does that take for me to do that?
Matt: That's half your movement. 25.
Travis: Half my movement. Can I use the rest of my movement to run towards dragon-dick?
Marisha: Towards dragon-dick?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: 25. That's as far as you can get.
Travis: Can I use the boots of feral leaping to leap even further.
Matt: Make your athletics check.
Travis: Okay.
Laura: Wait a minute, did she even roll to break her Grasping Vine?
Matt: Grasping Vine doesn't keep her restrained, it just grabs somebody and pulls them there, it's meant to move things--
Travis: Natural 20 on that one.
Marisha: Natural 20?
Travis: Yeah, on my leaping. (all laugh)
Marisha: Well, I mean, that's still cool.
Travis: I leap through her chest. Boom!
Liam: Pacman through it?
Travis: Yeah. So I have my three attacks, yes?
Matt: Yes. You're not in melee, you didn't quite get far enough to get--
Travis: Imma have to throw 'em. Reckless, not negated because I can see her now.
Matt: Correct.
Travis: Right. 30.
Matt: Yeah, that'll hit.
Travis: Okay. 23 for the first one.
Matt: 23 damage? All righty.
Travis: The second one I'll make reckless and great weapon master.
Matt: Sure.
Travis: Okay. No, I can't do great weapon master because it's one-handed.
Matt: Yeah, no, well, it's thrown, you can only do it with melee.
Travis: Right. Jesus. 24.
Matt: 24 hits.
Travis: 23 for the second one.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: Piece of shit for the third one. Wait, where's--
Matt: 23, you said?
Travis: 23.
Laura: Does Kima have Revivify, do you think?
Sam: Don't you have two of them?
Travis: Third attack.
Marisha: Maybe, she might. Are you guys out of Revivifies?
Laura: No, Pike has lots more spells.
Taliesin: We've got time.
Travis: 27.
Matt: 27 hits.
Taliesin: In a minute. That's a long time.
Patrick rothfuss: A minute's a long time.
Taliesin: Ten rounds.
Laura: She's got little legs.
Marisha: Matt gets weird about the minute rule. Just keep that in mind. I think the sooner you do it, the easier.
Taliesin: Yeah, I know.
Travis: 26 for the third one.
Taliesin: Matt does get weird about the minute rule, that is also funny.
Sam: Right now, Scanlan's getting fed grapes by little cherubs that are the same size as him. (all laugh)
Sam: And he's like, come on, Percy, we've got red and green grapes.
Matt: All right, that ends your turn, Grog?
Laura: Like, the ultimate punishment for Scanlan is he would show up as a spectral servant in somebody else's mansion?
Sam: Oh god!
Travis: No, the last one I rolled a one on the damage, I reroll ones or twos with that first thing of fighter?
Sam: You want what? Oh. All right.
Matt: That's for the larger weapon. I'll double-check real fast.
Travis: Yeah, I don't remember what the number was, anyway.
Matt: Well, here, just to remind myself. The weapon... a melee weapon you're wielding with two hands, which as you're throwing it, you're not.
Travis: Thank you.
Matt: So no. All right, got it. That ends Grog's turn. Kerrek, you're up.
Patrick rothfuss: Oh please, please just let me, all I want to do is stick at least one on this god damned dragon.
Marisha: Come on, Kerr-bear!
Liam: Yes!
Patrick rothfuss: Okay. So there is 26.
Matt: 26 hits.
Laura: Yeah!
Patrick rothfuss: And a 20. I'm guessing the 20--
Matt: 20 misses, unfortunately.
Patrick rothfuss: Unless this dragon is so surprised that I finally made a successful attack. (all laugh)
Matt: No, unfortunately, the feral angry unintelligible state of Raishan right now as just a beast, no. Not surprised. Instinct now.
Patrick rothfuss: So I'm going to burn my second-level spell for Smite and she is not anything that is specifically affected by Doomhammer here? She's not undead technically or--
Matt: No.
Patrick rothfuss: Just regular old evil?
Matt: Yeah.
Patrick rothfuss: Okay.
Marisha: Regular old evil.
Taliesin: She's just awful.
Marisha: Classic evil.
Patrick rothfuss: Just... just bad. So that's ten... 18... one more. 28.
Matt: 28 points of damage?
Patrick rothfuss: 28.
Travis: She dies suddenly. A cardiac arrest.
Matt: At a max hit points of 520... How do you want to do this? (Screaming and cheering.)
Matt: Literally had seven hit points left. As far as my math goes, yeah.
Liam: Level seven!
Matt: I can't fucking believe-- I can't fucking believe that happened!
Laura: Kerrek just like leveled up to like...
Matt: So. How do you want to do this?
Laura: Oh my god.
Marisha: Oh my god, Kerrek!
Matt: The feral beast there, tearing the innards out of Percy on the ground, Grog slamming into it, just seemingly bashing against the world, watching everyone drop around you like flies, your warhammer in hand.
Patrick rothfuss: What I would like to do is step over to be over his body, and it's like, no, no further. And as the dragon is coming in, just trying to mindlessly claw at this poor destroyed corpse... I like to think of the anime slow-mo strike, where the hammer comes back and it slows down and then when it connects you get the big starburst. Wow, okay.
Matt: As the hammer arcs downward (slow-mo sound effects). It just slams into the snout of Raishan just as the head turns up, the eyes that were once reptilian and intelligent are now just filled with bloodshot rage and feral intensity. The jaw is attempting to snap up and catch the blade, however, you're too fast. Your old adventuring reflexes are kicking in. As the glowing hammerhead comes down onto the snout, the divine energy blasts forward, and you watch as the dragon's face explodes, inverting inward, the front of the skull being blown backward, and you guys watch as this flash of light fills the entirety of this necrotic space. This one plume of radiant smoke kind of pssssh. And left behind, you see Kerrek standing there, holding the rod, the actual head of the hammer now dismissed as part of the burst of radiant energy, and there the smoking ruin of the throat, headless, of Raishan the Diseased Deceiver, collapsing to the ground, unmoving. And we're going to take a quick break. Take a break, and we're going to take a little time to take in the aftermath of this moment before we finish tonight's episode. So we'll be back here in a few minutes, we're going to go ahead and use the restroom. We'll see you guys here shortly.
Travis: Oh my god!
Marisha: Holy shit! [BREAK]
Matt: And welcome back. So. Last we left off, the battle with Raishan ended with a victory for Vox Machina but at a rather high cost at the moment. As you stand now in the still silence, the aftermath of the fray, looking down, seeing your allies beaten, bruised, disheveled, Scanlan lifeless on the ground on one side of this cavern, and a partially gutted Percy lifeless on the other, the smoldering ruin that was once the head of Raishan lifeless and still on the ground as Kerrek clutches the hammer. Kima walks over and grabs your shoulder and tightly squeezes it, going, "You did what had to be done. Thank you."
Patrick rothfuss: I mean, I've been around, I can't help him, can I?
Matt: "I think he's beyond either of our power now. Allie? Please tell me she's alive." And Kima runs off, realizing that she doesn't really know the status of the rest of the group. Allura shouts out to her on the side.
Laura: What's happening?
Matt: I'm all right!
Patrick rothfuss: I get down there, and I'm doing, I'm doing useless combat triage.
Matt: Trying to gather what you--
Patrick rothfuss: You do what you can.
Matt: What's outside, putting it back in. Yeah.
Patrick rothfuss: And I've-- yeah.
Laura: Vax?
Liam: Yeah.
Laura: Are you up?
Liam: Yeah. Yeah.
Laura: Good. Percival? How are you?
Marisha: Sound off if you're alive.
Travis: Alive.
Liam: I start stumbling over towards Scanlan.
Marisha: Percy.
Laura: "Percy?" I go running around the corner.
Marisha: Same.
Matt: As you guys both kind of run, Keyleth a bit behind, Vex, you turn and you see Raishan's corpse just piled, and then on the ground you see Kerrek slowly and methodically, almost staring off into a memory, trying to gather a bit of Percival's scattered innards from the side torn open.
Laura: "No. No!" And I run over to him. "Help him! Pike!"
Matt: Pike comes running around the corner. "Oh, God." And she runs up real fast and begins gathering her Revivify spell.
Travis: Wh-where's Scanlan?
Liam: I pick him up. I start walking towards Grog with him.
Matt: Did either of you guys want to roll for Pike's Revivify?
Liam: On Percy?
Laura: On Percy.
Matt: Percival, yeah.
Travis: Do you want Matt to do this, so that there's no--
Laura: I--
Liam: I'll do it. I don't want you to have-- I don't want you to-- get out of your head, I'll do it, I'll do it. I'll do it. It's just dice. It's the universe. That's low.
Laura: Oh, no. Is that a five?
Liam: Plus six.
Laura: Plus what? It's not going to work.
Matt: Six plus five?
Laura: Eleven.
Matt: Percival has died... how many times?
Laura: I don't know.
Marisha: Once.
Matt: I think just once for him, right?
Liam: The big one.
Marisha: It works. It works. It's just enough. It's just enough.
Travis: Wait, how many times has he died?
Matt: We're double-checking. Taliesin.
Travis: Taliesin, how many times have you died?
Taliesin: Does the necklace count, or does the necklace not count?
Matt: The necklace does not count.
Taliesin: Once. As far as I can remember.
Laura: 'Cause the necklace just instantly bamfed him back.
Matt: Yeah, similar to the effect earlier.
Liam: Yeah, it's a shield.
Marisha: Oh, come on, come on.
Patrick rothfuss: If that's going on, I've got like 30 points of Lay on Hands just that I have not had a chance to use, and I'm probably not in great shape. I'm probably going to be trying to use it even though I know better.
Matt: So as you're trying to grab the body and trying to make it form, it's not-- it's not doing anything and the healing magic is not taking effect into the now-still cold body. As Pike's metallic hand comes into your visual frame, Kerrek, you watch in that slow breathless motion as her gauntleted arm reaches down and touches the clavicle of the bloody mess of Percy's torso. And as the divine energy pulses warmth once more through the chest, you watch as the bits of exposed organ that you had pushed in close over with skin. (breathes) And breath comes back to Percival's body. You come to consciousness. Barely.
Taliesin: Quick question.
Matt: Yes.
Taliesin: Okay, just checking. Okay. Good to know.
Laura: I just kiss-kiss-kiss-kiss, tears-tears-tears-tears.
Taliesin: Oh, that's nice.
Laura: Welcome back. Don't look down, you're a bloody mess.
Taliesin: (panicked laughter) Oh. Is this mine?
Marisha: No?
Taliesin: Okay. I'm going to pass out.
Travis: Are we all here, then?
Liam: Grog!
Laura: Scanlan was down.
Marisha: Scanlan's down.
Travis: I take off running for Vax.
Matt: Okay. As you turn around the corner--
Liam: I've got him in my arms.
Matt: Kima and Allura are rushing up to you now as well. "Is he--" And you turn the corner, Grog, and you see Vax holding the still body of Scanlan, just dangling out of his arms.
Travis: No. No. No! Fix him! FIX HIM!
Liam: I just start to rock him like a child.
Travis: Well, somebody do something.
Taliesin: We have to take him home.
Marisha: We have to get him out of here.
Travis: Well, we got all these people with magic, you've all got magic spells, you just brought him back. Fix him!
Laura: Pike looks at Kima. "Can you do anything?"
Matt: This is-- this is beyond any of my capabilities. I-- look, I have a certain skillset, and it's not this kind of skillset, I'm sorry.
Marisha: Vax, the Raven Queen. You can talk to her, right? Vax?
Travis: I mean, what do we need? Do we need, like--
Marisha: Okay. We have to get him out of here, because this place sucks.
Taliesin: We need to take him somewhere. To the temple. And we need to find his daughter.
Marisha: Um, okay. Question. Oh, you didn't kill anything, did you, Vex? There's no, like Fenthras-trees?
Laura: No.
Marisha: There's no trees?
Matt: No trees.
Laura: Can Allura do--
Matt: Allura says, "I do have a teleport spell I can utilize. Gather everyone around."
Taliesin: I'm going to drop the gate stone that we have right in this room. I'm just going to leave it here.
Liam: You know, you're very funny, but this is not very funny.
Taliesin: I'm coming back here to dissect that monster once we're done.
Marisha: That's fair. Okay, let's save our friend.
Matt: "All right. Let's all of us gather our hands together." She puts her hands out, Kima takes one side, and you all form a circle.
Taliesin: I am lying down to do this, but yes.
Matt: She closes her eyes. She begins the incantation under her breath.
Travis: Why did he roll?
Laura: Why is she rolling?
Matt: There's a brief flux of arcane energy, and then it fades and you all remain in place.
Travis: Fuck.
Marisha: No.
Matt: She goes, "Um."
Marisha: What's wrong?
Matt: I don't know, something is-- something is barring my--
Patrick rothfuss: It's this place. The dragon said that there were features to this place.
Marisha: Oh, fuck. We don't have--
Patrick rothfuss: Kerrek has no affect in his voice.
Travis: We have to get out of here.
Patrick rothfuss: Up and out.
Marisha: Up and out. Up and out?
Laura: Pike's going to cast Detect Magic and see where it's coming from. Can she see if it's coming from anywhere?
Matt: Okay, she casts Detect Magic. There are a number of magical sources in this room. There are a few vials on the back shelf, some of which appear to have been broken and scattered on the ground, and the magic is fading. There is one book that is actually in a chest that she goes and partially opens, there is a book inside that is emanating some magical essence. There is the doorway across the way. But there is just a general magical presence, like a faint magical energy everywhere in here.
Marisha: Which doorway across the way?
Matt: On the far end.
Patrick rothfuss: There is a doorway.
Travis: Oh, there is?
Marisha: I run over to inspect it.
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Marisha: Try and get us out of here. Perception?
Matt: Investigation.
Marisha: Oh, jesus fuck.
Taliesin: What hit points am I at right now?
Marisha: Seven.
Matt: Seven. The door looks like-- the door doesn't look like it's particularly intricate.
Marisha: Trapped or anything?
Matt: It looks like it's locked or chained by something.
Marisha: Vax, can you check for traps?
Liam: Grog.
Travis: Yeah.
Laura: I'm going to third-level Cure Wounds you.
Liam: Take him, take him.
Taliesin: What am I at right now?
Laura: You're probably at one.
Taliesin: Okay, that'll do.
Laura: So I'm going to Cure Wounds on you.
Liam: All right. I head over to where Keyleth is and start looking for traps.
Patrick rothfuss: Can I Lay on Hands with him once he's back?
Matt: You can now, okay.
Liam: I'm going to use my last Luck of the day.
Patrick rothfuss: So I can give you-- I'll give you 30.
Taliesin: Thank you.
Liam: I just used my last Luck of the day and I got two ones.
Matt: Two ones.
Marisha: Are you fucking serious?
Matt: The door seems, not trapped, but it appears to be chained or locked from the other side.
Travis: Fuck that shit. Titanstone Knuckles. I'm going through the door.
Matt: All right.
Liam: Give him back, give him back.
Matt: All right. Roll a strength check.
Travis: With advantage. That's good. 26.
Liam: But it's not trapped, I checked it.
Laura: 24.
Matt: 26. (punching sounds) You start slamming your fists against the door, and as it splinters and then breaks inward, and then outward, and rocks just start tumbling outward, where once was the door in this vicinity here now appears to be a cave-in on the opposite side.
Marisha: Augh. I do my Stone Shape and I just punch the walls and try and blast a hole through the fallen rubble with Stone Shape.
Matt: Okay. As you slam through, you smash a cylindrical space in, and it just meets more rock. You get the sense that whatever chamber was beyond this room--
Marisha: Is just a cave-in.
Matt: -- has just caved in.
Taliesin: I'm going to say something awful. Put him in the bag of colding. It's not like he's breathing. It will keep him safe. Let's gather what we can. We have to walk out of here. There's no other way.
Laura: Pike looks at the book that's emanating magic. Does it look like it's an evil book at all?
Matt: It has a sinister look to it. It is ancient, the leather itself is darkened not by initial color but by just weather, age. It has a very, very deep leathery-brown burgundy tint to it. It has ancient brass inlays, and it is locked shut on one side.
Laura: Pike's going to take off her scarf and throw it over it and try to cover it and wrap it up in cloth.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: And ask Grog to put it in the bag of holding and wonder if that'll make the magic go away.
Travis: Sure.
Taliesin: I'm also just going to grab Grog really quickly and just scrape as much stuff off the shelves into the bags because we need to know what this shit is.
Matt: Okay. So you grab a number of the tomes. A number of them were destroyed from the impact of the Meteor Swarm, but the one-- you get a number of tomes in there, you get some odds and ends, some trinkets, some bones, some other things that're around the territory. And that all seems to go in fine.
Marisha: Keyleth goes over to the corpse of Raishan. She takes the staff of Melora and shoves it down into her corpse. Just to see if any reaction happens.
Matt: Okay. The staff slams into the flesh, one of the exposed wounds on the side of Raishan's body. As it sinks in, the staff seems to right itself in a standing position. You let go instinctually, and you watch as the remaining visual of the black disease that had begun to spread across the body spreads rapidly across the entire body of Raishan. What remains of green scale turns to black, and very very quickly the corpse begins to wither and blacken and then turn to this rippled, fleshy husk. The staff disengages and falls to the ground, clattering against the stone, seeming that the remainder of the disease completed its cycle.
Marisha: I just say, "That was for Scanlan from the Ashari. Bitch."
Taliesin: I'm going to... Grog, help me pile all of the dragon remains into a pile. The eggs. Everything. I need a pile. We're going to try and remove anything useful, especially of the eggs. Anything to know what they were. But I don't want to take the whole thing, I don't want to leave anything. We're going to burn it. We're going to burn it all.
Laura: I take the gate stone and put it back.
Taliesin: Thank you.
Patrick rothfuss: Knock out these pillars, it'll cave this whole thing in.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: I still want to burn it, but yeah.
Matt: As you, Kerrek, walk toward one of the edges of the pillars there, there is a flash on the ground, a magical glyph or a symbol of some kind that triggers, and your body is immediately wracked with horrible pain. I need you to make a constitution saving throw.
Taliesin: Jesus.
Laura: Let's not walk around this place anymore.
Patrick rothfuss: 11.
Matt: 11.
Patrick rothfuss: No no no, wait wait wait, with constitution I get...
Matt: I'll make sure it's constitution.
Patrick rothfuss: Plus seven. 15. 18. I probably should've been making some of these saving throws by adding the right numbers to them.
Liam: Eh, that's D&D, man.
Taliesin: It's math-lite.
Matt: Let me see and make sure it was the right one. Yeah, okay. So as the excruciating pain takes over, you instinctually start screaming as your muscles lock up and you are unable to move. You guys all look over suddenly as Kerrek is just locked in place, all the muscles pulled into this tense moment, just screaming in place.
Travis: Kerr?
Marisha: What is he grabbing onto? Is he grabbing onto something?
Matt: Nothing. He just walked toward one of the pillars--
Taliesin: And hit a glyph.
Matt: In the central area here.
Taliesin: Someone shove him off.
Laura: I'm going to use my Rope of Entanglement and grab him.
Matt: Okay. You pull him off, the glyph still remains glowing in place, and he clatters to the ground, still locked up. You don't even see color or shape right now, it's just white from the pain that is wracking your body. You are unable to move, make conscious thought. You are purely a primal entity that is suffering right now.
Travis: Can you smash glyphs?
Liam: I walk over, I'm going to try--
Patrick rothfuss: Actually, it's not much-- this is almost better than what I had before. (all laugh)
Liam: I kneel down and try Lay on Hands on him, because it can cure multiple diseases and cure poisons with a single use.
Matt: Okay. So you spend five of your hit points.
Liam: Sure, five.
Matt: Doesn't seem to assuage him. Almost biting through his tongue. Allura immediately looks over and is going to attempt to dispel.
Liam: Is he cursed?
Matt: Which succeeds, actually, she rolled a 15 plus-- so. The pain subsides immediately, and she puts her hood back up. As your breath begins to regulate--
Taliesin: Let's get out of here.
Marisha: What was that?
Matt: Dragon left a symbol.
Marisha: A symbol?
Matt: Don't worry about it, it's gone now. Just do not touch that for the next ten minutes.
Taliesin: I'm going to quickly search Scanlan's body for his wand.
Travis: Of Fireballs, or--?
Taliesin: Yeah. I'm going to shoot some Fireballs in here when we're on our way out.
Marisha: You're going to burn it to the ground?
Taliesin: I'm going to burn it to the fucking ground.
Marisha: I can help you with that.
Taliesin: Thank you.
Matt: As can I.
Marisha: As we leave, we help burn this motherfucker to the ground.
Matt: All right. As you guys begin to walk out, the three of you, between your staff, your wand, and Allura's preparation, you guys just (fire, explosion sounds). And you watch as elements of the stonework begin to fall into itself and collapse. Not enough to the point where it causes a full cave-in to be endangering to you, but you ensure that this space is no longer used for whatever purpose it was being used for. You guys continue back out to the edge of the chasm where the bridge is currently--
Patrick rothfuss: The bridge got snapped, didn't it?
Matt: It did, yeah.
Taliesin: But the gravity is off.
Patrick rothfuss: Now the gravity's regular.
Matt: Yes.
Liam: We can ferry back and forth on the carpet.
Laura: Yeah, ferry on the carpet and the broom.
Matt: Okay. You get across without issue.
Laura: Pike casts Light on her mace so that it's a nicely lit thing, it's not all creepy and dark.
Matt: All right. You guys make your way across the chasm. You can still hear below, and occasionally as you glance down as the light opens the area below, you can see the masses of writhing bodies that are all reaching up from below, but with no magical gravitational trap in effect, they have no effect and are kept at a distance. You make your way across, heading back towards the spiral staircase upwards. The glyph--
Marisha: Avoiding all that stairs-trap stuff.
Matt: Yeah, the glyph is still dispelled from earlier. You guys still make your way up in sections using your-- the broom and the magic carpet. As you make your way up into the next chamber, you begin to hear cackling laughter.
Marisha: Are these the fucking ghostrider skulls again?
Matt: You hear (cackling) from ahead, and you see a little bit of a light source begin to appear from the iron door room that you guys had your first encounter with--
Marisha: Are they all just like right down--
Matt: They're not quite in sight yet. You can just see the glow as they're descending down a grade.
Marisha: And we're kind of in a hallway, right?
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: Are they technically undead?
Liam: Yes.
Laura: Then Pike's going to use her-- Yeah, she's going to use Turn Undead on those motherfuckers.
Marisha: Yes.
Matt: Okay. Looking at the radius of Turn Undead. I'll just double-check here, because it's pretty close.
Liam: Destroy Undead.
Patrick rothfuss: If she's got it.
Matt: It would be Destroy Undead at fifth level, which she has. But yeah. It's 30 feet near you. So she can wait.
Laura: But they can shoot Fireballs, so maybe that's not smart.
Taliesin: I'll actually say, the second that we see them, I'm just going to empty the wand.
Patrick rothfuss: It's fire, though.
Laura: Yeah.
Taliesin: Oh, will they just be fine?
Marisha: Yeah, they're immune to fire. We need radiant damage.
Laura: I'm going to just shoot them with arrows and try to get them from far away, I guess.
Matt: All right. So you guys are holding your action for when they come into range, essentially.
Marisha: Can I see them yet?
Patrick rothfuss: Is this like a straight tunnel, a straight featureless tunnel heading towards us?
Matt: It's a slow grade downward. You guys are heading back up the pathway, and you see them now coming in your direction.
Taliesin: Can I just unload on them, I suppose?
Matt: Once they come into range.
Travis: Is it all four of them?
Matt: You're not sure.
Patrick rothfuss: We just can't clump like we were before.
Marisha: I've got a Sunbeam ready to go.
Taliesin: Oh, well.
Laura: Well, yours has a probably good range on it.
Marisha: 60 foot. But I want to get them in a line.
Laura: I've got 120 feet on my bow.
Taliesin: I've got disgusting range.
Matt: All right, so you guys, hearing the cackling and seeing the glow coming, you hold your actions. You're holding your bow, you're holding a Sunbeam, you're holding your attacks.
Marisha: I'm going to line them up.
Matt: That would give you guys immediate action as soon as they arrive. So. Sure enough, within a moment you watch as four of them come into view, the same four that you destroyed earlier, clustered around. There's two lines of two, essentially. So.
Travis: Do they regenerate?
Laura: So I'm going to do--
Travis: They just grow back? Like, we shattered two of 'em.
Marisha: I have a feeling there's a bunch of these guys.
Travis: Fuck.
Matt: So, Keyleth. Sunbeam can only affect two of them. So they get their saving throw, right? Roll 8d6, if you could. They... (laughs) they do not make their saving throws.
Marisha: That's right. Five, six, need two more.
Taliesin: What do you need?
Marisha: d6s.
Taliesin: That's a lot of whiskey.
Marisha: (counting) 27 radiant damage.
Matt: 27 radiant damage to both of them. All righty. Got you. All right. Percival?
Taliesin: I'm going to try doing a sharpshooter piercing shot on another round of them with the Pepperbox. Sharpshooter piercing shot.
Laura: Pike's going to do Sacred Flame on them, too.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: That's not bad. So that's-- the first shot is--
Marisha: It's good.
Taliesin: 16.
Matt: Hits.
Taliesin: Oh, then they all hit. That's good. So that's 1d10 plus 1d6, so 1d10 plus 1d6. And this is piercing shot so it's the enemy line, so. Wow. That's nice. That's-- I have no brain. 27 points of damage, with five points of psychic damage for the first shot.
Matt: Okay, so 19 total. They appear-- the blasts of the bullets don't seem to be doing as much damage as other forms of attack.
Taliesin: Okay, but it's hitting both of them in a row.
Matt: Right. Yeah.
Taliesin: Next shot is-- ha! Is 28 points of damage with four points of psychic.
Matt: Okay, this is the ones she damaged with the Sunbeam?
Taliesin: Mm-hm.
Matt: Both of those skulls just (explosion sound). As soon as the beam streaks past, blasting into two of them, two piercing shots in a row, you can watch as their eyes begin to glow, flames glowing within the back of the skull. Two of them immediately just scatter into dust and bone. The two on the other side.
Taliesin: I still have one last shot, so. Let's do slightly less that time. 20 points of damage with one point of psychic.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: And that's my contribution to the world.
Matt: All right.
Laura: Pike does Sacred Flame.
Matt: What level?
Laura: She's a 17th level cleric now.
Matt: Right, but what spell level?
Laura: It's a cantrip.
Matt: Oh, that's right.
Laura: So it's just 4d8 damage.
Matt: Okay, yeah.
Taliesin: 4d8 radiant?
Laura: Mm-hm, 4d8 radiant damage. Oh yeah, that's good. 22 radiant damage. They have to do a dexterity saving throw.
Matt: Nope.
Laura: Cool. So one of them takes 22 damage.
Matt: Nice.
Laura: I'm going to do the one that Percy just hit.
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: I hit both of them.
Laura: Oh. Well, there's four of them.
Taliesin: Two are down, the other two are damaged.
Laura: Cool, well, she chooses one. And then I'm going to, as Vex, shoot arrows at them.
Matt: Go for it.
Laura: That doesn't hit because the world hates me tonight. And that one hits.
Matt: All right.
Laura: 17 damage.
Matt: All righty. 17 to the one that's over there. Allura, who is frustrated and understanding what their resistances are, she's going to go ahead and cast a high-level Magic Missile.
Taliesin: Classic.
Matt: Okay. That one just explodes and scatters, so now there is one left that is just partially damaged from Percival.
Patrick rothfuss: Are they within 30 feet?
Matt: Not quite yet.
Patrick rothfuss: Then I leave the ring of invisibility off, and I just charge.
Matt: You just charge in?
Patrick rothfuss: I'm heading toward them, because if they hit me and I'm far enough away, it won't hit the whole group.
Matt: Okay. As you go rushing in, that triggers them-- or the one that's remaining to go ahead, and it's going to fire two Fire Rays at you.
Marisha: Fire Rays?
Matt: That is 20 to hit?
Patrick rothfuss: Yes it will.
Matt: And 24 to hit.
Patrick rothfuss: That one won't, strangely enough. No, it did. (all laugh)
Matt: That would be strange.
Marisha: I want that class.
Matt: That is 13 points of fire damage on one.
Patrick rothfuss: Okay.
Matt: And seven points of fire damage on the other.
Patrick rothfuss: I will take that.
Matt: All right. You watch as both eyes streak out these burning rays of flame in his direction. Both blast him in the shoulder, one hits him in the side of the knee and thigh, but Kerrek keeps running forward. You can go ahead and make your attacks if you want.
Patrick rothfuss: 19.
Matt: Hits.
Patrick rothfuss: And-- actually, that's way better than 19, I'm counting dumb. This is 18.
Matt: 18 hits.
Patrick rothfuss: Okay. So for the first one, I'm going to burn one for Divine Smite.
Matt: All righty.
Patrick rothfuss: And these are undead.
Matt: Yes they are.
Patrick rothfuss: Eight... eh. 11. 17. 25.
Matt: 25 for both hits? That's the first one.
Patrick rothfuss: The first hit.
Matt: All right, so do the second hit now.
Patrick rothfuss: And that doesn't do it? Just to make sure I didn't kill it with the first one?
Matt: It doesn't destroy it, no.
Patrick rothfuss: Okay, then the second one--
Matt: It does crack the skull and you watch as the sutures cave in from below, the light of your hammer still--
Laura: These are hardy skulls.
Patrick rothfuss: Right, and 12... 22... 23... 31. All radiant.
Matt: 31, that'll do it. With that, the first blow knocks it almost to the ground. As it begins to lift up again, its mouth (cackling), you hit it with the side of the hammer, and it just scatters into broken bone chunks and shards that splatter against the wall and rattle down the grade a bit towards your direction as Kerrek turns around, looking back over his shoulder at you guys, the pathway now clear ahead of you.
Patrick rothfuss: It's matter-of-fact, there was no serpentine, it was like-- and then it was just cutting wood.
Matt: Yeah. You guys continue forward. You make your way to the chamber with the iron door, still open, eventually walking to the outskirts of the entranceway to the sanctum. You now walk carefully around the previously noticed patches of dirt and sand.
Laura: Oh, I grab those immovable rods when we get out of there.
Matt: Right. And as you pull them out, it seals the tunnel once more behind you.
Liam: Let's find a tree.
Travis: Yeah, how do we go?
Marisha: Allura, do you have any more teleportations left?
Matt: No, that was the one.
Marisha: Let's find a big ol' tree, then. I'll burn my seventh-level spell.
Liam: Do we see any trees? Everything was dead the closer we got to the central--
Marisha: We have to get to a living tree that we can all fit through.
Matt: Actually, she goes, "I do have a teleportation circle, so I may be able to bring us to Emon."
Marisha: Do we want to go to Emon or anywhere else?
Laura: We can go to Greyskull Keep.
Travis: Why, what's there?
Marisha: Can you get us to Greyskull Keep, or at least the--
Travis: We need something that'll get Scanlan. What's the quickest--
Laura: Sarenrae's temple.
Travis: Is at Greyskull Keep, or--
Laura: I mean, that's where our chapel is in our house.
Marisha: Pike and I have a little temple, yeah.
Travis: Oh, right.
Matt: That's one of the few teleportation sigils that still exist, in that vicinity at least.
Travis: Yeah, do it, do it. Yeah.
Marisha: If it doesn't work at Sarenrae's temple, I can use a treestride to get us elsewhere. Let's get to Greyskull Keep.
Matt: "All right." She gets down and begins marking out the symbol on the ground on the outskirts. She finishes, you watch the arcane flash.
Travis: No. No. No.
Matt: She steps onto the circle and vanishes. The teleportation circle. And Kima's about to go behind her, and Kima goes, "I don't... it doesn't usually look like that."
Marisha: What? Allura didn't vanish, did she?
Matt: Allura stepped onto it after casting it and then vanished. There was a weird sparkle of electrical energy.
Travis: What do you mean, it doesn't look like that normally?
Matt: I don't know. I don't know!
Marisha: Do we follow or do something else?
Laura: I don't understand. No, Kima!
Marisha: Kima!
Matt: And Kima just walks in after her. Sparks once more.
Laura: Does anybody know what the fuck--
Travis: What did that mean?
Laura: What was that supposed to look like? What it was supposed to look like?
Marisha: Can we do some sort of check?
Patrick rothfuss: I don't know arcane.
Marisha: I don't either.
Laura: (tearfully) Scanlan does.
Marisha: (tearfully) Scanlan does. He would know.
Matt: You can make an arcana check.
Taliesin: I'd love to make an arcana check.
Marisha: For Scanlan!
Patrick rothfuss: I'll roll the bones in case it's a religious thing.
Laura: I mean, as perception thing, if we've seen a teleportation circle before, would we at least know that it doesn't look like it's supposed to?
Marisha: (yells) Nothing. I don't know shit.
Taliesin: 22.
Matt: 22?
Taliesin: Yep.
Matt: As you get closer and look at it-- you've seen a few teleportation circles, and once they're down they just kind of glow with this mild energy until they dissipate. Which is pretty rapid. Let's see here.
Travis: We need those two, right, to do what we need to do. We have to go with them.
Taliesin: We don't.
Laura: We don't.
Marisha: I can get us there via tree. If we need to. There's a tree in Sarenrae's--
Travis: You'd better be right. If we leave those two behind.
Matt: Yeah, it only lasts for a round, so it's--
Taliesin: Six seconds.
Matt: Yeah, six seconds.
Laura: So we have to make this decision stat?
Matt: Now.
Laura: But what if it took them somewhere--
Matt: You glancing at it, there is a flicker to it and weird (crackling), very similar to the weird flash that you saw when you were inside and attempted the original teleportation. There's something-- you get the sense that there's something about this-- either this mountain or this underground area, there's something that has some sort of influence or impact on any sort of transportation magic.
Marisha: Who knows where they just got teleported to?
Patrick rothfuss: Or if they ended up anywhere at all.
Travis: Do we need them?
Liam: I mean, the amount of talking we're doing, it's already closed at this point.
Matt: It's gone.
Laura: Oh my god.
Marisha: Fuck.
Travis: Go find a tree. We all start running.
Marisha: No no no.
Taliesin: No.
Marisha: Yeah, we find a tree, we find a tree.
Taliesin: We go to the beach and we find a tree. We get as far away from this cave.
Patrick rothfuss: As far away.
Liam: Yes.
Laura: What if-- where did they just go? What if we just sent them to some plane of existence?
Marisha: I don't know. I can try to scry on them. I can try and scry on them and see, but that's going to take time.
Travis: Yeah, yeah, now.
Taliesin: One crisis at a time.
Liam: We just start walking. Grog and I start walking.
Taliesin: We start walking to the beach.
Marisha: Can I scry while we're walking?
Matt: The ritual requires you--
Taliesin: The ball.
Laura: What about the ball?
Marisha: Can I get a piggyback from Grog and scry while we're walking?
Taliesin: On the carpet.
Laura: Yeah, on the carpet.
Matt: You could probably try that. I'd give you a concentration check to maintain it for the duration.
Marisha: Let's do it, let's do it.
Taliesin: I'm going to take a rest on the carpet and I'm going to fly the carpet while you do your thing.
Travis: Vax and I are still walking.
Marisha: I'm going to cast-- I haven't burned any fifth-level spells, I'm going to scry.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Pike's going to cast healing on people.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: She might want to save-- well. We'll see. Seems like we know where--
Matt: Okay.
Patrick rothfuss: Whoever's low. I know some people are pretty low.
Marisha: I'm really low.
Laura: Everybody's low, super low.
Matt: You guys slowly make your way through the forest, avoiding the patches that you noticed before, the weird collapsing earth.
Marisha: I'm just laying back on the carpet in a trust-state as they guide me.
Matt: Go ahead and make a constitution saving throw, Keyleth.
Marisha: Just straight constitution?
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: 15.
Matt: 15, okay.
Marisha: No no no, 17. Plus five.
Matt: What are you focusing on?
Marisha: Allura.
Matt: Allura? Okay.
Marisha: Oh no. Oh no.
Matt: Okay. So. You focus on Allura's life force, form, face, and as you close your eyes, slowly moving along with the gradual movement of the flying carpet, your vision pulls out of you and above. An island. It then shifts suddenly and pulls you over blue. Over water. And then there's another flash, and there's nothing but water around you. You don't know where you are, you don't know where it is, and it flashes once more. And there in the center of this open expanse of water and ocean, you see two figures swimming. And you glance down and there in the middle of the ocean waters you see Allura treading water, shouting Kima's name. "Kima!" And looking across the way, you can just barely hear in the distance, "Allie, I'm coming!" She swims over in that direction. They eventually grab each other's hands and together hold each other and look around, keeping treading water, as the sun is slowly beginning to set in the distance and nightfall comes. You just see Allura holding her there, trying to keep both aloft. "It's all right. We're alive. I don't know where we are. But we'll figure this out. We'll figure this out." And they both begin swimming, looking at the direction of the sun and picking what looks to be a northern position. And then the scry--
Marisha: Do I see any land, is there an island?
Matt: You cannot see-- the scrying is specifically on her. But they are both just plopped somewhere in the ocean.
Laura: If we would've gone through...
Taliesin: We would've been in trouble.
Liam: Drowning.
Laura: Well no, we have the fucking magic carpet.
Taliesin: That can't hold all of us.
Laura: Oh my god.
Marisha: I tell them what happened when I wake up. I don't even know where they could be. They're in the middle of the ocean, they could be right off the coast or hundreds of miles from here. This ocean...
Taliesin: This is fine. We're going to go to Whitestone now, we're not going to go to Greyskull, and we're going to get Gilmore's help.
Liam: Gilmore, yes.
Marisha: But they're our friends, are we just going to leave them behind?
Taliesin: We're going to get Gilmore's help.
Travis: One thing at a time.
Liam: That's right. That's right.
Marisha: I mean. Keyleth starts hyperventilating, panicking a little bit.
Laura: Keyleth. We need you right now.
Marisha: They're okay, right? Allura will figure it out, right?
Laura: She'll figure it out. She's so powerful.
Liam: Yeah.
Marisha: Okay.
Liam: One thing at a time.
Marisha: This is taking everything to not stay here. Okay.
Travis: Still moving towards the beach, looking for live trees.
Matt: A short time later, you eventually get close to the edge of the waterline, and you do find a handful of trees that appear to be alive enough and large enough to maintain one of your spells.
Marisha: I do a useless scan of the ocean out of desperation to see if I see anything.
Matt: Perception check.
Taliesin: I'll join.
Laura: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Marisha: Natural 20.
Laura: (gasps)
Marisha: It's true. It was a Gil dice, it was Gil's dice. You can see, you can see.
Matt: And add your perception bonus?
Marisha: 31.
Matt: 31.
Marisha: Perception's 11.
Matt: You take a moment, and you don't know if it's the sense of the scry spell and something about the arcane winds that blow through the ley lines of magic that traverse across Exandria, but something guides your attention that way, and you focus real hard, and you see just at the horizon what looks to be a very, very faint speck of movement.
Travis: Shut the fuck up.
Marisha: There they are! Oh, shit--
Laura: I take off on the broom.
Marisha: I don't know if that's them, I think that's them!
Taliesin: No, wait.
Patrick rothfuss: Kerrek puts his hand on her shoulder and says, "Oh, child."
Laura: I take off on the broom, I'm out. In the direction that she went.
Patrick rothfuss: Wishing doesn't make it so.
Marisha: No, I know. I know, but look! Look! There's something. It could be something else, but it's something.
Taliesin: Keyleth--
Laura: Yeah, I'm going, I'm going. I went.
Matt: You, arcing as fast as you can on the broom, full speed, holding on to the hat as best you can. The wind of the ocean air coming past your face, the salt and the briny spray of bits of reef and rock that surround the island--
Marisha: I'm trying to give Vex over the earpiece like a, Warmer, warmer, warmer, colder, a little-- ten degrees to your left.
Matt: Yeah, you do look out and you see both Kima and Allura swimming through the ocean, exhausted and it looks like, based on both the heavy armor that Kima's wearing and their general physical state, they're both having a hard time treading water, and they're swimming in the wrong direction.
Laura: I fly over them and just tell them, "Hang onto the broom!"
Matt: "Oh, that's the best thing I could've hoped for seeing." And Allura reaches up and grabs your arm and says, "Kima, hold on!" And grabs the edge. You can see Kima now is like coughing up water and is trying desperately to tread water. That's a natural 20 on a strength check for Allura. Holy shit. With no modifier. Manages to hold onto both you and Kima and keep you up. I need you to make an athletics check. Just to hold on.
Laura: 13?
Matt: 13, okay. It's enough to maintain. Carrying them both back as fast as the broom-- which is not very fast at this time. It takes you probably a good 15 or so minutes, and as the tension's going on you can see Allura getting more and more exhausted.
Laura: Keep holding, we're almost there, darling.
Matt: I'm trying.
Marisha: I just keep saying, "Vex? Did you find them?"
Taliesin: I'm taking the carpet that direction.
Marisha: Vex?
Patrick rothfuss: If it's been this long, Kerrek has given The Talk, like.
Marisha: I'm just crying in Kerrek's shoulder right now, just bawling my eyes out.
Taliesin: "I'll be back in a moment." I'm taking the carpet towards the speck I see on the-- and probably ten minutes in is where, I would have given it ten minutes. I'm on the way with the carpet.
Laura: I have them.
Marisha: I swear I saw them, I swear.
Matt: At this point, you can see Allura's grip is getting shaky on the broom now. She says, "We're almost close enough. Now." And then her and Kima vanish in a puff of dark bluish energy and appear on the carpet next to you through dimension door.
Taliesin: (yelps) I'm so tired.
Marisha: Still sobbing into Kerrek's shoulder.
Patrick rothfuss: It's been a slow litany of, sometimes people go and you never get them back. It's, he's giving you the wrong pep talk.
Marisha: Oh god. So wait, maybe they were just dead and I saw their ghosts?
Laura: We have them! We have them!
Marisha: What? And I just cry harder.
Liam: Vax is also listening to that, sometimes you cannot get them back, while holding Scanlan.
Laura: (wailing) Like little Dobby in Harry Potter.
Matt: Eventually you guys manage to gather the rest of your party at the beachside. Waterlogged, Kima shakes it out, leaving this trail as her hair's all matted and into her face, and she just looks really pissed and is like, "Not a word." Allura's squeezing out the sides of her braids. "Well, now what?"
Laura: Whitestone.
Marisha: Let's take a tree, shall we?
Matt: Let's try. I think this definitely explains why so many folks who went to investigate this place never came back.
Patrick rothfuss: Are we as far away as we can be, like, we came in on a tree, right?
Travis: We're on the beach.
Matt: You came in on a tree, yes.
Patrick rothfuss: Okay.
Taliesin: That doesn't mean a lot, but yeah. We're as far as we can get.
Matt: So you go ahead and find the tree? All right. Hm. As you reach out and touch the side of the tree, eyes clenched tight, hoping that this is enough, you watch as the bark splits into the transportation via plants portal, and as it splits apart, you can see further internal wood striations, those split. A third layer splits, it's having to force its way through this tree, and finally it divides out and you can see the sunset-lit outside of the center of Whitestone.
Taliesin: Oh, thank god.
Marisha: I hold the door open like it's a closing elevator. Am I sure it's fucking Whitestone?
Matt: It appears to be Whitestone.
Laura: We've got six seconds, go!
Marisha: Go!
Taliesin: I'm running for it.
Matt: You guys all charge through, making your way through the portal.
Marisha: And I go in last.
Matt: You all step out, catching yourself, just as the tree slams behind you. There you see the faintly blossoming branches of the Sun Tree greeting you to the center of sunsetting Whitestone, together as a group, clutching Scanlan's lifeless body in your arms still, Vax. What do you do?
Marisha: I cry to Kerr a little bit more.
Travis: No, no time for that.
Taliesin: No time.
Laura: Get him to the castle.
Marisha: Okay, sorry.
Laura: Right?
Marisha: No, should we get him to the castle or the Raven Queen's temple?
Liam: To the temple of the Raven Queen.
Marisha: Okay, to the temple, to the temple.
Taliesin: Scry-- find his daughter. Scry on his daughter.
Marisha: Okay. I use my-- oh jeez. I can't remember-- no, I didn't use any of my Scrying Eye on Raishan at all, right?
Taliesin: No.
Marisha: That was my spell just now. I will use my Scrying Eye now to see if I can find Kaylie.
Liam: I'm already 50 feet towards the temple.
Matt: Okay. You guys all make your way towards the temple of the Raven Queen and the graveyard outside of Whitestone. As you're making this scry attempt with the item, go ahead and make another concentration check as you're moving along and doing this on the carpet.
Marisha: That's cocked. That's not bad. Just a regular-- what do I use?
Matt: It's a constitution saving throw.
Marisha: Con saving throw? Then 16.
Matt: Remember, you have warcaster, so you technically have advantage on concentration, too.
Marisha: Oh my god, oh my god.
Matt: Don't forget that.
Marisha: No, 16.
Matt: Okay. Little bit of a show. Okay. Your vision pulls back and is dragged fast enough through the clouds to have no sense of direction. Suddenly you feel your essence thrust downward through the clouds once more towards the closing daylight around Kymal in the center of Tal'Dorei.
Marisha: She's in Kymal.
Matt: Looking down to the rather dirty, destitute, gambling-overrun and light-law-enforced city that Kymal is, you're pulled once more into what looks to be a tavern room, and there you see a makeshift band of very terrible performers playing, and at the back table you see Kaylie with half a flagon of ale sitting there, dagger on the table, just staring and just giving those performers shit, she's like, "You all fucking suck, you know that?"
Marisha: Oh, I love her so much right now.
Matt: Where I come from, they'd kill you for this. That's terrible. Certainly.
Marisha: Knowing how scrying works, and knowing that certain magic-casters can feel it-- This is going on a limb. I just yell through the scrying and audibly amongst everyone, "Kaylie! It's Scanlan!" Trying to push through the magical boundary and see if I can at least get a reaction out of her.
Matt: Okay. You're shouting this, you guys hear her doing this, and you just keep pushing forward, occasionally checking to make sure she's okay. Kaylie just keeps drinking from the flagon and is shouting out, someone comes by and you watch as she deftly nabs a little bit of coin from the pocket--
Marisha: And I scream again, "Kaylie!"
Matt: Doesn't seem to be having an effect.
Taliesin: Kymal.
Marisha: God damn it, I wish you could talk to people through scrying sometimes.
Laura: Who can send me there?
Marisha: She's in Kymal.
Laura: Who can send me there? I'll go.
Marisha: Allura might be able to send her a message. Allura, do you still have any messages left?
Matt: I can cast Sending, yes.
Marisha: Has she ever met Kaylie?
Laura: I don't think so.
Liam: No.
Laura: We need to get her and bring her here.
Liam: Can we get the other gate stone and find Shaun.
Laura: I've got the gate stone, yes.
Liam: We have both of them, we have them?
Taliesin: No, we have the one gate stone.
Liam: Yeah, doesn't your sister have the other one?
Taliesin: She has the other one.
Liam: Yes, find the other gate stone and find Shaun.
Laura: Find the other gate stone. I take off to find Gilmore.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: I will go get the other gate stone.
Marisha: I'm tapped out of teleportations.
Taliesin: It's fine. We can make this work. And in the meantime, take him to the Raven Queen temple.
Matt: And so is Allura.
Marisha: Tapped out of teleportation?
Matt: Yeah.
Patrick rothfuss: Now, from what I know about the Raven Queen, she is not like, oh, you can get a do-over, right?
Laura: No.
Patrick rothfuss: She is like, you are dead and that is the line you do not cross to not come back.
Liam: It's a little more complicated.
Laura: Well, he is her champion.
Patrick rothfuss: Yeah, but from what I know.
Matt: From what you know as Kerrek? Yeah, she's--
Patrick rothfuss: She's the one that fucking holds this line. Like, you do not come back.
Matt: She guides you. One way or the other. She's the mistress of fate, and if your destiny is cut short, there is exception.
Patrick rothfuss: Okay, okay.
Matt: However, her real loathing is for those people who go against that natural destiny.
Patrick rothfuss: That abrogate the natural order.
Matt: Exactly.
Patrick rothfuss: Okay, right.
Matt: Unnatural, unexpected death across one's fate line is unfortunate, but it can be corrected.
Patrick rothfuss: Okay, okay.
Matt: So. You go ahead and you look for Gilmore? You find Gilmore with a big mug of coffee in his comfort robes, still recovering from the war the previous day, his hair's tousled up and he's sitting there cradling it, looking out as the sun's setting in the main common mess area of the castle, and as you walk in. "Oh, Vex'ahlia, you return!"
Laura: I just run straight up. "Darling."
Matt: Yes, yes?
Laura: Do you have teleportation? Do you have anything that can send me to Kymal. Kymal?
Liam: Kymal.
Laura: To Kymal.
Marisha: In a tavern in Kymal.
Matt: I-- (nervous chuckle)
Laura: Please.
Matt: I don't know of a sigil there, I'm sorry. I normally don't frequent places like that. It's a bit dastardly for my tastes. I-- I'm sorry.
Laura: (tearfully) Do you know of a city nearby? Anything?
Matt: I mean, there's Westruun, but that sigil got destroyed too. What's wrong?
Laura: (tearfully) I don't know what to do. Scanlan's down. We have to find his daughter.
Matt: Puts his mug down and stands up slowly. His demeanor gets very stoic and very dark. "Well. Let's see what we can do. Follow me." And he begins walking down and leads you towards the home that he's been staying here in Whitestone. He goes in, and it's barely furnished based on the original attack on Whitestone when you guys had the assassins that came after you here. It's been cleaned up but it hasn't been replaced. He goes rummaging through some things up in his room, he goes through a few bags and goes, "I don't really have many options. Is it a--"
Laura: I just need to get there.
Matt: Have you talked to Allura?
Laura: She's out. Out of spells.
Matt: "Hold on." And he leads you back up to the castle. What are you guys doing?
Liam: All this time, I have laid Scanlan down in the center of the temple, and with a wet rag I have cleaned his face and combed his hair out and laid Mythcarver out next to him.
Laura: Probably gave him some clean pants because he's covered in piss.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: Yeah, you've got to scrub that down a little.
Travis: I'm waiting outside the temple because I probably can't go in. Right? I can't go in there.
Laura: Why?
Travis: I don't know. I'm just me.
Liam: While I'm cleaning, I start talking as well. You know, if it is his time, then I can accept that it is his time. But he just did an awful lot for you. That dragon was tampering with your ways, and without him we would have not gotten as far as we have. He has done a lot for you, and this isn't even bargaining anymore. I am yours. I'm not bargaining. But this little man has more heart in his chest than any man I've met. And if there is anyone who deserves a second chance... I don't know, I don't know. Your will be done.
Marisha: I grab Grog on the outside of the temple, also standing outside, and I just grab him by his massive gigantic shoulder and say, You were closer to him than probably anyone else in this group, you knew more of his secrets than anyone else. I think it would mean something if you talked to him from beyond.
Travis: How do I do that?
Marisha: His spirit still holds on. You can still speak to his spirit and convince it to come back. Convince it to come back, Grog. You knew him. You knew him. Look inside and you will know.
Travis: What, I just start talking to him?
Marisha: And I crack the door to the temple open and try and gesture him in.
Travis: Oh, in there. I'm not really religious, though, like. I don't--
Marisha: You don't have to be religious. You had the connection with Scanlan, and you have heart. That connection speaks far stronger than any religion ever could. It's up to you. We don't know if Kaylie will make it.
Travis: Right. Okay. For Scanlan, then. And I go into the temple of the Raven Queen.
Matt: Okay. Are you guys having Pike prepare the Resurrection ritual, is that what's going on?
Laura: I guess so.
Matt: I don't know what's happening. You guys are talking to air right now.
Marisha: Well, I was talking to Grog.
Matt: Right, right, right.
Taliesin: Trying to put together the Resurrection ritual.
Matt: Okay, that's what I thought.
Laura: Trying to prepare that, yeah.
Liam: I wasn't expecting-- that wasn't part of the ritual.
Matt: Right, right.
Patrick rothfuss: So everybody here is a mess, right? And when they brought them out of the ocean, Kerrek was like-- because that shook him, you know? Because he knew at this point, now is the point where all your friends die. But these guys I can't talk to, they are all messed-- how bad are you?
Taliesin: Outwardly I'm fine.
Patrick rothfuss: Okay.
Taliesin: I'm in get-shit-done mode.
Patrick rothfuss: Right. I get you a little aside.
Taliesin: I'm probably coming back down now from the castle with the stone.
Patrick rothfuss: What-- can his sister do something, or his daughter?
Taliesin: His daughter.
Patrick rothfuss: Why-- why the urgency, I mean?
Taliesin: Because it's the only thing I can think of that could really drag him back from wherever he is. That's my thought. I've been there, I've experienced this.
Patrick rothfuss: Been where?
Taliesin: I've died. And you need to... it's not easy. And you need to-- not everything cuts through. You need to find the right thing to cut through, and I think this might be it. So it's where I'm putting my bets.
Matt: Allura approaches and says, "If we can wait until tomorrow, I can take us there, but-- I just, I have no means of--"
Marisha: What about--
Laura: I feel like it's bad to wait.
Marisha: Oh jeez, I don't know his name.
Matt: Vex, as you're brought up to the castle, Gilmore is tugging your arm, and you see he has a haste to him, and he's like, "Where's Eskil? Where's Eskil? Has he returned? Please, somebody, give me this answer. Anyone." And you watch as some of the guards come up and like, "Eskil's been back in his research at the ziggurat for the better part of a week, now."
Taliesin: Guards, you're with Gilmore, you will get him into any room in the castle immediately without question.
Matt: Yes sir, yes sir.
Taliesin: Now.
Matt: Pulls you down, and you rush down past the Ziggurat, and Eskil's returning with his servant. This older hunched form. It looks like they finished their work for the day and, as you all begin rushing down the hall to the ziggurat beneath Whitestone, he says, "Oh, hello. We're finished, there's no reason to--"
Laura: Teleportation.
Matt: It's a very strange, very--
Laura: Shaun.
Matt: -- unique magic, yes, of course.
Laura: Can you do it?
Matt: Peh. Child's play, really.
Laura: Then can you send me to Kymal, please?
Matt: Kymal?
Laura: Yes.
Matt: Why would you want to--
Laura: Urgently, darling.
Matt: "Shaun--" Shaun kind of goes, "If you want to be of use to anybody right now, buddy, this is the way to do it." (sputters) "Kymal. All right. Heh, that's a one- way trip, so you're paying for room and board."
Laura: "Sure." I give Shaun a kiss on the cheek.
Matt: All right. Have you guys caught up at this point?
Taliesin: I'm at the temple, I've sent them off to deal with this.
Matt: All right. So we go-- what are you looking for?
Laura: I'm looking for a tavern, probably the only one in town.
Matt: All right, I'll take you there, and that's where we're staying for the night. We'll return tomorrow.
Laura: Yes.
Matt: "All right. (sighs) It's been a while." And he reaches out and grabs your hand. "Be back in a day!" And begins doing this incantation. As he traces his fingers through the air, you watch these lines begin to connect, and he's tracing almost this mystical map of the portions of Tal'Dorei, and as each finger hits a point you see him connect a thread. As he connects a thread, both of you blink out and appear in the middle of this busy cobblestone street. You can hear what sounds like raucous laughter and shouting in the distance from two different directions. You can see now as the night has gone from a bright orange and purple to the dark reds and blues of post-sunset. There are a couple of what look to be guards wandering the street, but they themselves look to be laughing and probably a little tipsy in their own right. You see many humans, and you see a couple of half-orcs. You actually see two gnolls and what looks to be a goblin that are wandering amongst those people in the street. Kymal is, and you've passed through before. Kymal is-- it's the real-- it's the seedy Reno of Tal'Dorei, if you will.
Marisha: I mean, Reno's already pretty seedy, so.
Matt: It's not Laughlin level. It's not-- sorry, Laughlin.
Marisha: Sorry, Reno.
Matt: Go ahead and make an investigation check.
Laura: I'm just terrified of all my dice.
Liam: High rolls.
Laura: 16?
Matt: 16, okay.
Laura: Wait, but I didn't add anything to that. Investigation... that's a 23.
Matt: Okay, yeah. Asking questions rapidly around, dragging Eskil behind, he's like, "Where are we going? (grumbling)" Asking to where the worst performers you've seen perform in this town, and everyone keeps pointing you to this one place that's up on this one hill towards the back of the Ironseat Ridge, which is the mountain that Kymal is up against. As you walk into the tavern, you see a little more than a dozen people in various clusters. Some of them are ready to go, they've been drinking since sundown and they're already pretty sauced. There's a terrible off-key band in the corner of four people, three gentlemen and a lady--
Taliesin: Terrible band name.
Matt: It's a terrible band name. And it's pretty bad. And there you see, half-slumped over in the corner at the table, you see Kaylie, just ready to pass out at the end.
Laura: Fuck. Stay by the bar. I'll be right back.
Matt: Should I get our rooms?
Laura: Fine. Yes, darling.
Matt: One room-- two rooms, she's paying, hold on.
Laura: And I run off.
Matt: And he walks over towards the bar.
Liam: He's going to be so pissed.
Marisha: Yeah he is, he's going to be so pissed.
Patrick rothfuss: Ditch him.
Marisha: I so approve of this, by the way. This is the way to do this. Okay, byeeee.
Liam: Sorry!
Marisha: Sorry!
Matt: Kaylie at the table.
Laura: Kaylie.
Matt: What do you want from me.
Laura: I smack her across the cheek.
Matt: "You--" She grabs the dagger and grabs you by the front of the shirt and brings it--
Laura: Darling, your father! Scanlan. Tell me you're sober.
Matt: Oh, I remember you.
Laura: Are you sober?
Matt: I'm never sober.
Laura: Ah, fuck. Your father's hurt.
Matt: I don't want to deal with him right now. Tell him-- look.
Laura: "Kaylie!" And I pick her up and bring her up to my eye-level.
Matt: I will kick your ass right now if you keep treating me like this.
Laura: Your father. He died. But there's a chance we can bring him back, if you're willing to help.
Matt: "How'd he die?" And she's still being held up, reaches over and grabs her tankard. Her feet still dangling.
Laura: Defending everyone. Saving the fucking land, can you believe it?
Matt: Who would want a death like that?
Laura: He died with piss all over him.
Matt: That sounds like my father.
Laura: Will you go?
Matt: And what?
Laura: Will you help? Kaylie.
Matt: And help what?
Laura: I set her on the table so we're still eye-level. All his words were of you. Look, I know a little bit about having a father who wasn't around. Right? Take it from me. It's not worth it. It's not worth harboring this hatred in your heart. If you can find it in yourself to forgive him, you'll live a much happier life.
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Patrick rothfuss: (singing) My father wasn't around...
Laura: (singing) My father wasn't around...
Marisha: (singing) My father wasn't around...
Marisha: Come on, Vex, come on.
Laura: 25.
Matt: She looks at you for a second. You can see her kind of frustrated piss-off facade drops a little and her eyes sink below. "I really don't know what you think I can do, but, I mean. At the very least, I'd like to see his body before it's interred."
Laura: I pull out the stone and I put it in her hand. Concentrate. Concentrate on him. It'll bring you to him, I swear.
Matt: (sighs) So much strangeness surrounds you folks every time I cross paths with you, it seems.
Laura: Please. Kaylie.
Matt: Can I take my drink?
Laura: You can take whatever you want. Just promise me you'll try.
Matt: She holds the stone for a second and looks at it. Squints an eye. "Listen, if you're trying to take the piss out of me--" And her form just vanishes from the table. It is pushing 11:20. I think we will pick this up right there next week here in Whitestone for the ritual.
Liam: All night long, man, all night long.
Matt: I'm trying to push the narrative as long as I can get, trying to get to a point, but yeah, this is building and I don't want to drag us in here.
Laura: It's just going.
Marisha: Gah, it's going to be another Percy situation.
Matt: I know.
Marisha: Scanlan's going to be dead for a week.
Matt: I can't force narrative.
Marisha: Schrodinger's Scanlan.
Matt: Can't force narrative. All right, well, we will pick this up next week.
Taliesin: Ironically of course, also, I don't think we have Sam next week.
Marisha: Sam won't be here!
Laura: Yeah, he's not here next--
Matt: Sam can't be here next week. Oh, that's going to be interesting.
Liam: Push the narrative all night long like Lionel Ritchie, come on.
Sam: Get used to it! (all laugh)
Laura: No, Sam!
Matt: Oh, snap.
Taliesin: Dick!
Liam: If we wait, he's going to write us off.
Travis: I hear him! I hear him from beyond!
Laura: See, Grog? See?
Matt: All right, well, we'll figure it out. If worse comes to worst, I'll play him, or we'll see if he can Skype in. We'll see. I don't know what he's doing. I know he's gone. Like a tool.
Marisha: Oh yeah, maybe he can Skype in.
Taliesin: We can totally, like Zod in the mirror.
Matt: That's true. All right, well. With that, the Conclave lies destroyed.
Laura: Oh my god.
Marisha: (whoops)
Matt: Raishan's plot still not uncovered. One of two deaths reversed, one still on the line. The tethering of the soul to the body withering with each fall. And a surprisingly low-level paladin getting the final blow on an ancient green dragon.
Laura: Nice!
Taliesin: Way to David that goliath, man.
Laura: Yeah, right?
Marisha: Like, legit, we were all talking, we thought you were going to die.
Patrick rothfuss: Why do you think I showed up?
Taliesin: We were like, I wonder if he's going to totally Coulson, I wonder if he's just going to Coulson on us.
Marisha: We thought you were going to be our Agent Coulson, yeah.
Matt: I honestly prepared that to be this-- like, we talked about that on the break, it would've been an awesome heroic end to the story.
Patrick rothfuss: That's why I was here. I was going to throw my body in front of someone.
Matt: It just happened to work out that she was pinned straight to the side--
Travis: Well, you didn't do a very good job of it, Patrick.
Patrick rothfuss: Oh, believe me, Kerrek much would've rather died than have this particular outcome.
Marisha: Shoot for the moon, sometimes you'll land at the how do you want to do this.
Matt: I like that.
Liam: Also, Feeblemind? Natural 20 on scanning the ocean?
Laura: Pretty fucking great.
Liam: Pretty amazing.
Matt: Yeah.
Patrick rothfuss: That was...
Marisha: I had a few lucky rolls.
Laura: Keyleth and Kerr MVPs for sure.
Taliesin: Somebody conquered some personal demons, this week.
Marisha: Yeah, I was waiting for this.
Matt: Well, Sam, we love you. Wherever you are.
Taliesin: You're still an awkward mess, but you know.
Marisha: Keyleth will always be an awkward mess. As much character growth as you can have, you're still always you.
Taliesin: There will always be a pit of fire.
Marisha: She will always be awkward. I will always trip and fall and faceplant in lava.
Taliesin: It's beautiful.

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons & Dragons. Nice try, motherfuckers. (all laugh)
Matt: Anyway, welcome to tonight's episode. Before we get into it, we have some announcements to do really fast. First and foremost, getting to our fantastic sponsor for the evening. Returning: the glorious Loot Crate! Thank you so much, Loot Crate, for being fantastic and for being a sponsor for our show as long as you have! It's been awesome!
Sam: Hi, guys!
Matt: Hi, Sam.
Sam: Oh, you didn't throw it to me yet, did you?
Matt: No, but I can. Hey, Sam. Why don't you tell us about our sponsor?
Sam: Hey, as I tell you guys-- Hey, crew. By the way, crew as I tell you guys about Loot Crate, can you guys get a camera up here? I'm going to show some close-up things. Should have done that ahead of time. It's on its way. Okay. Loot Crate, the theme this week is Primal. Brands include X-Men, Overwatch, Predator, you can go to lootcrate.com/criticalrole and use the promo code CRITICALROLE for 10% off. And that's some severe savings. Just a few days left to catch this month's theme, so check it out. They're a great sponsor; we love them. They do so much for the show. We genuinely appreciate them. Okay, that being said-- and this will tie into Loot Crate, I promise-- I was thinking a lot this week about fan art. Are you on me? Whatever. Fan art.
Marisha: Where did that camera come from?
Sam: They're fast. So, we have amazing fan artists on this show. We get hundreds of art pieces every week. We're floored by them constantly: legitimately amazing artists. Talented, gifted. And I was like, "why should they get all the fun?" So I was like, "I'm going to do my own fan art this week!" Because things people know about me, I'm a talented performer and all that stuff, but I'm also an emerging visual artist. And this is a chance to get my art out to the world. And so I'm going to present it right now. Guys, this is art, so if you have any kind of a reaction that's real-- if you cry, if you clap, whatever. I'll take it.
Liam: Man. Joma, your time is over!
Sam: I'm going to start with Grog.
Laura: So good!
Sam: It's pretty good!
Laura: Did you really draw that?
Marisha: Let me see over here! Is that you? Did you do that?
Sam: Magic marker on paper.
Marisha: That's actually pretty good, man!
Laura: I like it!
Sam: I feel like I got his rage and his ferocity.
Taliesin: I'm feeling it.
Sam: Next up, she's hard  Keyleth.
Marisha: That's pretty good!
Sam: I did Keyleth. I should point out that all of these are signed and numbered by the artist.
Marisha: I have some fierce bone structure going.
Sam: You're hard. Lot of things going on.
Matt: I can see she's cast the 5th-level spell "Body to Forest."
Sam: I didn't know how to draw bodies! So I just went with grass!
Liam: Druids don't shave pits, man.
Sam: Truth be told, I was drinking, so things get a little worse as we go. So, this is Percy! It's a lot of white. I don't know how to paint with white or use white.
Liam: To be fair, so is Percy.
Sam: He's a white guy with white hair. I've got to work on this one. Next up, a guy who's near and dear to me. Here's Taryon Darrington. Little art tip here, guys: don't use blue pencil on blue paper because it tends not to show up. That's a free artist-to-artist tip for you guys.
Taliesin: Wait, you need to turn it back this way more. Oh, okay.
Sam: There is a drawing there.
Taliesin: Bold decisions.
Sam: It's just blue pencil on blue paper.
Matt: It's like one of the Magic Eye pictures. You have to really focus to see it.
Taliesin: I see a sailboat.
Sam: And then I was like, "The people are going to want Scanlan, right?" So this one took the most time. I will say this. Took about an hour. Mostly because I had to go to CVS to get more magic markers, so that was about 55 minutes of the time. And then the rest was hardcore art. And I feel like I really captured him. He's got a flute. He's got poop.
Marisha: I love that you broke rule number one of Pictionary and labeled things!
Sam: Okay, I'm going to do the twins next. Probably go a little wider because these will be side-by-side, all right? So you can really get the artistry. Okay, here they are.
Laura: Which one's which? (all laugh)
Sam: Some may argue that I photocopied Vax and put pink ribbons in her hair to be Vex. Some could argue that, and they would be correct. But you can also tell them apart because he's got a knife and she's got a little bow and arrow.
Travis: Are those arrows green?
Sam: I ran out of a lot of things, and I was drinking pretty heavily at this point, so I was probably fully drunk at this point. And then last, but not least. I mean, all together, I'd say probably an hour and a half it took me to do all these, including the CVS run. And last but not least, I'm most proud of Pike Trickfoot, ladies and gentlemen.
All: Whoa!
Sam: Now, again, you could say that I printed out her IMDB page and colored it in, and you'd be right, but it is also art, and I will stick by that. Now here's how this all ties into Loot Crate, guys.
Matt: It tied into The Dark Knight in that particular image.
Sam: I'm giving all of this art away tonight! I'm doing a contest, an unsanctioned contest that I'm running myself. So tonight, tweet me pictures of your Loot Crate stuff, like you and your Loot Crate shirt, or you holding a Loot Crate, or a screengrab of "I just subscribed to Loot Crate!" Tweet it to me with the hashtag #BrianFosterSmellsLikeCabbage. (all laugh)
Sam: And I will, like a lottery, pick one at random to win all of this art signed by the artist. One-of-a-kind pieces that will certainly go up in value-- maybe even before I die! They will be worth a lot of money. And these are all going to a fabulous art collector out there. Thank you, Loot Crate! Thank you, artists! And that's it.
Taliesin: What are you?
Liam: Happy St. Pat's. That's the end of the episode, right?
Sam: You can pass them around. Share them, show them.
Marisha: When did you do these? Last night?
Sam: I think it was after you left my house last night.
Marisha: Are you serious? We left at midnight!
Sam: Yeah, it was eleven-something.
Taliesin: Is it my imagination that all of the half-elves kind of have the same weird chin thing going on?
Matt: It's consistent!
Sam: Yeah!
Taliesin: I will also say that I definitely get Ashley as the Joker threatening the city.
Sam: Yeah.
Matt: Yeah.
Taliesin: Millions will die.
Marisha: Why the pink lipstick, man?
Sam: That's what girls wear!
Marisha: Have you ever seen Ashley wear pink lipstick?
Sam: Yep. Girls wear pink lipstick.
Marisha: Although I appreciate her guns and her biceps.
Matt: She's a monstah.
Taliesin: She's like if The Joker had a daughter with Krondor.
Matt: Thank you, Sam.
Sam: Sure, sure.
Laura: Thank you, Sam, and thank you, Loot Crate!
Matt: Thank you, Loot Crate.
Taliesin: What's that hashtag again?
Sam: #BrianFosterSmellsLikeCabbage
Matt: Okay, there we go. Remember that, guys. All right, merch update. Same old, same old, I'm pretty sure?
Laura: Merch update! There's merch still in the store!
Matt: Cool. You've got stickers, mugs, patches, bracelets, stuff like that.
Laura: All that stuff.
Matt: Logo shirts and the disturbingly comfortable "How do you want to do this?" hoodies up there.
Laura: It's true.
Matt: WonderCon! We're going to be at WonderCon doing a live Talks Machina panel on Saturday, April 1st from 2-3 PM Pacific at the arena at the Anaheim Convention Center. The big room. So fill it, Critters! Come on in! We have plenty of room and space for you guys. We want to try to show the convention that we are legion.
Marisha: Not an April Fools' joke!
Matt: We're actually going to be there.
Laura: This is legit.
Liam: It is an April Fools' joke.
Laura: No, it's not!
Matt: They gave us the big room and went, "You can't fill this," and we're like, "Yeah, we can." So we're trying to prove to them that we can fill the room. Come and join us, 2-3 PM.
Liam: Bring 4,000 of your closest friends.
Matt: Wednesday Club! Taliesin!
Taliesin: Yes! I missed this week because I realized, once again, that I'm supposed to be doing things other than playing D&D and actually working in the real world. So I missed this Wednesday Club, but I'll be back next week. I don't actually know what the subject is yet because I've done nothing other than this all week.
Sam: Fantastic Four!
Taliesin: Actually, probably not. We did Marvel last week.
Travis: Old Man Logan!
Taliesin: Maybe. No Marvel this week! We've got to let DC, and Image, and independent books may give a thing.
Travis: X-O Manowar!
Taliesin: X-O Manowar? You are a nerd, dude, whoa! Are you coming on?
Matt: How about just Manowar? The band.
Taliesin: I was going to say, will you come on our X-O Manowar show if we do one?
Travis: I don't know, man. I like football.
Taliesin: Okay. I love you. So yeah, there will be a Wednesday Club. Check out Twitter for updates, but I'll be back and it will be fun, and I'll be catching up on all my books.
Matt: Awesome. Next up, we have debuting on, I believe it's Sunday. This Sunday, March 19th, on Alpha we have Roundtable. Which is, essentially, a series where a bunch of various storytellers get together and talk about different themes about storytelling over drinks. It's actually pretty badass. This first season is Gamemasters. We have a collection of talented people from all over the webisphere running games.
Marisha: We went international!
Matt: Heck yeah. This first episode premieres Sunday. It's a conversation between me, Mark Humes of High Rollers, and Adam Koebel of Roll Play. So, if you want to check it out, it's on projectalpha.com.
Marisha: Pro-JECT Alpha.
Matt: Pro-JECT Alpha.
Marisha: Pro-JECT that Alpha.
Matt: It actually was a really awesome conversation. I'm pretty happy about it. We got a little tipsy. GM Tips episode went up today! It is my final run on GM Tips, but the series continues as I pass it off to a new host. If you haven't checked it out yet, our fantastic Satine Phoenix is picking up the torch to give her perspective as a game master for this next bit. She's awesome. This episode is specifically about how to avoid or deal with GM burnout, which is a topic that I think a lot of people are familiar with.
Liam: You don't have that, do you?
Matt: Huh? Not yet.
Travis: They make pharmaceuticals for that.
Matt: None. (laughs) Hopefully. No, but honestly, it's got some good tips for anyone out there who is feeling like they're starting to run a little ragged or a little sluggish. Check it out. Hope you like it. Signal Boost episode.
Marisha: Featuring Satine! Which we timed out pretty well. I think intentionally.
Taliesin: Maybe. Probably not.
Marisha: I'm not sure.
Matt: Nothing that works out well is intentional in our sphere.
Marisha: Totally intentionally. So if you don't know who Satine is, get introduced to her with this week's episode of Signal Boost, and then she'll lead you graciously into GM Tips.
Taliesin: It's the gothiest one since me, I think. Well, no, Jason Charles is pretty gothy.
Marisha: She's awesome. I have kind of a girl crush on Satine. She's so cool.
Taliesin: She's so cool.
Marisha: Yeah, you should go watch her.
Laura: Thanks, Matthew Mercer!
Matt: You're welcome. Updated Trinket stats.
Laura: (singsong) New Trinket stats!
Liam: He's got guns attached now! Gatling gun!
Laura: Yep, and a cannon.
Matt: Misfire score  20.
Liam: It shoots bees!
Matt: Yeah, and they all attack Trinket. It's bad. You don't want to use it. (all laugh)
Matt: (explosion noise) Right back into him. (bear grunting) Yes, and last but not least, Talks Machina live on Tuesdays, 7 PM, here on Twitch and Alpha. Brian Foster hosts every week. We talk about random shit about this, have guests from the community on-- check it out. It's a good time.
Marisha: And apparently he smells like cabbage.
Matt: Apparently, hashtag.
Sam: Getting a lot of great tweets already.
Matt: All right! That's the last of my announcements.
Sam: Are we doing the other thing?
Matt: Oh, that's right! I'm sorry! The Critical Role Fan Club on Facebook actually had a limerick contest to announce their 10,000th person joining it. And we had a winner. The winner is Tamiko L. Fujio. Sam, do you have a copy of the limerick?
Sam: I have a copy of the limerick in my inbox, right here.
Matt: I think you should read it off.
Sam: I'm going to read this limerick. They had their own internal contest, and this was the winner, and it's really awesome. Vox Machina is a fine troupe Who knock baddies and grannies for a loop Unless they encounter a door Then their plans are no more So instead they'll just scry with their poop. (all cheer and laugh)
Matt: Congratulations, Tamiko. That was awesome! Well done. And everyone leveled. Everyone's at 17 except for Tary, who's at 14. Congratulations.
Travis: Fucking dingleberry.
Marisha: (sings) 9th-level spells!
Laura: That Scanlan could've gotten.
Marisha: Yeah. (all laugh)
Matt: Anyway, let's go ahead and bring it into tonight's episode of Critical Role. [opening credits]
Matt: Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. I'll remember that. Taryon apparently exploded.
Taliesin: Yeah, that happened.
Matt: Oh! There he is! Good job! (laughs) It's like you rushed here from work.
Sam: (whispers) Sorry!
Matt: That's okay. So. Bringing us into tonight's episode: Vox Machina, having completed the toppling and destruction of the Chroma Conclave, have now gone towards tying up the loose ends at the end of this massive journey that involved coming to the final stage of Keyleth's Aramente to prove to her people, the Ashari, that she is the proper next leader of the Zephra Air Ashari. You traveled far west across the Ozmit Sea after renting passage across a ship helmed by Captain Adela, and made your way to the island city of Vesrah, where you encountered Uvenda, Heart of the Tides, the leader of the Water Ashari, and put upon your final trial. You were sent into the subocean Aerie of Torrent where you were to retrieve lodestones in the constant threat of a kraken in the vicinity. Unfortunately, the kraken was triggered upon your attempt. A massive battle took place, one that claimed the life of Vax'ildan, and barely escaped with a success under your belt. You managed to bring his body back to the central temple at the top of Vesrah, and through bringing Pike's essence by a blessing through Sarenrae, complete a resurrection ritual that succeeded. Vax returns on his ever-dwindling borrowed time from the Raven Queen, it seems, thrusting himself into danger, but returns nonetheless. After this, you guys got some pictures drawn by Doty, as Pike intimidated him into learning your names in a wonderful method. You got passage on the ship back to Emon, where you have made your way back to Greyskull Keep. And that was where we left off, as you plan for the next leg of your venture. So. Picking up from there: as an evening rest comes to you all, a night of sleep. Vax, you have a difficult evening, tossing and turning in bed, the general ramifications of recent events surrounding you. Which, as a note, as a person who's back from resurrection, you are at a relative penalty for the next few days. I don't know if you were aware of that. Were you aware of that?
Travis: He is now.
Liam: I kind of remember people going through that.
Matt: Yep, so you have a night's rest after this, so that's-- actually, no. You traveled on a boat for a few days. That would have gone away! That's right, because you had to make a whole journey back to Emon, so you've rested up heavily in the boat. Forget I said anything.
Matt: But, tossing and turning as the night eventually takes you into subconsciousness, you are plagued with flashes of deep-sea darkness. Lashing tendrils. The ever-gaping maw, a beak swallowing you. The light fading. And there once again, you see emerging from the darkness the same expressionless, solid porcelain mask of the Raven Queen. The voice, omnipresent but gentle, strangely warming against the cold of nothing. And the voice just calls out, "I've given you back, my champion. But you are still mine. You have a purpose. Do not forget."
Liam: You know well that my heart lies with them. Both of them. All of them. But I have put my faith in you. And I await your word.
Matt: "And wait you shall. I sense something on the horizon. I sense rousing villainy. I sense twisting the threads of life, but it is too far beyond my vision. Only time will tell. But I've watched your thread. And it leads to something bright; it leads to something great. But your thread is still clouded at that point. I cannot see beyond. And as that thread moves, it gathers many around it: those you've come to love. Perhaps their fate is tied with yours. Is that a responsibility you can bear, Vax'ildan? Then be patient. Enjoy the time you have. For when this rousing evil gathers, I will need your full attention, my champion." The mask recedes back into the darkness, the cold overtakes you, and suddenly you find yourself shooting up in bed, gasping for breath. Sweat pours down your face just as a gentle bit of light begins to break over the sun coming through the window into the bedroom. Keyleth, you are roused out of your slumber as well, hearing him gasp and breathe heavily, leaning off the side of the bed.
Marisha: You okay?
Liam: Yeah. (coughs)
Marisha: Did you have a nightmare?
Liam: Yeah.
Marisha: I have them, too.
Liam: I know.
Marisha: Do you want to talk about it?
Liam: Eventually.
Marisha: Okay. Do you need anything?
Liam: I've everything I need.
Marisha: I do a little bit of Druidcraft, something like lightning bugs in the room, and make them dance. Nice and calming, just trying to get back to sleep.
Matt: Okay. You get--
Liam: We get an extra hour.
Matt: You guys curl up to get back to sleep, and as you do and the darkness takes you once more, you hear the faint echoing whisper in the back of your head as you fall back into your dreams, and it says, "My fate-touched." Now, the rest of you wake up the next morning. It's been a while since you've been back in Greyskull Keep, and it is strangely heartening to be back at home without another constant threat of death, without the looming of dragon destruction. And it brings back a flood of memories of when you first had this keep made, the innocence of those days and the things you've learned since, and the new appreciations you've gained through the struggles you've had in the process. The other thing catches you is the smell of fresh breakfast being made downstairs, as Laina apparently is already on task.
Travis: Fuck yeah. (all laugh)
Laura: I'll run downstairs. Can't miss that.
Marisha: As I wake up, before we head downstairs, I grab Vax. Did you get back to sleep? Are you all right?
Liam: Yes. You ready for the day?
Marisha: Never? Always. Yeah. No. Sure, let's go!
Liam: You're a born leader. Come on.
Marisha: Thanks.
Matt: You guys come down for breakfast. Laina is currently rushing around, seemingly excited at the prospect of being back in her kitchen, which has been outfitted partially. When she returned, as you know, most everything was stolen from the keep, and it looks like she's made a few trips into town and has purchased enough to make it functional. She comes out and she starts bringing meals; she has large piles of plates. "I'm really quite sorry, but we don't have enough plates for everyone, so if you don't mind sharing for now-- We'll go do some purchases."
Laura: I start grabbing bacon from the big piles.
Marisha: Yeah, same. Communal style.
Matt: "Good. Well, I hope it's okay."
Laura: It's perfect.
Taliesin: Oh, good. Plates. I'll have a plate.
Sam: I'll take one as well.
Liam: I reach in front of the boys and grab a big fistful.
Marisha: Half-elves are just, (gnawing noises).
Matt: As you guys are eating you hear some heavy footfalls coming from around the corner. The first thing you notice is a familiar female face. Once-short red hair has now grown quite long, or at least grown longer to about ear-, chin-length. You see Shayne Tranter, one of the guards that you originally hired and then moved over to Whitestone to guard, walk in, leather armor on, big pack over her shoulder, looks like she's also returned. As she comes in, she throws her pack down--
Marisha: Dwarf, right?
Matt: Human. Human female.
Marisha: Wrong note. Shayne Tranter?
Matt: Shayne Tranter, yeah. She walks in and throws her pack down. "Ah, good morning! Glad to see you're all mostly alive."
Travis: Did you eat already?
Matt: "No, is there food?"
Travis: Too bad, no.
Laura: Help yourself.
Taliesin: Grog, please, there is food.
Sam: But no plates.
Taliesin: But no plates.
Matt: "And you are?"
Sam: Oh, hi there! Just here for a visit. Taryon Darrington. You haven't heard of me yet, but you will. Do you work here? Are you one of our employees?
Matt: "I'm one of their employees, yes."
Sam: Oh, well. They made me an official member now, so.
Matt: "Great, so you'll be the one that pays me, then."
Laura: Oh!
Sam: We will all chip in for whatever your monthly wages will be.
Matt: "Unless I'm mistaken, and-- well, unless you canceled our contract. Mind you, we haven't been guarding the keep for a long time, so I'm not going charge you for the time over that, we appreciate you on that, but we are back on the clock, and this is kind of my only job at the moment, so--"
Laura: Start guarding.
Matt: "All right." And she smiles and sits down, and she grabs a little bit of food and pulls it off into her hand and starts eating off her leather gauntleted glove.
Laura: Taryon, you don't have to worry about paying on this.
Sam: How much do they cost?
Taliesin: A fortune.
Laura: I'm sure I have it written down somewhere. (all laugh)
Taliesin: We have books, there were books, we kept books.
Laura: Yeah, there were books! There was also a dragon attack.
Sam: I fully expect to be treated as a full, paying member of this and I will gladly contribute one-seventh of the salary.
Laura: Really not necessary.
Taliesin: It's quite all right.
Sam: I insist. It's literally nothing to me. (all laugh)
Travis: Someone should teach him the Vox Machina fight song, then.
Laura: You should do it, Grog.
Liam: Oh, yeah, Grog. You have the best voice of all of us.
Travis: Yeah. Do you know the fight song?
Sam: No, no, I've not learned any fight song. Most of the songs that I've learned are either religious in nature or I've read them in books and I've made up my own melodies to them. They were epic poems of yesteryear, and I sort of set them to a little melody, mostly happy--
Travis: You made up songs, then?
Sam: Well, I--
Travis: No, that's good. Each one of these songs is, like, personal, to the member, right? So you make up a song about what Vox Machina means to you.
Sam: I do that?
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: Wow.
Travis: We'll need it by sundown tomorrow.
Sam: Doty, we have some work to do! Working breakfast.
Matt: Doty sits down right next to you.
Sam: Machina, Machina. "Sock in a." Put a sock in a-- no. Vox, Vox. Put it in the box. We'll work on this.
Laura: I'm scouring my notes for where I wrote their salaries down.
Taliesin: That was a long time ago.
Laura: It was, but I've got my spiral here.
Sam: They're 100 gold a month for five of them, and then 50 gold a month for the other two. That's Vex's memory.
Laura: That's my memory! 100 gold a month for each of the guards, and then what was the extra?
Sam: Five of them get 100 gold a month and two of them get 50 gold a month. I don't remember why or who, but that's how-- I think the guards get 100 and the cooks get 50, or something?
Matt: Servants get 50, yeah.
Marisha: See, as I wrote down, I believe Shayne, Cordell, Jarett, Kendrick, and Nitebe get 100 a month.
Laura: And then we always gave Jarett a bonus because he was captain.
Marisha: Yeah. And because he was hot.
Matt: Yeah. Well. There you go. Although Jarett is technically not on your payroll anymore. Jarett's now a member of the Pale Guard in Whitestone.
Laura: Yeah, I remember.
Marisha: That's right. So, reducing our costs. We're getting better at this.
Laura: Do you know where the rest of the crew is, Shayne?
Matt: "Kendrick is currently watching up on the wall. Nitebe, I haven't seen since you sent him off to Wildmount."
Laura: Right.
Matt: And she gets a distant stare for a second and says, "Well, Cordell didn't make it through the ordeal."
Taliesin: Really?
Matt: You can see her kind of-- she has that look of somebody who lost a close friend. She gets a distant stare for a second, clenches her jaw, and then shakes her head and goes back to eating absentmindedly.
Marisha: We should have some sort of service, then, or at least a dinner in Cordell's honor.
Matt: "That's up to you. I've already had mine. My piece has been said."
Laura: Well, we're glad to have you back.
Matt: "Me, too."
Taliesin: Glad so many of us survived.
Matt: "Not everyone."
Laura: Do any of us remember why Nitebe went to Wildmount?
Matt: You sent him a long time ago to look for information about the Briarwoods.
Taliesin: Oh no!
Laura: Oh no!
Travis: We made him a snack!
Laura: We did?
Travis: He turned into a Hot Pocket, y'all!
Taliesin: Did we fight his undead body in the crypt? Is that-- oh.
Matt: You have not crossed his path.
Laura: Oh no, we killed our guard?
Matt: You haven't heard anything from him in a long time.
Taliesin: Vox Machina, not returning your calls since 1992.
Marisha: Vox Machina, not returning your calls since 1992.
Matt: To be fair, spies, by nature, live a very dangerous lifestyle that they accept. Who knows what his whereabouts are or if he'll ever show up again, but you haven't heard from him.
Laura: Maybe he just took our money and ran?
Matt: It's also very possible.
Laura: I doubt it, though.
Taliesin: I would feel better about that, but probably not.
Marisha: I can try and scry.
Taliesin: I just like the notion that maybe if we just checked one more of those cells in the dungeon of Whitestone--
Marisha: Want me to scry on Nitebe? I can.
Taliesin: You know, I'll say just because I'm curious where this particular rabbit hole leads--
Travis: Really?
Laura: Maybe.
Taliesin: It's not like we're going to go wherever--
Travis: We're just eating breakfast. Go for it!
Laura: Yeah, just scry while we're eating breakfast.
Marisha: All right. I scry on Nitebe.
Liam: I like that this is our breakfast entertainment.
Taliesin: This is our version of looking at our phones. This is Vox Machina going--
Laura: What do you see? Has he posted anything on Facebook lately?
Travis: Have we figured out how to project this on a 55-inch flat wall monitor for us yet?
Marisha: Actually, good question!
Taliesin: Yes, but the frame rate is only 120 frames per second.
Marisha: Yeah, it's only in black and white.
Liam: He posted on Instagram six weeks ago and that was it.
Matt: All right. So, are you doing Scry on Nitebe?
Marisha: Yeah.
Laura: What do your scrying eyes see, Keyleth?
Matt: So as you eat your breakfast, you take a moment. You finish the small ritual on the center of the cold stone floor of your mess hall area of the keep. You focus on your fuzzy but decent enough memory of Nitebe. As the ritual completes, your vision focuses out for a second and then returns to you. There's no focus. There's no Nitebe.
Laura: Oh no!
Travis: He's a Jolly Rancher in the belly of Craven Edge!
Taliesin: What?
Marisha: I'm afraid the insane things that Grog just said is correct.
Travis: I am a powerful magician.
Marisha: Yes.
Liam: A happy ranch hand in the--
Travis: Yeah, he's on the farm! He's running through the fields of the farm, happy as can be. All the room to run he wants! (laughs)
Laura: This is actually very terrible.
Taliesin: This is really sad in the weirdest way.
Travis: I mean, yes. This is very dark, dark time.
Laura: That's terrible.
Marisha: Travis!
Taliesin: I know. I can't.
Liam: We're laughing at ourselves. We haven't thought of this guy in 72 years!
Taliesin: Pre-stream! It's been since pre-stream that this has come up.
Liam: Yeah.
Taliesin: Okay. Wow.
Laura: Well.
Travis: Zero focus. Nothing.
Matt: There's no creature to receive the scrying spell.
Liam: My breakfast is not tasting as good.
Matt: Which means he's either on another plane of existence... or he's fucking dead! (all laugh)
Taliesin: Is that this version of "He's in the Feywild. Everything's fine right now."
Matt: You sent him to the great spy farm upstate.
Marisha: Whatever timeline you believe in.
Laura: At least we've avenged him, in a way.
Sam: Did he have a family? What was his mother's name? (all laugh)
Sam: Because we might want to send her a gift or some sort of a tribute in coin.
Laura: Yeah, I'll get right on that. Yeah.
Marisha: There's got to be public record, right?
Laura: Yeah. Yeah. Anywho. We're down a few servants, we should probably get some more guards. Hey, Shayne, do you have anyone you'd recommend?
Matt: "Honestly, me and Cordell worked as a team for a long time. We didn't really make friends. I can go looking in the city for you?"
Travis: No.
Laura: That's all right.
Taliesin: Keep your eyes open. We trust your judgment.
Matt: "Unless you want to go look for yourself? I don't mind going and finding some good candidates."
Laura: Find a few more?
Matt: "Yeah."
Marisha: I feel like the city is pretty overwhelmed at the moment, though.
Matt: "Up to you."
Laura: A lot of keeps have been ruined. Guards might be looking for work, actually.
Matt: "Yeah. People looking for work right now. You look like you've got more important things to focus on, so if you want to hire some guards and you have trust in me, throw me some cash and I can probably bring some people in."
Marisha: How do you feel about your workload? Do you feel like you can handle this?
Matt: "I can handle it." She shakes the bit of scrambled eggs from her gauntleted hand.
Laura: Good leading. Good leading, Keyleth.
Travis: How's your keep bandwidth right now? Is your plate full?
Laura: This is shitty. Can I roll for insight and make sure that she's trustworthy? I feel like she's trustworthy, but--
Matt: Totally.
Laura: I rolled poorly for my insight--
Matt: What did you roll? Even if you roll poorly, with the bonuses.
Laura: 13?
Matt: 13. She seems pretty straight.
Laura: All right.
Matt: She's straight with you. She's not trying to layer it at all.
Taliesin: We've got a trip to take, so perhaps when we get back, we can audition some new candidates. That'll be fun. You'll enjoy that.
Sam: Yes! I would enjoy anything.
Taliesin: Oh, it's quite fun. It's quite nice.
Sam: I love me some fun.
Travis: Are you going to audition these new guards like we did you?
Matt: "Oh, I can figure something out. Don't worry."
Laura: I like it. Make sure they're trustworthy, if we're not going to be around. And I hand her 500 gold for herself and for Kendrick.
Matt: Yes.
Laura: And the three that you hire.
Matt: "All right. I'll get on it, then. I think I should have some time to go into town and do this here within the afternoon." She grabs another roll off the table and takes a bite of it. "Glad to have you back." And she turns around and leaves the room.
Travis: I like her.
Laura: She's cool.
Travis: Yep. Doesn't say too much.
Taliesin: Now I remember why we hired her in the first place.
Travis: Because she fought well! She fought a giant fucking scorpion in the courtyard. What are we doing today?
Marisha: Well, we talked about going to the Cobalt Reserve to drop off this--
Laura: To drop off the evil book and do a little research on the Nine fucking Hells.
Marisha: And then--
Taliesin: We need to do a bit of shopping, but then we do have-- you're not quite done, are you?
Marisha: I mean, there's that.
Taliesin: I'm putting it out there.
Liam: Yeah, you up for it?
Travis: What?
Laura: She's got to get crowned.
Travis: (laughs)
Taliesin: Wow! I watched that work its way from your ear all the way to your brain, there!
Travis: You're going to get crowned? Really?
Taliesin: It got lost on the way! It was amazing.
Laura: Even larger antlers?
Travis: Wow!
Marisha: Yeah, it's weird. I don't know.
Travis: Does it sit on your head, or on the antlers?
Taliesin: They decorate it, like a winter's festival.
Liam: They put antlers on the antlers.
Matt: You do actually know, though you've never seen anyone wear it, because in the time that you've been learning, there hasn't been a formal Voice of the Tempest, it's not a crown. It's more of a mantle. It's a ceremonial mantle.
Laura: So you just hold it like a giant mantle?
Marisha: Well, not like a fireplace mantle. Although I could, technically, transform into a fireplace now.
Travis: Why?
Marisha: Because I'm a badass.
Laura: (gasps) You could turn into doors!
Marisha: You know, I could, I'm pretty sure.
Matt: Creature!
Marisha: No, I could! Hang on, hang on!
Laura: A mimic!
Marisha: A mimic! Couldn't I turn into a mimic that could be a door? Or a mantle?
Matt: Well, you haven't seen a door mimic before. Because I don't hate you that much yet.
Liam: We haven't seen a base mimic before.
Laura: Yeah, we have!
Liam: In this game?
Matt: You have seen a mimic, yeah.
Liam: I don't remember it.
Matt: That was second session.
Liam: Ooh, shizz-nap!
Matt: Yeah. That was second. A mimic and a gelatinous cube in the same combat. I was like, "Hi guys! Welcome to D&D! (splat noise)"
Liam: That I remember, yeah.
Taliesin: Was I at that one?
Matt: No, you weren't at that one, unfortunately. That was before you came back to the campaign.
Marisha: Can I be a door?
Laura: I think it's a no.
Matt: I'll look at Shapechange.
Marisha: We'll think about it. Anyway.
Matt: I'm pretty sure it's just creatures.
Marisha: It's fine.
Laura: Okay! What are we fucking doing? What are we doing?
Matt: It's "different creature." If you encounter a door-shaped creature in the future, you can totally do that.
Taliesin: Please! I'm sure you're having all sorts of reservations and thoughts and processes about this notion, but I will admit, I have yet to introduce your sister to the best part of being titled, which is dressing up. And it would be a coronation! We could get some clothes! We could wear something lovely.
Liam: Does that jive with your hometown, though, Kiki? Dressing up?
Marisha: Yeah.
Taliesin: It's a sign of respect.
Travis: Do all people with titles have to dress up?
Taliesin: Yes.
Travis: Are you sure?
Taliesin: I am.
Marisha: We're very open-minded.
Laura: Oh, Grand Poobah. I'm afraid you have to wear something quite formal.
Travis: You know what? Breakfast is disagreeing with me. I think I have to go back to bed.
Taliesin: Heavy is the head that wears the crown.
Travis: (gags) Yeah, I don't feel well. I've got to go. I go back up to my room.
Matt: (laughs) Grog storms off.
Laura: I really thought we were going to get him to bathe this time.
Marisha: Does he have an aversion to wearing pants?
Taliesin: I'm sure we can work out something without pants.
Laura: (laughs) Just a belt. A really glorious belt. Over the dwarven belt.
Marisha: All blinged out.
Liam: It's like a kilt that's barely joined at the bottom already. It's like a poopy diaper.
Taliesin: Just get him boots that go all the way up to the neck.
Liam: It literally is a poopy diaper.
Matt: Poopy diaper of dwarvenkind.
Laura: Gross!
Taliesin: Activate number one or number two.
Travis: Battle kilt.
Laura: Seriously, though, what are we doing?
Liam: Well, we're in town. We've got this book and a library, but we should decide what we're going to do tomorrow. What's to wait? Why don't we go home?
Marisha: (stammers) Well, it's just weird. It's just weird. It's been so long. It's a lot of build-up, and then it's going to be over.
Liam: You are adorable right now.
Marisha: I'm serious!
Laura: Maybe your dad will have information on the Nine Hells.
Marisha: He could, yeah. It's just, my whole life has been building up to this, and if we complete it, that makes it real.
Laura: Wait, I do have a question, actually. If you complete it, do they want you to stay?
Marisha: If I complete it, then I am the Voice of the Tempest. I imagine I can do whatever I want. Right?
Laura: Or you stay and lead your people.
Liam: Yeah. Does the Tempest go on road trips?
Marisha: I don't know.
Liam: Oh.
Taliesin: Has your life been leading up to this moment, or has your life been leading up to everything that happens after this moment?
Marisha: I'm not entirely sure of the difference of what you just said.
Taliesin: I'm just saying, as somebody who spent several years of their life avoiding the one thing that would make them even remotely happy, maybe just barreling through it is the way to go. We'll be there!
Marisha: I guess it is that notion of leading up to this one moment that you've thought of for a while. Once you complete that, what happens next?
Laura: It's just like getting married, Keyleth.
Marisha: Is it, though? Yeah?
Laura: It's all the planning. That just freaks you out, that's all.
Marisha: Yeah, sure.
Liam: What do you know about that?
Taliesin: I was going to say, is that theoretical or experiential?
Laura: Theoretical, obviously!
Taliesin: Okay. Just checking.
Liam: She does read a lot. Or she used to.
Taliesin: She still reads a lot.
Laura: I do! (laughs)
Liam: Are you sharing a library?
Taliesin: Lots of things.
Liam: Yeah, yeah. I don't need to hear about it.
Taliesin: No, you don't. That's why I was so excited that you pried.
Marisha: It's whatever you guys think is best. We can go to Westruun first, or we can go to Zephra first. Just whatever you want.
Liam: Oh, that's a big decision for you to make, I think.
Marisha: No, it's the difference of a day or two, right?
Matt: You hear the heavy footfalls upstairs of Grog's feet and a door slamming shut.
Taliesin: He took his time.
Marisha: Do we need an extra day to convince Grog to wear pants? That could be the deciding factor! Maybe we should put it on him. Right?
Laura: Keyleth!
Marisha: What?
Laura: Make a decision.
Marisha: (groans)
Laura: Leader. You're going to be a leader. Just make a choice.
Liam: Everybody else believes in you. Why shouldn't you?
Taliesin: Pencil or pen?
Marisha: (laughs)
Laura: I'm looking forward to buying a dress either way.
Marisha: Let's check in at Westruun. Drop off the book.
Laura: And see how you feel.
Marisha: We'll head from Westruun to Zephra.
Laura: Good plan.
Marisha: All right.
Taliesin: You're going to be very good at this.
Marisha: Man! Decision-making is hard.
Taliesin: I know.
Marisha: So many choices.
Laura: So wait. (valley girl voice) Would the shops here be better to buy a dress than the shops in Westruun?
Taliesin: Wow!
Marisha: Good question! Who's importing more? Where's fashion week happening?
Liam: They're both handicapped, aren't they?
Laura: That's what I mean.
Matt: They've both been under some recent duress, so it really could go either way. Emon is definitely more of the cultural hub, especially since it's such a huge port town. You get a lot more cultural influence from other continents and heavier trade. Emon would probably have better outfits. But Westruun-- which, Grog, you grew up in, and you guys have spent some time in-- does have its own textiles district. There are weddings that happen there. They have other events where they sell fine--
Liam: What's Westruun like? Pittsburgh?
Matt: You could say, yeah.
Travis: It's like Wisconsin.
Taliesin: Okay, that's less disappointing.
Matt: Emon's the New York. Westruun's the Pittsburgh.
Taliesin: Whitestone's the Boulder.
Matt: Kind of, yeah! (laughs)
Taliesin: It's Boulder, Colorado.
Liam: Yeah, I like it!
Taliesin: There's nothing happening.
Travis: Boulder, baby.
Laura: But it's beautiful.
Marisha: If it's the Pittsburgh, then we should go now, because everything closes at five.
Liam: We could also Tree Stride to Vasselheim for the fanciest of shopping. If you want to go all-out.
Taliesin: In theory, they'll have your crest on file. That's one of those things, any dressmaker would actually know how to assemble something appropriate for any house of any nobility that exists.
Laura: You know what? Vasselheim will actually know a little bit about Orcus and I bet the Nine Hells, as well, being the god hub.
Taliesin: Ooh, a work vacation.
Marisha: We did mention if we wanted to drop off the book at Westruun or Vasselheim--
Laura: We should go to Vasselheim!
Marisha: Do we want to do that instead?
Laura: Decision's fucking made. Let's go.
Marisha: All right! Let's go to Vasselheim.
Sam: I've never been. That sounds great!
Marisha: How far north have you been, Tary?
Sam: Quite far north. Right? I'm from the north?
Marisha: You're from Wildmount, correct?
Matt: You're from Wildmount, which is-- as far as you know, from where you grew up, Tal'Dorei is to the southwest of where you grew up. Issylra, which is where Vasselheim is, and Othanzia is far to the east.
Liam: First there was the dinosaurs.
Sam: But I lived in the north of that place.
Matt: You lived in the north of Wildmount. It's pretty Siberian, you would consider it.
Sam: Yeah.
Liam: I want to go to there.
Sam: I thrive in cold places. Is this such a place?
Marisha: It is quite chilly.
Taliesin: Not as cold as my home, but it'll do.
Sam: I have some excellent cold-weather robes in my bag of holding that I would love to flaunt.
Laura: Let's go.
Marisha: Let's go.
Taliesin: We also probably need a few healing potions and such, and we'll probably have better luck somewhere else.
Laura: Yeah.
Taliesin: Yes!
Marisha: Anything else we need to do before we leave Emon?
Sam: They'll have potions and things there?
Taliesin: We probably need to stock up a bit.
Sam: Yes. They'll have these things at Vasselheim?
Laura: Yeah.
Sam: Great.
Travis: You don't just have some health potions in your armor? You can't just plink one out of your nutsack or something?
Sam: I'm going to reach onto my robe and pull out a patch that produces four healing potions.
Travis: What?!
Matt: There you go.
Laura: Are they regular, or are they greater?
Sam: They're regular.
Laura: Oh. All right.
Travis: That's great!
Laura: That's pretty cool.
Travis: Man! We should tear you apart limb from limb and see what fucking shakes out!
Sam: Please don't.
Liam: Does that regenerate and come back? Is it one time only?
Sam: No, but I'll just buy another one if I run out.
Travis: Another robe?
Sam: Yeah.
Travis: Wow.
Taliesin: It's like a four-pack of medieval Five-Hour Energy drink.
Matt: Basically.
Sam: It's literally Monster Energy.
Taliesin: That's like a 1st-level healing potion.
Marisha: Tary, Vasselheim does get a little bit--
Liam: They don't like magic.
Sam: They don't like magic?
Laura: Arcane magic.
Marisha: Arcane magic.
Sam: I practice alchemic magic, mostly, so I'll be okay. I think.
Taliesin: You might want to keep a low profile.
Matt: Alchemical elements, yes. But a lot of your spells and infusing everything is arcane-based. And you have a giant arcane metal man following you around.
Sam: Oh! Maybe I should disguise Doty in some way.
Marisha: Can you do that?
Sam: No. (all laugh)
Sam: I can throw a cloth over him or--
Laura: Make him look like he's just a big dude wearing a robe with a hood over his head.
Taliesin: Or a ghost.
Sam: Or a ghost! Is it Halloween?
Marisha: I don't think so.
Taliesin: It is sadly not Hallow's Eve. We can put him in some armor or some fake cloth of some sort.
Laura: Let's just put a robe over him.
Sam: Could you and I craft something for him before the journey, like a face mask of some sort that makes him look like a brave warrior?
Liam: I mean, I am really good at disguises. I haven't flexed those muscles in a while, but--
Laura: Let him give it a go.
Sam: You can make disguises?
Liam: I can work with a little bit of nose putty, and yeah, I can make a fake face for this guy.
Sam: That I would love to see.
Matt: As best as you understand, it isn't like, "Oh my god, there's some sort of magic source in Vasselhiem, arrest everyone involved." It's not super illegal, it's just generally frowned upon and calls suspicion.
Sam: No, I want to pursue you making a mask for Doty.
Liam: So do I. I feel really rusty.
Laura: I want to help him because I'm a rogue, too.
Taliesin: Well let's go full Cinderella on this. Let's get all the mice involved.
Liam: What do we want this guy to look like?
Sam: Well, I mean, there's no disguising the fact that he's eight feet tall and squeaks when he walks. (all laugh)
Liam: Should we turn him into a goliath, then?
Sam: I mean, are we going to do full body paint for this?
Laura: What if we just put a stealth cloak over him or something?
Liam: Stealth cloak? Do you have a stealth cloak?
Laura: Yeah, then paint his-- yeah, I do.
Taliesin: Let's make him look like a goliath that wears a lot of robes because he was horribly scarred.
Laura: I start taking robes out.
Taliesin: Grog, how do you feel about this? I feel like you have the look--
Laura: Grog's upstairs.
Taliesin: Oh, you're upstairs, you're not actually here. Never mind.
Marisha: He's upset about the notion of pants.
Taliesin: I know.
Sam: Making him look like he is in a suit of armor seems like a thing.
Taliesin: We could put him in a suit of armor.
Sam: He's already metal.
Laura: Fine. I take all of the robes off. Do whatever you want.
Taliesin: Is Doty strong enough to wear a suit of armor?
Sam: He's strong.
Matt: I mean, decorative.
Taliesin: Yes, decorative.
Matt: Yeah. Doty is his own suit of armor.
Laura: Why are we doing this?
Taliesin: Because this is funny.
Matt: Because it's amazing.
Travis: He's a giant automaton!
Laura: Just wear a robe!
Taliesin: I'm having a wonderful time.
Sam: I want Doty with a fake nose. That's all I want.
Travis: Yeah, yeah, do that!
Taliesin: Groucho Marx nose and glasses. (all laugh)
Liam: I'm going to need your help because I'm not used to working on robots. You can make some mesh work, right? And we can get some clay, and some spectacles like yours, but maybe shaded. Yeah?
Travis: He's only got the one pair now.
Taliesin: We can make him a mask at the very least.
Liam: Yeah.
Taliesin: All right.
Liam: I have made masks for myself.
Marisha: This is going to look ridiculous!
Matt: I'm so excited.
Marisha: Everyone's going to be like, that's a robot wearing a mask!
Taliesin: No, it's just a man with no arms, legs, heads, limbs and chest.
Liam: We don't have to, I mean--
Taliesin: No, we're doing it.
Sam: Let's spend some time.
Taliesin: Everyone else can get their little run-around of Westruun done while we sit making a robot.
Matt: Okay. So, Vax, needing materials to prepare such an elaborate--
Liam: Hey, give me some money. I don't have any money. I never have money.
Laura: You need money to go buy a stupid mask for a stupid robot?
Liam: This is the first time in this entire goddamn campaign--
Laura: No, it's not.
Liam: Yes, it is.
Laura: No, it isn't.
Liam: Give me some fucking money.
Sam: Or, I can give you money.
Liam: I want her money.
Sam: All right.
Liam: Thanks.
Taliesin: It is important for him to express himself.
Laura: I have passed out money lately, before, I think.
Liam: I throw myself off of things for this one, she can't give me 50 gold pieces.
Laura: Fine!
Liam: Thank you.
Laura: How about everybody gets a thousand gold.
Liam: It's a party!
Travis: Really?
Laura: Yeah, everybody take a thousand gold.
Sam: Me too?
Laura: Except for you. (all laugh)
Liam: Hey, Matt?
Matt: Yeah?
Liam: Do I have this ability? I feel like I remember it, but I'm looking through--
Travis: You don't know?! (all laugh)
Taliesin: Oh no!
Matt: I'm pretty sure you do! I think you have a disguise kit. It's not an ability per se.
Liam: I have Imposter, right?
Matt: Right, you have Imposter.
Liam: That's me, can I use it on a robot?
Sam: By the way, Liam, if you don't have this ability, I want to see this even more.
Liam: Oh, we're doing it.
Marisha: Just bluff your way through it.
Matt: No, because Imposter is the ability to mimic somebody else. It has nothing to do-- A disguise kit is what you're using.
Liam: And I've always had a disguise kit.
Matt: Correct.
Liam: Because I did something back in the home game, I did something.
Matt: Yeah, you've done a couple of things. But it's not an ability you have.
Liam: No?
Matt: Well, you do have an ability, but it's only for you, it's not for Doty.
Taliesin: You own a cardboard box with a bunch of stuff.
Matt: So here's what we do. First and foremost, you have to go to the town and gather supplies because your disguise kit is designed for very small prosthetics and things. This is a large endeavor.
Liam: This is five times that.
Matt: Yeah. So I'm going to need you to roll an investigation check. This is your ability to go around the town and find, through the midst of chaos of Emon trying to repair itself, somebody who can sell you the supplies necessary.
Liam: Well, that is a 20.
Taliesin: I need some clay.
Matt: A natural 20?
Liam: No, not a natural 20.
Matt: But a 20? That's still fine. All right, it takes you--
Taliesin: I gave him a list.
Matt: It takes you about three hours, round trip, to go into the city, locate the location, and purchase-- relatively inexpensive, comparatively, about ten gold pieces for materials to do this. Which is expensive for anyone who's just-- and a lot of it is burlap material that's gone over with a weatherproofing liquid, that when it solidifies, it gives almost a rubbery texture. It's used for carts that are traveling a long distance under bad weather. And you figure that might resemble some sort of a skin-type texture at a distance. You gather other elements to build a mask, to wrap things in material, to block things that might look metallic. So yeah, so you gather things that might work in your favor. So as you collect this, what are you guys working on?
Sam: We're making a mask?
Taliesin: Well, the first thing that we're going to need, is we're going to need a way of connecting this to him without limiting his movement, so I'm making so it's a very accessible, easy harness to get this on and off. And starting to design and put together how we're going to-- what I'd like to make is a couple-- a porcelain cover for the hands and face so that it actually looks like perhaps-- it won't draw immediate suspicion, but if it does, it will look like somebody with an artificial limb, maybe they've been hurt.
Liam: Get me ten sets of scissors.
Matt: (laughs) So are you crafting the porcelain?
Taliesin: I am. I've got the kiln.
Matt: Yes, but your materials, you're used to using--
Taliesin: Instead of porcelain, I'm going for the ceramics that I use for some of my build. It's more practical. I've been working on some jewelry shit, I could genuinely learn how to do this.
Matt: This is true, but the skillset for jewelry is very different from the skillset of porcelain.
Liam: I need you to make a rig, like in a video game. Can you do that?
Laura: I'm going go into town and buy some plates for Laina.
Matt: Okay. I will say--
Taliesin: I'm willing to have this--
Sam: We could just use mud from outside.
Matt: Do you have a set of potter's tools? Because that would be specifically what would be used for this, if you're going to be working with ceramics and porcelain.
Taliesin: Can I roll to see? Because I have a kiln, so I might have it, but I don't know if I have it--
Matt: But you have a kiln that's designed more for-- it's more of a metal-use forge.
Taliesin: It's more of a metal-use forge.
Matt: So it'll destroy ceramics. It burns at a certain heat.
Travis: This could be the dumbest--
Marisha: This is the best thing we've ever wasted time on.
Matt: I'm so excited.
Taliesin: If prototype one fails, I'll make it out of pewter.
Matt: Okay. This is an adjacent skill set. You're not going to get your proficiency bonus to it, but you do have materials to essentially try it. I want you to go ahead and roll a base dexterity check. Just add your dexterity modifier. You're not proficient.
Taliesin: I'm trusting in Gil, because he also can't make a pot.
Travis: Say the thing, say the incantation!
Taliesin: Mecca lecca high, mecca hiney ho, don't fuck me, Gil.
Marisha: Where are those pottery tools, Gil?
Taliesin: And those pottery tools are--
Marisha: (laughs) It's a good roll.
Taliesin: 22.
Matt: 22. It takes you the better part of the next two hours, but you manage to create some--
Taliesin: Thank you for helping me Ghost, by the way. Never mind.
Matt: They have to cool and harden, but in the process of crafting it and heating it, you do have some decent ceramic plates that you think might work. They're going to be fragile.
Taliesin: That's fine.
Matt: Not like they'll crumble on their own walking, but, if they take any sort of chip and damage the ceramic.
Taliesin: Hands and face is what I was hoping for.
Matt: I'll say the better part of two hours or so to craft them, and then you begin to heat them in the kiln. It'll take you a while for them to harden and set.
Taliesin: Okay, and we're just figuring out a little easy armature that won't get in his way. And I'm peeking at him, seeing how he works--
Matt: All right. The armature, roll tinker's kit. Check. Proficiency plus dex.
Sam: I'm going to-- oh, sorry.
Taliesin: You can assist.
Matt: Actually, this would be proficiency plus intellect, is what it would be, because this is trying to figure it out specifically.
Taliesin: I'd be happy for an assist, unless you're doing something.
Sam: I was going upstairs to ask one of the help something.
Taliesin: Oh, go ahead, okay, that's fine. I'll just work on your robot by myself, then. 21.
Matt: Okay, easy enough to figure out a harness. What are you doing, Tary?
Sam: What was the servant's name who you said used to have short hair, now long?
Matt: Shayne.
Sam: I go to her? Him?
Matt: It's a her. She will punch you so hard.
Sam: I offer to buy her hair for 100 gold pieces to use as a wig.
Matt: How do you say this? (all laugh)
Matt: She's literally outside, sitting on the outside wall of the gate, leaning forward, just on a stool, with a loaded crossbow over her lap, looking out at the distance. And you're down below, about 20 feet down.
Sam: You there, excuse me. Hello?
Matt: She looks over the top. "Yeah?"
Sam: Hi! Taryon Darrington. New member of the group. Hi.
Matt: "Hi."
Sam: Yes, we're working on a very important project. It's an undercover mission in a foreign land, and we're going to need a disguise. Specifically, a wig, a convincing wig. We all thought that it might be a good idea to have some real hair for this wig, and, well, you have beautiful hair. I wouldn't mind if you would lend it to the cause. I'd like to buy your hair for 100 gold pieces. (all laugh)
Matt: Go ahead and roll a persuasion check.
Liam: Oh my god, where's Shorthalt when you need him?
Laura: Did he roll well?
Taliesin: I'm not saying.
Sam: Persuasion? 24.
Matt: She goes, "You're kidding me, right?"
Sam: Oh, no, no, no. And I reach into my bag of holding and pull out 100 gold and say, it would mean a lot to me and to my teammates if you would cooperate in this mission. It might even save a life.
Matt: She gives you this long, stern, dark look. "(laughs) Make it 500 and you got a deal."
Sam: 500? All right, fine. (all laugh)
Sam: And a bargain at that.
Matt: "Ah, it was getting too long, anyway." She makes her way down the ladder and just walks past you into the keep. Comes back about half an hour later, head completely shaved smooth, and she's got, in a little square of fabric, a cluster of all of her red hair. She balls it up, comes over.
Sam: A pleasure doing business with you. This haircut might very well be the fate of the world, so thank you.
Matt: "You're welcome."
Sam: Here's your money.
Matt: "Thank you. Here's your fucking hair. God damn weirdo." And walks off and heads back to her perch at the top of the wall.
Sam: Buy my book! (all laugh)
Matt: Okay. You now have Shayne's hair--
Sam: I'm going to try and make a wig out of it.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Don't really know how.
Laura: It's just a bunch of pieces of hair.
Sam: Glue? I've got alchemy, right? I can make, like, goop?
Taliesin: You want a-- no, nope, I'm not helping. Never mind. Don't want to help.
Matt: You can. Do you want to do that?
Sam: Make some goop. Some glue to put on it.
Matt: We'll say, using the basis of a tanglefoot bag, which is a very simple alchemical--
Sam: Oh, it's got goo in it, yeah.
Travis: I mean, I can make a gallon of it.
Matt: You begin to apply it to the top of Doty's head, and begin to very carefully layer hair across it. I'm going to need-- let's see-- (laughs) I love you guys so much.
Laura: How long does goop last? Will Doty just always have hair now?
Sam: I mean, it's pretty sticky.
Laura: Gross.
Matt: Go ahead and make-- just make a dexterity check.
Sam: Okay. Okay. Ooh. Not good. I'm feeling lucky. 17.
Matt: 17. (laughs) So it looks a little Carrot Toppy, but it works. These clusters of poofy red hair, but you layer it in a way that looks as good as you can, given the fact that you glued hair to Doty's head. (all laugh)
Matt: It could've gone a lot worse. From a distance, this kind of looks like a person.
Sam: I also gave him a little bit of--
Matt: Little bit of goatee?
Sam: Just to match me.
Matt: Okay, yeah, great. You now have--
Travis: Do you mean the fu man, or did you give him the full goatee? Because you just did the fu manchu.
Sam: Probably just the fu man.
Matt: All right, there you go.
Laura: But it's going to be covered by a mask.
Sam: Oh, yeah. Oh, shit.
Matt: You've crafted your own avatar.
Liam: Is the hair curly or straight?
Matt: It's a little wavy.
Liam: Wavy, okay.
Matt: Her hair had been short before, when it grew out long, it came out a little wavy. So yeah, it has a little bit of a-- it looks like... What was the actor's name? From Mask?
All: Eric Stoltz?
Matt: Kind of looks like that on Doty.
Taliesin: Critical Role, ladies and gentlemen. Eric Stoltz. Google it.
Marisha: Cher was great in that.
Matt: It's a great movie.
Liam: I thought you were going to go Ronald McDonald, so that's a step up.
Matt: Yeah, see? But that's kind of the texture and the look of the hair, from what I recall it.
Sam: Okay, we've set the stage.
Laura: Wow.
Sam: Vax, bring us home.
Matt: So, with the porcelain cooling off, Vax comes back with the rest of the supplies. (all laugh)
Liam: Oh, good gods! What did you make, what did you do?
Sam: He's not just the president, he's a member, too! (all laugh)
Matt: What's fantastic, is he's glued the facial hair before the porcelain mask was put on, so as Percy and Vax come in with their pieces--
Taliesin: All right, I've got the-- Oh, good God!
Laura: (laughs)
Liam: I mean, it's bad. It's really bad.
Taliesin: No, it's-- I mean, like, it's--
Liam: It's a start. I think the hair will actually help the molding clay stay in place.
Taliesin: We're going to put a little wrap, it'll be fine.
Sam: And you've got hands?
Liam: (sighs)
Taliesin: Oh, yes, that too. Yes.
Sam: Ah, excellent. Excellent.
Liam: All right. We collectively are Dr. Frankenstein.
Laura: (laughs)
Marisha: Oh my gosh.
Liam: Let's make this happen.
Sam: (laughs)
Matt: Okay. So, you put on the harness. You get the ceramic plates on that can loosely appear to be smoother, and a little more of a general curvature to the joints, so that it looks more natural from a distance. You put on the-- The mask of porcelain that you made, I mean, you know, the facial hair that's underneath and is on Doty's face is going to be under the mask.
Taliesin: Yes. Thank God.
Matt: You could attempt to remove it, if you'd like.
Liam: No, I think that'll help--
Taliesin: No, no.
Sam: No. We'll leave it.
Liam: -- it'll help hold all it in place.
Sam: Just a little glue to help stick it there.
Taliesin: In case we're in combat and it comes out, maybe we'll get, like, a momentary element of surprise as they go, 'My God, what is that?'
Matt: Plus it's just good to know that, at any given point in time, Doty now has a secret goatee. (all laugh)
Matt: That only you know about.
Sam: I had extra hair, I wanted to use it.
Taliesin: #secretgoatee. (all laugh)
Matt: #secretgoatee. (all laugh)
Marisha: #secretgoatee. (all laugh)
Taliesin: What is this episode? What--
Liam: Oh my God.
Marisha: This is the worst thing!
Matt: All right. Play 'em home, keyboard cat. Roll a disguise kit.
Liam: Oh, all right. I'm going to try to make this a--
Travis: (keyboard sounds)
Liam: What number do I use for the disguise kit? Dexterity?
Matt: No, this would be-- hold on, the toolkit here-- with you it would be-- Yeah, because it is--
Liam: Because I'm a rogue.
Matt: It's how nimble your fingers are. It's a dexterity bonus plus the proficiency modifier for a disguise kit. If you are proficient with this kit, with the disguise kit?
Liam: Oh, my gods.
Matt: What are your proficiencies?
Liam: I don't think so. I mean, I don't know, so I'm just going to say no.
Matt: Then it's just dexterity.
Liam: Dexterity.
Matt: Just roll a d20, add your dex bonus.
Liam: Okay. All right, I'm going to go for like, a General Krieg-type look to the face? I'm going to do my best--
Matt: Okay.
Liam: -- to redheaded General Krieg?
Laura: Nice.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Okay, here we go. I'm going to use Luck.
Laura: (laughs)
Liam: I'm going to use Luck.
Matt: (laughs) Are you sure?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: Are you sure?
Laura: Are you sure?
Liam: I'm quite sure. Natural 20!
Laura: Oh my God. (all cheer)
Liam: General Krieg, it's good to see ya!
Matt: In spite of the absurdity of what you've managed to accomplish with the better part of your day, as the sun is now setting, and the rest of you have been wondering what the fuck is going on down there, you manage to build some semblance of a muscular structure underneath the robes. And amongst the porcelain mask that Percy had set as a base, you have crafted texture, color, it looks kind of like a face.
Taliesin: It looks like Lincoln from Disneyland! (all laugh)
Matt: It does! It looks like a shitty animatronic. Which means--
Sam: I was the sixteenth president. (all laugh)
Matt: Like, it really does.
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: Like, not a good Disney animatronic. Like, state fair animatronic.
Marisha: Sure.
Travis: Yeah.
Taliesin: Chuck E. Cheese.
Liam: Chuck E. Cheese.
Laura: Chuck E. Cheese.
Matt: Yeah. This has been through a few fires.
Marisha: Yeah, I was just going to say, been through a fire!
Travis: (animatronic sounds)
Matt: Yeah, it's Bonnie Springs. It's straight-up Bonnie Springs. But, given the circumstances, not too bad!
Taliesin: Boys, I'm so proud of both of you.
Liam: Guys, art is subjective, all right? Put clothes on top of this thing and we're golden, I think.
Laura: #BrianFosterSmellsLikeCabbage. (all laugh)
Liam: Happy St. Patrick's Day, everybody!
Taliesin: I'm quite pleased. I'm quite pleased.
Sam: I didn't think that Doty could be improved, but you all impressed me today. Thank you. Thank you for this.
Taliesin: Good work, everybody.
Sam: Good work.
Taliesin: Good work, everybody.
Sam: Yes.
Liam: Good teamwork.
Sam: Teamwork!
Liam: Yeah.
Sam: Yes! Feels good to say it!
Liam: Well, good work.
Sam: Shall we go to Vasselheim?
Marisha: Yeah, let's go.
Taliesin: Grog?
Travis: And I'll come down.
Taliesin: Grog!
Laura: What have you been doing up there?
Travis: Is that General Krieg? (screams) (all laugh)
Taliesin: It's all right! It's all right!
Sam: No, no, no!
Taliesin: It's very expensive, don't break it.
Travis: Why have you aligned yourself with this creature?
Liam: I knock on the side of its head.
Sam: (hollow metal knocking sounds)
Liam: That's not Krieg.
Laura: It's Dootie.
Travis: No. Dootie did not have fire crotch hair. He did not have a face or hands--
Sam: Did you say 'fire crotch'?
Taliesin: Yes, he did.
Travis: --or a cloak. He didn't have any of that stuff.
Liam: Yeah, but Grog, we glued it on. We Dorked with it.
Travis: Oh, he's wearing a disguise! Yes.
Liam: Yes, he's a disguised robot.
Travis: Who did that?
Taliesin: Oh, all of us.
Travis: As a team?
Marisha: Mainly these three--
Liam: Mostly Keyleth.
Travis: Right.
Matt: It occurs to you guys, you don't know where the hair came from.
Liam: What?
Marisha: Druidcraft.
Travis: Wow.
Taliesin: Wow, well done.
Liam: Got all your hair--
Travis: Could you do that to me?
Taliesin: Where did you get the hair?
Liam: Where is the hair from?
Taliesin: What is it?
Sam: I've got some tricks up my sleeve. (laughs)
Liam: Did you pull it like a patch off and it turns into a bunch of hair?
Sam: Maybe. Maybe I did.
Liam: God, magic is amazing.
Laura: Did you get glue all over my robe that I put on him?
Sam: Maybe. Maybe I did.
Matt: Make a perception check.
Laura: Oh, motherfucker.
Liam: That'll do all right.
Laura: 24.
Matt: (singsong) That robe is ruined.
Laura: Oh no! It's not ruined!
Matt: (laughs) Certainly. Elements of it are permanently glued to Doty.
Marisha: Oh, I think this is your hair-dying robe now. Sorry.
Laura: That was my stealth robe.
Marisha: And now your--
Sam: And will be once more, I'll have it cleaned and pressed for you.
Liam: Wait there's glue on the--
Taliesin: That's the stealth robe?
Liam: -- on the elven cloak? Oh.
Taliesin: Oh.
Marisha: Does that mean that the--
Sam: It's a magical item you put on?
Laura: (laughs nervously) Yes.
Taliesin: You put a magical item on the robot?!
Laura: That's the only robe I fucking had!
Taliesin: (laughs)
Travis: Wow.
Liam: Oh, that--
Travis: For nothing.
Laura: (shouts) I didn't know you were going to glue it to him!
Liam: Much sentimental value--
Laura: (shouts) I know!
Taliesin: Now there's a robot with sentimental value.
Liam: It's all right, you're still alive. Whoop-dee-doo. Let's just do the thing, come on.
Marisha: You're right, now that I've blurred my vision, the glue is the most noticeable part.
Matt: (laughs)
Taliesin: I think it blends into the texture, actually, quite nice. Makes it look like he's seen some shit.
Laura: Motherfucker! Let's go to Vasselheim.
Travis: Yeah, let's go.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: I'll buy you a new robe.
Matt: Doty's been standing there, and as soon as you guys say let's go and Doty starts moving, it has this scary Return to Oz feel to it--
Laura: Ew. I like it.
Taliesin: This is everything I've ever wanted.
Matt: (Doty walking sounds)
Liam: Oh, man.
Marisha: Hey, where did you learn contouring?
Liam: What--
Marisha: (laughs) Because that's really well done.
Liam: You've seen what I can do with hair, right? I mean, are you really surprised?
Marisha: Good point, let's go.
Matt: It's the elvish half.
Marisha: It's the elvish half.
Travis: It's the elvish half.
Liam: Clasp time, Clasp time.
Matt: Yeah. All right, so. You go ahead and head up to the Temple of Sarenrae within your keep, there is the central tree there. You go ahead and Transport via Plants to--
Matt: Vasselheim!
Marisha: Vasselheim!
Matt: Where in Vasselheim do you want to exit?
Marisha: And we have the book? We have the book in the chest? Chest and the book?
Taliesin: We have the book.
Marisha: All right.
Laura: Not the chest, but in the bag of holding.
Taliesin: But we have the book. Yeah.
Laura: Wrapped in cloth.
Marisha: Where? Wasn't there the tree that was near the Slayer's Take?
Matt: There is one, yeah, there's one that patches there.
Marisha: Yeah. We'll do that.
Matt: Okay, so you use that one.
Liam: Let's use that save point.
Marisha: Yeah. What do they call it? Never mind.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Waypoint.
Marisha: There! Yes, thank you.
Travis: The waypoint.
Matt: So, as you guys emerge it is still early afternoon in Vasselheim. The sun is just setting in your location, you guys have travelled far northwest at this point when it was still midday. You emerge roughly in the center of the Quad Roads, a little bit north-center area of the Quad Roads. What are you looking for?
Laura: Well, we should go--
Taliesin: Library.
Laura: Yes, the library.
Liam: Library.
Laura: We delivered the horn of Orcus to the Platinum Dragon.
Matt: Yeah, the Platinum Sanctuary.
Laura: Yes. So we should probably go talk to them as well.
Marisha: Because I imagine they'd have a good hiding place?
Taliesin: It's where I'd put the Ark of the Covenant, certainly.
Marisha: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Laura: And also to talk to them about Orcus.
Marisha: Correct.
Laura: Since that's--
Marisha: And then shops for more potions.
Liam: Do we want to split up? You want to go talk Orcus?
Marisha: That's actually not a bad plan.
Laura: Yeah. Sure.
Marisha: Okay. You're going to go research Orcus?
Liam: Yeah.
Marisha: The twins?
Liam: Yeah.
Marisha: All right. Percy, you want to go to the Platinum Reserve?
Taliesin: Always.
Marisha: All right. We'll take the book. Tary? You want to come with us or the twins?
Sam: With you, absolutely.
Marisha: All right. Grog?
Travis: Ugh, god, the options both suck. (all laugh)
Travis: Fuck!
Taliesin: Go with the twins, they're more inclined to violence.
Laura: Oh, Grog could also go learn about the Nine Hells!
Travis: No, no no. Okay, wait. Books?
Laura: Yeah.
Travis: Nope. What are you doing?
Marisha: Books.
Travis: No. I'm doing my own thing.
Liam: We're gonna go learn about scary things, though.
Sam: I've been wanting to buy some potions and things, is that an option here?
Marisha: Oh, do you want to be team potions?
Taliesin: And buying things? You like buying things.
Marisha: Team Shopping, right Grog?
Laura: Tary-- Tary!
Matt: Grog's really good at buying potions.
Laura: Tary-- I pull Tary aside.
Sam: Yes, what?
Laura: If you're going to go shopping with Grog you need to know-- don't look at him. He is terrible with money.
Taliesin: I can't look away.
Laura: Tary, he's terrible with money. I mean like, he will offer them-- stop it! He will offer them double what they ask for.
Sam: Oh. And that's not good? Don't worry, I've been raised around money, I know its worth. I have--
Laura: I'm just saying--
Sam: -- at least six trust funds and they're all managed quite well.
Laura: (deadpan) I'm so happy for you.
Liam: Tru-- what?
Laura: Just keep an eye on him, all right?
Sam: I will receive your trust.
Laura: (sighs)
Sam: And I will fulfill your request as a fellow member of this team.
Laura: (strained) Fabulous.
Sam: Thank you for entrusting me with this mission.
Taliesin: Thank you, Tary, good luck. Grog, keep an eye on him, make sure that everything's--
Travis: Oh, I will.
Liam: As they leave, I spank Grog hard on the ass and say, money was meant to be spent!
Laura: (laughs)
Travis: I like that twin.
Matt: (laughs) All right, you scatter into three different directions. First--
Marisha: To the library?
Matt: All right.
Laura: No, you were going to the Platinum Sanctuary.
Travis: Yeah, Jesus. (laughs)
Laura: We're going to the library.
Marisha: Which is to the place where they--
Travis: Holy shit.
Taliesin: Archive.
Marisha: (shouts) To the archive!
Sam: Did you guys both say goodbye and then you're walking the same direction?
Matt: Yep! Yeah.
Travis: Oh, you're parked over here, too? Oh, okay, cool.
Taliesin: I'm tired-- okay, this is awkward now, we'll just keep--
Marisha: They're right next door, they're connected, they're partners.
Liam: Well some people go this way, and some people go that way and some people go both ways!
Matt: (laughs) All right, so you guys make your way up to the Platinum Sanctuary, you head to the base of the central mountain that the north end of Vasselheim is built around, to the winding stair that leads up to the Sanctuary proper. There, as you ascend, you can see the sun is getting to the three to four o'clock in the afternoon position. The color of the sky's starting to turn a bit different. You guys make your way to the outside doors of the Sanctuary, where you see the guards are there, stationed, and as you approach, some of them put up a bit of an aggressive front from a defensive standpoint, but one of them does recognise you and approaches, pulls the front of his helmet up. "You are Vox Machina."
Laura: We are.
Matt: "What business do you have here at the Platinum Sanctuary?"
Laura: We have come to discuss the (whispers) Horn of Orcus that we delivered here a while ago.
Matt: "So you request an audience with Scalebearer Vord?"
Laura: Mm-hm.
Liam: Yeah. That guy.
Travis: The sphinx's name.
Laura: What?
Travis: The sphinx's name.
Laura: I don't remember.
Matt: (laughs) All righty. Highbearer Vord. He says, "Very well. Please to be patient, I believe he is busy."
Laura: Oh. Right.
Matt: And he heads inside, the doors close behind.
Laura: As he does that, I look to Vax and go, hey, I have an idea. So the book we have, right?
Liam: Mm?
Laura: What if instead of leaving it here, we left it at the Raven Queen's sanctuary? Don't you think they would keep it more safe? Because she hates undead, right? This is like her nemesis, right?
Liam: She does. Yeah, I mean, that's a whole thing, I don't think that's a bad idea, but I feel like if I go there, I need to stay for a bit.
Laura: Oh, really?
Liam: Yeah.
Laura: Do you want to do that?
Liam: No, not yet.
Laura: All right, cool. Let's forget I mentioned anything.
Liam: Let's do that.
Laura: All right.
Matt: All right. About 15 minutes or so pass as you guys are led up. It's a gorgeous view from up here, by the way, I mean, for Vasselheim, the cloud cover is probably 70 to 80% of the year, with coming storms and sleet. This is one of the few days you've been during this part of the season where the sky is open. You actually see some blue in the sky, and as the light of the day begins to grow more towards a dusk color you start seeing the distant change and it's just endless thick, dense forest of the Vesper Timberland all around the city. And so there's kind of this serene waiting period as well.
Laura: I just lean against Trinket.
Matt: Trinket just (bear noises). You calm Trinket a bit. Trinket doesn't like heights and is up here on this platform, it's literally like a very small rail and then it drops probably a good 150, 200 feet down, and so Trinket's just like staying as far away from the edge as possible. Eventually the doors shift and one side opens up slightly, the same guard walks out. "All right, very well. Follow me." Turns around. Leads you in. He's carrying his large, very well-polished tower shield to his side, he still has his helmet visor up. Leads you into the central structure.
Laura: Do we know what we're going to say?
Liam: We're going to talk about the book. We're going to ask them if they can destroy it.
Laura: Or hold it, right? Do something with it.
Liam: Preferably destroy.
Laura: Okay. It's history, though.
Liam: It's dangerous.
Laura: True.
Matt: You guys are led to the audience chamber. Surrounded by the wide den of pillars and the central area has a hole above the top of the temple where the light comes through and there you see, stepping in hurriedly from the opposite side, flanked by two advisors is Highbearer Vord, the Silver Touched. You see his elven form is very fine-featured, his skin still very pale, almost pearlescent when the light hits it and his robes flow behind him, dragging a good four or five feet across the center. It's such an open space between the circular pillars that hold this-- it's just this tiny image of him approaching you amongst this wide-open space with his two advisors. As the footsteps get louder and louder as he approaches. "So yes, you've summoned me, what is your business?"
Laura: Didn't mean to summon you, Scalebearer, I know your time is precious.
Matt: "Yes."
Laura: We however came across, in fighting the Chroma Conclave and defeating them, this book which references Opash's search into necromancy. NecromANcy? NecrOmancy.
Sam: NecrOmancy.
Matt: NecrOmancy. Josh NecrOmancy?
Liam: NECromancy.
Laura: Necrome-- yes.
Travis: Necromé?
Laura: Necromé.
Liam: (laughs) Does that name mean anything to you?
Matt: "I have read of it, yes. I mean, it's a creature of lore. Opash was before the Divergence, even. If you indeed found a tome that once belonged to him, this is of much interest to us and our network of researchers."
Liam: Research?
Laura: Researchers.
Matt: "Well, yes."
Laura: It's an evil tome.
Matt: "I can only assume it is, you are right."
Liam: We came to Vasselheim to dispose of it. My sister has read it. Parts of it, and--
Laura: (whispers) All of it.
Liam: It's foul. It should not be allowed to exist.
Matt: "We can ensure that it falls into no hands beyond this temple. However, we do have to research the contents, you understand. The necessity of understanding the evils and darkness that are out there, that when they arise we can properly counter them."
Laura: Can I insight check him?
Matt: Yes, go for it.
Laura: (groans)
Travis: Turd burgers.
Laura: It's not terrible, but it ain't good, 14.
Matt: 14. He's hard to read in general, disposition and station, and his eyes are so white, like the iris is almost not visible. And he's stone-faced in his explanation but he's making sense, you know. If you have information on--
Laura: Necromancy.
Matt: On necromancy!
Laura: Yes.
Taliesin: Jif.
Matt: Or any devices that darker forces utilize, it better prepares you if you know what those entail.
Laura: Right.
Matt: And if there is any place that could withstand the corruption of such a book, it would be the strongest focus of the Platinum Dragon's divine power that exists on the planet.
Laura: Well, that's good.
Matt: So, you get the sense that Vord is not deceiving you.
Laura: Okay.
Liam: What happens after you research it?
Matt: "We seal it in the vaults below, same place we stored the horn."
Liam: Has that vault ever been disturbed in its entire history?
Matt: "It's been a long time and we've reinforced it. If I recall, last time you were here you encountered some of our defense yourselves."
Laura: Yes.
Matt: "I think you'll know by memory that we are well fortified. So--"
Laura: Be warned, the book tried to claim me.
Matt: "Hmm. If you resisted it, I have no doubt our clerics can as well." He nods his head over to one of his advisors.
Travis: Shade.
Laura: I know, yeah.
Travis: Dark shade.
Matt: This young man with a very, very tight braid pulled to the back of the head that dangles about mid-back behind silver and white robes just approaches and puts his hands out to accept the tome.
Liam: Oh, I'm sorry, we weren't clear. We came to discuss it. We don't have it now.
Matt: Puts his hands aside and steps back. "Oh. Well. Return with the tome, should you see fit to leave it here."
Laura: Can I ask you, how much do you know of Orcus?
Matt: "I know enough."
Laura: I don't know much of anything, and it's important that we learn.
Matt: "Hmm." So, he nods to one of the other advisors who steps off for a moment. "Sit a moment. This is a conversation to have." And some of the guards come and bring a few chairs and set them behind you. "Orcus, the demon prince of undeath, resides in the depths of Thanatos, one of the varying realms of the Abyss. It is here that he snuffs the life from all creatures and brings them under his sway. He is an entity of ever-hungering need for power, and to take all life and break it so he can bring it under his control. Thankfully, as one of the betrayer gods, he was sealed away, and the Divine Gate was placed up to prevent his, and any other evil entities' entrance into our world. However, that does not prevent him from sending his minions, sending his powers, sending his influence out through the permeable, small gaps in this gate. So his influence remains."
Laura: He only has two horns, right?
Matt: "Oh! Four, once."
Laura: Four?
Matt: "Two that he maintains on himself to this day, and two that were severed, enchanted, and bequeathed into two of his, at the time, one of his champions."
Liam: And all these many months, you've been in possession of the horn you have?
Matt: "Yes."
Laura: And you don't have another one down in that vault?
Matt: "We do not."
Liam: What have you learned of the one you do have?
Matt: "Well, this belonged to a great and terrible champion of Orcus. It was utilized in the Calamity, the war that came to the very gates of Vasselheim. This armored evil was destroyed and torn asunder, the horn scattered. We currently have some of our finest and brightest out in search of the other one, now that we know they have and can be recovered. Not to any avail yet, but we're doing our best."
Laura: If you hear any word of that horn, will you send word to us?
Matt: "Of course. And you do the same, please."
Laura: Of course.
Matt: "One was dangerous enough."
Liam: We need to discuss a few things, but we'll fetch the tome.
Matt: "Very well."
Laura: Thank you so much for your time.
Matt: "I don't have much of it. If you have business to discuss with me personally, I would recommend doing it now. Otherwise, you'll be dealing with one of my advisors when you return."
Laura: Do you know much about the Nine Hells?
Matt: "That's a complicated subject. What do you need to know?"
Laura: I fear we have to travel there.
Matt: "Why, pray tell, do you intend to travel there?"
Laura: There is a rakshasa after my brother and our cleric friend, Pike. And, unfortunately, I fear he will return if we don't snuff him out at the source.
Liam: It's already made one attempt.
Matt: "Hmm."
Liam: It's only a matter of time.
Matt: "I've dealt with fiends. I've dealt with devils. I am not a specialist on the Hells, but there are a few places where you could possibly research this information. Majority of such research is found in the presence, or at least in the grasp of the Cobalt Soul. They do have one small temple here in the city, and they have one over in Tal'Dorei. Either one will have some semblance of research at their disposal. What I can tell you is, in asking about Orcus and the Abyss, those are demons, entities, savage, chaotic, in selfish, hard to read societies that twist, crumble and rebuild, a rate that only insanity can seem to drive. Madness and hunger drives the Abyss. But the Hells, the Hells are built on tyranny. They are built on societies, power structures, subservience and dominance. Whereas few mortals dare tread in the Abyss, there have been some from many different realms, who go to the Hells to do business."
Laura: Do you know what sort of people might survive there?
Liam: Or fit in?
Matt: "Powerful ones. Ones that stay out of sight. Ones that don't make a scene. Just know; they're very clever, and above all else, they seek your soul."
Laura: All right.
Liam: No big.
Laura: All right.
Liam: Thank you for your time.
Laura: So, we'll go to the Cobalt Reserve.
Matt: "All right. One of my advisors will receive the tome upon its delivery."
Laura: Fabulous. Thank you.
Matt: "Good luck."
Laura: (whistles)
Matt: He stands up and as soon as you begin to stand up, the seats are already immediately pulled out from behind you. The guards separate them, he leaves with his advisors and you guys are led out of the temple back onto the winding staircase and into the heart of Vasselheim.
Liam: I pull Vex into an alleyway. (sighs) I don't know what the right thing to do is. I thought one thing going in there.
Laura: Mm-hm.
Liam: And now I think maybe you were right. I have not wanted to go to that temple, though. She has finally been speaking to me again.
Laura: All right. What about?
Liam: When I died, I saw her. I have dreamed of her already. And she speaks of some sort of purpose on the horizon. And I don't know if she's talking about your promise you made, or what. But she is with us. And I barely know what the fuck I'm doing, but I know that she doesn't want that book to exist. And, honestly, I am frightened of going to that temple because I want time. I want time with you, I want time with Keyleth, I want time.
Laura: All right.
Liam: And I don't want to lose that time now, I want to be selfish for a little while. We've been working so fucking hard, by all rights we should be dead.
Laura: Do you think if you go to the Raven Queen's temple, she'll claim you for her own right now?
Liam: Well, I don't know. I don't know. And look at this. And I start to unbuckle the front of my chest-- Relax, look at this.
Laura: What am I seeing? (laughs)
Matt: You see right around his heart there's a dark spot in the skin where some dark veins travel for about an inch or two across.
Laura: What the fuck is this?
Liam: I don't know.
Laura: When did it happen?
Liam: I don't know.
Laura: What do you mean, you don't know? Did it happen after you died?
Liam: I think so. Hurts a little bit.
Laura: What the fuck? We have to get you to a cleric, that's not normal!
Liam: Not really, no. I cover it back up.
Laura: Are you sure it's related to her?
Liam: But I think you are right, and I think that they're going to hold that, and someone will take it, whether it's in a hundred years or a thousand years, and she doesn't want it and--
Laura: Well, they're holding the Horn of Orcus. Playing devil's advocate.
Liam: Yeah, they already have that. They don't have this.
Laura: Then let's go to the Raven Queen's temple.
Liam: All right.
Laura: Do you want to go now?
Liam: Yes.
Laura: Let's go.
Matt: Okay, while you guys make your way to the Raven's Eyrie, we go to you two. You guys are currently looking for a library. Who wants to make the investigation check to ask for information?
Taliesin: I'll do it, that's funny.
Laura: Would I have known anything about what that thing was?
Matt: Not really. It doesn't look diseased. It looks bruised almost. It's just a strange-looking bruise where you can see some of the veins are dark and visible, almost like varicose near the surface.
Laura: Like trauma?
Matt: Kind of, yeah, but it doesn't look--
Laura: It doesn't look like Raishan's?
Matt: No, it's not like that.
Marisha: So, we have the book. They went to the sanctuary. We are going to the library.
Matt: Yes.
Taliesin: Okay.
Marisha: Okay!
Matt: As far as I know, that's what you guys are searching for.
Laura: Wait, I thought we had the book.
Taliesin: It's in the-- wait, no, the book's in the bag.
Travis: And I'm the one with the low intelligence.
Matt: (singsong) Grog has the book.
Marisha: You guys, I thought our whole thing was that we were taking the book to the sanctuary and then you guys were like, we're going to the sanctuary, because you guys totally gave me shit when I was like, the library, and you were like, not the library, but apparently we are.
Taliesin: Yes.
Marisha: All right. Let's go to the library.
Taliesin: I rolled a 16.
Matt: It's like Vox Machina has a hard time planning. (all laugh)
Taliesin: Don't agree with him.
Matt: It's crazy.
Taliesin: That's not fair.
Sam: I'm the new guy. (all laugh)
Travis: "I'm the new guy."
Taliesin: 16, investigation.
Marisha: We said we had the book.
Taliesin: We thought we did, we were not paying attention.
Matt: Did you say you took the book?
Marisha: I thought we took the book, that was our whole fucking plan--
Taliesin: I thought we took the book too.
Marisha: -- that we took the damn book.
Taliesin: It occurs to me it was actually in the bag that Grog was holding.
Marisha: But I would assume if we said, "we're taking the book", that would mean--
Matt: If you guys said you're taking the book; Grog, you heard them take the book?
Travis: I thought you said you were taking the book to go look at the wherever.
Marisha: We have the book.
Matt: All right. I'll take that as consensus to say that you guys have the book.
Sam: Oh, I used the book to make the wig. Is that okay? (all laugh)
Sam: It's just, it's all paper.
Laura: It's glued under the cloak.
Matt: Make a wisdom saving throw.
Taliesin: Papier-mâché of evil.
Matt: Okay. You guys, not having a bag of holding, are clutching the tome-- it's a big tome, it's like--
Marisha: I thought we put it in a box, right?
Matt: No.
Taliesin: No, we didn't have a box.
Laura: There was no box. It was a book wrapped in cloth in the bag of holding.
Sam: In a box.
Marisha: We wrapped it in cloth.
Matt: So there you go. You have a tome wrapped in cloth under your arm. You guys spend about an hour or so asking around. The locals, they're-- not saying they're not friendly, but not all of them are well-versed in what you're asking. You say library, some of them are more simpler folk are like, "I don't--" and eventually somebody says, "Oh yeah, you can head over to the-- what's it called? The Cobalt Vault. It's in the southern region of the Quad Roads."
Taliesin: That's exactly what I was looking for, thank you so much.
Matt: "All right, yeah, I'll show you." And the guy gives you a couple directions down the road, and you make your way there, and it's similar to the Cobalt Reserve in Westruun, but it's about a quarter of the size.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: The Cobalt Reserve is the center of the Cobalt Soul monk order, the Ioun worshipers that gather information and maintain it. As Ioun's presence was shattered slightly during the Calamity, in the battle against the chained god, her presence in Vasselheim was diminished and then regrew through the Cobalt Soul in Westruun, so it's expanding back into Vasselheim. You make your way to the structure. The exterior of it is this light-grey stone, it's a cylindrical building with three different doorways around the outside and a giant, bright blue and black marbled dome on top. It looks somewhat transparent, like it's made of a glass-type material. As you step into the front, you can see a central chamber within the inside that's also cylindrical, so you have a small walk-around hallway on the immediate inside of this giant structure, and then the actual library is in the interior, and so on the outside, you see a few books and there are some paintings and tapestries on the walls and you see a few varying monks walking around, a handful that are curious and turn as you walk in. They're all wearing the uniform, dark grey and blue robes of the Cobalt Soul, and there is a desk at the front, where you have a young woman of olive skin sitting, her hair short and wavy with very thick spectacles adorning the front of her nose. Young-ish, maybe mid-twenties. She looks up as soon as you guys approach. "Good day. I fear we're still in the process of preparing the interior, but what do you require?"
Taliesin: We were hoping for access to some of the deep research archives. We've been looking around, we have several complicated matters that we need to research, and we heard that you had a wonderful collection and we were hoping to gain access to some materials, preferably of the histories of Orcus, the Nine Hells, a few various things.
Matt: "I'm terribly sorry, that type of research is only for Cobalt Soul members."
Taliesin: Who could we talk to about special access? I'm sure that there must be somebody in charge.
Matt: "I apologize, I am--"
Marisha: I'm sorry--
Matt: "I'm going to have--"
Marisha: I am Keyleth of the Air Ashari and this is Percival Fredrickstein Von Musel Klossowski de Rolo III.
Taliesin: Close enough.
Marisha: We're a part of the group Vox Machina, we've been through here before, we're part of the Slayer's Take. This is a matter of great importance, so if there is any type of upper management we could talk to-- (all laugh)
Matt: Roll a persuasion check.
Travis: Fuck this. It's just that dismount at the end.
Taliesin: (creepy voice) Who wants to talk to the librarian?
Matt: It's Keyleth's specialty.
Liam: It was going great.
Marisha: (coughs) Mm, 11.
Matt: "I mean no offense, but I don't think we have the kind of research that you're looking for that we could--"
Taliesin: We would also possibly like to make a donation. And I pull out the Manual of Quickness of Action, place it upon the table.
Matt: She adjusts her glasses for a second and reaches into the desk and pulls out a small, white gem and passes it over, and as she does, you can see the front of the tome seems to glow almost like a blacklight over something that was reactive to it.
Sam: Covered in semen.
Matt: As soon as I said it, I was waiting for Sam on that one.
Sam: Sure, sure.
Taliesin: Thank you for ruining that one for me for all time.
Matt: Scans over. "Perhaps. Give me just a moment, please." And she slides the book in your direction, gets up and exits through one of the small doors in the side, that you didn't notice until now. It's part of a similar stone, just gives way and then closes behind her.
Taliesin: Well, we'll see what happens now.
Marisha: And yet, worst case scenario, I also have this book that Scanlan read that's on how to be a good leader--
Taliesin: Hold on to that one.
Marisha: All right, I'll hold on to it.
Matt: The door opens again and she comes back out, followed by a man of very, very dark skin, bright, soft eyes that crack on the sides from, you can gather, a lot of smiling. He wears the same uniform, blue and gray robes, but as he walks, you can hear what sounds almost like a faint-- almost like jewelry clanging, but you don't see any jewelry on him, and as he approaches, his arms are folded into themselves, and he steps forward quietly, looks at the book for a second, looks up at the two of you, and smiles, "Hello. My name is Kusuo and I am in charge of looking over this extension of the Cobalt Reserve's reach and collection. You have come to offer this book as trade?"
Taliesin: Yes.
Matt: "And you are seeking what?"
Taliesin: Well, we are in a bit of a bind. We are members of a traveling group of adventurers known as Vox Machina. We recently helped defeat the Chroma Conclave.
Matt: "I'm familiar with your exploits as of late, yes. It is our job to collect information and history and record of it, so I am very aware."
Taliesin: Well, the deeds and those things that must be done have not yet been fulfilled. We have just a few last, treacherous events that we must complete before the Chroma Conclave is completely put to rest. One of which has to do with Orcus, and the other with the Nine Hells.
Marisha: It's a rakshasa.
Taliesin: And we are desperate for knowledge that may keep us safe in our travels. Prepare us for our enemies.
Matt: "Come with me." And he takes the book and sweeps it up, and it vanishes into his robe.
Taliesin: Worth it!
Matt: He leads you into the small doorway that you watched open and shut before, and on the inside, you go from this barren outer walkway, into this large cylindrical library that is from floor to ceiling about 60 feet tall, with dozens of ladders that move around, and you can see books are in the process of being put up, some books are being categorized, it looks like there were stacks that have just arrived that are in the process of being researched and copied, there are a number of these monks that are at different tables in the process of making copies of books, this is specifically a repository for the gathering and guarding of information. In the center of the chamber, there is a spiral staircase that leads to an upper platform that has another series of chairs, either a research or reading section, and there are only a handful of people on the interior that are not dressed in the same way that these monks are, but each one of them is attended by a monk. And you--
Marisha: Anyone look familiar? Any uniforms that look recognizable?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Taliesin: Yeah, use that one. That's weird.
Marisha: It's on another dice? All right.
Taliesin: There, that's better.
Marisha: Oh, that's good!
Taliesin: What is that? Oh--
Marisha: That's a 19! Perception?
Matt: Perception.
Marisha: 21. Sorry, 20. Yeah, 21.
Matt: Okay, so you glance around--
Marisha: No! 31!
Matt: There we go! I was like, your wisdom's pretty high--
Marisha: 31.
Matt: Okay. You look around really fast, glance at each person that is not of the Cobalt Reserve's attire, no one you recognize. But they all appear to be fairly affluent. And they're all in the process of reading through some sort of thick book with a stack next to them, of varying sizes, and the monk is just standing there patiently, watching them as they do so.
Taliesin: That's disconcerting.
Matt: And you recall, from your first time at the Cobalt Reserve, that no books can be taken from the Reserve. They can be read within the interior, they can be copied, notes can be taken. But you cannot remove them, and the monk that is assigned to you is both a guide, and to make sure you don't take anything you're not supposed to.
Marisha: Right. Theft protection.
Matt: Yes. And it seems that Kusuo has taken upon himself to be your assigned monk.
Taliesin: There's quite a bustle today, this is impressive.
Matt: "It is more than we are used to, usually. But we are happy to know that people are interested in knowledge. Any given day."
Marisha: Any reason for the sudden spark in interest?
Matt: "Well, recent events of dragons terrorizing countrysides, leads people to want to defend themselves and learn of these occasional terrors."
Marisha: Good on them.
Matt: "Anyway, follow me." And he leads you to the back of the spiral staircase, as it comes and meets with the floor, there is a large rug that sits as part of the decor there, and he glances around, and using his foot, his toe clips the edge of it and flicks up and catches the rug, folds it and sets it down, in one swift motion you weren't expecting, and with the dust that sets off, you now see what looks to be a trap door of the same material as the hardwood floor of the library. The small chain that he then bends down carefully, tugs and lifts, and you see the staircase that descends below.
Marisha: Can you do that with your toes?
Taliesin: Not with my toes, no.
Liam: That's some Name of the Rose shit right there.
Matt: "The books you require, we keep in the cellar. So, please, after you." It's a staircase. (all laughs)
Taliesin: No! I'm committed!
Matt: (laughs) You're just going down--
Liam: Then an escalator!
Matt: You're dog paddling your way through the darkness. You guys descend and the trap door closes behind you and it is pitch black. You have no vision, you can see in the vicinity, the stairs go down maybe 20 feet, however as soon as the trap door closes, a soft glow emanates from behind you and you can see there is some sort of a dangling wristband with a small glass marble that hangs at the end that is now glowing with a soft candlelight, and Kusuo is holding his arm in front of him as it dangles like a candle, and he slowly brushes past you and leads the way down before the stairs stop and level off into an open chamber, a square room, the cellar as he called it. There, inside, you see candelabras flickering in the corners, there's four of them, two near you and two on the far side. Within the shadowed, subterranean chamber, you see shelves and locked cases throughout. Some cases are glass, some are almost crate-like, but they have locks on the sides, and on these shelves it isn't books stacked to each end, each book is facing forward, and seems to be placed deliberately, and some of them are chained in, some of them have chains that dangle from the piece-- this is where all the secret books are kept. This is the private collection.
Taliesin: Books that want to get out.
Matt: As soon you guys enter the space, two monks of the Cobalt Soul spin out of the corners and immediately stand in the defensive position with their arms out in front of them, and then as soon as they see Kusuo smiles and nods, they put their guard down, arms together, and they bow for Kusuo. Kusuo turns back over the shoulder, "Do not worry, this is Wailen and Sura, they are assigned to watch over. So, stand aside, help our guests." He walks forward and leads you through some of these cases, and you look and they're made of different woods, some of them seem to have been brought from different locations, and there are scroll cases, there are giant wads of ancient parchment that are clustered together and bound with some sort of a leather strip, you can see tomes all across the way of different fronts and sizes, and some of them are very old and ruined. And in the back right corner of this chamber, you see Kusuo pulls what you didn't notice before, and that jangling sound you were hearing before is a giant ring of over a hundred keys that he pulls off of his neck. He turns it and begins just thumbing through the keys, very quickly, like he knows exactly what he's doing. Catches one key, looks at it, and walks over to one of the cases in that corner of the room and just undoes the locks, but they're a different key for each lock, and he goes and finds each one. First try, knows exactly where they go. As each lock is taken, he opens the case and on the inside you smell this scent of dust and ash, and there are four books in there, two of which look damaged, but they all look very old, and he reaches in and grabs two of them. One of them is one of the damaged ones, one of them is not. "You seek information on Orcus?" Sets one tome down on one of the nearby closed cases. "And the Nine Hells." Places the other next to it.
Taliesin: I just try and see if I can discern what the other two books are just from looking in and being a nerd.
Matt: They don't have any labelling on the cover.
Taliesin: Oh, nothing. All right. Fascinating. Thank you. I suppose we'll sit, and get to it.
Matt: "Very well."
Taliesin: And I sit down and I open the book.
Marisha: Yes. Which one are you opening?
Taliesin: Before I touch it, this doesn't react poorly to people handling it, does it? There's no--
Matt: He arcs an eyebrow towards you. "No, part of our distinct training is to disable any sort of wards should you wish to research."
Taliesin: Excellent.
Marisha: Which one are you opening, Percy?
Taliesin: I open the first one just to look into--
Marisha: The Orcus one?
Matt: Do you speak Abyssal?
Taliesin: I do not speak Abyssal.
Matt: The Orcus tome you aren't able to read. It is all in Abyssal.
Taliesin: Do you speak Abyssal? And the other book--
Matt: The other book?
Taliesin: -- I open up the Nine Hells, take a look.
Matt: That one is actually written in Common.
Taliesin: Okay.
Marisha: Weird question.
Matt: Yes.
Marisha: Abyssal.
Matt: Yes.
Marisha: I know creatures who are from the Abyss, right? I've encountered them?
Matt: You have encountered demons in your past, yes.
Marisha: If I do a Shapechange into a demon, can I then read Abyssal?
Matt: Lemme look at the spell real fast.
Sam: You're going to change into a pit fiend in the library?
Marisha: I would let him know! I would give him like a disclaimer.
Taliesin: I'm going to show you a really weird birthmark, don't panic.
Laura: I mean, if he really was a demon, why would he need to do research?
Taliesin: Who is my father?! I don't know.
Laura: Genealogy of the Nine Hells!
Matt: It does not specify, but it says you gain the abilities.
Liam: I think I've read it says you keep the same intellect, though, right?
Matt: Yeah, you keep the same intellect.
Marisha: You keep the same mental stats.
Matt: Correct.
Marisha: But you get the abilities--
Matt: Yeah, you retain all your skills and saving throw and proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature.
Marisha: In addition.
Matt: You don't know.
Marisha: I don't know.
Sam: Might as well try!
Taliesin: I'm going to take a moment also before this happens, open the Common book, take a moment, and gently ask the good sir if they have a reading glass around, because I still don't have any reading glasses.
Matt: (laughs) He gives a curious look. "But of course." And he snaps his fingers, and the other monks, he just darts off for a second and then returns a moment later with a small wooden case that opens up, and on the inside there are four different types and thickness of reading glass you can go through. You find one that'll work okay.
Taliesin: Perfect. I'm going to let you deal with this other end of things, because I'm going to sit and read.
Marisha: What was that demon guy we encountered? Does he have a name?
Taliesin: Phil.
Sam: You mean the pit fiend, or--?
Laura: Oh, you mean like Senokir?
Liam: No, he was a genasii.
Marisha: The pit fiend was a devil. Who was the guy who lied to us, and you said devil at one point, and he was actually a demon.
Laura: You said he was a demon and he was actually a devil.
Matt: That was a glabrezu. That was what killed Pike.
Taliesin: What about the basement way back when?
Travis: Where we found you?
Taliesin: Yeah, remember?
Laura: The succubus?
Matt: That was after you found Percy. This was in the palace of Emon.
Laura: What about the succubus?
Liam: The succubus. And that thing with the bones.
Marisha: Succubus are-- yeah.
Laura: We did kill a succubus.
Matt: You did, yeah.
Liam: In Krieg's house.
Marisha: And they're demons, right?
Matt: They are fiends. You're not sure. You don't have enough knowledge-- Are you trained in religion?
Marisha: No.
Taliesin: But you could ask me. Well, I'm not--
Matt: Yeah. You're not too familiar. Part of this research is learning the distinguishing factors between fiends. You don't have a whole lot of knowledge of that.
Marisha: Okay. You know what? You're reading the book on the Nine Hells. That'll tell us what fiends there are.
Taliesin: All right.
Marisha: Right?
Matt: Maybe.
Taliesin: Maybe. I'm reading the book.
Marisha: Read the book.
Matt: Okay. There we go. (all laugh)
Liam: Saviors of the universe, we are.
Matt: So.
Taliesin: Do you know the dewey decimal system?
Marisha: Yes. (laughs)
Matt: What're you trying to find? Do you want to just read all the information? It'll take you--
Taliesin: I'm skipping specifically through Orcus, and also since she mentions what she's--
Matt: There's no Orcus in this book. This is about the Nine Hells.
Taliesin: Oh, I'm so sorry. Hierarchies. I'm trying to get a general overlay of some of the information if there's a natural enemy for the rakshasas. Any weaknesses, where we can find them.
Matt: Okay. You do know there is a very strong infernal hierarchy of all the hells.
Taliesin: I'm also seeing what the book also specializes in.
Matt: Yes, that's what it looks like as he's reading. It's a very rigid power structure here. And the whole purpose of most devils is to try and gain power and ascend their rank by proving themselves stronger or tearing others down to take their position.
Taliesin: So anyone lower would be an enemy, anyone higher would probably--
Matt: Well, they'll work together because it is a lawful evil society. It is a society that only functions because of its structure. So it is tyrant and underlings. And underlings will work and serve things they hate that are more powerful in hope of gaining the favor, especially since higher devils can bequeath lower devils the chance to ascend to a higher tier.
Taliesin: Are there stories of anybody defeating a rakshasa before?
Matt: You glance through, and rakshasas, like any other devil, can be killed. If you can go to it and kill it. But there are many tiers here. There are archdevils at the top. That are the rulers of each-- essentially the top ranks. There are greater devils below them. Greater devils include horned devils, erinyes, which you've encountered, pit fiends, which you've encountered, and ice devils. And they are the greatest of the devils below the archdevils. Then you have lesser devils, which are like imps, spine devils, bearded devils, barbed devils, chain devils, bone devils. You've got all these names, you get some drawings and sketches of some of these creatures, and they all look awful. Lowest in this rank are lemures. Lemures are the souls of people that have passed, who have either done enough evil deeds that they fall under the sway of one of the archdevils. Most of them are acquired by making a deal with a devil. A contract. They're big into contracts. Their power structure is based on what sort of souls, what power they can gain, what people they can sway, what people they can convince to--
Taliesin: Lemures are infernal Pokemon, is basically what you're getting to.
Matt: Yeah. Once a soul has come under the sway of a devil and is brought to the Nine Hells, it either can become just a lost wandering soul used as a source of energy; most of them convert into lemures which are the low-level slaves. They're ever-tortured, flesh masses that--
Taliesin: So like The Scream?
Matt: Yeah. They're the tortured souls of the Nine Hells. If a lemure does manage to do good enough work over an extended period of time it can ascend into a lesser devil, by pleasing its masters, by whatever it may be. There is a chance, that's how devils ascending are brought to a higher station.
Taliesin: There's a few that have crawled their way up.
Matt: Yeah, and the pit fiend you killed probably returned and got demoted.
Laura: Ooh, to a lesser? Like they get turned into something smaller?
Matt: If something really powerful and cool that was given a station was suddenly walking through the street and killed by a bunch of people in the city and came back and was like, "they killed me," they'd be like, "you're weak obviously". Reading the structure, you probably really ruined that guy's day. (laughs)
Taliesin: He's probably going to have centuries getting his shit back together. He's probably really pissed.
Matt: Yeah, you basically made him lose his house, and his dog, and his wife. You turned him into a country song.
Taliesin: Do they talk about anything like the children that we saved? The effect of angelic, angelic, why those little angel children--
Matt: There is very little talk about celestial blood, divas, other than the fact that there's been a long-standing battle since the founding. Since the prime gods and betrayer gods divided early in the creation of Exandria and--
Taliesin: There's no talk about using celestial power as some sort of weapon against these creatures.
Matt: Not celestial power necessarily, but some of the entities are susceptible to various divine magics and abilities, and that is a strong back and forth between the two sides. The big war is between the devils and the demons. The Abyss, which is the nature of chaos and evil and driven hunger at whatever cost, versus the power-hungry devils, which build structure, dominance, expanding their territory, and ruling through structure and power.
Taliesin: Okay, so within evil, there is chaos versus order is kind of the internal conflict of evil.
Matt: Yes, those are the two sides, devils versus demons.
Taliesin: All right. This is all very useful.
Matt: But there are many tiers of the hells and nine--
Marisha: Does it mention any Abyssal fiends that they particularly hate that we might have encountered?
Taliesin: Flipping. I'm just going to keep skimming.
Liam: While he's skimming could we jump back for just thirty seconds?
Matt: Sure.
Taliesin: Actually I'm happy to time-pass and we'll revamp that.
Matt: I just want to make sure that we don't get lost on this somewhere.
Liam: Just 30 seconds before we go in, I'm like I should have the book. I'll carry the book in, give me the book.
Laura: I thought you took the book.
Liam: I don't carry books.
Laura: No, you have the book. I thought you were lying to the guy. You actually have the book, right?
Liam: You took the book when we left--
Laura: I didn't take the book, I thought you took the book.
Liam: Are you fucking kidding me?
Laura: Are you fucking serious?
Liam: Fuck.
Taliesin: Can we direct people to the Benny Hill steampunk theme song.
Marisha: (sings Yakety Sax)
Laura: Let's go to the library.
Matt: All right, meanwhile.
Marisha: So were we supposed to take the book? Or were they supposed to take the book?
Taliesin: I thought you said that we were taking the book.
Marisha: Well, I also thought we were going to the Reserve and now we're in the library.
Matt: Are you unveiling the book?
Taliesin: No, we are not. We have it, we have not unveiled it.
Laura: We're heading to the library.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: I'm going to keep reading while they head, you guys if you want to--
Marisha: I'm so confused on our plan.
Matt: There are many things you learn. One, the first layer of Avernus, which is the first layer of the hell. It is a terrible blackened rocky wasteland, rivers of blood. It's a bad place. Usually, you have to travel from each layer into the next one. There are very few portals that'll lead to the Hells. Usually, any that do start at Inverness and you have to work your way in. That area is ruled by Zariel, which is the Archduchess of Avernus. This is also the realm of Tiamat.
Taliesin: Ah, yeah, okay!
Matt: You glancing through and trying to find things that catch your attention. This is a large tome. You could spend days and days researching this but you don't have a lot of time. You are looking for specific things. Dis is the second layer of the Nine Hells. It is a labyrinth of canyons, wedged between sheer mountains, filled with iron ore. There are iron roads that span through the canyons with a series of bridges that lead over these giant crevasses and this dark landscape. The ruler of the second layer and the lord currently is Dispater.
Travis: Dispater?
Matt: Yes. Dispater, which is--
Laura: Similar to James Spader.
Liam: Yeah. (all laugh)
Matt: Yeah. Just half-cousin. Talks kind of like him, too, it's really creepy.
Marisha: So, it's the realm of Dis and the leader is--
Taliesin: Dispater.
Marisha: Dispater.
Matt: Yeah.
Taliesin: They're not that clever.
Marisha: And the first layer of Hell is also referred to as the layer of Inyimenemo-- what?
Matt: Avernus.
Marisha: Avernus.
Matt: However, what does catch your attention immediately is on Dis there is a city called the Iron City of Dis that is a massive metropolis, primarily where most extra-planar entities travel to do business. It is in many cases an open market.
Taliesin: So, probably safer.
Matt: It's one of the safer areas for a mortal to walk through, comparatively-- it's still in one of the Hells. But because it is such a center for business, it's a popular location for extra-planar travelers, it's a popular place for succubi, incubi to travel, it's a popular place for rakshasas. It specifically brings up hags, creatures that deal in business, deal in exchanges, deal in contracts. Beyond the usual devil ones, a lot of them tend to go to the Iron City of Dis.
Taliesin: Okay. I'm marking that-- I'm putting a pin on my Pinterest board.
Marisha: Atlas Obscura that shit.
Taliesin: Atlas Obscura the hell out of the City of Dis.
Matt: I can give you the rest of this to read on the break, if you'd like because it's a lot of information, but that's the one that sticks out to you.
Taliesin: I don't want to kill Travis.
Matt: No. In looking specifically for the mention of rakshasas, there are sections about the creatures and talking about their history and how they originally stemmed from the Hells and burst out of the prime plane. It goes into their history there, the rest of it doesn't have as much in correlation to where you would look for such a creature. They do exist on multiple layers of the Hells.
Taliesin: City of Dis seems to be the winner.
Matt: At the very least, a place where you can get information that can lead you elsewhere.
Taliesin: I'm very excited.
Marisha: Any information on how to get there?
Laura: (sing) We built Dis city on--
Liam: (sing) We built Dis city on--
Taliesin: Inter-planar travel.
Marisha: I can Plane Shift there. I do a very detailed look at what the Iron City of Dis seems like--
Taliesin: I'll sketch a little bit of it out of the book, as well.
Matt: Okay, cool. And there are some descriptors in there, some mild sketches. One thing it does speak of is the Tower. The Iron Tower of Dispater which is, essentially, this massive central structure to the city where the actual archdevil himself looks down upon the city and keeps watch over most business that he can.
Liam: Great stealth roll.
Matt: Good job, thank you. (all laugh)
Taliesin: Dagger, dagger.
Liam: Thank you.
Matt: While you guys are completing your research-- Taryon and Grog! What are you guys doing?
Sam: Do you have the book? (all laugh)
Travis: Which book?
Sam: Never mind. Let's go find a place to buy some potions.
Travis: All right. Are you accustomed to buying things?
Sam: Very much so.
Travis: Oh. Do you have a personal shopper?
Sam: I actually do, yes.
Travis: Nice. Well, show me how it's done.
Sam: All right, I'll take you under my wing, so to speak.
Travis: Yeah, I'm a bit big so I don't know how you're going to do that.
Sam: Doty, join us!
Matt: And as you guys walk through the streets, everyone stares. Partially because you are a bright shiny beacon of finely polished gems and armor flanked by a massive bearded goliath and whatever the fuck Doty is.
Sam: Hello, hi, greetings, good day, good afternoon, don't mind them, they're my friends! Hahahaha!
Travis: Wow.
Matt: About five minutes of walking before two armored Bastions come up in their piecemeal leather and scale breastplate armor with their heavy fur cloaks over their shoulders, holding spears. "You!"
Sam: Uh!
Matt: "You walk with strange company. What's your business here in Vasselheim?"
Sam: We are wandering merchants, trying to find some textiles to buy to resell in other lands. That's all. Don't mind my traveling companions. They're my protectors. I travel as a merchant with a lot of coin, so I found these two at a leper colony and nursed them back to health. It was also a gym, a muscle-man place, so they're really buff. But they're also lepers. And that explains their matted hair.
Matt: Make a deception check, please.
Taliesin: You get to experience this as a normal person now. I'm so excited.
Sam: What, deception?
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: Ooh, I better use Luck. Ooh, no, that's worse. (all laugh)
Sam: So do I use the higher one, or just the second one?
Matt: I'll double check.
Laura: I think you have to use the second roll.
Sam: Well, it don't matter.
Matt: You choose.
Sam: Okay, ten.
Matt: Total of ten.
Sam: Yeah.
Matt: He leans in real fast. "Oh wow, that's got to be unfortunate. Being so buff and so filled with leprosy."
Sam: It is their cross to bear. That's why this one doesn't even talk, and this one is a leper of few words.
Matt: He leans back, and the two guards watch you and nod and step back to let you continue to pass.
Sam: Thank you. Might I inquire from you fine gentleman where we might find some medicine or healing potions? These lepers are set to relapse. That way? All right. I'll head that way then. Good day to you. Keep warm.
Matt: As you guys keep walking, they slowly close behind you and just begin to follow from about 30 feet back.
Travis: That was amazing. Have you ever lied to anybody before?
Sam: Never. I think I have a talent for it though. I just felt the words coming out and I went with it.
Travis: It was a thrill, right?
Sam: It was thrilling. It was exciting. And they were going with it. They were eating it up. I had them right where I wanted them. I could've told them fucking anything. It was great, right?
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: Wow.
Travis: On a scale from one to two, how do you think it went?
Sam: I mean, two's the higher of the two, right? Oh, you don't know. (all laugh)
Sam: I feel good.
Travis: Nice, yeah.
Sam: Now, remember, if anyone asks you, just go (moans in pain) "I'm a leper", or something like that.
Travis: (moans in pain) I'm a leper.
Sam: That's good.
Travis: Yeah, good. Are they following us now?
Sam: Oh, I hadn't looked.
Matt: You turn around, right at them, and 30 feet back they're walking and they just stop as you stop.
Travis: Still think it went well?
Sam: (whispers) I think they're following us.
Travis: Really?
Sam: What do we do?
Travis: You know, it was probably you told such a good story, they're just fascinated by you now.
Sam: What do I do? I've never been followed by guards before.
Travis: You should probably act casual. Or you could drop some money on the ground, and let all the people run and collect it, and make a diversion. It's up to you.
Sam: Are there people around?
Matt: There's a few.
Travis: Just dump all your money on the ground. They'll come out of the houses, the woodworks.
Sam: I was warned about you and money. I won't listen to that. But I will try to act casual. I will just take off my gigantic, diamond-encrusted helmet. Let my hair down.
Travis: How long is his long, blonde hair?
Matt: Just past the shoulders.
Travis: Just free-flowing? No fancy braids or buns or anything?
Matt: No, just free-flowing, perfectly arced in the front, except pulled back because of the helmet. It's glorious. It's Bee Gee-tastic.
Sam: (loudly) Ah, what a day, am I right?
Travis: You're talking real loud.
Sam: (softly) That's what casual people do.
Travis: No. They don't.
Sam: They don't care what people think.
Travis: Volume control, real important.
Sam: Okay. (loudly) Ah, just want to take a load off and just rest here for a while. Not going anywhere, just sitting here and acting real boring, right?
Travis: Yep. How are we going to stay here and find the health potions at the same time?
Sam: Guide me. You've been doing this longer.
Travis: No, you're really doing well. I'm learning a lot right now. Clearly, you are a well-traveled man of mystery.
Sam: All right, I've read about situations like this, right? We just need to create a diversion. While the guards are diverted, we run away, fast as we can, right?
Travis: I literally told you about that one minute ago.
Sam: Yes. (all laugh)
Sam: Here's my plan.
Matt: Grog, make a perception check.
Travis: 15.
Matt: You're getting close to the exterior of the building pointed to by the guards, and you recognize it. It's the place where you've previously purchased potions.
Travis: Look, I hate to interrupt, right. Do you think you've done anything wrong?
Sam: Illegal?
Travis: Yeah. Have you done anything wrong?
Sam: I don't think so, no.
Travis: You've never been here before?
Sam: Well, we are traveling around with an arcane being. I don't know if that's illegal.
Travis: Yeah, it's totally fine. Look, this place is where the goods are.
Sam: You mean potions and magical items?
Travis: All sorts of stuff. I don't even know if his inventory has improved since we've last been here, but he will give you a really great deal, and it'll give you a chance to prove to me how good of a salesman you are.
Sam: All right. But how do we shake the uards-gay?
Travis: What?
Sam: Well, that came out weird. Didn't think that through. (all laugh)
Travis: I mean, the motherfucking pig-latin. Jesus.
Sam: What they do in the comfort of their own home is their own--
Travis: I don't think there's any shaking them, right. Why don't you leave old twinkle-toes outside, and we go in? Surely Doty can read or something?
Sam: He can stay here and keep watch, but if they ask him anything, he will be--
Travis: Mute.
Sam: Is that all right, do you think?
Travis: What's wrong with that?
Sam: All right.
Travis: Maybe just tell him to be cool.
Sam: Doty.
Matt: Which, as you turn, you see he's been drawing in his book the entire time, everything you guys have been discussing.
Sam: Doty. Act cool. That means book down, don't say a word, and if the guards get close, let us know with some sort of sound. Thank you. Remember, you're a leper, so seem unhealthy.
Matt: (lopsided mechanical footsteps) Horrible creaking sounds.
Sam: Good. All right, let's go inside.
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: So, the guards are closing the gap a little bit. You guys pick up pace, they pick up pace a little bit. You get to the outside of the building. The doors are closed. You open them and get inside. The warm interior is lit up. You can see there's nobody else currently inside, except for your old friend, the potion-seller, who's currently reading what looks to be some sort of a-- you're not actually sure what's inside the book, but it's a small, handheld book, and he's reading through, bored. "No. No. No."
Travis: No, no. She's not here. It's just me and my new, rich friend. Rich.
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Travis: Natural 20.
Marisha: Are you serious?
Travis: That's what it says.
Matt: "She's not here?"
Travis: She's not here. It's just the two of us.
Matt: "And your friend's very rich?"
Sam: Extremely.
Travis: Do you see what he is covered in?
Matt: "What is that?"
Sam: Just outside the door there?
Matt: "Yes."
Sam: He's a man.
Matt: "Great. Well then." (all laugh)
Travis: Nice. Slick.
Matt: "So what can I get you? I've got all sorts of salves and spices. We've got all sorts of incense. What are you looking for?"
Travis: Inside the shop, has it grown or become more ornate since we've last been here?
Matt: It does, actually. Last time you were here it was in the process of being put together. The shop seems to be fully open now and outfitted, though it doesn't seem to be getting much traffic, as it is very empy. So he seems eager he has customers. And now much more put at ease, now that you've let him know that from his vision, the dragon woman did not come with you.
Travis: Yeah. (laughs) You first.
Sam: Oh, for myself, do you have any spell scrolls, or any sort of one-use items that I could use in a fight or a tangle with some bad chaps?
Matt: "Let me see what I've got."
Sam: Things that could deceive, things that could use force against--
Matt: And he rummages through a couple of scroll pieces. Let's see here what he might have. "I do, should you be so interested, currently carry one scroll that would surround with you a wreath of dangerous fire."
Sam: Oh, all right. Just around me, or around an area?
Matt: "Just around you. Anything that came too close would burst into flames and be burned."
Sam: I have 13 of those right here. Do you have anything else?
Travis: Not that that's not really impressive.
Sam: It's really good.
Matt: "I've got something that makes you jump."
Sam: I've got that.
Matt: "I've got something that makes you see in the dark."
Sam: Yeah, I have a light already. (all laugh)
Matt: "What do you want?"
Sam: All right, give me that one scroll, the fire scroll. I could sell it and get something else.
Matt: "All right."
Sam: How much is that?
Matt: I'm looking right now for the scroll that's here.
Travis: You have to read the scroll, right?
Sam: I could read it to you. If that's what you're asking.
Matt: He looks you over. "The scroll I would put at a fair 6,000 gold pieces."
Sam: (gulps) Watch how it's done. I'm going to put an amount of gold on the table. I'd like you to consider it, and if it's to your liking, take it, and if not, just shake your head. And I'll put 200 gold on the table. I'll put 200 more. I'll put 2,000 more. And another 2,000.
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Travis: 4,400.
Sam: 17. Plus seven! 24.
Matt: Takes the gold.
Travis: Wow!
Sam: Check and mate.
Travis: Check'n'mate?
Matt: You now have a scroll of fire shield.
Sam: Scroll of fire shield, excellent. I don't know what that is.
Travis: Wow. Do you have anything that makes you faster?
Matt: "I said I have something that makes you jump."
Travis: No. I'm pretty good at jumping. What about regular healing potions?
Matt: "That I've got! You cleared me out of my other various vials last time."
Travis: No new exotics came in?
Matt: "No, I'm waiting on-- Trade's been a little slow. Looks like things are getting up in Emon, so hopefully we'll have more soon. But for the time being, I do have some more healing potions." And he goes into the back room, and you hear him rummaging for a minute. You hear one crate fall over and a couple of things shatter. "Ah god damn--". And eventually he comes back through the door, and he's holding in his arms a few clusters of various glass vials. Some of them have been repurposed and taped at the top, but they're functional. He sets them down on the counter. "All right. I have six potions of healing, and I have three of greater healing, and one superior."
Sam: Do I know how much these things tend to cost?
Matt: Make an intelligence check.
Sam: Ooh! This is not a save.
Matt: Yes, just add your modifier.
Sam: 20!
Matt: Yes, actually. The healing potions can range around 75 to 100 gold pieces generally. The uncommon ones can range somewhere in the 500 gold pieces range. The superior, however, are much rarer to come by, and the fact he even has one, with how recently you guys cleared him out, it's pretty decent. That one can run anywhere between 4,000-5,000 gold pieces.
Sam: And it's six, three, and one? Is that right?
Matt: Six, three, and one.
Travis: Do you want to get them? It seems like you got all the money in the world.
Sam: I can heal myself just fine, but I don't know about your friends-- do they have healing abilities?
Travis: No, not-- well they do, they touch you with their hand and then like all of a sudden it feels a bit better.
Sam: A bit better?
Travis: Yeah. I don't really know how that works.
Sam: But they use potions. I've seen them use potions.
Travis: Yeah, I'm normally pouring them in their mouths.
Sam: Do you think they would appreciate these?
Travis: I don't know, I hadn't thought that far. As a (mumbling) new member of Vox Machina--
Sam: What was that?
Travis: Bad allergies here. It could be like a really great gift, you know? Like Keyleth gave you.
Sam: -- welcome-me-to-the-gang gift.
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: Do you gift-wrap, here, sir?
Matt: "For an additional charge, yes, of course, I gift wrap!"
Sam: -- of course for an additional charge. What if we took the whole lot of those for 6,000 gold?
Matt: "The whole lot? For 6,000. I'm afraid that is far under the price I'd be considering. Let me see here." And he does some kind of notations, and he goes, "Hm. You seem, from our previous experience, to be quite the bargainer, my friend."
Travis: Yeah, the brains.
Matt: "How would you say to the fair price of 10,000 gold pieces for the batch?"
Travis: Let me confer with my partner. (whispers) How many on your hands is that? Yeah, no-- both hands, how many?
Sam: All.
Travis: Two?
Sam: Oh. Wait. (all laugh)
Sam: It's too much.
Travis: Too much.
Sam: Yes. This man is insulting your intelligence, and you should be very angry right now.
Travis: How about 9,000 gold pieces?
Matt: "Mm, you drive a very hard bargain, my big friend, however! Because it's you? Deal."
Travis: Done! Pay the man.
Sam: I would object to this. This is coming out of my purse, and I insist that you negotiate with me, and not--
Travis: Tary, this man drives a really well-known establishment. If we leave here, after having struck that bargain, and we don't pay? There will be more guards outside.
Sam: (gulps) How about this. I can trade you something worth far more than the extra 3,000 gold this gentleman promised you.
Matt: "What would this be?"
Sam: It's a rare egg. Magical in nature. It can save a life, in any situation. And if you eat it when you are nearly dead, you will go back into battle with the strength and bravery of ten men, and you will not rest until your foes are dead.
Matt: Make a persuasion check. This isn't deception because you believe this wholeheartedly.
Sam: Is this deception or persuasion?
Matt: This is persuasion.
Sam: 22.
Matt: "6,000 and the egg, you say? Very well." He pushes the--
Sam: Gentle!
Matt: "I will be." He goes over and quickly reaches over and grabs a thick towel-like pile of cloth, and wraps it up carefully. "Ooh." Sets it down. "A pleasure doing business with you all."
Sam: Ah-ah-ah. The gift-wrapping? (all laugh)
Matt: "Terribly sorry. My apologies. I'll be right to it." And he turns and leaves the room.
Travis: Tary, that was a personal gift from me to you.
Sam: I know, but we're partners, as you just said, and I felt that you would approve of me doing so.
Travis: I suppose I am a bit proud.
Matt: (loud clanging)
Sam: What was that?
Matt: You hear behind you guys in the doorway--
Sam: Oh shit. Oh shit.
Matt: -- some of the impacts of metal, rapidly and heavily.
Travis: What?
Sam: Sword!
Travis: Oh Jesus.
Matt: You watch, (whoosh), whips into a longsword. And you glance behind and you see, walking through the doorway, the very heavy, hulking figure of Doty, carrying two unconscious guards that are hanging from his hands.
Sam: Oh shit.
Travis: What did you do? Give me those! I punch them both, one time each, in the jaw, just for extra measure.
Matt: Okay. Both jaws are very broken.
Travis: Your guy really did a number. Cool. Okay. (all laugh)
Travis: Everybody's going to die, all right? So we're going to kill everyone that we see in the next ten seconds.
Sam: Wait, we're killing them? Even the shop owner?
Travis: Yeah, he's got to die.
Sam: Oh shit. All right. Partners, right? I'll do whatever you say.
Travis: Is there a counter in the shop?
Matt: Yeah, there's a counter in the front area.
Travis: Is it wooden?
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: Can he see through the counter?
Matt: No, the proprietor is in the back room. He's wrapping your stuff right now.
Sam: He doesn't know this happened. Let's get rid of them. Get rid of them.
Travis: Well, what's in the shop? Is there a tapestry, is there a rug?
Matt: It's not a very big-- There is a secondary room to the side where it looks like there is an upper platform, but that looks like where his bedroom is, maybe.
Travis: Uh-huh.
Matt: There's a couple of lanterns, it's a warm-lit interior, and as you're looking around, it's not a huge establishment. Make a perception check.
Travis: Yeah. Two.
Matt: You have no idea! You're panicking.
Travis: I saw this in a tavern once. Let's sit them up like they're just sleeping and nobody will notice.
Sam: They have jaws-- the blood! Their jaws are terrible!
Travis: Well, didn't you put a mask on Dotty? Let's do it again.
Sam: I can't! I don't have extra masks.
Travis: No, it will be no problem.
Sam: We can put them somewhere else.
Travis: I sit one up in the corner, and I sit the other one, and lean it on his shoulder.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Oh my god. What?
Travis: This is great. Don't worry.
Sam: Even I can tell that those are two--
Travis: I have an even better idea! I take the cask of ale out of the bag of holding, and I just start pouring ale all over them.
Sam: Why would they be in here drinking? They're guards on duty!
Travis: They're terrible guards. They make horrible life choices. They're in the wrong line of work. I take two chalices and I throw it in their laps. Cool. Now I need you to vomit on them.
Sam: I can't vomit.
Travis: Do it right now. Put your finger down your throat and puke on these guards.
Matt: Make an intimidation check, Grog.
Travis: 17! Puke on those fucking guards!
Sam: What do I roll?
Matt: I'm going to say, make an insight check. Sure.
Sam: 16.
Travis: Vomit on those bitches.
Sam: (dry heaving)
Matt: And that's going to be giffed forever. (all laugh)
Matt: Make a constitution saving throw.
Sam: Natural 20.
Matt: About 30 seconds of you trying to gag yourself pass, before the shop owner comes back, with these beautifully packaged healing potions. "All right, so--"
Sam: One second! One second.
Travis: I'm really sorry. These two gentlemen obviously have been off their ass. They came in here, smelling of booze, looking for something to make them feel better, I don't know, and they just passed out in the corner. Is there someone you know that we can call? I really hate just leaving them here.
Matt: Make a deception check.
Marisha: Oh my god. Come on, Grog!
Taliesin: Please a four.
Travis: Nine.
Taliesin: Yes!
Matt: He slowly hands out this really nice bundle, and it has a little bow on it and it's wrapped, and he hands it out to you and just goes, "Please, take this and never come back. Please."
Travis: For the rest of the day?
Matt: "Ever again. Your presence has brought me no end of pain. Just go."
Travis: Obviously, we've gotten the better end of this deal.
Sam: I think that that is true, absolutely.
Travis: Do you still have the--
Matt: "Go!"
Travis: We should go. We should leave.
Sam: All right. Thank you for your--
Matt: (incoherent noises)
Sam: Good day to you. Let's go. Doty, come.
Travis: Bidet.
Matt: Doty turns. "Ahh!" And comes running after you guys as you exit the shop.
Liam: Holy shit.
Taliesin: That was amazing. I don't feel good.
Marisha: Wow.
Travis: Good job. We've got to go. We've got to hole up somewhere for a minute. You know. A drink?
Sam: Please.
Travis: Yeah. Is there a tavern near this shop?
Matt: In the Quad Roads? Yeah. There's actually quite a few taverns.
Sam: As soon as we step outside, I barf all over the floor. (all laugh)
Travis: Where was that? What the fuck?
Sam: I'm sorry. It just comes naturally. I can't force it.
Travis: You can't perform on command? I needed you. Okay, you got more in there?
Sam: No.
Travis: It's just a one-er?
Sam: Maybe a little.
Travis: Okay.
Sam: (barfs)
Travis: Okay. That looks like Lucky Charms.
Matt: Okay. While you guys get a drink, we're going to get a quick bathroom break. We have a couple more beats we want to get through before the night's end. We're not going to go too long, trust me. But we're going to take a quick bathroom break, and then we'll come back here in a few minutes. We do have one more giveaway here tonight from our awesome friends at Wyrmwood. We have a dice box here, signed by the cast of Critical Role. It is a birch dice box. Do we have a code for the chat room?
Crew: Wyrmwood!
Matt: Wyrmwood. Go ahead and use, one word, Wyrmwood, in the chat room on Twitch. We'll have a break, and we'll have a winner announced for you when we get back.
Marisha: Wyrmwood with a 'y'.
Matt: Yes, Wyrmwood with a 'y', as in the actual company. Thank you guys so much. We'll see you in a few minutes. [break]
Matt: Welcome back, everyone. So, first and foremost, we have our winner in the chat room. 'OnlyTwentiesAllowed'. Great name, by the way. You won the contest for this week. We're going to go ahead and get your information, and send you your Wyrmwood box. Thank you again, Wyrmwood, for sending that so we can get that to you guys for free as the contest weekly. Back into the story we were. So, you guys are drinking and laying low.
Travis: Yep.
Matt: You guys were making your way to the library, you said?
Laura: Yes.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: We're going to finish up and try and get out, I guess?
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: I would also like to definitely talk about maybe having access later, to come back at some point.
Marisha: We want to talk to Kusuo and see.
Taliesin: Just on our way out.
Matt: On the way out, as the tomes are placed and locked back up, you talk to Kusuo. "That is not a worry. Just make sure that you request me when you arrive."
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: "It would be my pleasure."
Taliesin: Thank you so much. And I hope that that book finds a proper home and is worthwhile. Thank you for your time.
Marisha: Thank you. And would it be possible if we bring friends of ours in the future who are--
Taliesin: Of our group.
Marisha: Yeah, who are fluent in these languages.
Matt: "But of course. Just make sure that you accompany them."
Taliesin: Of course.
Marisha: Thank you.
Matt: He leads you out. You guys exit the library just as Vax and Vex, after finding information on where to go, arrive.
Laura: Do you guys have the book?
Taliesin: We do.
Marisha: We totally do.
Laura: What the fuck?
Marisha: I know-- I thought-- You know, I think-- I don't know.
Laura: What did you find?
Marisha: Well, some good stuff.
Taliesin: It actually went quite well.
Laura: All right.
Marisha: We found one book that we could read, and one book that we couldn't.
Laura: Okay.
Marisha: So we'll have to come back with you guys. Because it was all written in Abyssal.
Laura: We can read that!
Marisha: Yes! Because your father forced you to do things.
Taliesin: Don't they all. Speaking of fathers forcing you to do things, we have to deal with you. We have a starting point for the rakshasa.
Laura: Wonderful.
Taliesin: So, soon, when it's time, step one will be the City of Dis.
Laura: The City of Dis?
Taliesin: Dis City. Not this city, but the City of Dis.
Laura: Okay.
Marisha: We built Dis city.
Taliesin: Did you build Dis city?
Marisha: On rock'n'roll.
Liam: Can I have that book please?
Taliesin: Oh, yes! Hi. Yes, this is-- Yes.
Liam: I'm just going to hold on to that.
Taliesin: Are you going to hold on-- Do we have a bag to put that in?
Laura: We have Grog's bag of holding, the same one we've always had. Hey, is there somewhere we could buy a fucking bag of holding?
Travis: They're kind of rare.
Matt: They're not expensive.
Travis: To Grog, they're rare.
Matt: But you could ask around and try to find somebody. It'll take a little time. You guys are right now hitting the cusp of dawn. Sorry, dusk.
Laura: Is there somewhere I could find before things close? Just to see?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Laura: Oh, balls. That's terrible.
Matt: What did you roll?
Laura: I rolled 13.
Matt: You manage to find one location, but it's been closed for half an hour when you get there.
Laura: Fuck! Fuck. Fine. It's fine.
Taliesin: It's in Los Angeles.
Travis: Pittsburgh.
Marisha: Pittsburgh, yeah.
Laura: Keyleth?
Marisha: Yeah?
Laura: How about we go see your dad.
Marisha: (laughs nervously)
Liam: Are we tabling the book, then?
Taliesin: We're going to drop it off, I think.
Marisha: What did you guys find out? Is it a good spot, a good home for it? Do you want to drop it off?
Laura: They definitely are interested in it at the Platinum Sanctuary.
Liam: A little too interested for my taste.
Taliesin: You think?
Liam: Yes. I don't want this book in anyone's hands, frankly.
Laura: They were very interested in researching it. Which I don't think is a bad thing. They're good people. And learning about history is a good way to keep yourself from repeating it. However, you do serve the Raven Queen, who I know wants nothing to do with the undead. And if it means destroying this book, then do what needs to be done.
Taliesin: Can we destroy this book?
Marisha: It's like our magical items. It's not easy to destroy them. Seems like a pretty powerful book.
Taliesin: The fear I have with the book is of course if we keep it, we keep it out of the hands of everyone, save those who are finally strong enough to best us.
Liam: Do we want this book to travel to hell?
Marisha: Ooh, no.
Taliesin: No, no.
Marisha: But it might not be a bad-- I mean, we did drop off the horn of Orcus here.
Liam: I'll tell you what. Why don't you guys get everything set to go, and I will drop this off.
Marisha: What? Where? There? Where?
Taliesin: Oh. Oh.
Liam: Yeah, it'll be fine. It'll be fine.
Marisha: You're going to go back to the temple.
Taliesin: That's a terrible idea. I kind of like it. That's not a good thing. I think it's a good idea. That may not be a good thing.
Liam: Do you want to come with me?
Taliesin: Yes.
Liam: I hook him by the arm and we just start off.
Taliesin: Find a bar!
Marisha: I'll get things packed?
Laura: It was my idea! Go fuck yourself.
Liam: Love you!
Marisha: I look at Vex.
Laura: Dresses? Oh, everything's fucking closed!
Marisha: Oh goddamnit, Pittsburgh.
Laura: Are there dress shops open? At all?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Liam: This ain't New York City.
Laura: We just want pretty dresses. Oh! Oh! Oh!
Marisha: Get it, girl. Get it, get it, girl.
Laura: 25.
Matt: You do manage to find one individual who is in the process of closing their formal attire shop.
Marisha: I toss them 20 gold. An extra 20 minutes, please.
Matt: "But of course! Come on in."
Marisha: Thank you.
Travis: Wow.
Laura: Ah! Everything's better!
Matt: (laughs) All right.
Laura: Keyleth?
Marisha: What?
Laura: What's good for your Ashari people? Something covered in grass, maybe?
Marisha: Mm.
Laura: Turf? Astro-turf?
Marisha: You know, it's a little esoteric for me. A little experimental. A little Gaga-esque.
Laura: Lots of pink bows, maybe, for me.
Marisha: You know, it reminds a little of when we dressed Trinket up in pink bows.
Laura: Right, and we could be like--
Marisha: I don't know if that's a good thing.
Laura: Help us. Make us pretty.
Marisha: Make us pretty.
Laura: And very expensive looking.
Marisha: I'm going to become royalty. Kind of, but not really.
Laura: It's my first time getting to dress up as royalty.
Marisha: Yes!
Matt: "All right. That-- Okay." The gentleman seems a bit overwhelmed, but quickly goes ahead and helps you guys find, over the next 30 or so minutes, some very nice dresses. Better than anything you've previously worn. And he gets you something that he thinks royalty should wear. As there is no real royalty in Vasselheim, it is a church-run state. It is more of a frumpy robe with a fur collar.
Marisha: Vex, this collar is so big.
Laura: This is terrible. Give her something flowy.
Marisha: Why can't I see over it?
Matt: "Flowy. Of course. I'm so sorry. Flowy, yes." He's starting to get a little impatient, but does manage to pull one very nice simple gown, that just hangs off the shoulders and pools on the ground around you.
Laura: In all the colors. Can it be in all the colors?
Marisha: Yeah, can we dip-dye it blue?
Matt: "Dye? I could have it dyed. That would be by tomorrow morning prepared."
Laura: Okay.
Marisha: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Matt: "All right, I'll get it taken care of."
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: All right. While that's happening, you two are heading to the Raven's Crest?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: All right. So you guys walk over to the Dusk Meadow. You're met by the same gray, slightly bleak atmosphere on this side of Vasselheim. But you make your way to the exterior of the large structure. The ominous obsidian and gold building that represents the center, if you will, the beating heart of the Raven Queen's worship. As you approach the front stairway, both of you familiar with, one brought in, the other not met with any living person for the most part in your journey, you both approach-- still arms hooked?
Liam: No.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: I suspect you've been here before.
Taliesin: Yes.
Liam: (sighs) I like that things are better between you and I now.
Taliesin: I feel the same. I like that most things are better now. Not everything, but it's a brighter world, even for us.
Liam: Do you know what I like? I like the version of you that my sister brings out.
Taliesin: I do too. I'll do my best to keep him in the forefront. And as for you: I like the version of you that's not afraid. So let's go meet this terrible thing, drop off the book, get you feeling a bit better.
Liam: (clears throat) Come on.
Taliesin: Fuck. (clears throat)
Matt: As you both ascend the stairs, you see standing-- previously not noticed as you guys were having a conversation-- but off to the sides of each side of the entryway, the two doors that are closed, there are two women in long black gowns with dark veils that drift over their head to the mid torso, that you had lead you into the chamber initially. Both suddenly present themselves, bow, and step out of the side as the chamber doors open to the interior of the Raven's Crest temple. There, standing as the doors open, is what looks to be an older woman wearing the same attire, the same dark veil, somewhat able to see her features beneath the dark material that hangs in front of her. She steps forward as the doors open.
Liam: Hello there. You recognize me. This is my friend. We bring you an offering for the Queen.
Matt: The woman bends down, takes the tome from your hand. She holds it, she takes her fingers and brushes the cloth away that currently obscures the tome, takes a look at it, holds it a foot further away from her face, and throws the cloth over the front, clasps it in her arms and brings it down towards her torso. And, for the first time since this-- you've heard her speak before, you have done this before-- but the strange eerie kind of airy whisper comes out from this older woman as she bends forward, clutching this tome. "We thank you. And we will be sure that this finds its final seal."
Liam: She has begun to speak to me. Her desires are not clear, entirely, but I am listening. And I intend to learn.
Matt: "Good."
Liam: We have to go. But I mean to come back.
Matt: "Whenever you're ready. The vision of the gods is obscured beyond the Divine Gate. We are not just their tools but their extensions. The creations that act as their fingers in this plane. The center of all other life and death. Be watchful. Be vigilant." She bows, and backs into the Raven's Crest once more as the doors close, the two other women now flanking out of the shadows and stepping before each door, and seemingly just not paying attention to your presence.
Taliesin: I was envious of you once. God. So sorry. (sighs)
Liam: (whispers) Good day.
Matt: They make no response as you guys turn and make your way down the stairs from the Raven's Crest.
Taliesin: Just so you know, it is your duty to have some joy in the meantime. You do know that, right? You're no use to her a wreck. She needs a man. Have a fucking beer. And I slap him on the ass as we walk towards the pub.
Liam: Look over my shoulder at the temple as we walk. Come on, let's get drunk.
Matt: As your head moves forward, walking, you feel this cold tingle just drift down the back of your neck and spine, then it fades, and you keep walking, carrying on your chest there a brief, warm secondary heartbeat representing the brief boon granted upon you by the Raven Queen. You catch up with the ladies at the bar.
Marisha: Hey!
Laura: (laugh)
Sam: (laugh)
Taliesin: I shove Keyleth at him. Fix that, good god.
Liam: (laughs)
Taliesin: Ahh.
Liam: Scoop and lift.
Marisha: Are you broken again?
Liam: No.
Marisha: Ah.
Liam: I need a drink, have you had one already?
Marisha: Yes.
Liam: I'm fine.
Laura: She's had a few.
Liam: Yeah?
Laura: (laugh)
Matt: (laugh)
Matt: You guys, you've found dresses that are to your liking. You've-- the cost of them with the materials would probably run about 20 gold apiece.
Laura: I think that's acceptable.
Sam: (laughs)
Marisha: Designer.
Laura: Mm-hm.
Taliesin: Couture.
Marisha: Couture.
Laura: I can't believe these dresses are so much cheaper than a healing potion.
Marisha: I know.
Laura: Ridiculous.
Marisha: It's like, look at the beading!
Laura: (laughs)
Marisha: It's crazy!
Laura: Wait, we're picking them up in the morning, Keyleth. You're not even wearing it yet.
Marisha: In the morning, I'll look at the beading. (all laugh)
Marisha: It's crazy.
Taliesin: That's sweat, yes.
Marisha: Yeah.
Taliesin: Yeah. Ah, where are Grog and Taryon?
Laura: Oh, we haven't heard from them in a long time.
Taliesin: Grog, Taryon!
Laura: Grog!
Travis: Can we hear them?
Matt: You were still in the Quad Roads, keeping low. You guys are both-- you're able to hear them. Whatever you guys have been up to trying to stay out of sight.
Travis: Yes?
Taliesin: We're at a bar, where are you?
Travis: Funny, we are doing something similar. Are you done?
Taliesin: No, we're just starting. You--
Sam: Are they talking to you right now?
Travis: Yeah, they are.
Taliesin: Is that Taryon?
Sam: Just tell them to--
Taliesin: Tell him we say hello.
Travis: All right. The two fucking people talking to--
Sam: Tell them--
Travis: Yep.
Laura: Did you buy potions?
Sam: Can we ask them where they are?
Taliesin: I need to talk to Taryon.
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: Ask them where they are.
Taliesin: Tell Taryon to take you where we all are right now
Sam: Tell them where we are right now, and ask them where they are.
Taliesin: Just have him bring us to us-- I'll give you directions. It'll be fine.
Sam: Tell them--
Travis: My real-world ADD is fully maxed out. (all laugh)
Travis: I just heard a bunch of sea lions barking like, "Ar ar ar ar." It was nothing. Oh fuck.
Taliesin: Why don't you two come join us?
Travis: I reach over, I cover Tary's mouth. Percy?
Taliesin: Yes?
Travis: Let me know when you're done.
Taliesin: Are you sure? We're drinking. You can join.
Travis: All right. What tavern are you in?
Taliesin: All right, I'm going to send you the psychic information of where we are right now.
Travis: You can do that?
Laura: I want to say the name of it.
Marisha: (laugh)
Matt: (laugh)
Matt: Okay. Vex lets you know that this is the-- shit, what is it? What tavern would this be here? Let me go through.
Taliesin: Can't you just bullshit? You have to actually look up the real name?
Sam: No, there's two bars in Vasselheim!
Matt: There are a lot of bars in Vasselheim.
Taliesin: Yeah. It's-- the other bar would actually be enough.
Laura: The other bar.
Matt: The Siren's Succor.
Laura: (mystical voice) We're in the Siren's Succor.
Travis: Oh my god, I heard it.
Taliesin: Isn't that amazing?
Travis: My powers are getting stronger.
Taliesin: I've gone beyond the veil.
Travis: All right. We'll make our way over to you.
Taliesin: I've gained such power.
Laura: (mystical voice) Meet us soon. Did you buy potions?
Travis: Are you asking me to buy potions, Percy?
Taliesin: No, I want you to come straight to the bar. Straight to the bar.
Travis: But I thought you just sent me a request for--
Taliesin: I was thinking about something else. No, you just heard me thinking about something else.
Travis: All right, we'll have to fine-tune my abilities.
Taliesin: You'll get there.
Travis: All right.
Taliesin: I have every faith.
Marisha: You're doing really well at perfecting your mystical voice.
Travis: Oh my god, I hear two voices.
Marisha: Yeah, it's good. It's good. I like it.
Liam: Freddie. Order me something that rich people drink.
Laura: Beer! (laughs)
Taliesin: Get him--
Laura: Some wine.
Liam: Is that it? I've done beer.
Taliesin: Get him a giant glass of half Guinness, half whatever cider they have.
Laura: Ugh.
Taliesin: Rich people get drunk. Oh, do you want something fancy?
Liam: Yeah!
Taliesin: Okay, I take the black and tan.
Matt: (laughs)
Marisha: Oh, black and tan.
Taliesin: And I get him a tiny glass of creme de menthe. (laughs)
Liam: This one tells me that you have the goods, so I want the goods. Want the goods.
Taliesin: I don't know how to feel a little awkward in saying I'm not sure I want to waste it on you. But--
Liam: We're in a bar, you fucker. Buy me a drink, you asshole. I've saved your life like three times.
Taliesin: I wait for her to nod. Okay, that's enough.
Marisha: What do you mean by the goods?
Taliesin: Oh dear. I pull up-- I tip the barman because I'm showing him that I'm pulling something out for some glassware.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: Because I'm not an asshole.
Matt: Right.
Taliesin: Well--
Sam: (incredulous sound) (all laugh)
Taliesin: And then I pour a little bit of the Tear Whiskey. Of the Green Tear.
Liam: Mm.
Taliesin: It's mean. It's minty. You'll love it.
Liam: Hm.
Taliesin: We have it every year.
Marisha: Where did you keep that?
Laura: (laughs)
Marisha: Where'd you just pull that from?
Taliesin: Okay, do you actually want me to answer? You can say yes, it's all right. It's not going to get weird. That's all right. I'm going to tell you anyway.
Marisha: Whoa. Jeez.
Taliesin: See this belt? It's got a series of these little--
Marisha: Uh-huh.
Taliesin: -- things on. Those are mostly filled with little bits of gunpowder I have wrapped up in the thing.
Liam: That's all?
Marisha: Right.
Taliesin: These last four are liquor.
Marisha: (gasps)
Taliesin: Sh.
Marisha: That's so smart.
Taliesin: That's how I can just stand everywhere among their being idiots, is I'm really trashed.
Marisha: Wow. And probably much cheaper than just buying in bars all the time.
Taliesin: Yeah. Oh yeah. No, I'm-- well. I like to--
Marisha: Wow.
Taliesin: -- drink what we-- the locals.
Laura: I'm staring at the door waiting for Grog and Taryon.
Matt: You have to take the pre-gaming feat to actually use that ability.
Taliesin: What? Oh--
Matt: (laughs) At that point, you watch as Grog's hands hit the doorway and he sheepishly looks in, checking the surroundings for any possible--
Laura: Grog.
Travis: How busy is it in the tavern?
Matt: It's actually pretty sparse, aside from your friends, maybe two other individuals.
Travis: Okay. Come in. Come inside. Listen.
Matt: Okay. Tary comes in and (crashing sound) behind you. Doty.
Travis: No, sh. Gah. Sh.
Marisha: Hey! Oh, sorry.
Laura: I forgot how weird Doty looks.
Travis: Sh. Jeez. Just bring it down a notch.
Taliesin: This is so-- Oh. Hm.
Travis: Apparently, Dotty had a bit of a run-in with some of that Vasselheim--
Laura: Did you get it? Did you finally get it?
Marisha: (laughs)
Sam: Did you get it?
Travis: Yeah. (all laugh)
Taliesin: For those of you at home, this thing has been just driving us nuts.
Laura: It's been all night.
Liam: It's a stirge.
Travis: We had a bit of a run-in--
Matt: It's fine.
Travis: -- and Doty may or may not have paddy-caked some of the guards, so, like, we need to remove--
Sam: (tearfully) Doty killed two guards. He just killed them. They're dead.
Travis: Well, there it is.
Sam: (tearfully) They're dead!
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: (tearfully) He killed two guards.
Laura: He killed them?
Travis: He's been like this.
Sam: (tearfully) We didn't tell him to! He just did.
Laura: Did he really kill them?
Liam: But did the disguise work?
Sam: I actually think it did. Actually.
Travis: He's been doing this for about half an hour, so--
Taliesin: Half full. He'll have a glass of something half full. Thank--
Marisha: What? What did you tell Doty? What did you inform him right before--
Liam: Are you sure they were dead? Are they just fucked up?
Travis: I think they were--
Matt: Doty is writing all this down by the way.
Marisha: Potentially murdered the-- Doty!
Sam: This is evidence, Doty!
Marisha: I might-- Oh.
Travis: Look, Percy. Vax.
Sam: Ugh.
Laura: Dear diary.
Travis: I think you you need to remove--
Laura: I have an itty bitty metal penis. (all laugh)
Travis: You need to remove--
Taliesin: Leave that there.
Travis: -- Doty's disguise.
Taliesin: No.
Sam: No, no! Oh, because they might recognize him as the murderer?
Travis: Yeah. They'll be looking for a giant red-haired--
Taliesin: Wait.
Travis: -- eight-foot-tall--
Sam: No. What we need to do is put another disguise on top of this one. (all laugh)
Travis: You're right.
Taliesin: Doty. Doty. Did you actually expire two soldiers?
Laura: As he's doing this, I pull out some lipstick and I start drawing lipstick on his face, to try to turn him boy to girl.
Matt: Doesn't resist.
Taliesin: You ask and he listens to you.
Liam: Is there a mop anywhere in the room?
Marisha: What?
Liam: In this room?
Matt: Not within visual--
Liam: No.
Marisha: You want me to ask Doty? Or you want me to ask Tary?
Matt: -- vicinity. You could ask.
Liam: What about drapes on the windows?
Sam: He won't answer any of you.
Taliesin: Ask him if he actually just hurt, or if they're--
Matt: Not in this tavern, no.
Marisha: -- just unconscious.
Taliesin: Maybe he just punched them a couple times.
Sam: Greg knows.
Travis: Yep.
Taliesin: Ah, that's close enough.
Sam: Did you kill them, with those punches of fury?
Taliesin: Did you?
Travis: I did.
Marisha: Are you sure? Did you check?
Travis: I don't know. I'm really strong these days.
Marisha: Grog.
Liam: Insight check Grog.
Taliesin: I'm joining in on this insight check. I call bullshit.
Matt: (laughs) Sure.
Liam: Well, that's a one.
Laura: (laughs)
Liam: I'm not wasting Luck on it.
Matt: He fucking killed two people.
Taliesin: 13.
Liam: Jeez, man.
Laura: Grog.
Travis: It was like an act of mercy, really.
Liam: Did they attack you?
Matt: Grog, make a deception check.
Travis: No, no.
Sam: Oh, boy.
Laura: (nervous sound)
Travis: 19. (all laugh)
Taliesin: Fuck.
Matt: Grog fucking killed two people!
Travis: 20.
Laura: What? 20!
Liam: Why? Were you in danger?
Laura: This is what happens when Pike isn't around!
Travis: No no.
Liam: Why?
Travis: Look, from what I understand, these guards were attracted to the horrific disguise that Doty had. He knocked them out, brought them in. I checked for, like, a pulse, checked their knee reflexes, and they were on death's door, so I just finished the deal.
Marisha: Okay--
Travis: It was really merciful.
Marisha: That doesn't--
Taliesin: I'm feeling slightly better but slightly worse?
Liam: What a clusterfuck.
Laura: Did anyone see you do it?
Sam: We're not sure, Doty did this outside without us being--
Laura: Doty, did anyone see you do that to the guards?
Sam: He won't answer you. Doty, did anyone witness your crime?
Matt: (squeaking "I don't know" sound)
Marisha: Tary, what do you mean you didn't tell him to-- he just did this on --
Sam: I told him to protect us! He's my protector. He does what needs to be done to protect me.
Marisha: (sighs) Tary, is this thing safe to be following us around?
Travis: Yeah, no, he's really impressive actually. Have a little more respect.
Laura: Maybe you shouldn't bring him into cities. Maybe that should just be a rule.
Liam: Was there no other choice?
Laura: Doty doesn't come into cities.
Travis: Well, I don't know, we weren't--
Taliesin: We let the bear come into bars.
Laura: Well, yeah, Trinket is well-behaved.
Taliesin: That's fair.
Laura: Doty kills people.
Sam: Well, to be fair, Greg killed the people.
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: Doty merely roughed them up.
Travis: And to be even more fair, they'd been drinking all day. Smelled like alcohol. (all laugh)
Matt: And he does.
Taliesin: Are we still buying this?
Marisha: No way we'd buy that delivery!
Matt: (laughs)
Travis: You bet your ass you do, that's a 20!
Marisha: Can I roll an insight check? That's bullshit!
Travis: That's a 20!
Matt: You can.
Marisha: There's no fucking way!
Matt: You can, go ahead and make an insight check.
Marisha: What? Oh, bullshit. That was the most bullshit delivery.
Laura: Yeah, can I try? Can I try too?
Travis: I'm never gonna roll that high again.
Liam: Please, save us from this moral dilemma!
Marisha: Mm, mm, 21!
Laura: Oh!
Matt: You are the first person not to believe Grog's story.
Marisha: (quietly) Grog.
Laura: (laughs)
Travis: Yeah.
Marisha: Do we need to make sure you're with an adult from here on out? Can you not be trusted alone with Tary?
Laura: Did you buy potions?
Sam: I have quite a gift for you!
Laura: For me?
Matt: It looks like a--
Sam: For all of you.
Laura: Oh.
Marisha: No, no! Do not! Do not be influenced by his very generous act of kindness! That was so kind of you!
Sam: I think you'll find something for everyone in there.
Travis: Is there a little bit of vomit on there?
Matt: Like a little. Spatter. It's dried by now.
Marisha: That was like 6,000 gold worth of-- But do not! Don't!
Taliesin: Is this blood on the-- yep--
Travis: No, that's vomit.
Taliesin: Oh, that's good.
Travis: Yup.
Liam: We are skipping past the fact that two men are dead right now.
Laura: (sighs)
Liam: Do we need to go and find them? And try to--
Laura: Do we need to go find these dead guys?
Travis: Nope.
Marisha: Are you sure they're dead?
Travis: I forgot where I left them.
Marisha: Grog--
Liam: This is upsetting.
Sam: I know where they are, but the situation was fluid, and it was fast-moving. And we acted on our best instincts and our best judgment, and mistakes were made.
Travis: Yeah. Mm-hm.
Marisha: Tary, it sounds like all of the opposite of that is true.
Sam: When you're an adventurer--
Laura: Except for mistakes.
Marisha: Except for the mistakes part, yeah.
Sam: When you're an adventurer, you have to learn to live with a certain amount of bloodshed around you, and I think what Greg has told me today--what he has taught me was to toughen me up. And I appreciate him for that and I appreciate the lesson. And I appreciate you all for sending me out with him, knowing full well that that would happen.
Laura: Don't kill people in cities! Don't kill people!
Sam: I still haven't-- I-- okay.
Laura: Don't kill people!
Travis: Who killed anybody?
Laura: Grog!
Marisha: Vax?
Laura: Did you--
Travis: What?
Laura: You didn't kill anyone, did you?
Liam: Of course he did, he looked us in the eye and he said he killed two people! We should go find them.
Travis: Yep. They're dead.
Laura: I don't believe him. Can I roll an insight check?
Matt: Sure.
Laura: Oh no.
Taliesin: Whose vomit was this?
Laura: Oh no!
Laura: (laughs)
Liam: (laughs)
Matt: What did you roll?
Laura: I believe him!
Matt: What'd you roll?
Laura: I believe him so good! 11!
Taliesin: This game is a nightmare.
Matt: Grog fucking killed two people!
Laura: Oh my God! Grog!
Liam: That's it.
Travis: Look, I was trying to protect our new friend here. It had to be done.
Liam: Where was this place? Where was this place?
Laura: Ugh, we're never going to be able to come back to Vasselheim!
Liam: We have to find these two men and bring them to a temple or something, we can't just leave them--
Sam: It was a potion seller, it was a medicinal, herbalist or something--
Taliesin: Oh no.
Liam: Can you guide me there?
Marisha: Oh, you did not go to that guy, the guy who-- oh no.
Taliesin: Did you go to that guy?
Sam: It seems to be--
Travis: He did say he wanted to see the twins, especially.
Sam: That is not--
Liam: Look, listen, take me to this place. You and I will carry these men to a temple.
Sam: And do what? What they did to you?
Liam: We will-- what happened to me?
Sam: Well, you were revived, from death.
Liam: Well, I can't do that. And you can't do that, so we need to take these men to a temple where somebody can help them!
Travis: Oh, God, look, fine, they're not dead!
Laura: I don't believe you.
Travis: (sighs) No, I just knocked the life out of them, but they're not dead, right, wiretapping does not mean dead, all right? (all laugh)
Sam: It was in quotations.
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: Dead.
Travis: Dead.
Travis: Okay, look, they're fine, they might be covered in beer, we don't really need to go back for them.
Marisha: Insight check!
Laura: Yeah, I don't believe you. You killed them.
Marisha: Now you're the fucking boy who cried wolf three times.
Matt: Go for it. Roll insight, both you guys.
Marisha: God damn it, don't fuck me, Gil.
Laura: Oh, I rolled Gil, too!
Marisha: Oh, jeez, that wasn't great.
Laura: I got it. I got you covered.
Marisha: 15.
Taliesin: Natural 20.
Travis: They didn't ask you to roll, Taliesin.
Laura: 24!
Matt: No, you guys get at this point that Grog's been fucking with you.
Laura: You fucking dick!
Travis: Yep. (all laugh)
Laura: No, but seriously, you still attacked the guards, right?
Travis: He did.
Laura: That's still really bad.
Taliesin: Whose vomit is this?
Liam: So those guys aren't dead, is what you're saying? Those two guys are not dead?
Laura: They're not dead.
Travis: They're not dead.
Liam: All right, that's kind of funny.
Taliesin: I still feel like I would like an answer to the mystery of the vomit.
Laura: At least Doty was in disguise. No one will recognize him. Just take the disguise off him now.
Travis: That's what I said like five minutes ago.
Laura: Take the disguise off of him.
Marisha: That looks like Tary's vomit.
Taliesin: How can you tell?
Marisha: Because I saw him puke under the water and it floated right past me. I got a great view of it. He's a nervous puker.
Liam: What is better in this town? A disgusting mess or a robit?
Laura: A robit?
Liam: An automaton.
Laura: It's necromancy.
Liam: An ottoman.
Laura: Yes.
Sam: I think I need a drink.
Laura: (gasps)
Sam: What?
Laura: What?
Taliesin: I pour him a little bit of the Tear Whiskey.
Travis: How did you guys do?
Liam: Oh, great.
Laura: We thought we had a book.
Travis: But you don't?
Laura: But we didn't.
Liam: We left without the book, thinking we had the book, and then we lied about not having the book, but we actually didn't have it.
Marisha: But it seems like it might be okay, right?
Travis: Got that motherfucker.
Laura: Did you?
Marisha: Did you get it? Yeah! Real-life hero.
Matt: Two guards alive. That is fucking dead (all laugh)
Laura: I say we get Doty's disguise off of him.
Taliesin: All right.
Laura: I say we go to sleep.
Liam: I start peeling it away.
Sam: And then what?
Laura: Then we get up in the morning, and we pick up our pretty dresses.
Marisha: Yeah.
Laura: And we go get you crowned! So we can wear our pretty dresses.
Taliesin: Keep drinking.
Matt: Everything but the hair comes off. The mask, the porcelain, everything else comes off.
Laura: What about the cloak?
Matt: The cloak does not come off.
Laura: No!
Matt: Not from just tugging it. It's adhered pretty strongly.
Liam: This is so fucking terrible. I'm so angry. (all laugh)
Marisha: Tary, going forward, I think you need to recognize how literal Doty takes things, and maybe think maybe more detailedly on how you word things, maybe?
Sam: Doty did his job. He protected us.
Marisha: From innocent guards.
Sam: Who were going to arrest us.
Laura: Why were they going to arrest you?
Sam: Because we were arcanists walking loose in the--
Laura: It's not illegal!
Sam: I was led to believe it was. And I'm a stranger in this land, and they were trailing us, and your cohort over there, the big guy himself, told me that they were a danger to us, and Doty did his job. Listen, you can't blame Doty for the mistakes that I may have made. I take full responsibility for this, and I throw myself at your feet for mercy. I know I'm new to this team, and I hoped that this gift would be a peacemaking gesture. By the way, you should divide all these potions up as you see fit.
Laura: We totally should.
Sam: And I'm sorry if I made mistakes today. But we're all alive, we have what we need, and we're still on an adventure, right?
Taliesin: A toast to mistakes--
Sam: Let's all sing our fight song, shall we?
Taliesin: -- and to terrible consequences, to failure.
Laura: How about you go first, Tary.
Marisha: Yes, let's learn it from you.
Sam: Doty, show me what we wrote. (sings) 'Seven intrepid warriors we, were strong before and 'stronger with me. Drinking wine and Heroes' Feasts, saving maidens, defeating beasts. We 'fight, fight, fight, with strength and girth, I slew a marid and proved my worth. Vix and Vox, 'Kiko and Greg, and Percival with the head like an egg. I defeated a kraken too, and I saved the 'Ashari single-handedly in the ocean blue. We fight, fight, fight, with strength and girth. I 'won your hearts and I proved my worth.'
Taliesin: Ooh. Bravo!
Laura: Hey!
Sam: Now you all have fight songs too, don't you?
Taliesin: We'll cover that at the next drink. I think it's time to turn in.
Marisha: Hm, yes.
Laura: Wow.
Taliesin: I'm going to run-- I'm going to get a little bit of the hardest alcohol that they have, preferably a clear alcohol, and ask them if they have any chicken, like-- or some sort of meat that they're about to throw away.
Laura: Oh. Chicken.
Taliesin: Stop it.
Matt: They do have some near-spoiling meat. And at the cost of one gold piece you can get a pretty solid bottle.
Taliesin: I pop it and I'm just going to try and start solventing away the glue with grease, with fatty grease and alcohol.
Matt: It'll take you the better part of the next couple of hours, but you can do it.
Taliesin: Yeah, I'm just going to try and get this thing off. Let me try and remove the hair too.
Matt: You do manage to get the hair off. You don't get all the glue splotches. Doty now has these, like, clusters of nasty-looking glue splotches all over the head. And of like, taken pieces of thread, and fuzz, and dirt and things just from the atmosphere to him. It looks awful. Doty looks awful. But the cloak does come off.
Taliesin: We'll have it cleaned, dear.
Laura: That's amazing. So worth it, darling, I can't believe you did that. Thank you.
Liam: Does the cloak of Elvenkind look like butt?
Laura: It's got clumps of red hair stuck.
Matt: Only like 10% butt. Like, there is still glue on it. You have to spend more time.
Liam: It worked?
Sam: Did we take off the mask?
Matt: If you want to.
Taliesin: It looks like the kindergarten class attacked it.
Marisha: Yeah.
Sam: Should we take off the mask?
Laura: Probably.
Taliesin: Fucker.
Sam: There's another one! (all laugh)
Taliesin: There's another one! (all laugh)
Matt: It's like a hydra, Travis killed one, two more took its place.
Travis: It's so strange man, they go up, they come back down.
Taliesin: Arsehole, where did you go? Fuck. They're huge. Sorry. That was really inappropriate.
Matt: So, as you guys get tired, you could rent a room for the evening.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: At the tavern if you'd like, the Siren's Succor.
Laura: Okay, let's rent a room.
Matt: Okay. So, I'd say for the rooms for all of you guys tonight, drinking there, mark off ten gold, it's fine.
Sam: For everyone, or each.
Laura: For everyone.
Matt: For everyone.
Sam: Pf.
Taliesin: I know.
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: I can take care of this, if you'd like.
Taliesin: No, we got this. It's okay.
Laura: We've got it. It's fine, Tary.
Taliesin: But part of being--
Liam: You buy the potions, we pay for the shitty hotel rooms.
Sam: (laughs) I don't know if that evens out. But all right.
Taliesin: Don't think of it as a thing that evens out, think of it as an ever-increasing debt that doesn't really ever get paid.
Sam: I like the way you think, science bro.
Taliesin: Cheers.
Matt: All righty. As you guys rest for the evening, the morning comes around. You're across the board, fairly hung-over, but functional. Except for Grog, Grog, you're fine. Yay constitution 20! But you guys muster yourselves, get a quick bite to eat downstairs, in the now even-more-empty tavern. Your dresses are at the ready, you go and collect them. What's next, what do you guys want to do?
Laura: We should go to see your people.
Marisha: I mean, we could catch brunch first?
Laura: No. We should go to see. Your. People.
Taliesin: No.
Liam: No.
Marisha: All right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let's go.
Liam: No time like the present.
Laura: Wait, what are the colors of Whitestone again?
Taliesin: Lavender, white, blue, gold, silver.
Laura: That's the colors I want my dress to be.
Travis: That's five.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: It's too late, it's black. (all laugh)
Taliesin: I might add, you do-- Part of taking a crest is that you actually do get to build something of your own.
Laura: We need to work on that, Percival.
Taliesin: We do. I was-- I feel like I've been negligent. That we've not been--
Laura: You also need to explain to me what the fucking Grey Hunt is at some point.
Taliesin: Yes, we should get to that. I only know because we've talked about that.
Matt: Yeah. All right.
Laura: Come on, let's go, Keyleth.
Marisha: Okay. Let's go.
Laura: Antlers upon antlers.
Matt: All right. And such. With the Transport Via Plants spell cast into the nearest tree, you guys find yourself emerging from one of the cliffside trees that have grown out of the outcropping of stone and rock that marks the exterior of Zephra. Did you all travel here last time, or was it just Keyleth and Vax?
Marisha: It was just Vax and Allura--
Matt: Yeah, Vax. Allura, that's right.
Taliesin: Ooh.
Marisha: Whom we kind of forgot was with us. (nervous laugh)
Matt: That's right, and she was like, "Whatever."
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: All right, so you guys all emerge, and you see now, on these extremely tall mountain bluffs, the wind is strong on the outskirts, and you can see, whizzing past you, puffs of cloud, and leaf, and dust. But it's all contained on the outside of this bluff. And before you on the opposite side, built deep into this mountain top, you can see dozens and dozens of structures made from the natural stone and bending of long wood slats that seem to have been curved over into these dome-like structures. You see small trees emerging in places, and even though you are a few hundred feet off, you can already see maybe 20 or so various people just wandering the town, some of which are outside working on-- sitting on benches, working on various crafts. You can see leathers being dried out from various hides. You catch the sight of a griffin that swoops past and disappears into a nearby cloud. And looking over the bluff--
Sam: Cool.
Matt: -- about ten feet off, this is the drop, goes down for hundreds of feet before vanishing into low-hanging clouds. You guys have no idea how high up you are, but it seems very high.
Marisha: (inhales) Oh man.
Sam: Are we falling?
Laura: Is it super windy?
Marisha: No no no, we're on the mountain.
Matt: You can see a lot of wind rushing just around you, but it seems like this portion of the mountain is almost protected, or at least the winds are guided in a way where they're not affecting this portion of the mountain.
Laura: So what do we do?
Liam: What happens now, boss?
Marisha: I forgot you guys haven't seen my hometown yet. Okay, all right. Let's go that way. Okay. See, over there is where I caught my first baby griffin--
Taliesin: Oh no.
Marisha: -- he was lost and got separated from his mom, and I captured him up, and I tucked him up under my shirt. And over there actually--
Taliesin: (groans)
Marisha: -- I tripped and fell and that was the first time that I scraped my knee--
Sam: Amazing.
Marisha: -- and I was like, oh no, I'm bleeding.
Sam: It must have been terrible.
Laura: While she was walking, I go behind and do this to Vax.
Marisha: Oh, it was so terrible, yeah.
Liam: Ow.
Laura: Does it still hurt?
Liam: No it's fine, I feel good. I feel really good.
Laura: Yeah?
Liam: Yeah, I feel really good. I feel rested. I feel fucking healthy man. I don't know. I'm serious.
Laura: All right, that's happy.
Liam: (growls)
Laura: (growls)
Matt: As you guys are walking closer to the outside of Zephra, you see a couple of individuals beginning to approach, three or four children, just seeing these strange visitors in the outskirts. They're also keeping low and not trying to draw your attention too strongly, though they are out in the middle of the open. You see a few bushes and elements. You see two grown individuals walking up with the children, one of which appears to be a relatively young girl, maybe around 13, 14 years old who pushes the kids to the back and goes, "Keyleth?"
Marisha: Yes, hi, hi. What's your name?
Matt: "Sora. You used to watch over me when I was little."
Marisha: Oh my goodness, Sora. Wow, last time I saw you, you were like, like, oh man. Look how big you've gotten.
Matt: "I--"
Marisha: Do you still know that handshake? Do you remember the--
Matt: It takes a moment for you guys to figure it out.
Marisha: And there, you've got it. You got it.
Matt: It's slightly awkward, but for the most part you recall it.
Marisha: Yeah, yeah.
Matt: "I'm much older now, I don't need to--"
Marisha: Oh man.
Matt: "I didn't--"
Marisha: You forgot--
Matt: "You're back."
Marisha: Yeah. I guess I am.
Matt: "We have to tell everyone else."
Marisha: Hey, hey.
Matt: The kids are all just quietly staring wide-eyed and smiling quietly.
Marisha: Sora, Sora. Have you seen my dad around?
Matt: "Do you want me to get him?"
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: "Okay."
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: "C'mon, c'mon kids." And takes them by the hand and they all drag the kids off as you guys wait in the outskirts of the city. One of the kids who didn't quite get a hand on this young three-year-old boy who's running behind them stops. Turns and stares at you all, but stares specifically at Grog and is just wide-eyed, going--
Travis: Hey.
Matt: "Hi."
Travis: Eat your vegetables, you'll look like this.
Matt: "Okay."
Travis: Now get out of here!
Matt: (yells) (all laugh)
Matt: Just immediately bolts past to catch up with the rest of the crowd.
Taliesin: So I believe you just set up a lifetime of unreasonable expectations.
Travis: He'll be healthy, though.
Laura: I've never seen Grog eat a single vegetable--
Travis: No, fuck those things.
Laura: -- the entire time I've known him.
Taliesin: I was wondering about that.
Travis: Nothing in green is good.
Matt: A short time passes. A few moments, before you begin to see the city suddenly come to more vibrant life. People are stepping out of their abodes. Dozens of individuals are beginning to come together, talking, whispering, and some looking back and watching you all in the outskirts of Zephra, until eventually it seems a procession of some kind is all gathering and moving out of this mass of people in your direction. As you look, you begin to see people adorned in similar clothing as to when you first encountered Keyleth in the swamps outside of Stillben. You see these leather-based, almost scaled-looking armor that drifts down to the legs. You see people that hold giant staffs that hold golds and greens and blue colors that mark the symbols of the Zephra tribe. And then, in the center of them, you've met once before, you see stepping forth, Korren, the father of Keyleth and the current acting Voice of Tempest of the Zephra. His long white, silver hair drifting behind him. He approaches with a look. Everyone holds back as he steps forth from the crowd and ignoring the rest of you, just goes and beelines straight to Keyleth. You can see him, he has a bit of a limp to him that you don't recall from last time, but he seems other than that in good health. As he approaches you, he clasps his hands out in front of him and takes a good long look at you as he reaches out and takes your hands into his own. "My daughter."
Marisha: I just drop to a knee and say, Kaitiyaki, father.
Matt: "Kaitiyaki, Keyleth. We've heard that the defense of Emon was successful, yes?"
Marisha: Yes, we have defeated the Chroma Conclave. The help of Vox Machina and many many others, at the cost of many lives.
Matt: "Good, good. I'm glad we could be of some aid to your journey."
Marisha: Yes, thank you. The Air Ashari were very valuable during that day. Very courageous.
Matt: "And we will remember those we lost in that fray. The great sacrifices that they gave so that these children could live. So?" And at this point, he now takes notice of the rest of the group. "By what joy do we have of bringing your allies here and returning to your people?"
Laura: He doesn't know.
Marisha: Sorry, I thought Uvenda might have said something. I'm here because I have completed my Aramente, and have come for my blessing.
Matt: "Yes, you have."
Laura: (gasps)
Matt: "I just wanted to hear it from your lips."
Marisha: Still waiting on your final word, I guess.
Matt: "Well, while we still have daylight, let us prepare for the ceremony. Come, come, all of you. You are welcome, welcome here in Zephra. We'll begin, decoration shall commence. Rest, prepare, naught but two or three hours until the ceremony is to occur." He turns, and folks begin to rush in, and people just begin to barrage you with questions and congratulations, and a number of individuals who seem to have heard stories, many second-hand, and exaggerations of the various things that you've accomplished over the past year or so here in Tal'Dorei. You answer questions, you play into the tall tales if you want. One child turns to you and goes, "And who are you?"
Sam: Taryon Darrington.
Matt: "I don't know who you are."
Sam: You will.
Matt: "You--" (all laugh)
Matt: There is a massive interest around Grog as goliaths generally do not travel this far up into the territory of the mountain. Most of them stay far north in the Cliffkeep or wandering the dividing plain. They're just swarming you and climbing up on you and hanging from your arms and you feel kind of awkward but kind of enjoying the attention at the same time.
Travis: They're really little.
Laura: Kind of like gnomes.
Travis: Yeah. (gasps) (all laugh)
Taliesin: Well that works, well done.
Travis: I'm good.
Matt: Immediately, over the next hour or two, people begin to gather floral wreaths and strips of silk and material that have been prepared specifically for these types of occasions. Many of them new, made from the recent generations in preparation, many that are held over by tradition and by the various leaders that came before you. Many that may have had the hope of the return of Vilya, but instead, carry through with memory of Keyleth. As this transpires, you guys are brought food, you are gathered into a central open celebration. Almost like a pit that descends about two feet, and there are a number of stools and tables, and food and drink are brought about. As opposed to an event and then a celebration afterward, it seems to be a reverse here at Zephra. It's a build-up. It's everyone, the excitement grows. As this is happening, you glance off and there is one very large, singular tree right across the way, at the very edge of the precipice of this rocky outcropping that holds most of the city of Zephra. And there at the edge you see one large, twisting, gnarled tree that curves upward. Not quite Sun Tree in height and size, but still very elegant and beautiful with long, thin branches that gently sway on the outskirts of whatever barrier seems to bend and twist the winds from coming and scattering the village. You watch as people step up to it, and they're leaving jewelry, they're putting large ribbons across it. Elements of it remind you of the tree that was in the center of the temple in Vesrah, though a different texture. It seems to be a deep, vibrant, healthy dark brown, and with elements of gray bark, with moss that grow at the base and tuck under the branches, where the shadows tend to linger throughout the day. Eventually, it seems that they have returned and the decor is set, benches have been moved, and most of the people of Zephra are now shifting in the direction of this tree.
Liam: In all the hubbub and the movement, a few moments before, I've been watching for Korren, and when I see him alone for a second, I make a beeline toward him.
Matt: He's in the process of a conversation. And it's interesting. During this whole thing, he was excited to see you and that you've come, but he's also-- he's kept a strange distance from you during this preparation. He smiles, and you guys meet eyes occasionally, but he's also just focusing on this endeavor, and then you kind of come out of the blue. "Ah, yes, Vax'ildan."
Liam: Forgive me. Might I have just a moment?
Matt: "Quickly. We're about to begin, but yes."
Liam: I will be brief. I just wanted to take a moment to say, I really wish you could've seen some of the things she has done. I know you are proud of her. I've never met anyone like her. She's going to do your people very proud. I'm grateful.
Matt: "As are we all."
Liam: You've a lot to do.
Matt: "As do you. As does she." And he reaches out and pats you on the head and ruffles your hair a little bit. And even that feels a little awkward for him, like he felt impulsive to do it, and then 'oh, that wasn't very-- mm.'
Liam: It's all right. It's more than I ever got.
Taliesin: Whoa. Ow.
Sam: Darkness.
Matt: "Anyway. Come. It's nearly time." And as all of you are led over, there are spaces at the very front of the ceremony, in the semicircle around this tree. There are platforms set up at the base of this tree now. Amongst these hundreds of various, dangling threads, these small pieces of paper that flitter on the outskirts of the gentle wind that pushes through. You guess they might contain wishes or passages or something, but you see bits of script written on them amongst the various glinting pieces of glass and gems and stone that have been polished. It's small, but beautiful. Eventually, you're led to sit in the center of this semi-circle, and as everyone gathers and takes their seat, you hear the occasional kid crying and people muttering to themself, and eventually everyone shushes as Korren, now wearing a very old ceremonial long light blue and white robe wearing what looks to be some sort of a somewhat tattered, like a scarf that's wrapped around his neck and drapes off each of his arms. It's thick and it's long and it almost touches the ground around him, but you can tell from the way he holds it, and his arms consistently rest at this crooked position that it has some symbolism to this ceremony. As he steps up under the tree and turns around everyone gets very quiet, and the wind seems to almost stop on the outside of this barrier. The rushing, perpetual gust of air seems to almost hold its breath for this. He clears his throat. And as he looks up to everyone, you swear this tree begins to slowly produce cherry blossoms as his words continue. "For long, we of the winds have awaited the procession of our tradition. With the passing of our elder voice, Dwala, it was my wife Vilya who was selected to take the Aramente. Beautiful and full of determination, she accepted her path. And while she did not return to us, the destiny she set is now seen as one of preparation. Her journey was not in vain, for it was her love that produced our daughter. It was her guidance in joy that taught our child compassion. It was her discipline and understanding that forged young Keyleth's spark of intuition and unlocked her adept connection with nature and the winds. We mourn the loss of our Vilya, but take pride that she lives on in the eyes of our own, returned, beloved woman of the winds. Here we bring together our collective voices to bless upon my daughter, the memory of Vilya, the champion of Guasar, the mantle of our destiny." And as he puts his arms up, from around you to each side, Keyleth, you watch as young acolytes begin to approach from each side, arms down. All seemingly carrying these various pieces of dark green, leather-like material. And as they come together, they latch them into place and slowly build this mantle. "Ring clear our voices to unite our breath and grant our strength to her guidance and wisdom, as Keyleth takes the rightful and earned responsibility of leading our people into this next generation." At this point, the assembled mantle is placed into Korren's arms. And you now see this beautiful neck and shoulder piece that rests past to the elbows, but limp and without body, in his hands. As he holds it there and the rest of the acolytes step back and find their place, seated, he lifts his arms up a bit and begins to just sing a singular note (sings). And everyone around you in Zephra begins to join in in this singular note. Do you choose to join in as well?
Travis: Yeah.
Laura: Sure.
Matt: As you do, the notes begin to separate and harmonize instinctually. It creates this symphony, this beautiful tangling of hundreds of voices from all across the spectrum. And what at first may seem to resemble a discordant hymn, finds this perfect spread of every note you've ever heard, musically merging as one. As he does this, instinctually, Keyleth, without even thinking, you rise and begin to walk towards him. Like the spirits of generations before you are lifting you by your shoulders and elbows, and bring you up before your father. You find the breath leave your lungs, the inside of your mouth is dry.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: You're unable to understand what it is that's driving you, but before you know it you're standing before your father, looking up into his eyes as all of these voices just swirl around you, this weird warmth. The nerves in your stomach still climb to the top and vibrate within your chest. As your father places this mantle over your head and shoulders, and it comes to rest on you, heavier than you expected, but it fits well. As he places this, the green fades to a golden brown and red and orange and yellow. And the green leaves almost drip back into a long, springing trail of a cloak behind you that seems to grow with each passing surge of these voices around her, until it reaches the ground and curls behind. Eventually the cloak stops. The voices soften, and come to silence, as you look up once more into your father's face. "Rise, my daughter, and become Keyleth, Voice of the Tempest." He steps back and bows his head. Steps off the platform. And you stand and turn, and it's just you at the base of tree, looking about at all of Zephra before you, quiet, silent. And your friends before you, at the front of the crowd.
Marisha: Didn't think I'd make it here. I couldn't have done any of this without not only the support of every person in Zephra, and every person of the Ashari tribe, members of Emon, Tal'Dorei, Marquet, even Wildmount. In my journeys, I've learned being a leader is a global effort, one that takes the wisdom of many. Most importantly, I couldn't have done any of this without Vox Machina. And the pieces of them that I've taken away and have desperately tried to emulate in each one of them over the years. Each one of them with qualities that I admire and strive to embrace. Grog, with his strength and his unyielding loyalty. Vex, with her self-confidence and utter fearlessness. Vax is one of the most compassionate people I think I've ever come across and one of the most brave, even if it's maybe foolish. Percival, with your intelligence and your sensibility, is always there to be my balance. Scanlan, with his charisma and his wit. Pike--
Matt: As you glance past the group, you can see just the faint flutter of golden light and energy. Wherever she is, a part of her is watching.
Marisha: Pike, her generosity and her authenticity, always true to herself. And even Tary. Taryon Darrington, whose blind faith in Vox Machina and perseverance, trusted us even though he probably shouldn't have.
Sam: (whispers) You're incredible.
Marisha: All of these things that I learned and couldn't be a leader without. Vox Machina makes up me. Zephra makes up me. The Ashari people, and all of greater Exandria. I don't know if I'm the leader that you deserve, or a good leader, but I'm willing to dedicate the rest of my life to doing whatever I can for all of us. As long as Vox Machina stands by my side.
Matt: At this point, you watch as the light that remains of the eventually soon-to-come setting sun glints across the cheek of Keyleth, the bit of damp tear that has rolled down her cheek just detaches from the edge of her chin and hits the bottom of the stone. Every cherry blossom in the tree releases, and drifts past her from behind, before getting caught up in the wind just past her, causing this swirl of pinks and reds and whites behind her. Everyone around rises up, and they all begin to cheer and clap. All together. You look around and watch the rest of these blossoms slowly drift. You look and see your friends around you. You look around and you see your mother, out of the corner of your eye, just the memory of her. You sense that if she could be here, she would've been. Your father steps up and takes your hands and just says, "I'm so proud of you. And there's much to be done, I know, but I'm proud of you." And he takes your hand, and holds it up once more. "To the Voice of the Tempest. And the future of our people." Everyone cheers once more together.
Sam: To Vox Tempesta! (all laugh)
Matt: And with that, you gain the Inspiring Leader feat.
Marisha: What? I get the what now?
Matt: Inspiring Leader feat, as the end of your Aramente.
Travis: Oh, shit, Voice of the Tempest!
Matt: Which is pretty fun. What that allows you to do is--
Travis: You can never die.
Matt: No, you can totally die. You can spend ten minutes inspiring your companions, shoring up their resolve to fight. When you do so, choose up to six friendly creatures, which can include yourself, within 30 feet that can hear and understand you. Each creature can gain temporary hit points equal to your level plus your charisma modifier.
Marisha: Oh, what! Well, you guys are out of luck with the charisma modifier shit, but what! (all laugh)
Matt: And they can only gain the temporary hit points from this until they finish a short or long rest. So every short rest you can give everyone 17 temporary hit points.
Marisha: That is fucking dope!
Sam: You have to give a speech every time.
Matt: Essentially, you take ten minutes to talk everybody up. So start practicing.
Marisha: Jeez, no.
Matt: And we'll leave it there for the evening.
Laura: Oh, man.
Travis: That was gorgeous, man. That was gorgeous.
Laura: With the tree, man.
Matt: That was awesome. Completed your Aramente, took up the mantle, and, apparently, going to the Iron City of Dis soon. That's going to be fun.
Travis: (sings) We built this-- No, no more.
Laura: No more of Dis City.
Taliesin: I came up with great formal wear for you, too. It's a shame we didn't get a chance. I figured you out.
Travis: We'll see.
Taliesin: All right.
Travis: Grog has a very discerning taste.
Taliesin: I'm very proud I came up with an idea.
Laura: Well, I'm glad we went with the blue dress after that cape turned all the other colors of nature and it's like, you are covered.
Marisha: Yes. (all laugh)
Travis: Covered, girl.
Matt: Well done, guys. Thank you again, Loot Crate, for being our awesome sponsor.
All: Loot Crate!
Travis: Matt, you did a great job.
Matt: You guys are always such an absolute pleasure. Thank you for playing in my weird make-up world.
Taliesin: How long have you been working on that speech, man? That was nuts.
Matt: Oh, that was fun. I've been waiting for everybody to get to that moment.
Sam: Improv-ed it.
Matt: Glad you survived to get there.
Marisha: No shit.
Liam: Died in Stillben, game three.
Marisha: And send out the next one.
Matt: All right. We'll be back next week, to see where the next leg of Vox Machina's adventure takes them. Until then, have a wonderful night, have a wonderful weekend, and is it Thursday yet? Take care guys. (all cheer)

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello everyone! Close. Welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons & Dragons, rolling dice and shit. So welcome! Always awkward. Anyway, before we get into the game, we're going to do some quick announcements for the evening. First off, we had our recent 100th episode, and I think we have some merch in there. Laura, any updates?
Laura: Oh my gosh, all that crazy merch that we have! We have those posters, you guys, those amazing David Mack posters that look so pretty. The signed versions are going to be in the store for one more week, and the non-signed version is going to be in the store for two more weeks! And that's it, and then they're gone forever. So tell your friends, tell your buddies, tell everyone you know.
Travis: Hide your neighbors, hide your wife.
Laura: That's right. And we also have our Scanlan concert tees and our Slayer's Cake aprons. Our hats are out of stock, but everything else should be in there if you guys want to go check it out.
Matt: Fantastic.
Laura: In the shop at Geekandsundry.com.
Liam: Sold.
Marisha: Word.
Matt: Thank you, Laura.
Laura: Hey, you're welcome.
Matt: That's so sweet. All right, that is that. Let's see, here else. Just a reminder, the Tal'Dorei campaign guide pre-orders go on sale mid-July. You can go to the Green Ronin website for info on that, and it will be released physically bound at Gen Con first, and then it will be coming out weeks after that on the interwebs. Check out Green Ronin's site for all that information! And we're excited about Gen Con insanity, so see you guys there. Let's see. Wednesday Club? Mr. Taliesin Jaffe?
Taliesin: Yeah, we've got something special planned, but I don't know if it's official yet, but I think that we are going to be celebrating Pride Month, and we may have a special guest. I can't say for sure, but we're going to be talking.
Sam: It's Stan Lee.
Taliesin: It's Stan Lee. He's coming out on our show.
Liam: You heard it here first.
Taliesin: He and his pansexual adventures throughout comicdom. Excelsior. It's going to be fun. It'll be a thing.
Matt: Go watch it, true believers!
Taliesin: Possible special guest.
Matt: I love it. Check it out, special guest for Wednesday Club next week. Awesome. Thank you, Taliesin.
Liam: Why limit myself to just one?
Sam: That's Gilbert Gottfried?
Matt: All right. Also, we have Talks Machina Tuesdays at seven PM Pacific time here, on Twitch and Alpha, to discuss what you'll watch tonight on this episode.
Travis: Getting turnt.
Matt: Yes, that. Thank you, Sam. That's okay. Well done.
Taliesin: It's really pleasing in the hand, isn't it?
Marisha: That's what she said.
Matt: And I think that's it. Quick announcements this evening. Nice and quick. I like it. That means we get to dive back into the story here, guys!
Taliesin: Should we mention that we had to reprint some character sheets, or are we not mentioning that? I've now said it online.
Matt: Yeah! A few characters levelled. We have a few folks at 18 now, so that's fun.
Taliesin: Old enough to get in trouble for drinking.
Laura: Do you want to make a special announcement?
Ashley: So, special announcement about my hair. No. There's a time jump in Blindspot, so I'm here.
Sam: Spoiler!
Ashley: Oh, shit.
Marisha: Do they just assume your character doesn't go to the salon and cut your hair? Is that not a thing?
Laura: But they're so pretty!
Ashley: I love them. So much hair!
Liam: Did your character in the time jump go to the Feywild, or go sailing on the sea?
Matt: I'm pretty sure she makes her own bakery cake store. It's going to be great. It's called the Slayer's Bake. Anyway, guys, I think that's it, and that being the case, let's go ahead and hop into tonight's episode of Critical Role. [dramatic music]
Matt: Hello everyone, and welcome back. So last we left off--
Laura: Wait, do I put that on my saving throws, too?
Travis: Are you serious?
Matt: Yes.
Liam: We need to share it with the world. Laura just leveled up, and her attack bonus went down.
Laura: Because I was doing it wrong this whole time. Yep.
Matt: Oh boy. Anyway. Last we left off, Vox Machina had discovered the existence of a second ziggurat-like structure on the continent of Marquet, and apparently a cult of the Whispered One there gathering magical artifacts to toss into a second darkened black orb, similar to the one beneath Whitestone, all this time. You ran into Scanlan once more, and leading you guys to where this cavern was found in the mountains of Smouldercrown on the continent of Marquet, you did battle with the cultists there, and seemed to reveal one of the leaders in that group was none other than the not-dead Delilah Briarwood. She fended you off, completed their ritual, and some of their surviving cultists fled into the orb apparently to the other side. You then gathered yourselves, gathered some supplies, your information, and then proceeded to travel through the orb in Whitestone into the Shadowfell, the shadow plane, dark mirror to the Prime Material, where you stumbled upon a partially ruined city that had undergone some sort of ancient siege, and much of it still lies in ruins and disrepair, where you discovered what seemed to be two other siphon orbs existing around the outskirts of this forgotten city, leaving threads of magical energy being siphoned and transferred to a singular black obsidian tower, for whatever purpose the Whispered One, the Undying King, has for this energy. You began to make your way deeper into the city, masquerading as some undead. In the process you killed a few cultists wandering the street, and intimidated one-- Or, I should say, you didn't intimidate. You killed him, and then asked his corpse. I guess that's a form of intimidation. Probably one of the most extreme forms of intimidation, really. Discovering that this city is under the title Thar Amphala. Thar Amphala, you don't know too much about it, other than it seems to be where an ancient battle took place. Much of the undead that wanders this realm carries armaments, weapons, and symbols that seem to be of Pelor, the Dawn Father. You also discovered that there's this tower in the center titled Entropis, where all the magic is being funneled at the moment. Thus, having found this information, gathered your resolve, you continue your trek deeper and deeper into the city surrounding the tower Entropis, to discover what your purpose is here in Thar Amphala. So, Vox Machina, what do you do?
Liam: Figuring it all out.
Sam: Taking five.
Laura: Time out, time out, time out.
Ashley: Just hanging out.
Sam: So we found out that there's a ritual happening soon.
Laura: Yeah, like super stat.
Sam: And there's no day or night here, so who cares, right?
Laura: Right? It's all just night, all the time.
Matt: It's kind of a sunless gray sky. There's some low light, like a very heavy-- Like a very dark, thunderous Seattle.
Ashley: (singing) Hello Seattle! It's a song.
Travis: What song?
Ashley: I think it is.
Matt: It is now. So.
Sam: We have to make our way to the big tower, right? Super fast, and invisibly. Oh, we're also vampire creatures!
Laura: Oh, we look like the gloom stalkers! No, those are the flying ones.
Sam: We look like miscellaneous vampirey things, right?
Liam: Yeah, shambling zombies.
Laura: Scary ghouly creatures.
Taliesin: Extras from a bad zombie video.
Travis: Is Pass Without a Trace still kicking?
Sam: What?
Travis: Pass Without a Trace.
Matt: I would say probably because you haven't cast a spell yet that would've interrupted it, it would be...
Laura: I cast it when we landed here.
Matt: But I don't think you've done anything that altered that concentration yet.
Laura: I don't think so. So it's still going?
Matt: I think so. For maybe another 30 minutes or so.
Laura: Yeah, I didn't Hunter's Mark either of the guys that I attacked.
Travis: And we've got the smoking thing, right? What's it called, the censer?
Laura: Yeah, that thing.
Travis: What is it?
Laura: The smoky thing.
Sam: The censer.
Travis: Is it called a censer?
Matt: Yes.
Travis: First try!
Liam: And we learned that it does something, too.
Sam: It protects you from ghouley deads.
Liam: From ghouley deads, specifically.
Ashley: Will it protect all of us?
Taliesin: I think it's got a range.
Laura: If we stay in this... tight.
Ashley: If we stay tight?
Taliesin: Stay tight.
Sam: So why don't we just walk through the center of town, in the middle of the road, with the censer, and walk into the tower? No? Maybe?
Laura: No. I see nothing wrong with this plan.
Sam: Fly up to the top of the tower?
Travis: Oh, no.
Taliesin: Stay on the ground.
Sam: Teleport somewhere?
Laura: Do you have that ability?
Sam: She does.
Laura: There's no trees on the top of the tower.
Sam: Or we can be smoky mist.
Laura: Then it'll take us a minute to not be mist anymore, and by then they'll realize we're there on the top of the tower.
Travis: Should we take off the robes that they had and pop it on some of us?
Laura: Sure, why not? I mean, we're undead. We look like we're undead.
Taliesin: I think they probably know we're here. I think they probably know we're coming. I think let's just trepidatiously make our way a little closer, see what else is in this town, see if maybe there's anything useful.
Liam: And stay low-key. We don't need to go marching.
Laura: Blend in.
Taliesin: Let's not blow anything up yet.
Sam: But we're making our way to the tower.
Taliesin: Making our way towards the tower, in a towerly direction.
Laura: Are we at full health?
Taliesin: No. I'm not.
Laura: I'm not either.
Ashley: I can help with that.
Laura: Should we take a 30-minute rest and roll some hit points?
Marisha: Did we fight? Oh, no, that's right, we went down going through.
Matt: Yeah, going through the actual portal, the spinning ball of death caused some damage.
Laura: I don't know if there's actually time for that, though, to take.
Taliesin: I'm all right with mine. I'm 20 points down. I don't mind being 20 points down.
Sam: Let's be all full, though. We can be full.
Laura: We're going to fucking potentially fight Delilah Briarwood.
Sam: Yeah, let's be full.
Marisha: I'm assuming it's going to take us some time just to even get there, though, right?
Laura: Is it considered healing as we walk there, though?
Matt: No, you have to take a rest.
Taliesin: Let's get a little closer, then, and survey the situation, and then take a break. I feel like we're a bit far.
Laura: I just don't know if there's time. If she's already started a ritual.
Taliesin: If we run into something on the way there, though, I don't want to be at peak performance yet.
Laura: Yeah. All right.
Travis: Let's move.
Sam: Oh, God.
Marisha: Sure.
Taliesin: This is going to be fun.
Marisha: Do we still have Pass Without a Trace?
Matt: You do. For the next 30 minutes or so.
Taliesin: So let's take advantage of this.
Marisha: Yeah, let's at least move for 30 more minutes.
Travis: Who's got the censer in the front? Because we've got to stay together.
Sam: Someone in a robe.
Laura: Oh. Who's in a robe? We're all undead.
Marisha: Are me and you in robes?
Taliesin: We can do robes. I'm all right with robes.
Travis: There's only three of them.
Taliesin: I'll take a robe.
Laura: I'll take a robe.
Marisha: You lead with the censer.
Taliesin: I'll take a robe with the censer.
Matt: Okay, Percy and Vex?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Okay. You both throw robes on over your Seeming-altered undead bodies. Percy, you're carrying the censer?
Taliesin: Yes, I'm carrying the censer.
Matt: And you're all slowly clustered behind them?
Taliesin: Yes.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: (chanting)
Travis: (chanting)
Taliesin: Thank you.
Matt: All right. So you guys continue moving, what's very plainly towards the center of the city as the tower stands as this giant beacon of shadow in the center of the horizon. The streets are scattered and broken. You can see there was, what may have seemed almost like a hint of cobblestone at one point, really just looks like largely broken and shattered badlands and dried stone that seems to have been pummeled by impacts of some kind, cracked into small pieces. This is a city by function and function alone. There was very little considered in the beauty of its construction, at least this far out. As you continue to press towards the center of the city--
Laura: I want to keep an eye out, just to see if anybody's noticing. If it seems like people are paying attention to us in a way that they shouldn't be.
Matt: Okay. Well, as you're keeping an eye out, I would like all of you guys to make a deception roll, with advantage.
Marisha: With advantage?
Matt: Yes.
Travis: Come on, Gil.
Taliesin: That's not bad.
Sam: 33.
Taliesin: 21.
Marisha: 17.
Liam: 18.
Laura: 17.
Matt: Pike?
Ashley: 22.
Travis: Eight.
Liam: Too big.
Travis: I'm sorry.
Matt: As you guys make your way further down one of the, not major thoroughfares, but one of the general streets that snakes around towards the central area of the city, some of you gently moaning and gurgling as you walk, behind you, you have Grog Frankensteining his way down the street. (laughing)
Travis: Oh man.
Matt: The sound of your rendition, that song. As you're walking, a shadow seems to cross, a large hulking shadow crosses past one of the roads and turns and begins walking your direction. And you see ahead what looks to be about a ten foot tall, thick, burly figure of brownish red flesh, torn, and chains and hooks hanging from it. It looks to be almost like an amalgam of large hobgoblin body parts that have been sewn and stitched together with spikes and iron plates, jutting through, keeping it together at the seams. Where there would be a face, you see instead a giant metal mass that looks like a cage of some kind, and behind it these two glowing beads of yellow eyes poking through, and you watch as it just walks in a straight line (impacts).
Laura: Coming right for us?
Matt: Walking in your direction. Its arms are curled in front of it like a gorilla, its fingers dragging in the dust below it.
Liam: Does it look like it's just happening in our direction, or is it coming toward us?
Matt: It's hard to tell. It's about 60 feet up.
Laura: Is there a road we can turn directions?
Taliesin: Is there a nonchalant way of maintaining direction but getting out of its way?
Matt: There would be enough space to give about a ten foot berth to it as you put your back against the side of one of the nearest buildings and let it pass.
Marisha: Like parting for the queen at the Ren Faire?
Matt: A little bit, yeah.
Liam: Or Taliesin Jaffe.
Marisha: Or Taliesin Jaffe at any party.
Ashley: I move to the side and put my head down.
Sam: What's our ploy if this thing tries to kill us?
Laura: Kill it.
Sam: Okay.
Travis: Same old same old.
Matt: (heavy footsteps) You guys all make your way to the side and you watch. It's autonomous, it's not being brought along with anybody. It's running a path down the road. You all move off to the side, and as you maneuver to the side of it, it gets close to the censer you're carrying, and it (groaning) puts its fingers out of the way, actually crushing some of the stonework on one of the nearby buildings to pull itself aside, trying to avoid the billowing of the smoke from the censer. It gives a dull, deep resonant (huff) in your direction as it passes, and then eventually passes by the cluster of you that have all moved to the side, after its head shifts and scans back in the path that it's walking and it moves past you, following the direction you just came from.
Taliesin: Way to be Fonzies.
Laura: Nice. Very nice. So cool.
Sam: Wow. This thing works.
Taliesin: Lot of Fonzies. Smells terrible.
Matt: You continue further into the city. You still hear the distant, low shrieks of the gloom stalkers (shriek) overhead, swooping past in clusters, circling around. Occasionally you watch one or two swoop down and land on a distant rooftop, and you hear the crunching of heavy stone and whatever materials were still remaining on the roof of that structure as it lands and surveys a bit, and then (whoosh) takes off and joins the rest of its kin.
Taliesin: Do any of the buildings look remarkable or interesting? I'm trying to keep an eye out for any building that may have anything inside it of vague importance. Either the building itself is slightly more interesting, or it looks like maybe someone has boarded something up to try and maintain some kind of vigil against the darkness? I'm not entirely sure. Out of the ordinary.
Matt: Okay. Make an investigation check.
Taliesin: I knew you were going to say that. I'm not good at this. Nope. Nope, nope. That's a four. That's a natural one.
Matt: A lot of these buildings are hard to tell apart when they're all just in this state of disrepair and destruction.
Taliesin: Some of them have doors.
Matt: Some of them do. Some of them have windows, kind of.
Taliesin: Holes where windows might be.
Matt: Possibly. Some, you can't tell if it's a hole, or a window. Or a door? As you press forward.
Taliesin: I felt Orthax take over again.
Liam: So this is Osgiliath, right? It's wrecked ruin, no complete buildings, or are any of them?
Matt: You see some further in. The exterior appears to have been the most heavily sacked. There's been little intent to reconstruct from this point. Like I said, you're still probably a good mile and a half out from the center of the city, and as you walk further in, you can see more clusters of skeletons traveling in groups of 12 to 15, somewhat erratically. You've seen some creatures that seem to walk with an intent pattern, like they have some sort of a sentinel path that they follow to keep watch on the perimeter or the roads of the city. The skeletons that wander, the undead that you see clattering about across the dusty, cracked grounds between the buildings, are erratic, uncontrolled. Mostly it seems to be less intentionally created undead, and more just risen by the nature of the plane you walk, and haven't bothered anyone yet, or at least those who live here. As you begin walking forward, you watch as a cluster of them spills into this T intersection a little ways up, a few of them falling and tumbling and getting back up (cracking). As they cluster together, some of them bang into each other. You hear the clattering of metal from the bits of armor that still cling to their long-rotted forms. Broken bones, some of them are missing arms, or sections of a skull is exposed and cracked open on the side, where you can see what looks to be some sort of long-dried and rotted away gray matter was left to slowly collapse like a flan in a cupboard. As you begin to approach that area, they separate a bit and scatter to fill, almost diffusing in the center of this intersection, and then they contract, almost like there's a strange hive mind magic that seems to draw them back together. They're just moving in these autonomous clusters of chaos. You see on them still, similar to the ones you noticed earlier, some of the armor that they're wearing appears to be reminiscent to the armor that the black guard that you battled at the ziggurat earlier had, or similar dark metal, and others have long-destroyed, ruined, scraped and scarred bits of silver and gold armor that are emblazoned with long-ruined and defaced symbols of the Dawn Father, Pelor.
Laura: Does it seem like both of those factions are still-- are they clustered in the same groups?
Matt: They are. And you get the sense that whatever battle took place here long ago was probably between these two factions, and those that were lost in that fray have been risen over time and wander aimlessly through the streets.
Taliesin: Free range undead.
Liam: We've seen long-dead people. This is fucking creepy in the upside-down. (airplane noise)
Sam: What's going on?
Matt: I called the airport to try and coordinate this time with you guys. Cost me 17,000 dollars for that one five-second bit, so enjoy it, guys.
Liam: Worth it.
Matt: Totally worth it.
Liam: These bodies, compared to the ex-champion of the Raven Queen, do these bodies seem even older? More decayed? Do we have any sense for how old these fuckers are?
Matt: You would have to get up close and that would be a medicine check. Would you want to try and make your way close enough to one of these bodies to inspect it enough?
Liam: How far off are they?
Matt: If you guys continue moving forward, you'll be at that intersection in about 30 seconds.
Liam: I'm not going to go. I'll wait.
Ashley: I could go up close with somebody and do a medicine check.
Laura: Keep up near the thing. Everybody get close to the censer.
Taliesin: I'll guide us towards something.
Liam: Yeah, no one poking out ahead for this.
Laura: Hopefully they'll be affected by the censer.
Travis: Let's just stop by.
Matt: So who's moving forward?
Laura: The whole group. So we can all be with the wispy smoke.
Matt: Okay. So you guys make your way towards this intersection.
Laura: We're normal people in robes.
Matt: You also watch as you begin to walk further in that elements of the ground are growing more jagged and craggy. You can see bits of stone and earth are jutting out in large stone spikes, either through some upheaval or elements of the tumultuous landscape long ago that just caused elements of rock to spike outward up five, ten feet in sections. You watch as you grow close to this intersection, about half of the group all at once (groan) turns and looks in your direction and begin to (footsteps).
Laura: Can I just waft some of the smoke towards them?
Matt: Shamble in your direction. The rest of the group noticing-- You begin blowing the censer smoke that way. You watch as three of the closest skeletons make their way into the fume and seem to vaguely lose interest for a brief moment.
Ashley: Since we're close, can I do a medicine check? Are we close enough to?
Matt: Yes, but with disadvantage because of the smoke.
Ashley: Oh, shit. Okay.
Laura: You got this, Pike.
Taliesin: Roll like it's a stealth roll.
Ashley: 13?
Matt: With the brief glances you have, it's hard to really tell. Plus, you're not too familiar with the overall weather of the Shadowfell. You don't know if there's enough weather to manifest as general decay, or if they've been beaten by the ravages of time, if it rains here or not. It's hard to tell. You gather it probably doesn't rain often. They're definitely hundreds of years old. That's the most you can really tell. They aren't fresh dead. These are long dead.
Liam: I'm feeling Foresighty. Can I creep up behind and do the same?
Matt: I will say you can do that, however you still have disadvantage, because she's already taken the roll and you're supplementing her roll in a very short period of time.
Liam: Would that be an even roll, then, since I have advantage on everything?
Matt: You have advantage on everything. I'm giving you a chance to do this when normally you would have none, so the Foresight's allowing you to have a roll with disadvantage. Go for it.
Liam: Oh, that's going to fail. Ooh! 18.
Matt: Or not. Getting a glance at the one nearest to you, the bodies seem to be fairly well preserved for as long as they've been here, so you get the sense that there isn't a lot of heavy weather here at all. And given that fact, the decay that's there, it is reminiscent, maybe not quite as old as the corpse of Purvon when you discovered the tomb originally, but comparatively ancient. At least over 500 years.
Travis: Old Purvon.
Matt: Good old Purvon.
Laura: These skeletons are almost as old as you, Scanlan.
Sam: Good one.
Matt: As you continue to walk forward, and the skeletons part around the cloud of the censer, you push deeper into the city, and they coalesce behind you and follow. They're keeping a perimeter cluster now. They're still being held at bay by the wafting of this thick blackish-green smoke that's billowing off of it, but they're staying just outside of it and slowly shambling at your speed, waiting for an opening.
Laura: I have an idea. What if, right when we get close to the tower, all of these trailing skeletons that we have on us, you just Turn Undead? And then you control them all?
Sam: You can do that?
Matt: Destroy them, yeah.
Laura: Oh, you can't control them? I thought you could.
Ashley: I could turn them.
Matt: Turn them means they just run away screaming.
Ashley: I can make them run away.
Matt: You're at a level where you can just make them explode if they roll low. Up to you.
Travis: We've got a little nuke in our pocket.
Ashley: I want us to be quiet. I don't want to make a big spectacle. Because I can make them go boom boom, but let's just wait.
Laura: She can make them poop.
Taliesin: And they don't even have bowels.
Travis: Is anything stalking us from above while we're moving?
Matt: How astute of you, I was just about to get to that.
Travis: Did you hear that? Astute.
Sam: You put the ass in astute.
Laura: Hey, did you guys know that Travis is the smartest guy at the table?
Marisha: I could tell by his Cheers shirt. (laughing)
Matt: So. In the billowing smoke that's coming around, Grog, because you brought it up, as well as the twins who have relatively high passive perceptions, and Keyleth as well, actually, you glance up and notice that the erratic patterns that a lot of the gloom stalkers take in the sky, there's two that seem to be circling, and circling.
Ashley: I don't like it, I don't like it.
Matt: One of them (shrieks), and you watch as it goes into a dive in your direction.
Sam: Oh, God! In our direction?
Laura: Is there a building we can duck into?
Matt: Make a quick perception check.
Sam: But quick!
Laura: 33.
Liam: 24.
Matt: Okay. Both of you, really quick, you see in two different directions, past the intersection on the right, and on the left, you see two buildings that are mostly still intact. They've sustained some level of damage, but they still have two solid floors, maybe a partial roof missing, but they appear to be structurally sound enough to at least jump into. They both have doors that are partially ajar and a darkened interior.
Laura: And a roof.
Matt: And a roof.
Liam: (grunting)
Laura: (grunting) Why am I? I can talk. Go in that building.
Travis: Yeah, we go in there.
Laura: That way they can't dive bomb us, at least.
Taliesin: I go in last. Censer.
Matt: All right. So you guys all rush into the building on the right or the left?
Taliesin: Yours.
Laura: The right.
Matt: All right, so the one that Vex found. You guys all rush into that building with Percival the last one in there. As you--
Laura: Weapons drawn in case there's something in there.
Sam: But also moving like zombies.
Matt: Okay. Perfect. So as you guys all rush into the building, weapons ready, who's first in the building?
Laura: Me, maybe, because we saw it.
Matt: The two of you guys. Both of you roll perception as you enter the interior of the building. The undead that are clustering behind you are beginning to gather in a semicircle as soon as you hit the inside of the building, and they're clustering at the door as you close it behind you.
Laura: 20.
Liam: 24.
Matt: Okay. As you enter the inside, you look around and you can see what appears to be the remnants of a few tables, very simple tables, that have been shattered and destroyed, broken into ruin around the area. You see what appear to be blades, two left in the wall, one broken off, in the center, that have long rusted over time. You see what appear to be the signs of bodies, blood, dark, dark dried blood circles on the ground, but no corpses, no bodies.
Taliesin: I'm going to use the broken tables and swords to barricade the front windows or holes, I'm not sure which they are, but I'm going to barricade them. And the door, use the sword to jam the door shut.
Laura: Are there dark corners that anybody could be hiding in, or another room?
Matt: The room itself is pretty damn dark. The little bit of light that comes in through the distant, broken elements of the wall, there's enough light where you can kind of-- it's very dim light for you, Percy. Everyone else with Darkvision is all right to make out the interior.
Liam: Cursory trap check, even though it seems unlikely.
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Liam: 19.
Matt: No traps from what you can gather at this juncture. But you do hear, as you close the door and begin barricading it with Percival, you hear the multitudes of bony claws, hands, and bits of armor slamming and brushing up against the outer wall that you just came through. The doors (bang) as the undead have now clustered and are trying to push their way in. They seem to have a scent.
Laura: We'll keep the censer near the door.
Marisha: Yeah, I do a little Gust cantrip and put a little of the censer smoke under the door. I'm like an oscillating fan.
Matt: Druids get pretty cool at 18, guys. Just saying. Timeless body, oscillating fan. Best wild shape ability ever.
Liam: Wait till you see the sprinkler system.
Matt: So as you're blowing the smoke from the censer beneath the doorway, it lessens the impacts, but the undead, more than a dozen or so of these, probably about 15 or 16 of them, have spread out, and they're all clustered at that side. The little bit of the fumes that you can push beneath the doorway are only reaching a handful, and it's keeping them from the main door at the moment.
Sam: Can we see outside at all? Is there a peephole or anything?
Matt: There are no windows at the front of this building. You see a sliver where it looks like a portion of the wall suffered some sort of an axe or hatchet impact a long time ago and someone tried to pull their way through. It's maybe about that wide, and that's where the one source of light is coming through.
Sam: I'm going to go over there.
Laura: Wait.
Sam: Oh. Don't do anything?
Laura: I was going to say, what if we turned ourselves into something else and snuck out, and they would think that we're still in this building? Anything that was tracking us.
Sam: I was going to try to make a little diversion to draw them away from the door.
Matt: (boom) You guys hear a heavy impact on the roof above.
Sam: I'll do that. I'll do my thing.
Matt: You hear (boom) what sounds like really heavy footfalls along the roof of the building.
Sam: I'm going to look through the little sliver and I'm going to cast--
Taliesin: Do you want to see what they're burning in the censer?
Marisha: Yes, I do. That's exactly what I was going to do.
Taliesin: I'm going to open up the censer.
Matt: Hold on, just a second.
Sam: I'm going to cast Major Image and make a small little human girl in the middle of the street, crying, bleeding from the arm. She looks disoriented and she's walking towards the other building that we spotted, very sad and (whimpering).
Matt: Okay. As you glance through and create this image, this image appears of this tiny, saucer-eyed French poppet of a girl with a little dress. Her curls are mussed up.
Travis: Dragging her dolly by one arm.
Matt: It's missing one button eye.
Liam: You summoned Cosette.
Matt: Yes, basically. And she goes running off, screaming and crying. You guys immediately hear the shift of the undead beyond the door (rumbling) and begin getting fainter and fainter. As that happens, you also hear (whoosh). Scanlan, you glance out and you watch the shadow of one of the gloom stalkers flying overhead swoop down and attack for the little girl.
Sam: Okay, she's going to run. She's going to book it into that other building to try to get away as fast as she can. And she can move super fast since she's not real.
Matt: This is true. This is actually very true.
Sam: She's like the fucking Flash.
Liam: (singing) There is a lady all in white...
Sam: 120 feet is all I can move her.
Laura: She's sweeping as she's running towards the door.
Matt: Yeah. You can make her move with an action 120 feet. So the little girl goes from (whimper) to (fast running) and goes into a full sprint in a really creepy, Ring-style way. That was for you, Travis. Across the way, and you watch as the gloom stalker swoops up and (impact) slams into the side of the stone building, causing part of it to crush inward and break. The roof partially (rumbling) has to settle and it falls into itself as the creature rights itself (shriek). You now have a much closer look at this entity, and it is billowing black shadow like smoke off of it. You can see glimpses of some sort of physical form in there, but it's so blurry, it's almost like it's phasing between physical matter and dream. You're not sure what it's made from, but you can see what looks to be an elongated neck, some sort of snapping jaw at the end, and two bright, greenish-yellow glowing beacons like eyes at the front of its face. Its wings don't have skin or flesh, it's just dark smoke, and as it flaps, it leaves these trails, these curling bits like black, black, black smoke.
Liam: Are we talking dragon size?
Matt: It's wyvern sized. It's maybe 20 feet from wingtip to wingtip.
Marisha: Is it anything like we've ever heard about?
Matt: No, you have not encountered a creature like this before. But you watch as it glances, and at this proximity, Scanlan, you're the one who's getting the view of this, you watch wherever it looks, its eyes seem to emanate these tiny cones of light, like little flashlights, and as it scans past, the little girl, where the beam goes past, her body is nothing there.
Laura: Is there another door in this building?
Matt: There is on the back side, yes. It's partially covered by what looks to be debris, and it looks like somebody else barricaded the other side, but did not seem to cover both ends before they fell within this building.
Sam: Let's get out of here.
Laura: We should go out the other door as fast as possible.
Travis: I'll take care of that barricade.
Laura: But quietly. We don't want them to know that we're getting out the other side.
Travis: I don't know if I can guarantee that.
Matt: What are you doing, Grog?
Travis: Moving shit out of the way of the door, in a...
Taliesin: Medium pace?
Travis: Let's call it a medium well.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and make an athletics check.
Liam: You are a terrible stage mom, by the way.
Sam: Well, she died.
Matt: She's still there.
Sam: She got her equity card.
Matt: And that's what matters. She's still there, and you watch, the creature seems confused. The eye beams move past it, and the little girl's still there crying and still darting around the area, and the creature's like (snarling), lands on the ground, and comes up and swipes and bites at her, and it goes through her form. You get the sense these creatures aren't super intelligent, but they are effective at seeing through certain glamors.
Laura: They're going to know that we're not. They know we're not zombies.
Liam: Is it still after her, or has it given up on that ghost?
Matt: It's in the process of giving up on that ghost right now.
Liam: Still a cat and a flashlight.
Laura: We've got to go.
Travis: 21.
Matt: At this point, you watch as Grog goes over with his giant mitts and single-handedly shifts the entire pile over with one shove, exposing the door there before you.
Laura: Out the door, out the door.
Matt: You open the doorway.
Sam: Can we leave anything behind, like a dead body or something for them to eat?
Laura: What dead body?
Sam: He's got a ton of them in there.
Laura: Actually, yes. Throw a dead body in the room.
Travis: Who's laughing now, bitches? Dead body!
Matt: And like the world's most macabre flower girl, you produce one of the...
Travis: I birth from the Bag of Holding a dead body.
Laura: And use Dust of Tracelessness as we run out the door, so they don't follow us.
Travis: Who's giving the orders around here?
Laura: Me. Please?
Travis: Okay.
Matt: So as you throw the body behind you, the door's now being slammed a bit. It seems some of the undead wandered towards that illusion, some are still on the other side, and now that you've pulled the censer back from it, the other door's kind of (bangs) coming pushed in. You can see light peeking through. You guys rush out, still with your Seeming illusion on, and you hear, very loudly, almost omnipresent, the screech, the (shriek) of the gloom stalker, right around the corner from you, as it begins to take off just on the other side of the building.
Laura: Should we look for another building we can duck into? To lose their-- So they can't find us?
Liam: Yeah, we can just go hopping from building to building.
Matt: I want everyone to roll a stealth check, please.
Marisha: Do we still have...
Matt: You do. You're getting close to the tail end of it. You have about five minutes left.
Laura: Natural 20.
Sam: Me too.
Matt: Shit.
Taliesin: Thank God we still have a thing.
Matt: So natural 20.
Taliesin: 21.
Laura: Did you add ten?
Taliesin: Yeah.
Marisha: 36.
Liam: 39.
Taliesin: 22, I mean.
Laura: Natural 20.
Ashley: 22.
Travis: 20.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: We did not roll well. But we're fine.
Matt: So you all got above a 20. That's good.
Sam: We needed above a 40.
Matt: So you guys rush past and, quick glance around, you find one of the nearby buildings. It's a little more dilapidated, but it seems to have at least enough cover where you can all dive into the shadows and seemingly vanish. You all stand there for a second, and you're super quiet, all breathing heavily (panting), the censer still billowing this awful, awful fume. It's filling your nose, your eyes are watering instinctually from the presence. It stings just to get into your sinuses, but you're all enduring it and trying to be as quiet as possible.
Laura: Is there another door in this building that we can exit out?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Taliesin: I'm showing Keyleth what's inside the censer.
Matt: Okay, we'll get to that.
Laura: 19.
Matt: 19. It's hard to tell. It looks like where there may have been a door, a portion of the roof in here that has also collapsed, it looks like a giant siege stone, about that big, from a catapult was launched and tore through the roof and shattered that side of the building. The only way out is the same way you came in.
Laura: Fuck.
Matt: Unless you climb up and out. But as you open the censer and look inside, it looks like there is this ember, this cluster of burning, dried herbs. You're not quite sure what it is or where it came from, but it's currently glowing red in places.
Taliesin: I'm going to give some of the herbs to Keyleth to examine. It's like on a charcoal?
Matt: It has what looks to be charcoal stones in the bottom clustered around, and these herbs are placed over it, and it's burning and smoldering over time.
Marisha: Sure. Can I tell what the herbs are?
Matt: Make a medicine check. No, this would be a nature check, sorry.
Marisha: Thank you. Is this something that I would get advantage on for my herb book?
Matt: Yes, you would.
Marisha: 28.
Matt: Okay. I get to look this up.
Sam: Oh, look it up. It's a real thing. Wow.
Matt: It's called Wild's Guide. It's a tobacco-like leaf that was used... It was briefly used for recreational smoking and treatment of small wounds, but it tended to have a very quick diseased, sickening sense to it. Those that smoked a lot tended to get sick very quickly, and it went into disuse from there. It's largely considered to be a relatively useless plant. There isn't a lot of medicinal quality to it. It's just something that exists in herbalism books, as things to avoid.
Taliesin: Comes in green and red, available in the Resident Evil universe.
Matt: You get the sense that them using it for the censer is probably not a widely known use for this type of plant.
Laura: You found a new use!
Marisha: I did! I write it down and I press a flower, or I save some of it. And then can I Druidcraft some more, now that I know what it is?
Matt: From that cluster, I'd say yeah, you can create a little bit more, but very little bit.
Marisha: Okay, I'll go ahead and make as much as I can.
Matt: Okay, so you spend some time there to focus on it, and from the remnants there you can make about twice the amount than what was in the censer, so you have probably a good, solid softball-sized cluster.
Taliesin: The resin's the best part.
Marisha: Okay. I take half, put half back in the censer, and give half to Percy. Does anybody else want some? Actually, should we dab ourselves with it? No, is that weird?
Laura: Maybe just give it to Percy.
Matt: Really? After all that, no dab joke? Anyway.
Sam: Too classy for us.
Matt: I guess so.
Taliesin: Whatever the opposite of standards are, I know we have them.
Marisha: Give some to Percy, anybody else want some?
Laura: Yeah, yeah. I don't have any way to make fire, but I'll take it. Definitely in my shirt now.
Matt: As you guys are doing this, you hear the (snarling), and you hear the (flapping wings). It's hunting from building to building. (impacts) Closer. (flapping wings) (snarling) A little further away. (flapping wings)
Laura: It's gone? Did it fly away?
Matt: Sounds like it, at least.
Laura: Should we leave, and go to another building?
Sam: Let's keep going.
Liam: Building to building toward the tower?
Laura: I feel like it's not really gone.
Liam: Well, we'll find out. Let's make a break for it.
Matt: Okay, who's going first? Okay. Vax, as you dart along the side, glancing up in the air, you can still see. And it looks like there is some communication, because where once there was maybe two, you can now see a lot of them have clustered closer in your direction. There seems to be some sort of an overhead hunt.
Laura: Should I cast Pass Without a Trace on us again? Are we running out of time on it?
Matt: You're getting pretty close, yeah.
Laura: I'm going to cast it again, just so we don't.
Matt: Okay, so you cast Pass Without a Trace again.
Liam: And are we, Without a Trace and Dust of Tracelessness? That's just a one time...
Laura: Dust of Tracelessness is just so they can't track us.
Matt: So the second thing you've gathered, these creatures are not very intelligent, but they do have some sort of communication between them, and there apparently is a rush on their end to search for whatever was recently spotted. So as you guys make your way, following Vax's lead, down some of the alleyways, and begin slithering through the back ways and the small side streets, avoiding your first attempt to walk straight through the center of the town.
Laura: It's crazy how that didn't work, though. I mean, because it was a really smart plan.
Matt: It worked for a bit. Not every plan is going to hold you to the very end. There was some cleverness to it. So you begin to move through these buildings before-- It would be Keyleth, Vex and Vax. You guys come around one small alley and it opens up into another main road, and this road's hard to avoid. It seems to be almost a circular central road that marks the outer and inner rings of Thar Amphala. But you see there, marking right across this road, a 15 foot tall wall that seems to lock in the inner cloister of the town.
Marisha: How thick does it appear to be?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Laura: Maybe we can go under it.
Marisha: Or through it. 17.
Matt: It's hard to tell from this perspective. You have to get a better glance. You have to find if there was a break in the wall anywhere. You do see what looks to be some variation in texture a little ways to the right. It could be a gate, it could be a door, it could be an opening, or it could be some change in its rather solid, not very varied exterior.
Marisha: Go to the gate?
Sam: Yeah.
Marisha: Okay.
Liam: Why don't the half-elves go real quick, just to stay small and quiet. No clanking, no crushing. You take a look at the wall, and then we just call everybody up. Just two seconds if it's the way to go.
Laura: Is it far away? It's like 15 feet from us you said? Is it farther than that?
Matt: Probably about 60 feet down to the right of you guys.
Liam: So the change in the wall's about 60 feet, but the wall from our hiding spot is how far away from us?
Matt: Across the way it's about 30 feet from you. it's only about 15 feet tall, it's not crazy big.
Marisha: I'll see if I can discern something here a little bit better. You go. Go check it out.
Laura: Sure.
Matt: So the two of you dart off to the side, following Keyleth's impression of where she saw this shift, and as you make your way along the edge, you glance over and you see two things. One, there does indeed appear to be a small, cut doorway in the wall, maybe about six feet up, three feet wide, that's designed for a single file passage of any creature that wishes to move through. It's open. There's no closed door there. Above it, just above it, about eight feet up, you see what appears to be a deep cerulean blue gemstone, about two feet across, that's embedded within the wall.
Liam: I think it's fine.
Sam: Just go through the hole.
Liam: We're good. We found it.
Matt: It's a big blue stone, about that big around. It's embedded into the wall above the door.
Marisha: I ask them, how thick does the wall appear to be around that side?
Liam: Looking through the door, can we tell how deep?
Matt: Yeah, actually, you can. It's about three feet wide, four feet wide.
Laura: The depth of the wall?
Matt: The depth of the wall, yeah. It's a big, heavy wall.
Travis: Vex, I bet if you go real fast, you can totally make it.
Laura: Good idea, Grog. I'll definitely try it.
Marisha: I can try and Stone Shape through it.
Matt: You two... recognize, at least, there's something very familiar about that stone embedded in the wall.
Travis: It's blue.
Matt: It's definitely blue. It's very similar in size, installation, and functional placement as the threshold crests that adorn the exterior of Syngorn.
Laura: Which are definitely used... Wait. To teleport things?
Matt: The ones that are used to transport Syngorn to the Feywild and back.
Marisha: Oh, weird. Oh no.
Laura: Oh my god, if the ritual finishes, they can teleport this whole fucking city. Shit. We have to stop this.
Marisha: What if we dismantle the gems?
Taliesin: We would probably have to dismantle a bunch of them.
Travis: We're out in the open. Dismantling that's pretty tough.
Taliesin: I feel like it would be easier to wreck the operator than try to break the machine.
Laura: I don't know.
Sam: I mean, we've got a guy who crushes rocks all the time.
Laura: Yeah, but I don't think it's safe to touch those things.
Liam: And the moment he makes a ruckus, the air squad is coming down on our location immediately.
Marisha: Didn't we take some of that crystal? Didn't we take some of that?
Taliesin: Which crystal?
Marisha: Didn't we take shards of it from the thresholds in Syngorn?
Laura: I don't remember. I don't have any in my bag.
Marisha: One of them shattered, and I feel like we took some.
Travis: Yeah, I did.
Laura: You did?
Travis: Yeah, shards of blue crystal.
Laura: Matt's like, uh...
Marisha: I don't know, maybe it's useful in this case?
Travis: It's not pretty, it's all broken.
Liam: One question is, if these stones are used to pull this tower into the main realms, is there another purpose to them here, or is that doorway safe, is what I'm wondering?
Laura: No, that doorway is in no way safe.
Marisha: Where was the gem embedded in the doorway?
Matt: About eight feet up. About two feet above the doorway.
Liam: I feel like we should go through the wall or over it, just on principle.
Taliesin: We can go over it. We do have a magic carpet.
Laura: Yeah, and all the flying creatures are going to see us immediately. We either go under the wall... How far from the wall to the tower is it? Does it seem?
Matt: Probably...
Laura: Can we see the tower through the doorway?
Matt: You can see across, and it's not a straight shot, but you can get low and you can see where it breaks. Since you have a good sense of direction, being the ranger, I'd say you know it's at least under a mile.
Laura: A mile to the tower? So it's probably two miles wide, this whole...?
Matt: Probably less. It's hard to pinpoint directly from what little you can see, but it's definitely within a mile to a half mile of that door, that wall.
Liam: Kiki, would you be able to Great Escape us underneath this wall?
Laura: Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. What if we go under the ground all the way to the tower?
Marisha: Is it unworked stone? What's the ground like?
Matt: The ground is unworked stone. It is broken dirt and earth and stone. From what you gather, at the very least. A heavy layer of dust.
Marisha: I could attempt to tunnel us there. Percy, I'm sure you would know more than anyone. What's the likelihood that we might encounter, that I might bust through a dungeon or something, though, over there?
Taliesin: That would be the question. It's A, where do we come up? B, how do we tunnel without collapsing a building on us? And C, what if there's buried dead that haven't been able to break?
Marisha: I can get us under the wall for sure. I can do both, it's just figuring out what we want to do.
Taliesin: If we can tunnel under the wall and then come up in a building.
Liam: I think so. We're not trying to get all the way there, just past this.
Marisha: Okay. Can I Stone Shape--
Laura: From within a building.
Marisha: -- a crawlspace through the wall?
Matt: Yeah, you can probably do that. Let me look at the Stone Shape spell here real fast.
Marisha: Big enough for at least Grog to marine belly through?
Travis: We're all undead, so I'm a little smaller right now, actually.
Matt: Well, you look smaller.
Taliesin: You look smaller than you are.
Matt: You're still your same height.
Taliesin: You would be a little zombie, floating, stuck.
Laura: Can we be zombie cows?
Matt: Stone Shape is instantaneous, and it's a section no more than five feet in any dimension, so Stone Shape would be just a one-hit boom. You could not create a long tunnel.
Marisha: But I can't carve a shape through the wall to just crawl through, five feet?
Matt: Oh, through the actual wall itself?
Marisha: Yeah, through the wall, not under the ground. I want to bust a crawl space through the bottom of the wall.
Laura: Don't you think the flying guys will notice that?
Matt: Yeah, that could work. So do you want to do that?
Marisha: It's not a dynamite blast, it's like a (rumble).
Sam: Yeah, it's just a hole in the wall.
Taliesin: It's like butter.
Marisha: Yeah, it's like butter. So...
Matt: Okay. So you dart across the open road to the other side, where the wall is.
Marisha: Cover for me.
Travis: How would we do that?
Taliesin: We are stealthed.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Can I-- Shit, well, you already rolled. Can I have been keeping an eye on the sky and give her a go ahead when it looks like they're not going to see her?
Matt: You begin to do so as she runs across the road.
Marisha: What?
Laura: Just go. Just fucking go.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: You hear the distant shrieks, communication between the various gloom stalkers that (snarling) echoing in the sky. You make it all the way across to the wall, and get low, focus, close your eyes, press your hand against the cold, dark wall, and feel it (whoosh) as immediately, you carve a circular tunnel through that goes completely to the other side. Seemingly to no negative effect.
Marisha: Seemingly to no negative effect, I've made a tunnel.
Sam: You sound different. Why are you using weird words?
Marisha: I'm whispering! I'm just trying to be more pragmatic.
Sam: Let's go.
Laura: Hey, guys, we didn't eat a Heroes' Feast yet, either.
Sam: We didn't heal ourselves.
Marisha: No, we didn't.
Taliesin: We've got to get through the wall.
Sam: Let's get through the wall, and then we'll heal.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: He is looking at each one of us and rolling.
Taliesin: He's making eye contact and rolling a die, like it means something.
Laura: I'm not going to look at him.
Marisha: Keeping track. Why is he keeping track?
Liam: If I don't look, he can't kill me.
Ashley: If you don't make eye contact.
Laura: It's like in school, if you don't make eye contact, maybe they won't call on you.
Matt: Yeah, it's the old Warner Brothers rule. So as you guys all, one by one, dart across and leap beneath the tunnel that Keyleth had created, Keyleth, have you gone through the tunnel, or are you seeing everyone else through?
Marisha: I'll wait and see everyone else through, just in case.
Travis: Oh, how generous of you.
Laura: We all are dead.
Matt: You all begin darting through, one after another.
Marisha: I'm going to try and keep a lookout.
Matt: Keyleth, you glance up as, at the very tail end of it, you have Scanlan and Pike at the very end, ready to rush through the tunnel.
Sam: We're slow.
Matt: Because of the gnomish feet. They both get there as you glance up and watch as one of the gloom stalkers (shriek) and goes into a full screeching dive towards you outside of the wall. What are you guys doing?
Sam: Hurrying.
Ashley: Jumping through as fast as our little gnome feet can take us.
Matt: Okay, so Pike, you dart through, Scanlan, you dart through. With the size of the tunnel, it's easy enough for the both of you to just run through while crouching as opposed to having to get on your hands and knees, so you guys start making your way through to the side. Pike, you make it out the other side. Scanlan, you're halfway through. Keyleth, you're still there, ready to go in after as it's about to bear down on you.
Marisha: It's not coming up?
Matt: Oh, no, it's going for a straight dive. It's going right for you.
Marisha: Oh, god, am I trying to do anything but get through?
Liam: You're running! Come on!
Laura: She has to duck down.
Marisha: I don't know, I've got to crawl through!
Laura: Yeah. So do you have protection? Do you have something you could turn into?
Marisha: Yeah! Thank you! Thank you! I'm going to see it and immediately Beast Shape into a little mouse and (crawling sounds) through.
Matt: I want you to roll an initiative roll to see whether or not it gets to you in time.
Sam: Am I rolling, too, since I'm half-out?
Matt: You're halfway in the tunnel. It couldn't fit in the tunnel if it wanted to.
Sam: But, I mean, am I watching this?
Matt: You're watching this.
Sam: I'm going to roll. Okay.
Liam: I'm going to say that I didn't leave the other side of the wall when I realized that she wasn't coming through. So, waiting right in front of Scanlan.
Marisha: 18.
Sam: Two for me.
Matt: Okay. Natural 19 plus three. So, as you shift down into the tiny mouse-like form, its claws immediately slam into and sink into the mouse body. Yeah, that's a 23 to hit.
Marisha: Yeah. Immediately poof.
Matt: How much hit points does your mouse form have? Like one?
Marisha: I'm assuming no more than a kitten's worth.
Matt: Right, so yeah. So, we'll say for the purposes, one. So that would be 16 points of piercing damage, so your form immediately reverts, its claws now fill with your regular Keyleth form. You take 15 points of piercing damage, Keyleth, and you are grappled.
Marisha: Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool story. Cool.
Matt: As soon as it grabs you, it begins to pull you out of the tunnel and lift with you in its claws.
Ashley: Can I grab her arms?
Matt: You're on the other side of the wall. Scanlan's on the other side right now.
Liam: I'm three feet away from you.
Laura: Yeah, but he's in front of you.
Matt: Everyone else on the other side of the wall, Scanlan in the middle, Keyleth in the front. You saw it shriek and dive down, you don't know what happened from that point. You can glance down and you watch as Keyleth is being pulled up. You see that happening. Scanlan, what are you doing?
Sam: I'll yell to the rest  it's got Keyleth. I'll cast Dominate Monster on it, I guess.
Matt: Okay. So, what's the spell DC on that?
Sam: Well, I was probably not fast enough to pull up my horn, so 20.
Matt: That's a natural four plus three. So, as you say that and turn around, you bring your hand up and begin muttering the incantation and finish it with a flourish!
Sam: I could have just done that this whole time?!
Matt: As you finish the incantation, you watch as a small ring of glowing purple-pink glyphs appear like a crown around the outside, floating about three inches from the gloom stalker's "head." Its shriek goes (intense to calm croaking) and it's just there, hovering in the air, about ten feet up, clutching Keyleth.
Sam: All right. Please deposit her on the other side. Over the wall.
Matt: You guys watch as the gloom stalker (wings flapping) over the wall. Lands on the ground, slamming Keyleth. It slams you into the ground as it lands. You take five points of bludgeoning damage.
Marisha: (wheezing) You could have told it gently!
Sam: I don't speak Gloom!
Marisha: Five points?
Matt: Yes. You (wham) and almost knocks the wind out of you, and you slam into the hard ground, but the claws unfurl and leave you.
Marisha: (wheezing) I made it, guys! I'm glad you made it!
Sam: Only 59 more minutes.
Ashley: Maybe he can tell the others to leave us alone!
Marisha: Yeah, call them off!
Taliesin: Or maybe there are birds on the other side of the wall.
Sam: Does he keep rerolling for breaking, or is that it?
Marisha: Tell them it's handled, we're dead.
Taliesin: And then we can ride him!
Laura: Ask him if he has any money, and ask him if he can make a good dinner because I'm hungry.
Marisha: Where's the nearest 7-11?
Matt: Each time the target takes damage. It has to take damage to get the save. So, it's under your control for an hour or until it takes damage.
Sam: All right. First things first, please go tell your fellow gloomy friends that the hunt is off. No more flesh down here. And come back!
Matt: (croaking) You can see that it's landed, its giant wings have folded under into these folded knuckle-like claws that hit the ground as it (croaks) and he gets really close and snarls at you. As it gets close, the air gets colder in its presence, it's almost like it brings this drop. It's already pretty cold here in the Shadowfell, but it becomes pretty much freezing as soon as it gets within five feet of you. It seems to suck heat out of the air. As it's glaring at you, (wings flapping) begins to take up. You can see three other gloom stalkers who saw it dive earlier are all arriving towards your location. As it rides up towards them, you hear (gloom stalker speech) and the other ones (gloom stalker speech) snap at it, circle it and they all have what looks like an argument, if there was. And then, eventually, they break and they begin shouting off (gloom stalker speech). You watch as the heavy clusters that had been swarming this area of the town begin to respond in kind. You hear the echoes, the cacophony of various screeches and screams and they all begin to slowly dissipate and diffuse amongst the entire city of Thar Amphala.
Taliesin: Well, that went well.
Laura: Good job, Scanlan.
Liam: Welcome back, Scanlan Shorthalt.
Marisha: Thanks, Scanlan!
Sam: It's good to be back. Okay, we'll need a name for him, obviously.
Laura: Yes.
Sam: So, anybody got any ideas?
Laura: Benjamin is what I'm thinking.
Sam: Benjamin is great.
Marisha: Mr. Mistoffelees!
Sam: That's way better. (laughing)
Taliesin: Can we ride him to the tower?
Sam: Well, some of us can, right? By looking at him, how much can he carry? Or she!
Matt: You're not certain, based on its size, it could maybe carry three medium to small people.
Sam: Okay.
Marisha: (whispered) What's around us right now? (regular volume) Sorry, what's around us right now?
Matt: So, as you glance around the other side of the wall, the city is denser within this inner cloister, and the buildings all seem to be newer. Or repaired. It seems like this inner sanctum of Thar Amphala has garnished most of the attention of those that currently reside within its space. As you are glancing up, too, you see the flicker, the faint flicker of the conjoining strands of magical energy that are rising up to the pinnacle of the tower of Entropis where you see these three heavy claw-like fingers that jut out of the top of the tower all curve inward. The flash is in the center of it, it's just glowing brighter and brighter. That pulsing is (pulsing). It's almost like seeing this heartbeat of pure energy that's swelling and swelling.
Laura: I don't think we have time to stop.
Sam: Well, so no more healing. But we could fly right up there and break that thing.
Marisha: Do we really not want to do any other healing?
Laura: Pike can heal us, but we can't rest. There's no time for a rest. No time for a Heroes' Feast. I bought those fucking chalices.
Taliesin: Next time.
Marisha: Might still be useful.
Ashley: How long does Heroes' Feast take?
Sam: Like an hour or something.
Taliesin: It will hardly matter.
Ashley: We can't just take an hour?
Laura: I think that thing is like, going to go.
Matt: It's up to you guys. It's a gradual. It's not like all of a sudden, right now, you watched it pulse. As you've been getting towards, you've been watching it slowly swell. So, who knows.
Sam: Some of us could get on Mr. Mistoffelees and fly around the tower and see if there's a window that we could bust in or something.
Laura: I wonder if Delilah's on the top of the tower.
Sam: Yeah, but we'll be on a thing, so maybe we won't be very conspicuous.
Taliesin: Actually, maybe if we ask Mr. Mistoffelees-- I'm going to never get tired of saying that!-- to go up to the tower, greet whoever's up there, and throw them off.
Sam: It's just a pulsing orb of doom, isn't it?
Taliesin: Just go up there and cause havoc.
Sam: One of us needs to see what's up there.
Taliesin: No, we can just send him up there, and then we can head in through the tower. He can just be a problem.
Sam: He's dumb! What if comes back and he's like 'I don't know!'?
Taliesin: Just say, go up there and if there's anything living up there, throw it off.
Sam: Can't one of us go up there with him to scout it out? Yeah, if someone's invisible. Can't you all be invisible?
Taliesin: Yes, all of us.
Sam: Just me.
Taliesin: Yes, it's just you.
Laura: Can't you make all of us invisible?
Sam: Not while I'm concentrating on Mr. Mistoffelees! (laughter)
Taliesin: I say we head in closer on foot. If you want to ride Mr. Mistoffelees up to the top of the tower, that's one thing. But I think just sending him up there, or sending him to be an agent of chaos.
Liam: I could probably ride him, and if shit goes south, I could get away.
Taliesin: You could always get swallowed.
Liam: By Mr. Mistoffelees?
Laura: By anything.
Taliesin: I get the distinct impression we're going to have options before this day is over.
Marisha: I feel like we're going to have to do a lot of things to stop this.
Sam: We need to get into the tower! We don't even know how to do that!
Liam: We don't know what we're talking about, which is why I think the idea to go scope it out is a good one.
Laura: Does it look like there's any windows on the tower, or is just a big old Rapunzel tower?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Laura: Okay.
Sam: Nope!
Laura: Well, hold on. 19.
Matt: 19, still pretty good. Not a single window. It's a solid tower.
Ashley: Are there any doors? No windows?
Matt: You can't tell from your perspective right now. The base is currently obscured by the very, very dense buildings.
Laura: Ultimate challenge for Vox Machina.
Travis: Should we check one of the buildings, and then we can figure out who wants to go check it out, so we can get out of the open?
Laura: Yeah, let's get in a building and hide!
Travis: Because he's a cleaner!
Liam: The tower, is it obscured by all this shit happening on top of it? Vex can see there's no windows; can we see if there's a rooftop to it at all?
Matt: There is a top to the tower.
Liam: Is it this, is it this, or can we not see?
Matt: The tower gently tapers and then comes to an end. There is a top. You see there's three giant, curled finger-like black spires that curl inward on the outside, inward. And then there's the platform where the tower stops, where it seems like there would be somewhere to stand.
Laura: The thing that's glowing is off of the ground of the tower?
Matt: It's filling up the entirety of that space between the fingers on the actual roof of the tower.
Marisha: What if it has to keep expanding all the way to the crystals?
Travis: What's the nearest building? Is there one building that's closest to where we came through the tunnel?
Matt: Yeah, you guys are about ten feet from the nearest building.
Travis: Can I walk over? Are there any windows?
Matt: This building does not have any windows.
Travis: Does it have a door?
Matt: It does.
Travis: Can I knock?
Matt: (knocking) You watch as an older gentleman with a very thin gray goatee, looks a little sallow, missing his left eye, he currently has a small sack over his shoulder, he opens the door. "Can I--"
Travis: Hey, come here! And I grab his face.
Matt: (muffled yelling)
Laura: Inside! Inside!
Travis: We just go in. Push in.
Taliesin: Well, we're going in now, aren't we?
Liam: And we're walking, and we're walking.
Sam: I'll tell Mr. Mistoffelees to do a 90-second loop and come back down and check in on us because he can't fit in the door, right?
Matt: No!
Sam: Fly around 90 seconds and swoop back down.
Matt: He does a small circle as you guys all rush into the building. You enter the inside. You see what looks to be a lot of building materials. It looks like some of the outer buildings here were used as the storage facilities for what a lot of the city was rebuilt as. There's nobody else inside right now. This gentleman looks like he was on his way out of the building as you interrupted him. As now most of his head is just clasped by your giant goliath Titanstone Knuckle-adorned hand, you see a little bit of his eye peeking over Grog's, and he's like (muffled yelling).
Travis: Shh.
Matt: You see he's got the heavy male pattern-- looks like the old D&D Dungeon Master from the cartoon. He's bald on top, has long gray hair that goes past his shoulders. Very thin, missing the left eye, and he's just limp. He's not even going to fight it.
Laura: Oh hey! We were sent here by Delilah Briarwood. You may know her.
Matt: (muffled yelling)
Laura: Right. The ritual that's happening on top of the tower. How long until that thing's done?
Matt: (muffled noises)
Laura: Blink once for 15 minutes. Blink twice for an hour or more.
Liam: Three times for a bunch of days.
Sam: Maybe he doesn't know.
Laura: Yeah, do you know? Blink once for yes, blink twice for no.
Matt: (muffling noises)
Sam: 15 minutes! No, that was once for 15 minutes!
Laura: No, that was an hour, at least!
Marisha: I thought he blinked before. Are we at an hour and 15 minutes?
Taliesin: I don't think you can call it a blink if you've got one eye. I think it's just a wink.
Marisha: A wink? Man, semantics!
Matt: You get the sense that, as you say that, it does hurt him a little. His demeanor, while already pretty shattered, just even further (sad noise).
Travis: Does he have any pouches on him, or anything in his hands?
Matt: He had a small sack over his shoulder that he was leaving with. He's just adorned in regular--
Travis: Is the sack on the ground now or is it still over his shoulder?
Matt: No, it's currently on the ground. He dropped it as soon as you rushed and pushed him.
Travis: I take the satchel, and I give it to Pike and say: look in here.
Matt: You glance inside. As soon as you grab it, you hear the clanging of metal. You look inside and you can see what appear to be a handful of dark metal shortswords, daggers, simple dried rations, and, in fact, as you glance inside the room now, you can see a lot of the supplies here, aside from construction supplies, you see a handful of weapons that are well-made, recent-made, not seen battle yet.
Sam: They're about to invade.
Laura: What if we burn the fucking city down?
Sam: I mean, sure! What?
Laura: I mean, if they're planning on transporting this whole fucking city, and setting an army loose on our world, why don't we just burn the whole fucking city down? Destroy their rations. Destroy their weapons!
Taliesin: I am excited by this plan.
Sam: Wait, what? No! That's terrible!
Liam: Let's burn down Manhattan. How do you do that?!
Travis: Shall we ask this gentleman some questions? All right. I'm going to remove my hand. Obviously, you're like really cool with the purpose-- perspective of dying, and I'll quicken that if you make a loud noise. Right, like, if you've ever seen, like, Jello mixed with, like apple pudding. That's what I'll do to your head.
Matt: Make an intimidation check.
Laura: You did your hand signal for Arnold Palmer.
Travis: I did!
Matt: Universal.
Laura: Arnold Palmer?
Travis: 22!
Matt: 22. He doesn't make a sound, more than the gentle trickle out of his pant leg does. (laughs)
Taliesin: I think that's a yes.
Travis: Grab the scruff of his collar.
Matt: Okay, as you release, he (gasps). His teeth are broken and yellow, his one gaping socket is twitching a little bit from the recovery of the sudden, rapid series of events that he was not expecting today. As he gathers his breath, and scratches the side of his leg, "So. What do you wish to do to me?"
Sam: Nothing! We've got to hurry!
Laura: No, really, do you know anything about the ritual?
Matt: "I mean, not the specifics."
Laura: Do you know if it's going to be over soon?
Matt: "I know that some of the acolytes were rushing through, expediting things recently."
Marisha: Why?
Matt: "I don't know!"
Sam: Did they tell you to gather weapons?
Matt: "They just told us to be ready."
Liam: For what? What's the plan here, man? You're really far away from anything fucking nice.
Matt: You watch him close off as you start saying that. He catches himself saying too much information. His demeanor goes cold.
Laura: Please, we know you're going to transport to another plane.
Marisha: You're trying to bail, aren't you? Were you trying to run?
Sam: No, he's joining the fight.
Laura: Oh my god, he was going to leave.
Travis: Well, he's clearly clamming up. I put my hand back over the front of his face, I take the other one, put it on the back of his face, and I start making my fingers touch.
Matt: (muffled groaning) He reaches up and grabs the small symbol, familiar loop with the fork above it. He clasps it in his hand and doesn't resist.
Travis: Do you want it?
Ashley: Yeah! Put him a little lower, Grog. I rip off the necklace.
Matt: He's like clasping it in his hand. Make a strength check.
Taliesin: Drop it! Drop it!
Ashley: Oh my god, we're so terrible!
Travis: Are we?
Ashley: Natural 20!
Matt: He's clasping it, and you can see his one eye rolls back to hold onto it and he's muttering a prayer beneath your fingers and he's (muffled muttering) and you tear it from his grasp. (muffled panic)
Ashley: We'll give it back! You've got to answer some questions for us.
Travis: No, he won't. Look away if you want to preserve anything, and I just squish his head.
Matt: As you're saying that, you watch as one eye opens and his hands go limp and then (face exploding) and it just (splattering).
Ashley: Grog!
Matt: Spray on Pike.
Travis: I thought you were me giving the signal like, end it!
Ashley: No! I was going to-- whatever.
Travis: All right. We'll work on it.
Ashley: We'll find another one. It's okay.
Travis: Yeah, I'm really sorry. Sorry.
Ashley: Brains!
Liam: Pike got Dragon Aged.
Matt: Yeah!
Marisha: Is there a water bucket around?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Laura: So, but, set fire to the house, right? Burn the whole city down?
Sam: No!
Marisha: 11.
Taliesin: The city is mostly stone; I don't know if we can burn it down.
Matt: As you're having this conversation, you do find a small basin that's filled up with water. The people that live in this city still need to live. It looks like there are the means of feeding and drinking, though you get the sense that they may or may not-- most of the supplies do come from outside the Shadowfell.
Laura: Let's poison the water supply!
Marisha: I take a little bit of the water and control it and let Pike wash off a little bit.
Matt: Okay.
Ashley: I think I got a little in my mouth (gagging).
Liam: Wait, there's a little bit of skull right there. All right.
Taliesin: That's the little chunk where the joint is. It's just this little bit, it just breaks naturally if you put pressure on that side.
Matt: There's this slumped pile of dark cloth, thin body, and Riki-Oh mess on the ground.
Taliesin: (laughs) Wow! Way to bring that back!
Matt: So, what's the plan, guys?
Taliesin: We've got a little shadow creature coming back around in a moment.
Sam: Want to jump on and do a scouting pass?
Liam: Yeah.
Taliesin: You guys do the scout, we'll heal?
Ashley: You guys, are we not going to do a Heroes' Feast?
Laura: It's an hour. It takes an hour, right?
Sam: We can't risk it.
Liam: What do you think's going to happen in an hour? Everything's going to kick off in an hour?
Sam: Wouldn't you hate to miss it by 15 minutes?
Laura: The pulse has gotten stronger since we've been here. I don't know if that pulse means it's about to go, or if the pulse means that it's five minutes in.
Sam: This guy was about to leave his house to go walk over there for the final part of the ritual.
Marisha: Or he was trying to bail before the final part of the ritual.
Liam: Where's your pet? Let's go find some shit out.
Marisha: He had rations! No one takes rations!
Laura: He was handing out weapons.
Taliesin: It was like Carpentry of the Damned sort of thing.
Marisha: What if the giant orb has to reach the crystals?
Taliesin: It might, but it might just do the (buzzing, exploding).
Laura: Technical terms.
Marisha: Yeah, the (buzzing, exploding).
Taliesin: It's magic, it's the best I've got.
Travis: Who's going up?
Sam: Me and Vax.
Travis: Just you two, okay.
Ashley: How's everybody doing right now?
Taliesin: I'm a little rough.
Marisha: I'm a little rough.
Taliesin: I could use 20 points.
Laura: Yeah, I could use 20 points.
Ashley: Let's do a little Mass Cure Wounds situation.
Marisha: Nice.
Travis: Do it!
Sam: But do it with a flair! (laughter)
Ashley: Oh, fudge.
Laura: What? Oh that's a one, not seven, isn't it?
Ashley: 13.
Laura: That's fine, that's fine!
Taliesin: We're taking a short rest; I can add my--
Matt: Are you guys taking a short rest?
Laura: Well, while they fly up, is it enough time for the people staying in the house to heal a bit?
Matt: You guys could take a short rest during that time, if you want to do a full scoping. By the time you come back, that spell's about to fade.
Sam: I mean, yeah, we're going to go as fast as we can.
Matt: So those that are traveling can't take a short rest.
Travis: And if that fades, he's fully aware that he was dominated, right?
Matt: Well. You don't know.
Travis: Okay. Especially me.
Matt: Yeah, you especially don't know.
Liam: Time's a-wasting, Scanlan, let's go.
Sam: Let's go. Mr. Mistoffelees!
Matt: As you open the door, there, just landing (landing) (gloom stalker croaking). You guys climb onto its back?
Sam: Yes, we do!
Matt: You climb onto its back. Touching this creature is like touching the inside of a freezer. Even with gauntleted hands, you have to wrap some of your cloth around to not give yourself frostbite over a period of time. Even resting on it, especially with your leather armors, it chills you to the bone. As you take up, and even just ten, 15 minutes into (wings flapping) up into the air, gathering as to whether you'll be noticed or spotted by this, you can feel it beginning to chill you, your teeth are beginning to chatter from being in that proximity of the freezing cold creature. It's strange, as you touch it, it feels less like fur and flesh and more like you're grabbing onto a very, very thick sackcloth. Like, it tugs and pulls and it feels almost like the scruff of a cat or dog's neck, but it has a clothy texture, and as you grab it, you can feel the cold wisps of shadow and darkness obscure your hands. You feel like you're plunging your arms into it, but you find purchase within that shadow and hold on.
Sam: We'll need to spoon for warmth.
Liam: I nestle in behind Scanlan.
Sam: I gladly accept.
Liam: Let's ride.
Travis: Let's ride?! (laughing)
Matt: All right, so, as you guys take up into the sky, and you guys are taking your short rest, we're going to take a quick break on our end as well. Use the restroom, get a snack.
Marisha: We're taking a break?
Matt: We're taking a break here because it is 8:30. We are going to do another giveaway at the break here, a Wyrmwood giveaway. A fantastic flamebox elder hero vault, which is some of the prettiest wood that they make.
Liam: Maybe the prettiest Wyrmwood box ever.
Laura: How come we didn't ever see those before; is that a new wood?
Matt: I don't know. But it's cool!
Laura: I want it!
Matt: Hero vault for whoever the lucky winner is. To be a part of that drawing, rush over to Twitch chat. Tonight's password is 'secrets,' plural. S-E-C-R-E-T-S. So, when you're prompted, enter the word 'secrets' in Twitch chat to be part of this giveaway and we'll come back and announce who it is after the break. We'll see you guys here in a few minutes. [break] (laughter)
Matt: Hello, everyone, and welcome back to Critical Role.
Ashley: My timing is bad. (laughter)
Matt: We missed you, too, guys.
Travis: Oh my god.
Ashley: I forget, and then I remember to do it, and then we're already on the air.
Matt: Indeed, we are. Welcome back, everybody. First off, our winner of the hero case from our friends at Wyrmwood is Rory1177. Rory1177, you are the winner for tonight. Congratulations. Denobo will contact you and get your information and have that shipped off to you asap, so congratulations. All right, so as the rest of you are taking a short rest, the two of you are making your way, as stealthily as you can, on the back of a gloom stalker as it encircles the exterior of the Castle Entropis. First off, I would like you both to make a stealth check.
Liam: I squeeze the gnome tighter.
Laura: Oh god. I think you're out of range, so you don't get the plus ten anymore.
Liam: That's okayish.
Sam: 21.
Taliesin: You have advantage, though, on everything.
Sam: He's fine.
Liam: 34. A low 34.
Matt: Okay, so you guys begin to circle the exterior of the tower, making a wide spiral along its exterior. You make your way up. It's hard to gauge the full height of this tower, but it's at least six or seven stories tall, if not taller. I want you both to make perception checks, please.
Liam: Now that we're closer, I'm looking for windows that she might not have been close enough to see. Doors, holes, anything.
Matt: Perception check.
Liam: Yes, sir.
Sam: Natural one! I'm under his body.
Matt: He's curled up within Vax.
Liam: Hey!
Matt: Not even a top or bottom circumstance. You're just within.
Liam: It really just depends on the day. 26.
Matt: 26. Okay. No windows. It is a solid tower, completely around as you cycle around. As you get towards the top of it, you notice the three curved fingerlike spires that curl up at the top and the pulsing of the energy. You watch as these very faint tendrils of magical energy that you've tuned in to be able to see better, now that you know what to look for, are all-- from this height, you can see the long strands are undulating and shifting, almost like the very winds of the land are causing them to rotate. You can see the variations in their form, but they're all still merging and entwining at the very top of Entropis. You see nothing. You can see what appear to be a cluster of about 30 or so figures all gathered along the top of this. You can see what appear to be three glowing spheres in a triangular pattern around this that are accepting the tether of the magical energy, and then suffusing what appears to be a small altar of some kind in the very center of the top of this tower.
Liam: Mother bitch.
Matt: You've been circling here for about 15 to 20 minutes or so, and the energy (explosion noise) untethers and unfurls. There's a shockwave of warmth that cascades outward from the top of the tower. Both of you feel it pass through you, and that freezing cold that you've been trying desperately to hold at bay as you're clutching onto the back of this gloom stalker, this heat wave moves past. The gloom stalker (squawks) instinctually pulls back, and you can see for a second it drops, and you feel your stomach bottom out as it loses about 20 feet of elevation before catching itself again. And you watch as any of the others that are currently cycling around the stratosphere over the city of Thar Amphala also are taken off guard by the sudden burst of energy. As you glance over, you can see the tethers that connect have all fallen and faded. (music changes)
Sam: (quietly) How does he do that? How did you do that?
Matt: You also watch as about 25 or so of these figures at the top all collapse at once.
Liam: But some are left.
Matt: There are some left. You watch and very faintly, you can see on that altar in the center, there is a small bead of pure, vibrant, bright white light. You watch as a robed figure that previously was held in the shadows emerge. You're too far away to make any more details than that.
Liam: A lot of motherfuckers just died on the top of that tower. You felt that?
Sam: What do we do? Is that the end of the ritual?
Liam: How much time left on that hour, buddy?
Sam: Enough to get back to our friends, probably.
Liam: We've got to go.
Sam: Should we attack now? Just the two of us?
Liam: No, we should not do that.
Sam: We could.
Liam: We could.
Sam: Between you and me, we're the most powerful ones in the group.
Liam: I just don't feel like freeballing it right now, and I'd really like the group.
Sam: I know, but will you at least confirm that yes, we are the most powerful?
Liam: Clearly. We are the most, as the kids say, OP. Let's get back to the group.
Sam: All right. Hold me tight. Mr. Mistoffeles, back down.
Matt: It goes into a rapid dive, making its way back towards where you left the rest of your party. The rest of you, you can go ahead and regain your short rest. You get your Wild Shape back. You can spend any hit dice to heal up if you'd like. If you haven't already.
Laura: I already did it.
Matt: Okay, good. I also need all of you to roll a wisdom saving throw, please.
Sam: Everybody?
Matt: Everybody who was on a short rest.
Laura: If we had had a Feast, we'd have advantage on this.
Marisha: We would.
Matt: All right, so.
Taliesin: 14.
Marisha: 30.
Laura: 24.
Ashley: Just to make sure  I used Gnome Cunning, because I get advantage on wisdom.
Matt: It's not a "magical" effect.
Ashley: Okay. So then I'll take my first roll, which was two. And then I will add my wisdom saving throw number, which is ten, so I have 12.
Travis: 19.
Sam: I want you to explain every roll.
Matt: In the rest you take, the Shadowfell does not seem to have any adverse effect on your presence.
Taliesin: However...
Matt: There's no "however." You complete your rest fine. You guys all gather your stuff, you take a breath and prepare for the next leg of your venture as the door to your building slams open, Scanlan and Vax arriving, just leaping off the back of the gloom stalker that they had under their control. Who is also about to lose its...
Taliesin: How much longer do they have?
Sam: Fly away!
Taliesin: Attack the tower. Tell it to attack the tower.
Sam: Really? It's going to forget halfway there.
Taliesin: Maybe we can mess one person up.
Sam: Fly away! Just fly away!
Ashley: On the rest, could I have worked a little bit more on enchanting the silver bullets?
Matt: You can spend a little more time on it. It'll take a few days of getting that to happen.
Ashley: I just keep working on it.
Laura: Did we feel that (whoosh) within the building?
Matt: You didn't. You may have heard something strange, but it didn't really catch your attention. You guys spent your time resting on the inside of the building.
Laura: What'd you see?
Liam: Saw a lot of fucking people just die on the top of that tower. I can't guarantee it, but I think it's a safe bet that your girl Delilah is up there.
Laura: That's where I figured she'd be.
Sam: It seems they've completed at least some part of the ritual.
Liam: Yeah, there was some sort of massive pulse of energy, 20-something hooded figures just dropped dead on the spot. A wave of some shit blasted through us.
Laura: Can I run out and look at the tower and see if the orb looks different?
Marisha: I join Vex.
Matt: You guys rush out and peek outside of the doorway towards the top of Entropis. You see that the glowing pulse is gone. The energy tethers from the siphons are gone.
Laura: Fuck.
Marisha: I look around. Are we still in the Shadowfell?
Matt: Perception check.
Marisha: That's not great. 18.
Matt: That's enough. Yeah, you're still in the Shadowfell. (sounds of relief)
Travis: Motherfucking Mercer. That intonation.
Taliesin: If you rolled low enough, he'd be like, "You don't know." Seattle! You've taken us to Seattle!
Laura: Well, we should fucking get up there, then, huh?
Sam: Should we go straight up the tower?
Liam: What else are we doing here?
Sam: Yeah, all right.
Taliesin: Let's head to the base.
Sam: But we're going to fight an aerial battle against super-magical things.
Marisha: Oh my god.
Liam: We're weighing risk here. What do we think would happen if we spent an hour having that Feast right now?
Travis: Actually, that's true. Nothing's going to change at this point.
Sam: Maybe.
Marisha: I mean, maybe we should return to something like sabotaging the machine, or... burning the city. Oh god, Vex is rubbing off on me.
Laura: Did you see Delilah up there?
Liam: No. There was a ringleader, but we were too far out.
Laura: And the ringleader was still standing?
Liam: Yeah.
Ashley: How many people were still standing?
Matt: That would have been three that you noticed.
Liam: Precisely three. (laughter)
Ashley: Lots of them died in the blast?
Sam: Yeah, so it's not even going to be a tough fight. We'll just take down three people and be done, right?
Laura: So easy.
Taliesin: The less people we're fighting, the worse it is.
Marisha: Agreed.
Ashley: It won't just be three.
Taliesin: It might be four.
Sam: It'll be... less than three?
Laura: Even one with that fucking wall she had last time, we're fucked.
Marisha: How far did the blast go that you saw?
Liam: We were 100 yards out or something?
Matt: Yeah, you were probably about 300 feet out.
Laura: We didn't do any research on that wall, did we? That spell? Did anybody do any research on that spell that we saw her do? Down in the ziggurat?
Taliesin: We kind of figured out what it was. It was a modified version of a spell we've seen before.
Matt: Kind of, yeah. It seemed to be prismatic. You've seen Prismatic Spray. It's a prismatic spell in nature but you didn't really research any means of defeating it or bypassing it.
Travis: Do you still have that Earthquake spell?
Marisha: I believe me and Pike both do, yes.
Travis: We couldn't, like, earthquake the tower to the ground. Could we?
Marisha: Between me, you, and Pike? We can take this tower down.
Sam: Is that true?
Travis: I just don't know about us going to the top, if we could maybe bring it--
Taliesin: Oh, if we could maybe bring the top down here?
Sam: That's a good idea, if you can really do it.
Travis: I just don't know how big around it is. It might be fucking huge.
Taliesin: How big around is the tower?
Matt: At the very base--
Taliesin: He's looking at the tower.
Matt: -- it's about 170, 180 feet in diameter.
Marisha: Hang on, 180 feet in diameter? Hang on. Pike and I check our spellbooks real quick.
Taliesin: Can I do a little engineering? If I were going to punch at it...
Liam: Also, the idea that we're going to sneak into that tower is farfetched.
Sam: No, we either have to fly up to the top or bring it down to us, right?
Laura: I like the idea of bringing it down.
Liam: Even if it fails, the fight will still come to-- Either we bring the fight to them, or we rip down the tower and bring the fight to us.
Marisha: For up to a minute and a hundred foot radius, centered at a point...
Matt: It deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with the ground in the area when you cast the spell. If it drops to zero hit points, it collapses and potentially damages nearby creatures. So the question is, do you think that'll be enough to drop a solid obsidian tower?
Laura: It's a tough call. Twice in a row?
Marisha: But, I mean, two Earthquake spells and Grog.
Laura: I have a siege arrow.
Marisha: I will point out this will be burning mine and Pike's 8th-level spell, but it might be worth it.
Sam: It feels like it's a 3.2 earthquake, we need a 6.2 earthquake.
Travis: That's true, we do. Let's be honest. We really do need a massive shake.
Laura: What if we weaken the outside and then hit with the earthquake?
Marisha: I can tunnel out underneath it.
Taliesin: I think whatever was going on up there is gone. I think it's happened.
Laura: Well, Delilah's still up there, so if she falls at least she takes some damage.
Taliesin: That's fair.
Liam: I'm just going to throw my vote in the ring here, that I think we should take the time for the Feast. You know, we're not killing piles of rats in the sewers, here. This is serious.
Sam: When last time we fought Delilah, were any of us scared of her?
Taliesin: She's not what I'm afraid of.
Laura: Wisdom saving throws are major. She could take control of us.
Travis: I'm not against that, but I think one person should stay out of the Feast and keep an eye in case they leave in the hour that we're feasting.
Sam: Well, if someone's going to stay out of the Feast, it should be the guy who already has advantage on everything.
Travis: Oh, that too, yeah. I just can't get afraid, that's all I was going to say.
Laura: Yeah, but you can be taken control of with your brain, Grog.
Travis: That's assuming a lot.
Taliesin: Damn it.
Ashley: Shit.
Travis: Or we just go get it. We just go after it and go get it.
Sam: I'm against the Feast. I think we should just run in.
Laura: I just don't feel like there's time, honestly.
Sam: Also, I'm vegan, I don't know if I could eat everything at the feast.
Liam: It is largely GoFiBePo?
Sam: GoFiBePo? Why didn't you just name it a Poobah Platter?
Laura: Oh, that would have been way easier.
Marisha: How far are we from the tower in this little house?
Matt: In this house, you're a little over a half mile away from it.
Taliesin: It's a ten-minute walk.
Matt: So this house is just outside of the perimeter wall of the inner cloister.
Marisha: You guys could do the Feast and some of us can help tunnel out the ground during that hour.
Taliesin: I don't know. I don't think we're going to bring it down.
Travis: I don't know if we're going to bring it down. It was a cool idea, but I don't know if we're going to do it. We're no white ancient dragon.
Ashley: What's it made of? Obsidian?
Matt: You haven't been close enough to really tell, but it looks to be made of a very thick, dark obsidian or onyx-like material.
Liam: It's also unsettling as fuck, right?
Laura: Oh, it's probably magically protected.
Liam: Probably.
Taliesin: It may just hover there if we knock this.
Laura: That is very true.
Taliesin: It may be keeping the ground up as opposed to being sitting on the ground at that point.
Marisha: So we're going to try to fly up?
Taliesin: Or walk up through the inside.
Travis: Raise your hand if you want a Heroes' Feast.
Liam: For you all, yes.
Travis: Four?
Sam: Is that a raise or not?
Travis: Are you scratching your ear or are you raising your hand?
Taliesin: Yes, damn it.
Sam: Wait, so, are we four?
Ashley: I'm just nervous. I know we don't have time, but what if this is one of those decisions where later we're like "We should have fucking done a Heroes' Feast"?
Travis: Well, let's do it.
Ashley: I don't know, though, I don't know if we have the time. This is hard.
Travis: Well, the transaction upstairs has already happened, whether they get away or not.
Marisha: I have a feeling we're going to be down here a while.
Laura: Maybe we can prepare the Feast, keep an eye out. If we have to ditch out on the Feast early, then we do.
Marisha: Keyleth looks out the window again. Are people panicked, are people running around? Is there a rabble in the street?
Matt: There's no technical window in this building. There's the door.
Travis: She just pushes her head against the wall.
Matt: So you look out the door and glance through. You do notice, there's no panic, but you do see a number of-- and this is interesting-- you glance out, and you don't see any undead wandering the streets of the inner cloister. At least, not like the outer area was. You do see-- make a perception check, actually.
Marisha: Oh, that's good! 30!
Matt: You see, throughout the street, which, the street from here gets about halfway to the tower before it hits a building and curves around. You see maybe 35 or 40 total people in matching or close cultist robes or similar colors, all making their way towards the tower.
Taliesin: They're dressed for an occasion. Fuck it. Just go.
Laura: We got to go. 35 to 40 people? Let's kill 'em all on the way up.
Marisha: Man, you're frosty today. You're just--
Laura: They're trying to come over into our territory. I don't like it. They're all assholes.
Travis: Shall we go in?
Marisha: Well, how are we going to go in, though? Just flying up?
Taliesin: We have one broom, we don't have two brooms anymore. We got a carpet, and we got wings.
Laura: And a couple people with wings. Oh god, the creepy music is starting. We gotta go, y'all.
Liam: Beeline to the tower.
Marisha: And then what? And then what, though? Once we get there? Play it by ear?
Taliesin: Throw everything off the top. Break everything. Smash everything.
Laura: It's Delilah. She's going to destroy us. Do we have any way to neutralize her magic?
Travis: Well, you could turn into a... no.
Marisha: I can't. I gave Vax Foresight. I cannot turn into a beholder today.
Sam: I can.
Taliesin: You can?
Sam: Yes.
Marisha: Do you have Shapechange?
Sam: Something like it. (gasping)
Taliesin: All right, this is almost a plan. Let's do this.
Travis: It's more than we normally have.
Taliesin: It's far more.
Laura: Are there a lot of gloom stalkers around?
Matt: You can tell with the loss of magical energy that they've been tossed askew a bit. Their patterns of circling and being intent, they're a little more scattered a bit, but there are still maybe a few dozen that look over the inner cloister.
Taliesin: Let's make our way to the tower and maybe head up through the tower. We don't have to necessarily fly up to the top.
Laura: Wait a minute. Did the orb at the top turn the same way that the orbs in the ziggurat turn?
Matt: There were faint orbs that were taking the energy and focusing it towards that center altar, and when everything faded after the shock wave, what you saw looked like the tiniest star. It was just a speck of extremely bright light that to look directly at it hurt.
Travis: I don't know! I don't! Just go get it.
Marisha: I'm honestly still kind of into the earthquake idea. Bringing down the tower. I'm not going to lie.
Sam: That's not going to work!
Marisha: How do you know?
Sam: You said 50 points of damage?
Taliesin: I can take 50 points of damage. I can take two earthquakes, personally.
Sam: I mean, just from a metagaming scenario, that's not even-- that can't even hurt--
Marisha: No, no, no. The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with the ground in your area when you cast the spell, and at the start of each of your turns until the spell ends, and the spell lasts a minute.
Sam: So you get ten 50s.
Marisha: Ten of those. Ten 50s.
Laura: Oh, and then times two.
Marisha: With Pike and I.
Sam: So that's 1000 points. Over a minute. That's better than I thought.
Liam: Is it concentration?
Marisha: It's concentration for up to a minute, and it has a 500-foot range, and a 100-foot radius. So Pike and I could split, half and half of the tower.
Travis: It's pretty fucking Hollywood. I kind of like it.
Taliesin: All right! All right, let's do it.
Marisha: I feel like if we go right up to the top of the tower, it's like walking into the danger.
Taliesin: Let's bring the tower down to us.
Marisha: This is insane!
Liam: And you can still fuck shit up while you got that earthquake going, right?
Marisha: Well, how do you mean?
Laura: Oh, yeah, if you have that spell going, you can do other things in case things attack us?
Liam: Are you just doing Earthquake the whole time, or are you just standing there staring at the ground?
Marisha: It's my concentration, so I can keep it going and do an instant reaction spell.
Matt: Do other things, you can't do another concentration spell.
Liam: But you're not lightning anybody's ass, not doing anything like that. You're focusing on the tower.
Marisha: I mean, I can throw a Fireball and keep it going, yeah.
Liam: That's really big. All right.
Taliesin: I say the movers and shakers get the cloaks. Let's head out.
Laura: Get up as close as we can to support Pike and Keyleth.
Taliesin: And we keep them safe. We are playing defense.
Laura: Yes.
Marisha: God, I hope this works.
Taliesin: God, I hope this works, too.
Marisha: I don't know if this is going to work!
Laura: This is stupid as fuck!
Taliesin: We're distance. Anybody gets near them, we take them out.
Marisha: Grog, can you at the right moment just do a big-- see if you can topple it over?
Travis: I can try and do whatever you want. I can run around and punch a bunch of holes in it, whatever.
Taliesin: We're going to focus everything on one side of the tower, we're going to try and bring it down in a direction. Here we go.
Laura: Yes, focus it on one side of the tower. Both on the same side.
Taliesin: Like a tree. Let's do this. This is a terrible plan. All right. LAURA Just trying to gauge Matt.
Marisha: I know! Matt's stone cold!
Taliesin: Matt's thinking about all the other people he could be playing D&D with right now. (laughing)
Taliesin: He's imagining a whole other set of faces here.
Liam: All right, let's teleport inside that dragon. Come on.
Matt: Yeah, what's the plan, guys?
Liam: That's the plan.
Laura: We're going to get close enough so that they can do their 500 feet distance. But keep a distance to the tower.
Marisha: And if we can be hidden while we're doing this, instead of being open. We have a 500-foot range here. We've got a dope-ass range.
Taliesin: Keyleth's got a cloak. Pike's got a cloak.
Travis: I'm huge.
Taliesin: He's huge.
Laura: We're going to try to get in a building that's closer to the tower.
Matt: Okay. Seeming lasts for eight hours, so you're still under the guise of that illusion.
Sam: Although we don't--
Laura: -- need that anymore.
Taliesin: Well, we can look like cultists.
Sam: Keyleth, you said that there's no other undead around here, right? Maybe we shouldn't look like undead, then.
Taliesin: Can you shift what we look like without changing it?
Sam: I don't think I can shift it. No, you can't. That's a one-time thing.
Laura: Maybe just drop it and we'll be cultists.
Marisha: How many robes did we swipe?
Sam: We've got the one from the guy whose head we just crushed.
Matt: You would have four cloaks, because there's two you got from the outside at the ritual, and there's the one from the guy you killed when you got here. Well, technically, there was the two that you killed when you got there, but you didn't say you grabbed those. Oh, you did, you grabbed them off. So that's two, five, six. You have six cloaks.
Laura: Yeah, and then the one, the guy that we just killed in front of the --
Matt: That was included.
Sam: Me and Pike, she could be on my shoulders and we could share one cloak.
Laura: Yeah! That's good!
Travis: I have that Cloak of Smashing that Percy gave me.
Marisha: Totally 'Little Rascals' it! Oh, I love it!
Laura: Yeah, we'll just robe it up.
Matt: You guys all throw on the--
Ashley: I almost feel like it should be the other way around.
Sam: Oh, it absolutely should. (laughter)
Matt: Six cloaks, seven players. You guys are straight-up doing-- I am so proud of everything that has just happened. (laughter)
Sam: To make it look like our arms can reach the ends of the cloak-- are they sleeved cloaks?
Matt: Yes, they are.
Sam: I'm going to hold a flute and my sword. (laughing)
Liam: Mythcarver! You used Mythcarver to pull a Little Rascals!
Matt: "There will be no survivors!"
Taliesin: "The dread Pirate Roberts is here for your souls!"
Liam: Hey guys, it's the third time Scanlan has used Mythcarver! (laughter)
Marisha: That's a vestige right there!
Taliesin: It's gone from exalted to shamed.
Matt: It retracts into a dagger now.
Taliesin: Never happens. This never happens.
Matt: All right. In a hip montage, you pull out the various cloaks, assemble your materials, getting ready.
Taliesin: We are a bunch of assholes.
Matt: Scanlan hops on top of Pike, the cloak is placed over you. You get your sleeves ready, and you all walk out into the cold air of the Shadowfell, making your way towards the center of the city.
Marisha: Be cool. Be cool.
Liam: I'm also going to say, some time in the last several hours, I don't remember what the armor is set to, to necrotic.
Matt: I think you may have said that before you went in, just in case. I assumed that was the case.
Laura: I think that was already there, yeah.
Taliesin: And remember, if anyone looks at you, close one eye. Just be winking. Always be winking. Left eye.
Laura: Does everybody have their arms, that we've run into so far? Or are they missing an arm, too? An eye and an arm or just an eye?
Matt: It varies. Not everyone seems to be missing a hand, but most of them are missing an eye.
Laura: Okay.
Liam: You all look like my sister.
Marisha: You need to get your eyes checked, then. Your depth perception may be off.
Sam: All right, we go!
Matt: All right. You guys make your way up the street, following behind the few stragglers that you see trying to catch up with the rest of the groups of people that have filtered out of the buildings and made their way towards the center. You make your way through some of the side roads, following around, and you can see now that the closer you get to the city, the more the structures, the buildings here, are built in a spiral. The roads don't intersect at spokes, they all gradually curve in to the tower. If you're looking at it overhead, it looks like this large spiral into the tower, like a pinwheel. You follow the curvature of the road, which prevents you from seeing the end point, and as you begin to get close to some of the clusters of people that are walking with a brisk walk, but still walking towards the tower, you fall back a little bit to not draw any attention. As you're making your way there, you watch as two individuals hurry up that were a little bit behind you, and rush up to the side and are walking in pace. They glance over.
Marisha: Hoods forward.
Matt: One of them, who appears to be a younger man, probably 18, 19 or so, who's got this little patch of reddish brown chin fuzz and looks a little malnourished. He still has both eyes. He rushes up real fast, his hood pulling back a little bit, and he's looking around, excited but also with trepidation. "So it's happening, huh? It's really happening!"
Laura: I guess so.
Liam: It's fucking wild.
Laura: So exciting.
Sam: I'm so excited to be here!
Laura: Oh, don't.
Matt: Make a deception check.
Travis: Keep your mouth shut! Just keep your mouth shut!
Marisha: Just nod and smile.
Sam: 24.
Matt: He looks at you and goes, "Oh! I didn't know the Whispered One takes the special ones, too!"
Travis: Yep! Sure does!
Taliesin: What are you going to do after?
Matt: "I don't know."
Taliesin: Surely you've thought.
Matt: "I'm pretty low on the totem pole here. I'm just excited to be on the right side of history."
Laura: Ditto.
Liam: Fuck the normies.
Matt: "All right." And he rushes up past you guys to try and catch up.
Sam: So awkward.
Laura: I think he bought it. I think we played it really cool there, guys.
Marisha: I'm really bad at holding my eye shut for this long.
Taliesin: So are we close enough now that we can start this?
Matt: Not yet. You're about maybe 1,000 feet or so away.
Taliesin: I'm going to see if there's any structures that are within distance so that once they set up and start, I can get to them. Maybe we can perch.
Marisha: We only need to be so far out.
Taliesin: We can cover you from a roof.
Matt: Perception check, Percival.
Liam: Also wondering how we're doing in the gloom stalker department?
Matt: No one's seen you, currently. It seems that whatever piercing vision they have, it does not seem to pierce robes.
Laura: I want to keep an eye out for buildings, too.
Taliesin: 15.
Matt: Okay. Then you as well make a perception check.
Taliesin: Please.
Laura: 23.
Matt: 23. Okay. You glance about, and there are a lot of buildings here with vantage points. They're all similar heights. There are a few that are outliers, but most of them are one and a half to two stories, like a one story with an attic or an attic space, like a half-story. Or two stories. You do check a few that are third-story, and a lot of them are almost in steeple-like spires at the top. You start to notice there is a theme. A lot of the buildings closer to the tower are built in a similar theme as the tower itself. You begin to see the edges of the roofs curve up into their own spikes, and the further in you go, the more dangerous and unwelcoming the deeper inner cloister of Thar Amphala is to witness. You can see now certain people are climbing onto the roofs. They're getting up there, almost like they're preparing for some sort of a festival or a fireworks show.
Marisha: Like the Fourth of fucking July.
Laura: The aliens are coming and we're welcoming them.
Travis: Well, they're not wrong.
Matt: You notice, Vex... There's been no change in daylight or nightlight here. It's been this constant deep, dark gray gloom that hangs over the Shadowfell, unchanging, unshifting. There's a creeping brightness on the horizon that you feel rising.
Laura: We're getting ready to teleport.
Matt: And you watch as that creeping brightness forms a dome over your space, and then comes to a close over the top of the tower, and where once there was this gloomy skyscape, you now see what appears to be a brighter, clouded sky. The temperature grows a little colder, and you begin to see snowfall. Gentle snow begins to fall, and you watch as some of the cultists surrounding start reaching up and catching it in their hands.
Taliesin: Now, now!
Sam: We've still got to attack.
Marisha: It's totally taken us to Whitestone.
Sam: It's okay, we can still kill everybody.
Matt: Make a nature check.
Laura: We're in the north. There's a lot of places that snow. It could be Draconia. There's a lot of places that snow.
Liam: But it's Delilah Briarwood.
Marisha: 19.
Matt: You have no direct idea of where you are, but based on the weather that you left Whitestone in not too long ago, this isn't Whitestone or near Whitestone. The weather patterns are a little more classic snow.
Laura: Is it winter in Wildemount right now?
Matt: It's the tail end of winter in a few places.
Liam: Tower still needs to come down.
Sam: Let's go. Let's move. Let's attack. Are we within 500 feet?
Matt: You guys are about now within 500 feet.
Laura: Fucking get into the building that we can, and then start it.
Marisha: Pike and I huddle together and try and join forces.
Ashley: Let's do it.
Marisha: Let's do it.
Matt: As you guys are holding hands, a voice begins to ring out. Omnipresent. Directionless, like it's being positioned directly into the minds of each of you from wherever it stands. It's an unfamiliar voice. The words creep and curl in, like they've always been resting, and now is the moment is for them to reveal themselves. "I would ask you to listen before you make a fool of yourselves. I've watched you since you stepped into my domain, and I'm not going to lie, it's been entertaining. I admire your gumption. It reminds me of others who have tried what you are trying. But they're dead now, so I leave the choice to you. You can either walk away, or you can join me, or you will die, and join me anyway."
Laura: Eff that shit. Just do it.
Liam: No one walks away.
Marisha: People don't tell us to stop if they're not afraid of what we're doing.
Taliesin: To the end.
Laura: To the end.
Sam: To the end.
Taliesin: Yeah, let's just pretend that's not really happening.
Laura: Do it.
Marisha: I love you all. We do it, above the screaming, howling Horror Nights sound effects.
Taliesin: I pull Silence.
Matt: All right. As you guys clasp hands, and begin the intricate incantation for the Earthquake spell, you can hear the cheers of people on the rooftops. They're standing up now, and they're all shouting, "Yes! Yes, I hear you!" You get the sense that perhaps you weren't the only ones that have been spoken to, although the conversations may differ from individual to individual. As you guys complete your incantation, you watch as the dust begins to rise around the base. You see Entropis begin to quiver back and forth, and you watch as everyone begins to rush to the edge of the rooftops, then rush into the streets to look up, their hands raised to the sky, not sure what this means, but basking in whatever glory this next sign or omen is to be. You watch as a loud, shattering crack sound hits, and you watch as one large, snaking, carving line begins to work its way up one side of the tower. Up another. And the collective gasp of hundreds of voices across the city seem to echo, (gasps). You watch as one side buckles, and the tower begins to slowly (rumble) to the ground.
Sam: Is it falling towards us?
Matt: It's falling not towards you.
Ashley: We thought of that.
Matt: But not the entire tower.
Taliesin: Fuck.
Matt: You glance up and watch as the very apex, the three-clawed top of the tower, is just there, in the sky, held aloft, unmoving, as the rest of the tower seems to have (rumble) broken away, and as it falls, this slow, terrifying collapse, you hear the rumbling of broken stone slamming into earth as clouds of smoke, dust, and dead earth are kicked up from the impact of this falling tower, completely enswirling the center of the city with debris and darkness. You watch as cultists go running now, their faces filled with fear and confusion at what this suddenly means, what's happening. As the dust washes past you, it gives this haze over the sky, and slowly comes to fade. You all, taking in what's happening, watch as that one apex of the spire slowly makes its way down to the surface of wherever you are on top of the rubble that once stood as Entropis.
Marisha: It kind of worked.
Sam: I mean, it wasn't bad.
Marisha: It brought it down. Did anyone of significance die in the process?
Matt: You can only assume.
Laura: Can we see who it is?
Matt: You're too far away. You're 500 feet away from this.
Sam: Let's go.
Laura: Let's go.
Taliesin: Broom.
Travis: We're going up to it or waiting till it comes down all the way?
Sam: Oh, I mean, it's landing, right?
Matt: It's landed. It settled itself. It's kind of cocked to one side. For it to land in the rubble, it's not a perfect platform, it (rumble) and comes to rest at a very faint angle among the ruined, broken, jagged obsidian pile. It's a thousand million flecked arrowheads all jumbled in this broken glass-like landscape of destroyed tower, and there, the very zenith of this once-grand structure sits resting, waiting.
Taliesin: Let's do this.
Sam: Do we have an escape plan?
Travis: Kill everything.
Marisha: I can Plane Shift us if things get really bad, but I kind of think we're already on our plane.
Laura: This sounds like we're all going to die!
Sam: Sure does.
Ashley: All right, guys, we're going to do this. We're going to do this.
Liam: Start walking.
Taliesin: The minute I grab onto your broom, you can't hear anything, so I'm just going to ride it down to the ground and then let go.
Laura: Okay.
Travis: Well, I'm done playing, so I'm going to take the Titan Stone Knuckles and smash them together and cast Enlarge on myself.
Matt: Your cloak tears around your body, Incredible Hulk style as your form ruins what remains of the black, sheared fabric that once, even by the stretch of the imagination, pseudo-hid you, now...
Travis: A bib remains.
Matt: Exactly. It's almost like one of those Chippendale neckpieces. What you see is a number of cultists that were running away from the tower stop and see this, and then, almost instinctually, go to defend. Make an intimidation check.
Travis: Should've raged. That's not terrible. 24.
Matt: And go scattering in other directions. You see some are rushing towards the tower to see what happened, to see if anyone's okay. There are a lot of cultists that were crushed, you imagine, on that side of the city, especially since they were clustering at the base for whatever this was. But many more are still out in the streets as you guys walk (footsteps), making your way towards the central tower.
Laura: I take off the robes. Get ready. Slow motion walk towards the tower.
Matt: You make your way down the ruined city streets of Thar Amphala. Amongst the snowfall that's now beginning to gather on the tops of your heads and your shoulders and your wings, and along the sides of the street that hadn't seen snowfall, probably ever. You make your way past the final boundary buildings, the cultists just letting you pass, looks of fear, looks of excitement, looks of knowing, looks of understanding that you probably walk to your deaths and I want to watch this happen. You begin to step over the rubble, your footfalls finding the grinding, high-pitched cracks of broken glass-like obsidian beneath your feet. There you look up, and can see about 25 or 30 feet of the tower top is resting at an angle. You can't see what's up on top of it. No windows. How do you wish to proceed?
Liam: We're not sneaking up on shit.
Laura: Well, no. They know we're here.
Travis: Circle? Flank? All together? Which one?
Taliesin: Powerhouses together. Distance fighters keep their distance. I'll take the carpet if it's available.
Laura: Surround the tower, climb up each side?
Travis: I would.
Taliesin: I'm going to grab the carpet. Anybody who wants a lift up, feel free.
Travis: I will take that ride.
Laura: I'll broom it.
Ashley: I'll hop up on the carpet.
Taliesin: Carpet's full.
Matt: As you guys are getting yourselves prepared, that voice returns to you, echoing through your minds once again. "I am genuinely impressed. I'm excited. And I would like for you to remain to watch my ascension, but far be it for me to rob anyone of a fine death, so come. Come, and be the next sacrifice for the new age."
Laura: You're a dipshit!
Travis: Eloquence personified.
Matt: So, via broom...
Sam: We have to fly to get up to it?
Laura: It's 35 feet up, so.
Marisha: To the top of the tower?
Travis: Platform, whatever you want to call it.
Liam: I'm going to shoot up and past by quite a bit.
Marisha: Can I hop on a carpet or broom?
Laura: You can hop on my broom.
Taliesin: I was about to say, carpet's a bit full.
Marisha: I'll hop on the broom with Vex.
Sam: I need a ride as well.
Taliesin: Once I'm up, I'm going to scatter.
Sam: Do you want me to be a beholder? Or a dragon?
Marisha: Beholder has the anti-magic cone eye situation. Just wait and see.
Sam: Wait and see? Figured I should do it now.
Taliesin: How long can you maintain a beholder?
Marisha: How long does it last to cast?
Sam: It's instantaneous.
Taliesin: Oh, then wait until the moment that it's necessary.
Sam: But he could Counterspell it unless I do it now.
Laura: I don't know if he's actually here yet.
Matt: Help me put this down right... There.
Ashley: That's awesome.
Laura: I feel like whenever we come across a map, I feel like we walked into his hand, exactly where he wanted us.
Travis: Let's also talk about the fact that it's been years since we've been this close to a map.
Matt: This is also true.
Taliesin: That is true.
Matt: Please. Indulge me where you're coming in from. And these resemble the three curved spires.
Travis: Those ideally go like that above it, right?
Matt: Yeah, they curve upward and stop about there.
Taliesin: So they're not platform-y.
Matt: No. They come to a point.
Taliesin: I'm hiding behind this glowing spire. I'm going to take some cover behind.
Matt: You rush. We're looking for landing placement, here. This'll come into play, here. Grog, where are you going?
Travis: I'll go right there.
Matt: Right there.
Laura: Me and Keyleth-- do you want to land over here?
Marisha: That's fine. Yeah, I follow your lead.
Laura: As soon as I land, I bamf Trinket out.
Matt: Vax.
Liam: I'm going to say that I'm about 80 feet in the air, just off-center. Towards Vex and Keyleth, but just off-center.
Laura: Keep a distance, don't be in a line with us.
Liam: I'm going to say I'm there, straight up.
Matt: There you are, Vax, right there.
Travis: The minis look so cool!
Taliesin: I haven't seen them in so long.
Travis: I know, we've been so far away!
Taliesin: Who's left? Pike?
Matt: Pike and Scanlan. Because you took the carpet, you're going to have to be near Grog for where you guys land. Going to be the circumstance there. Percy, you just run up the side to get there?
Taliesin: No, I was on the carpet and hopped and left them because they had to go pick up.
Matt: If that's the case, then I'll say that you're landing.
Taliesin: No, they had to go get Scanlan--
Matt: Oh, you had to go get Scanlan?
Taliesin: It's 35 feet.
Matt: If you guys had leave Scanlan behind, that's a whole different thing.
Sam: No, I think I'm going to just go ahead and be a beholder and fly in there myself.
Taliesin: Okay, that'll work.
Matt: Okay!
Travis: Wow! Okay! All right! YOLO, why the fuck not?
Taliesin: If you'd be so kind, throw me here, then.
Liam: Someday, we could have a game with two beholders on our side.
Marisha: It's true! But not today.
Matt: That's Scanlan. (laughter)
Taliesin: I like that you found a goofy-looking beholder. (goofy voice) Hi!
Ashley: Hey, you guys!
Marisha: Hey, you guys!
Matt: As you guys arrive, the floor is just surrounded in bodies. Cultists of very ornate robes. Mostly you've seen peon-based: black splatters of sackcloth, what was available.
Laura: They've been peed on?!
Matt: No. these are well-adorned and appear to have been very well-regarded within the Remnants. You also see, on this side, what appears to be-- sorry, on this side would be Delilah Briarwood.
Laura: Bitchface Briarwood.
Marisha: Bitchface Briarwood!
Matt: On this side, you see what appears to be a black, armored, massive, not quite goliath-sized, but a thick, dark black knight of jagged dark metal armor, what appears to be a longsword that emanates this dark energy, and floating above--
Taliesin: Oh, balls.
Laura: Oh no, what's flying?
Ashley: Put it away.
Laura: No, I don't need it!
Liam: Those are my platforms, I can take them back anytime I want!
Laura: Oh no! What is that?
Matt: You see a man, though the flesh is pulled tight against a skeletal frame. You see long, red and purple and black robes that are tattered and drift below the breeze and cold gently blowing by. You see a field of crackling energy just bursting around the outskirts of his form. You see one hand is out, in a welcoming position, while the empty wrist that once contained a hand is now open on the other side. You see the bald, hairless head, which is covered in spots and tugged open, bits of flesh that have curled away from rotten decay. You see the cheeks sunken in where the skeletal teeth are now emblazoned in a terrible grin. You see the right eye, and the gaping hole where a bright green, bursting, flaming vacuous void where an eye once was now drifts off a trail behind it. You see there, reborn before you, the Whispered One, the Undying King. Vecna himself.
Travis: Oh god, we're in it!
Taliesin: I don't like it being this close.
Sam: We'll probably all die.
Matt: I would like you all to roll initiative. (screaming)
Travis: No!
Sam: Matthew Mercer, may I borrow your Monster Manual so I know what I am?
Matt: Marisha actually has a page for it, if you want that.
Marisha: I do have a page. Do you want my beholder page?
Sam: Yeah!
Taliesin: That's terrible.
Marisha: That's terrible for me, too.
Laura: My teeth hurt.
Matt: My teeth hurt?!
Taliesin: That's terrible. I'm not okay with that roll.
Marisha: Oh, give me that back page. Sorry.
Taliesin: Back page.
Sam: It doesn't say what his initiative is.
Taliesin: You have to roll. It's a dex modifier plus a d20 if you don't have initiative?
Matt: What's that?
Taliesin: Your initiative is normal.
Matt: Your initiative is whatever the creature's initiative is, which is its dex modifier.
Sam: Okay. All right.
Taliesin: Plus a d20.
Sam: 11.
Liam: When was the last time we went to bed?
Laura: I mean, it's a normal amount of time.
Liam: No, I mean, like, right before coming? I can't remember the last time we had a full rest.
Matt: A full rest would have been maybe four or five hours ago.
Liam: Okay. I think I have all my Lucks. That's why I'm asking.
Taliesin: I don't think you've burned since we've come through.
Liam: Not 100% sure.
Marisha: I also gave you advantage on everything.
Liam: I know it! Girl!
Marisha: I think you didn't use anything.
Matt: Initiative order. 25 to 20?
Travis: 20. Shit.
Matt: Fuck, guys. Guys.
Travis: Me?! Okay.
Laura: I have no plan!
Ashley: We're fully Leeroy Jenkins-ing.
Laura: Fully. Leeroy Jenkins!
Matt: Grog, what's your dex?
Travis: My dexterity? 15.
Matt: Okay. Technically, you rolled the same initiative as the death knight, so he'll go right after you.
Travis: Okay. The death knight, by the way, is what Colonel Arnold Fuck is.
Matt: 20 to 15.
Liam: 16.
Laura: 18.
Ashley: 17.
Laura: Ooh, nice!
Matt: You had 18, 17.
Liam: 16. Sylas, broomstick-up-his-ass, death knight Briarwood.
Sam: 11.
Taliesin: 13.
Laura: This first round is definitely a surprise attack on them, right?
Matt: Oh yeah! Totally!
Marisha: Seven.
Taliesin: They did not see this shit coming. At all.
Matt: All righty. So.
Marisha: I had so much hope when we took down their tower. It went away very quickly.
Taliesin: It did, but I think that probably made a lot of cultists go away.
Liam: Guys, we've got to start the new campaign sometime.
Matt: Okay. Beginning of the round.
Marisha: We all die.
Taliesin: I cast Game Over. 20th-level spell.
Matt: So many options. (groaning)
Taliesin: Fuck you.
Liam: We're going to die. Yep!
Travis: Obviously, we're not at the top of the round.
Matt: Okay, so. Vecna, as he stands there, seeing the beholder arrive over the edge, seeing the paladin in the sky, seeing the rest of these individuals cluster in, goes, "Very well. I wanted to talk more. Please, sit." I need Scanlan, Vax, Grog, Keyleth, and Vex to all make wisdom saving throws, please.
Travis: Fuck!
Marisha: Ugh, should have done that fucking Feast!
Laura: We knew we were going to say it.
Sam: Shit, I'm gonna lose my fucking 9th-level spell.
Ashley: Not necessarily!
Marisha: 13.
Travis: Oh fuck, yeah. A natural 19.
Laura: I have a feeling I have to roll really high against fucking Vecna!
Taliesin: Do you have a Luck?
Laura: Oh yeah, Tary had Luck, not Scanlan.
Sam: Neither have Luck. I'm a beholder.
Taliesin: No, you have all of your other stuff.
Sam: Are you sure about that?
Marisha: Is it like Shapechange?
Sam: This is True Polymorph. I am this creature.
Marisha: Oh, it's True Polymorph.
Matt: He is that creature.
Liam: That's hot.
Sam: Except it's not, because I'm about to not be anymore.
Laura: Because he's going to cancel it.
Matt: So.
Sam: 18.
Liam: God damn it.
Travis: Oh, Jesus.
Marisha: 27.
Matt: You resist.
Liam: 18.
Laura: Oh god, you have to roll so high in order to resist.
Sam: Even with advantage? Oh, fuck.
Travis: 19.
Marisha: They roll disadvantage against you, too.
Taliesin: Oh, you didn't say me.
Laura: You skipped me. And I rolled a 20.
Marisha: You rolled a 20?
Matt: You feel the force of his magical prowess coalesce like a cold vise on your brain, and your body seizes, holding taut. And you're all held. You fall straight down 80 feet.
Marisha: Oh, no.
Travis: (nervous laughter) Oh, fuck! Oh man!
Marisha: None of us can do anything to help him?
Laura: We slow-motion walked into our own death.
Travis: Oh, shit!
Sam: Is Pike out?
Matt: Take 32 points of bludgeoning damage, Vax. And you are-- Oh god!
Laura: Walls brought down.
Matt: Prone, there.
Marisha: Fucking shit.
Matt: The rest of you are also held.
Travis: Is this charmed or frightened?
Matt: No.
Travis: Okay, it's not.
Laura: What does being held mean?
Liam: It's paralysis.
Taliesin: Until we save, or until his concentration is broken, I assume.
Matt: Correct.
Travis: And rage would have no effect on this?
Matt: Nope!
Travis: Fucking shit.
Matt: And he's going to go ahead and shift up about 20 more feet and kind of glance over the battlefield a bit.
Sam: He's a god! He's a golden god!
Travis: He actually is one. And he won't jump off a 1000-foot cliff.
Matt: (chuckles) Apparently. All right.
Laura: T minus ten minutes until he turns into a goldfish.
Marisha: We can only be so hopeful.
Laura: That's plenty of time for us to die.
Matt: That ends his turn. Delilah's now going to go.
Travis: Oh, good!
Laura: Oh, good!
Travis: Wow, what a way to lead off the round!
Sam: My anti-magic cone is not in effect, I assume?
Taliesin: Actually, isn't it just naturally wherever they're looking?
Matt: It's wherever you're facing, but he hasn't had a turn to go yet, he basically just arrived.
Taliesin: Oh, okay.
Matt: So it would be kind of in this path here, wherever you would have come in in this regard. So it would be this direction.
Liam: It's a big fuckin' headlamp.
Sam: (laughs) Just frozen there. I really want to swallow and I can't close--
Taliesin: I was under the impression that the eyeball was passive.
Matt: I'm checking right now, actually.
Sam: Well, you have to choose. At the start of each turn--
Matt: At the start of its turn, which way the cone faces and whether the cone is active.
Sam: I haven't had a turn.
Marisha: And if it's active?
Taliesin: You're holding your action for being able to move.
Matt: Anyway.
Travis: Hey, so... (laughs)
Sam: We got this, guys. How many of us are still able to move?
Matt: Three of you.
Sam: Hey! Okay!
Travis: Looking up! Things are looking up. He has 12 hit points, by the way.
Marisha: Being held. What's the deal with that?
Matt: You're paralyzed. Which means you are incapacitated, you automatically fail strength and dexterity saving throws, attack rolls against you have advantage, and any creature that hits you within five feet, it's a critical hit.
Travis: Basically worst scenario possible. That's all you had to say: worst scenario possible.
Taliesin: It could be worse, but it would take math. This is bad.
Sam: Pike's going to solve everything.
Ashley: Oh, yeah.
Sam: Yeah, she can get us out of this.
Liam: Flipping those pages.
Travis: Remember this look, boys and girls. On Matt's face. As the chef carefully picks the menu of our-- Yes.
Laura: Of our destruction? Of our doom?
Taliesin: He has been grooming us and fattening us up for two years.
Matt: Delilah is going to move.
Sam: Oh no, lair action, she explodes. (laughter)
Matt: And is going to step over Vax's body on the ground.
Marisha: Oh, bitch! You better back off, bitch!
Laura: Hope you're wearing underwear, bitch, because he just looked up your skirt!
Matt: And looks at you.
Laura: (small voice) Me?
Matt: It's been a while, my dear. (yelling)
Laura: No! Why would you do this?! How you do dis Matt?!
Matt: Yep, so make a constitution saving throw.
Laura: No!
Matt: You're held, but you still make a constitution roll.
Marisha: Come on...
Ashley: Matt, how do you do this?!
Travis: Come on.
Marisha: Not again.
Laura: Natural 20! (cheering)
Matt: No way!
Liam: And I said, biiiiitch.
Matt: So you take half as much damage, which is good.
Marisha: Oh my god.
Laura: Oh, I'm really glad we healed.
Liam: Vax on the ground just starts going (unintelligible yells).
Matt: All right, so instead of 61 points of necrotic damage, you take 30 points of necrotic damage.
Liam: I'm shaking, guys.
Taliesin: Leroy!
Travis: Oh my god.
Liam: Got to squeeze my spiky dice to wake up.
Laura: Ow, ow.
Matt: You okay?
Laura: (whimpering) I'm good.
Travis: Blood pressure's a thing right now.
Matt: That'll end her turn. Grog.
Liam: Holy shit, Grog.
Matt: Your turn happens at the same time the lair action happens.
Travis: And the Death Knight, right?
Matt: And the Death Knight. He's going to go directly after you. You guys going on the same turn, I gave you a little bit.
Taliesin: Oh man, I am not-- This does not feel good.
Travis: Oh, shit! Oh!
Matt: You watch as the bodies on the ground quiver (sound of bones cracking) And begin to rise up around you.
Sam: No, forget them! Fix us! Forget them, they're nothing. Fix us.
Laura: They could just attack us until we die.
Sam: Fix. Us. They're tiny.
Taliesin: I have a plan. I have a plan.
Sam: Fix us.
Travis: What, you're going to pledge your fealty to the fucking--
Sam: Some sort of-- I don't know, can you restore... Restoration?
Laura: Do you have mass Restoration?
Ashley: No!
Marisha: That's not a spell, you guys!
Ashley: I'm useless!
Marisha: I don't know if Pike can fix this!
Laura: I don't think she can fix it.
Ashley: Let's use it! Let's just make it, Matt, you can put that in your new campaign book. Mass Restoration.
Laura: Mass Anti-hold.
Matt: And this will be there. So they all rise up out of the ground, these basic skeletons, and they all get one attack. So against Percy, this one moves in. Rolls a natural one, misses entirely. One of them's going to strike at the beholder that's up in the air; that's going to be a 15, what's your armor class?
Sam: 18.
Matt: 18. Just ricochets off the armor. There's one here that's going to go toward Pike. And you're not held, right? You resisted it. So it's going to go ahead and make a strike on you; that's another 15. Just hits your armor and scrapes off, no effect. This one's going to rush forward, two against Vax on the ground. It has advantage. That's a 19.
Liam: To do what?
Matt: To attack you.
Liam: All right, so I'm at disadvantage, but I have advantage, so it would be one straight roll?
Matt: No, it has advantage against you because you're paralyzed, so yeah, it would be one straight roll. The first roll was 19.
Liam: Oh, so no.
Matt: No. Your armor class is 21 naturally?
Liam: It is 21 when the daggers are out, and my daggers are in my hands. I mean, I don't know, this is kinda loosey-goosey. All right, then I'm at 20.
Matt: Yeah, so it still misses you. The other one, no, misses. Both of them just miss you. The effect of the 9th-level spell is just enough of a vibration that the attacks are being-- You're moving just, (grunts) ever so faintly out of the way.
Liam: Familiar.
Matt: One attacking Keyleth. That is a 24.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: So you suffer eight points of slashing damage. And then Vex, that is a 12 to hit? And a 20 to hit. Neither hit? So as they're striking you, they're hitting the armor, it's just not cutting through. They can't seem to get through it. So that worked out okay in your favor.
Laura: Thanks, dragon armor!
Matt: Grog? You're paralyzed.
Travis: Uh-huh.
Matt: I believe you make another saving throw at the end of your turn to try and shrug off the effect.
Travis: Can I go into a paralyzed rage?
Matt: Nope. But make a wisdom saving throw.
Laura: God, we've got to roll like a 27 in order to break it!
Travis: 12.
Matt: Nope. You're still locked in place, unable to move.
Sam: I will never be able to break it.
Laura: A 20 didn't break it, so yeah.
Sam: Yeah, there's no way.
Matt: A natural 20 would break it.
Laura: A natural 20.
Marisha: A natural 20 would break it, that's the only thing?
Travis: I have a modifier of zero, so.
Laura: Yeah.
Liam: Gotta fucking attack that bitch.
Travis: Holy shit.
Matt: Actually, you know what? No. He's gonna stay back there and move this way to get out of the way.
Liam: Fuck you, Sylas.
Matt: As the Death Knight kinda steps over to the side, you watch as this small sphere of darkness begins to (crackling sound) into his hand, and then throws it with an arc, in a 20-foot radius centered on a point that it chooses.
Sam: That's rough stuff.
Travis: You're a beholder, do you get legendary actions and resistances and shit?
Sam: I don't think-- I don't know.
Matt: It's legendary resistances, not actions.
Sam: What's a legendary resistance?
Matt: You get to reroll-- Unless it doesn't have it.
Sam: This doesn't.
Matt: No, the beholder does not. It's not that powerful. All right, I need Pike, Grog--it's a dexterity saving throw. So Grog and Scanlan automatically fail. Percival and Pike, I need you both to make dexterity saving throws, please.
Ashley: Okay. Oh, fuck.
Taliesin: Yeah. 20.
Ashley: (brightly) Six!
Laura: Wait! Oh, I thought that was ten.
Taliesin: I have advantage also, against--
Matt: Right. You take a total of 35 points of fire and necrotic damage. You take 35 points of necrotic damage, and because you're resistant to fire, you only take 17 points of fire damage. 35 points.
Ashley: Did you say 17, Matt?
Matt: 17, yes.
Matt: Scanlan? And Grog. You both take-- Actually no, since you have resistance to fire-- Which actually, your form is, I should give you the large form.
Sam: I added wrong. Wait, wait! Stop everything.
Matt: Yes? What're you stoppin'?
Sam: I added wrong. My saving throw was a 23.
Matt: Was a 23?
Laura: On being held?
Matt: On being held? Still fails.
Sam: Oh!
Travis: Yeah, you did a 24, right?
Marisha: I rolled like a 27.
Laura: She rolled a 27.
Travis: 27, yeah. We gotta go!
Laura: There's nowhere-- We're gonna die.
Sam: So what did I just get hit with? 70 points or something?
Matt: You took 70 points of fire and necrotic damage.
Sam: Awesome.
Taliesin: Do you have resistance to any of that?
Matt: Not as a beholder, no. Okay, that ends the Death Knight's turn.
Travis: I mean, he's just dunking on us.
Taliesin: Well, they're top-loading. They're top-loading.
Matt: Vex. Go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw.
Travis: Crotch in face.
Matt: That's cocked, roll again.
Laura: 21.
Matt: Nope, still locked in place.
Travis: Oh, for the wisdom save?
Matt: Pike.
Ashley: Okay. All right, I'm going to touch Grog and cast Lesser Restoration.
Matt: Okay, which cures...?
Ashley: Paralysis.
Matt: Then, yeah.
Ashley: Okay. So I've just got to run around.
Matt: Grog, you are cured of paralysis.
Travis: Okay.
Sam: Do that a lot.
Matt: You feel your form freed of the effect of the spell. Do you want to move?
Ashley: How many undead are there?
Matt: There are one, two, three, four, five over there.
Ashley: Okay.
Matt: You already used your action to cast a spell, so.
Ashley: Yeah. So, as my bonus action, I'm going to cast Shield of Faith on Percy.
Matt: Okay.
Ashley: Which will just add two to your AC.
Taliesin: Oh, thank you!
Matt: What level is Shield of Faith?
Ashley: First level.
Matt: Okay, yeah. So there you go. Just mark that for yourself.
Taliesin: Oh, it's on!
Matt: All righty. Do you want to move, or are you going to stay where you are, Pike?
Taliesin: You've got a Death Knight, if you're feeling frisky.
Travis: Do you want to move or stay where you are?
Ashley: Okay. Sorry. I'm going to hide behind the beholder.
Matt: Okay, so you move around Grog and get right about there. That ends your turn, Pike. Vax, make a wisdom saving throw.
Liam: I'm going to attempt to roll a natural 20.
Marisha: You have advantage on everything.
Liam: I know.
Marisha: That's good. That's okay.
Liam: It's not a natural 20, though, which is what it's going to take. I'm going to use Luck.
Marisha: Oh my god, you rolled a 19.
Liam: 18 and a 19.
Sam: Plus anything?
Liam: Plus two. Gets me to 21. I need a natural 20. Luck. No. Okay.
Matt: That ends your turn, Vax. Percival.
Taliesin: I'm going to scoot against the wall towards myself as far as a reasonable amount of movement will take me because I don't like clumping. I'm going to take aim at the asshole in the sky, and let's do a couple of things. I'm going to take Bad News out, and just to keep everything reasonable, I'm going to burn a point for dead-eye, and I'm going to take a sharpshooter shot on him.
Matt: Okay, so minus five to the attack roll.
Taliesin: Minus five to the attack. That's a crit! That's a crit.
Matt: You rolled a 19, yeah, which you have now at level 18.
Taliesin: At level 18, that's a crit.
Matt: This is with which gun?
Taliesin: This is with Bad News, so that's going to be 2d12. That's going to be 4d12 plus six.
Matt: This is Bad News, you said?
Taliesin: Bad News. I don't know if this also doubles-- I don't think it does-- but I'm pouring all of Cabal's Ruin into this shit, too.
Matt: Go ahead and roll the Cabal's Ruin damage. The actual hit from Bad News does nothing.
Taliesin: Oh, really?
Matt: The non-enchanted attack from Bad News hits and dissipates across his form. It's not half damage. Nothing. This is Vecna. Cabal's Ruin is considered magical damage, so that will go through.
Marisha: Was that the one you critted on?
Taliesin: Yeah, I burned a crit.
Matt: You gained the grit back, though.
Taliesin: The grit's not burned, so that's nice. These don't double, do they?
Matt: No. Wait, technically, they would. Technically, they do, because it is a crit. All dice double, yeah.
Ashley: Get him!
Taliesin: Does my other rule also apply to this? Does this add to bleed damage now? Maybe not.
Matt: I don't think so, because it's an outside effect.
Taliesin: It's an outside factor. That's fine. I'm with you.
Matt: No, you know what? It would because just like any other critical effect, yes, it would.
Taliesin: Okay.
Matt: It would.
Taliesin: (counting) 32. That's 32.
Marisha: Did you count that one?
Taliesin: 36 points of damage, times two.
Laura: 72.
Matt: 72.
Taliesin: 72 points of electrical damage, and then he's also going to get a bleed of 31. No, he's going to get a bleed of 15.
Matt: He will get 15 because he's resistant to lightning, so he takes half of that next time.
Taliesin: But he still has to roll concentration.
Matt: Yeah, for 36.
Taliesin: I'll take it, and goodbye, Cabal. I'll gain more when he hits me with some magic shit.
Sam: Oh boy.
Laura: It's such an anti-climactic fight because none of us can do anything.
Matt: That would be 18 as half that. DC is 18 to maintain concentration. Yeah, he saves.
Taliesin: God fucking damn it!
Matt: Barely. By one.
Travis: By one?
Matt: By one.
Laura: On concentration?
Taliesin: Damn it. I was debating whether or not to hit him with Hex, and now I'm so sad I didn't. Oh, well. That's okay. I'm reloading, and I'm going to take another Bad News shot at Delilah. Where is she?
Matt: She's over here.
Taliesin: What is she doing?
Matt: She just stepped over Vax's paralyzed body and threw a Finger of Death at Vex.
Taliesin: Okay. Let's burn that little bit of Animus again and burn that grit point again for advantage. Let's hit her with Bad News. Actually, I'll cast... Hex on her, as well, just for fun.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: And give her constitution disadvantage. Actually, let's give her, just in case she gets grappled-- let's make it constitution disadvantage. Fuck it.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: And then I've got bonus, and I'm doing sharpshooter again. Thank god I did because that was a terrible shot. That's 14.
Matt: 14 does not hit, unfortunately. As you go to fire--
Ashley: Do we know what would hit?
Taliesin: We don't.
Ashley: War God's Blessing to add ten?
Matt: Gives a plus ten?
Taliesin: Oh, that would definitely hit, I'd imagine.
Matt: You use War God's Blessing as a reaction onto Percy. As you go to fire, you feel the presence of Sarenrae coalesce around the blade, and you hear a little whisper over your shoulder say, "There." And all of a sudden, clarity comes into frame and (gunshot) you fire Bad News towards Delilah. Go ahead and roll damage on that. She's not even going to spend a Shield on that. It's way over her AC.
Taliesin: Not bad. That's (counting) 20 points of piercing damage and five points of necrotic damage.
Matt: (gunshot) It blasts, and you see the robe tear open on one side. She's like (cries out, breathes heavily).
Taliesin: That's my roll.
Matt: You glance over with the scope and see as she turns and looks at you. You can see, what you didn't see earlier, is one normal eye she has and one yellowish-green eye with a cat-slit pupil.
Taliesin: Shit.
Laura: What does that even mean?
Taliesin: Vecna's been busy. Okay. This is going to get interesting.
Matt: All right, that ends your turn, Percy.
Taliesin: That's all I can do.
Matt: Scanlan, go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw.
Sam: Nope.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: I can't move my eyes or anything or turn on my anti-magic?
Matt: As far as the ray that you have, the eye perspective, you're hitting right there, so you're just out of range to get rid of the paralysis from Vex and off Vax. If you manage to break from this somehow and you rotate, the spell would have no effect while it's on them.
Marisha: They're broken from it by being in his gaze? Am I in his gaze?
Matt: No, you are not.
Marisha: So I can still cast spells. But if I move into his gaze, I cannot.
Matt: Correct. Or if you shoot something through the cone, it will dissipate.
Marisha: If I shoot up at Vecna, will it go through the cone?
Matt: Yeah, probably. You're just outside of it.
Marisha: I will not go through the cone?
Matt: Probably. You can angle it that way, yeah. Keyleth, what are you doing?
Marisha: It is now my turn.
Matt: Also, I need you to make a concentration check.
Sam: Oh, my spell.
Matt: Yeah, transformation.
Sam: I get advantage as a gnome.
Matt: You do. How much damage did you take on that one, total, from the blast? From the blast that you took on that.
Sam: 70 points.
Matt: You have to beat a 35.
Sam: Okay. As a wisdom?
Matt: That would have been concentration. Constitution saving throw.
Sam: Constitution saving throw.
Matt: In theory, Scanlan, before it came to your turn, you dropped your beholder form.
Sam: Oh! I'm no longer paralyzed.
Matt: The spell maintains itself.
Sam: No! But I'm a different guy!
Matt: It's your mind it affects.
Marisha: Why?
Matt: Any spell still carries over the effects on you. You can't wild shape and--
Marisha: He lost concentration?
Matt: He lost concentration on his big spell, yeah.
Sam: Hey, guys.
Laura: Hey, Scanlan!
Matt: I'll let you remake that saving throw with your constitution. Sorry, your wisdom. With Scanlan's wisdom.
Sam: Okay, do I get advantage because of magic?
Matt: Yes, because it is magic.
Sam: And can I inspire myself?
Matt: Yes, you can.
Sam: All right. I will inspire myself. 24.
Matt: 24 is just enough. (relieved laughter)
Matt: You shrug off the paralysis at the end of your turn. You're now free to move.
Sam: Just move. I can't act, right?
Matt: No, that's the end of your turn. Keyleth, what are you doing?
Marisha: Is he 60 feet away from me? Is he within range?
Matt: Who?
Marisha: Should I handle Delilah, or should I handle him?
Travis: What're you doing? Which one do you want?
Sam: I can move now, or just in general?
Matt: No, next turn you'll be able to move.
Marisha: Is he within 60 feet of me? Vecna.
Matt: You're not sure. You'd have to eyeball it.
Marisha: (counting) He's exactly 60 feet in the air. I have to get directly under his butthole. Can I get directly under his butthole?
Matt: You can move through Trinket. You'll get two attacks of opportunity from two skeletons.
Marisha: Jesus, balls.
Liam: Jesus balls.
Matt: You'd have to leapfrog over Trinket to get there, but you can do it.
Marisha: What about Delilah. Where is she?
Matt: Delilah's over here. She and two skeletons right now are lording over the paralyzed Vax on the ground.
Marisha: If I move at all, I'm going to take opportunity from skeletons.
Matt: Yep. They don't do a whole lot of damage, but damage adds up.
Marisha: Jesus. Okay, I am going to head to Delilah. I can move up to her, correct?
Matt: You're going to move straight up to her?
Marisha: Can I?
Matt: You can, yeah. Both skeletons get attacks of opportunity on you. That's a nine and a 12. They both hit you, but the mantle writhes out in front of you. You watch as various leaves unfurl almost like a cat's fur on the back of its neck, and it deflects the blows from the skeletons as you rush past.
Marisha: I can give her disadvantage on constitution checks, and whenever she takes damage, she's stunned, or should I do the confusion thing?
Taliesin: Either one. They're both good. Go for the first one. Pick one.
Marisha: I'm turning into Ashley Johnson. Okay.
Ashley: Okay!
Marisha: I'm going to go up to Delilah. (pants) Cotton mouth. Oh boy. Yeah. Okay, I'm going to go up to her and be like, experience what you've been putting all of us through. And I'm going to touch her and I'm going to try and cast Contagion on her with Mind Fire?
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Mind Fire!
Liam: Sounds good.
Taliesin: Hit her with a mind bullet.
Travis: Mind bullets!
Taliesin: That's telekinesis, Kyle!
Marisha: That's telekinesis, Kyle!
Travis: (singing) How about the power to move you?
Taliesin: (singing) How about the power to move you?
Marisha: (singing) How about the power to move you?
Matt: Make a melee spell attack.
Marisha: I have a bonus to my spell attacks.
Laura: You've got this!
Marisha: It's cocked. That's even worse. Not great. 18?
Matt: 18 is exactly what you needed. That's her armor class.
Liam: (singing) We'll fucking lead as two kings!
Travis: (laughing) Tenacious D for the rest of this fight, please.
Matt: She now is affected by Mind Fire.
Marisha: Her mind becomes feverish, and she has disadvantage on intelligence checks and intelligence saving throws, and she becomes confused.
Sam: What does that mean? What does confused mean?
Marisha: For seven days.
Liam: It sounds like she can't cast spells too well.
Marisha: Hopefully.
Matt: She's now considered confused. She's under the effects of the Confusion spell for as long as it lasts.
Taliesin: That's me under the effects of being confused about the Confusion spell.
Matt: Does that end your turn, Keyleth?
Taliesin: What do you have for a bonus?
Marisha: I don't have a lot for a bonus. I can go into an elemental form.
Travis: If we attack her, is that going to drop the confusion?
Taliesin: Yeah, can we attack her?
Marisha: No, it just lasts for seven days.
Matt: It lasts for seven days if she fails the saves. She has three saves in a row, and if she succeeds, it goes away. If she fails, it lasts for seven days.
Marisha: Okay. She has to make constitution saving throws. But she's under the effects right now, correct? We've been through this before, haven't we?
Laura: Oh, yeah. This is one of the ones we tried a long time ago.
Marisha: It says after failing three of these saving throws, the disease effects last for the duration, so that would make me assume that she has it at least for three rounds.
Matt: We had this discussion before, because in the ability, it has Slimy Doom, which whenever it takes damage, it becomes stunned, which is the most broken--
Marisha: I almost did that.
Matt: I know, but I think the DND ruling, technically, they have to fail three saves before it affects them.
Marisha: But it's a 5th-level fucking spell. That's a lot!
Matt: I know.
Marisha: That's lame. Three rounds for a 5th-level spell?
Matt: Look. I'll say this. I'll let Mind Fire work on her for now.
Marisha: Oh, he doesn't look happy. I feel like I just pissed off the DM.
Matt: No, you didn't piss off the DM. This spell has a lot of contention in the community, but the official DND ruling was it doesn't affect until they fail all three rolls, but as it's written, it doesn't say that. It says they're afflicted on being hit, so I'm letting it go through because you didn't choose the cheesy-ass stun-lock broken spell.
Marisha: It does say that after succeeding on three of these, the creature recovers from the disease, so they were already affected.
Matt: Which is what I'm saying. This is between what's written in the spell and the arguments that people have made with DND on Twitter, and they clarified that's not how it works. It's a mis-type. It wasn't clear. I'm letting it work. Be happy with the book.
Laura: Stop making eye contact. Look down!
Matt: At the end of your turn, Vecna's going to use some legendary actions to cast a spell. (groaning)
Travis: How about you just say he did, and don't?
Ashley: Yeah. Let's not and say we did.
Liam: He could just evil monologue a little bit, tell us his plan?
Laura: He's really good at evil monologuing.
Taliesin: We were talking about how much you wanted a monologue. I really feel like this is the moment.
Matt: He's going to cast a 7th-level Fireball right there.
Travis: 7th-level Fireball?
Taliesin: That's the end of Vax.
Travis: We've got to go.
Matt: I need Keyleth, Vax-- you don't auto-save, yeah.
Liam: Good night.
Travis: Maybe the Raven Queen will use you or something.
Liam: I can't. It's an automatic fail because I'm paralyzed.
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: That's actually good. He'll lose the paralysis because he'll be in a coma. We'll just wake you back up and you'll be fine. It's actually kind of good.
Matt: Keyleth, I need you to make a dexterity saving throw, please. The skeletons are obliterated.
Marisha: That's a natural one.
Travis: Are you serious?! Are you serious?
Taliesin: I'm looking at it.
Matt: That's a surprisingly shitty roll. 38 points of fire damage to Vax. 38.
Travis: On a 7th-level Fireball?
Matt: I know. I rolled really shitty.
Marisha: 38?
Matt: 38 to you, as well. 38 to Vex. And 38 to Trinket.
Taliesin: That's a small-- that's a dire armadillo. That's okay.
Laura: 38 to Trinket?
Travis: Did Delilah take all that damage, too?
Matt: Delilah? Yeah, she did. She can't save against his shit. She takes it and (grunts).
Liam: She probably kind of likes it.
Laura: She's like, ooh.
Taliesin: Burn. Sick burn.
Matt: It made sense for the circumstance. She's up for the sacrifice. All righty, that ends Keyleth's turn. Top of the round. Now it's Vecna's go.
Travis: I thought that was Vecna's go.
Laura: That was his legendary.
Travis: Oh god.
Laura: I like that you have an enlarged figure Grog. That's cool.
Travis: I thought you were complimenting the DM. I was like, yeah, keep it up.
Laura: I like that you made an enlarged figure for Grog.
Sam: I'll kill you last.
Laura: Oh my god, this map is so pretty. (laughter)
Sam: What is that thing in the middle of the field?
Matt: This is the altar.
Laura: Whatever it is, it's really cool.
Ashley: Can we see what's in it?
Matt: You'd have to go check it out, if there was anything.
Marisha: Is he moving towards the altar?
Matt: He's shifting in the center and looking down for a bit. He goes, "Well, sleep."
Taliesin: Can he do that with concentration?
Matt: This is not a concentration spell.
Laura: Magic can't put me to sleep.
Matt: He casts Power Word Kill.
Sam: Oh. Well, that's different.
Liam: Where did Sleep go?
Matt: That's just what he said.
Sam: He meant metaphorical. He meant death.
Matt: You utter a word of power that can compel one creature you see within range to die instantly. If the creature you chose has 100 hit points or fewer, it dies. How many hit points do you have?
Laura: I'm dead. Insta-full death?
Matt: Insta-full death.
Marisha: No saving from it?
Matt: No.
Ashley: Wait, what?
Taliesin: What?
Sam: Perma-death?
Matt: No death saving throws. You watch as the life suddenly fades from Vex's eyes, and she falls to the ground.
Liam: Vax is watching, frozen.
Travis: Oh my god.
Laura: Hey, don't compliment the map, you guys. Matt really doesn't like it.
Matt: I'm sorry. It's now Delilah's turn.
Taliesin: This is not going well.
Sam: Maybe we should leave.
Travis: Plane Shift?
Matt: She turns and looks at you, Keyleth, and goes--
Sam: Is this Delilah?
Matt: This is Delilah. "You took him from me. Now I'm going to take him from you." She points down.
Sam: I thought she was confused.
Matt: I have to check what she does now. This may make the change.
Liam: Well, we weren't technically dating when we killed her, so I'm not really sure if she'd know.
Matt: I get to roll a d10.
Marisha: Let's hope he doesn't roll a nine or a ten, y'all.
Matt: A ten.
Marisha: You are fucking lying to me! (groans)
Matt: It's right there.
Travis: Yeah, I see it.
Taliesin: Oh shit. Wow, you really went down.
Matt: I'm sorry. I'm rolling really well. I'm sorry, guys.
Liam: Yeah, but that Fireball was super low.
Matt: All right, so do I have to roll for an attack on this? Creature has to make a dexterity saving throw. Hold on.
Taliesin: I don't know what to do.
Matt: That's 76 points of damage from the Disintegrate spell.
Liam: Halved from the Deathwalker's Ward. It's set to necromantic.
Matt: It's force damage. Disintegrate's force damage.
Liam: Oh. Well, then I'm down.
Marisha: No, that means he's disintegrated.
Matt: You watch as Vax's form (fluttering noise) turns to dust.
Sam: Wait, what?
Matt: Leaving the armor of the Raven Queen empty on the ground, the daggers (clattering).
Laura: No body left?
Marisha: There's no recovering from that, dude.
Laura: Bro. We're gone.
Taliesin: Wow.
Matt: Grog, it's your turn.
Sam: What's happening?
Laura: I thought this campaign was going to last longer than this.
Liam: I said this was the last episode, and I meant it.
Taliesin: You are a terrible person. Oh no.
Sam: With Foresight? Oh, because you're paralyzed. Oh fuck.
Marisha: She doesn't have to roll against that?
Matt: It's a dexterity saving throw, but he's still paralyzed.
Marisha: He doesn't get advantage?
Matt: You automatically fail dex saving throws when you're paralyzed.
Taliesin: You can't dex out of something if you can't move.
Travis: If I throw you over to her, can you Revivify?
Sam: I'm too far to do anything, right?
Matt: At the moment?
Sam: It has to be within 60 feet.
Matt: From Delilah? She's within 40 feet of you.
Sam: Can I retroactively Counterspell? (laughs)
Matt: Yeah. I'll let you do it. You have your ability back, so I'll let you try for it.
Marisha: Wait, with the Disintegrate? Go, Scanlan, go!
Travis: Do you have to roll for this?
Sam: I think I have to roll for this.
Matt: You roll and add your charisma modifier.
Sam: No. Charisma modifier? It's just an 11.
Matt: Plus two, because you get plus two bonus, so 13.
Sam: I can't add anything else.
Laura: Can you inspire yourself?
Taliesin: Can you inspire yourself?
Marisha: Can you inspire yourself?
Sam: Not on a reaction, I don't think.
Marisha: But you're a war bard, right?
Matt: He's not a war bard. He's a lore bard.
Marisha: War caster.
Taliesin: Oh man, this does not feel good.
Sam: Doesn't feel good.
Taliesin: It does not feel good.
Matt: Peerless skill. When you make an ability check. It's an ability check, technically.
Sam: What's that mean?
Matt: That means you can spend another bardic inspiration to it because you're at a 13.
Sam: (nervous laughter) It's cocked. It would have been 11. Four.
Matt: It's a 17? The spell is a 6th-level spell. The DC is 16.
Taliesin: Oh god!
Laura: You're not disintegrated?
Travis: Are you serious?
Sam: Matt is a gentle god.
Matt: In this flash of vision, Keyleth, you see this happen, and then the bit of inspiration from the Raven Queen that's been trying to push through whatever is keeping her vision at bay here. Your vision flashes back, and then you see Vax on the ground, the extended finger of Delilah as the green energy begins to spiral up from her finger, and Scanlan in the back just says?
Sam: Oh. Hey, you know what the problem is with your face? I can see it! (laughter)
Matt: Delilah goes, "What?" and the spell (fluttering noise) dissipates. (sighs)
Marisha: That was a 6th-level spell?
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: Does she have any more of those?
Laura: We don't know.
Marisha: Because I only have two.
Matt: That being the case, Delilah is going to go ahead and go. You do get an attack of opportunity on her, Keyleth.
Marisha: Just straight melee?
Matt: Straight melee.
Taliesin: Hit her with a stick.
Marisha: My dice suck.
Laura: You've rolled shit on that dice every time tonight.
Marisha: It's not good. 13.
Matt: 13? No, that misses, unfortunately.
Marisha: Fuck it.
Matt: Okay. Grog, it's your turn now.
Travis: Sure. Can I use my-- are we doing this?
Ashley: Yeah.
Travis: Can I use my action to pick up my buddy Pike, and I'm going to try and throw her as far as I can towards where Vex's body is laying.
Matt: Okay, so you're going to pick her up and move?
Travis: There's no difference, right?
Matt: You can pick her up and move and then throw her to give her the most distance, but you can only move half your speed as you're carrying her. It's essentially an agreed-upon grapple. You'd be able to move 25 feet with her.
Travis: Versus picking her up and throwing her for an athletics check, or something?
Matt: You can, but I don't know how far you'll throw her that way. It's up to you. You can stay where you are, if you'd like to.
Ashley: I'll make it.
Travis: You think so?
Ashley: Yeah. I can make it to her.
Liam: The initiative is Grog, Pike, Vax right now.
Travis: I should just go unload?
Ashley: Yeah, do your thing.
Travis: I would like to rage.
Matt: You are raging.
Travis: Can I use my full speed to head towards Delilah?
Matt: (counting) That's as far as you can get right there.
Travis: With my bonus action, can I use my Boots of Feral Leaping to leap horizontally 20 feet? I want to get within melee.
Matt: Okay, make an athletics check.
Travis: That's a million. 25.
Matt: (impact) You land right in front of her. She watches you as you (footsteps) run around the side, leap, (impact) right in front of her, this giant, hulking form of muscle.
Travis: Yeah. Reckless, great weapon master.
Taliesin: Turn her to fucking paste.
Matt: You have two attacks.
Travis: Yeah, two attacks.
Marisha: Why am I light-headed?
Travis: Everything's going wrong.
Taliesin: Well, that, and those drinks were really inappropriate.
Travis: 28?
Matt: 28? Yeah, that hits.
Travis: 19. 29. 35, and four because I'm enlarged. 35, total on the first one. And the second one, 19. Should have taken that other thing. That would have been a crit. Minus five. 27?
Matt: 27 does hit, yes.
Travis: Boy, she's got a high AC, doesn't she? 10, 24, 34, three points of necrotic for 37. That's a d8. That's the wrong one. 36 points of damage.
Matt: As you rush forward and cleave into her with hit after hit on the axe, you watch as her imposing form is battered around and slashed apart, and as you finish and withdraw the axe from the two strikes, you see her already clutching her stomach. (panting)
Travis: An action surge is a bonus action, right?
Matt: No. Just an action surge.
Taliesin: You can just do it.
Travis: Should we empty the tank?
Laura: Yeah.
Travis: I'll use the action surge.
Matt: Okay. Go for it.
Taliesin: Is that three more attacks?
Matt: Two more.
Travis: Reckless, great weapon, all the shit. Goddamn, that was two 19s in a row. If I'd picked that other thing, they would have been criticals. 28.
Matt: 28 hits, definitely.
Travis: 17, 27, 29. That's a fucking d8 again. 31.
Matt: 31?
Travis: 31 points of damage.
Matt: All righty. Second attack?
Travis: 27.
Matt: Jesus. Yes, that hits.
Travis: I'm a monstrous thing. That's a 12, 26, 36, 38, 40, including the enlarged and the necrotic.
Matt: You slam her with the two extra attacks, knocking her back. As the two additional axe blows slice across the front of her chest, one gets her on the side of her chin. You can see, you've carved the cheek open and broken teeth, and now when she looks back to you, you can see all of her back molars and teeth now, this horrible Joker grin on one side of her face as the blood leaks out. You can see the one gleaming greenish-yellow glowing eye flares open at you. She (spits).
Travis: Don't stop smiling on my account.
Matt: That ends your turn, Grog... All right, so ghostly claws begin to spring up from the ground in a 20-foot radius.
Travis: Did you say claws?
Matt: Claws, yes.
Sam: Ghostly claws.
Matt: Right there. I need-- Vax fails. I need Keyleth and Grog and Trinket to all make dexterity saving throws. Sorry, strength saving throws.
Laura: He can't do anything.
Marisha: Don't fuck me, Gil!
Taliesin: Trinket can.
Laura: Trinket can't still attack if I'm not alive.
Matt: I'll let you. I'll let you, in the purposes of you being dead, Trinket is going to act on his own to defend you.
Laura: He rolled a seven.
Taliesin: He's about to be in a pocket dimension really quick.
Laura: Yeah, he might go into the pocket dimension.
Matt: Grog?
Travis: 22.
Matt: 22. You take five points of necrotic damage, and are not grappled. You take ten points of necrotic damage, reduced to half, five, because of your armor, and you are grappled and paralyzed. Keyleth?
Marisha: 22.
Matt: 22. You take five points of necrotic damage.
Laura: And Trinket takes how much necrotic damage?
Matt: Ten, and is grappled. Trinket's speed is zero. All right. Welcome to the God Wars, guys.
Taliesin: Not cool.
Marisha: Why didn't we Heroes' Feast?
Laura: It wouldn't have mattered.
Liam: Let's get a god in here. Light or dark meat. I don't care. One or the other. Get one of those ladies in here!
Matt: (heavy footfalls) With these heavy, armored footfalls as it walks, with its fingers forward, it begins carving this sigil in the air. Grabs it and turns it, and as it turns, you watch the same sigil runes appear around Grog and begin to spiral around you. Make a charisma saving throw, please.
Travis: Fuck, balls. Hey, y'all, plus one. Don't worry. Four.
Matt: Grog, you vanish. (groaning)
Matt: Banished from this realm of existence.
Travis: No!
Matt: You appear on the ground in the Shadowfell, in the gaping crater where Thar Amphala once stood. You look around, up to the familiar cloudy, dark sky, and are alone.
Travis: Wait. Y'all aren't in the Shadowfell anymore?
Taliesin: No.
Travis: Oh, right. Snow's falling.
Laura: Wildemount, or some shit.
Travis: Without a perception check, is anybody around, or is it just me?
Matt: Nobody's around you, although you do look up and see maybe a dozen or so of the gloom stalkers, swirling up ahead. They haven't noticed you yet.
Taliesin: God fucking damn it.
Sam: You've been banished to another dimension. You can punch your way out of it.
Travis: You know what? I only have one thought.
Marisha: Oh no. He's going to turn to the cards, y'all. He's going to turn to those cards.
Travis: We've got this.
Matt: Keyleth, perception check.
Marisha: What?
Matt: Perception check.
Marisha: Ugh! Okay. That's good. 14 plus 13, so 27.
Matt: You do notice, the armored death knight still has a hand out after Grog's banishing.
Laura: Okay.
Taliesin: Okay, that's good!
Matt: This doesn't appear to be Plane Shift.
Marisha: So if I kill him, he'll come back? Or if I kill him, Grog won't ever come back? What does that mean?!
Taliesin: We'll find out. We'll just lay waste to shit until it stops happening. We're going to keep doing terrible shit until terrible shit stops happening.
Liam: Pickle time.
Travis: This is the worst grin you've ever given us. It's so great.
Matt: We are at the end of the death knight's turn. Vecna's going to use two legendary actions to cast another spell.
Ashley: This feels like when we played in Liam's one-shot when we got on the beach.
Liam: I was just about to say, this is revenge for Demogorgon!
Taliesin: This is very much the beach, isn't it?
Matt: Vecna's going to shift further back on the field to there.
Marisha: Is he always going to fucking fly?
Matt: Why wouldn't he?
Taliesin: Feet are passe.
Matt: As he glides over, he looks down and sees the mess that Delilah's currently in. Looks around and sees the options and says, "Well, I hate to see work unfinished."
Sam: Again?
Liam: Disintegrate?
Matt: Disintegrate again.
Sam: This is the same round, right?
Matt: This is the next round.
Sam: Can I try--
Matt: He moved out of your range.
Sam: Great.
Marisha: No!
Matt: Now you see as a green ray fires down from the Whispered One above, and within an instant--
Marisha: Wait, can I bonus action him? Can I use my bonus action?
Matt: Not on your turn.
Taliesin: I've got nothing.
Matt: You turn to dust within the armor. Where once Vax stood, the vision you saw flash you thought might have been a warning, instead it was an omen. You look down and see the raven wings turn to ash, and now there is the empty armor of the Raven Queen, the daggers clattering to the stone.
Travis: Oh man. What the fuck?
Matt: Pike, it's your turn.
Ashley: I can't do what I was going to do. Fuck.
Sam: Laura.
Ashley: Okay. Sorry. Hold on.
Sam: She can't reach you?
Ashley: Nope.
Sam: I can bring you to her.
Matt: You could hold your action and he could bamf you over.
Ashley: When are you up?
Sam: I don't know.
Laura: Do whatever you want.
Sam: You have to touch her?
Ashley: Yeah.
Matt: If you wanted to do something like that, you'd have to begin casting it and hold your action for him to take his turn, and then you could take her there.
Ashley: Wait, who's up?
Matt: It's you, Percy, then Scanlan.
Ashley: Okay, so Percy's next, and then it's Scanlan.
Sam: If we don't die in those two turns, yes.
Ashley: Okay. Oh my god, I'm shaking so bad. I will start casting Revivify, and I will hold my turn until Scanlan bamfs us.
Sam: I'm going to be a total dick and not do that.
Ashley: There's no one in between us?
Sam: No, we're next to each other.
Ashley: I mean, no one in between us, like the bad guys.
Sam: Well, they can go whenever they want.
Matt: Delilah already took her turn. Scanlan?
Sam: Oh, it's my turn. Where's Percy?
Matt: Sorry. Percy, you're up next.
Taliesin: I'm going to unload a few rounds of Animus into Delilah, since she's still standing. She's still standing?
Matt: She's still standing.
Taliesin: All right. Let's drop a point of grit, and let's get some advantage on this for Animus shot number one. Come on, crit. Not a crit, but still pretty decent. That's a 28 to hit?
Matt: 28 to hit? That will hit.
Taliesin: That's not the full damage. Let's do this, plus let's do that. That's 12 points of piercing damage, five points of psychic damage, and four points of necrotic damage.
Matt: Okay. Necrotic damage doesn't do anything, unfortunately.
Taliesin: I know. I'll keep that off, then, for now.
Matt: Okay. She's looking really hurt.
Taliesin: All right, let's take another shot. Same thing, burning a grit because fuck it. And let's make this one-- these are not the right dice to roll. I'm really nervous. Let's make this one a sharpshooter to see if we can pour a little more pain. Natural 20. That's a crit. Let's get that grit back.
Marisha: Kill her!
Taliesin: I've got to use my pen! Don't shake me! I shake so much on my own! That's 2d10 plus 2d6 psychic, so that's four points of psychic damage. That was a terrible roll. And 24 points of damage.
Marisha: Is that doubled?
Taliesin: Yeah, that's doubled. It was terrible.
Matt: How do you want to do this on Delilah?
Taliesin: (sighs) I take my second shot. I call, Delilah? Even if we die, it's fucking worth it. And I take it right in her good eye. I want me to be the last thing she sees.
Matt: As she turns around, you watch that side of her face explode, and she falls back, the force of it knocking her off her feet. She (impact noise) scatters across the stonework. You glance over, and you can see her looking face-up, and the little green eye in the socket turns and looks towards you.
Sam: Wait, it's still working?
Matt: The eye turned and looked at you from within the socket.
Taliesin: But it's down.
Sam: There's a creature inside of her.
Taliesin: Off. (sighs) For my third shot, Mr. Armor. And I get another grit back because she's dead. Armor. I'm taking-- what's he holding?
Matt: He currently has a longsword in one hand. That's all he's currently holding.
Taliesin: He's holding a longsword? Let's get rid of that longsword. I'm going to hit him and make him drop that longsword.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: I'm burning a grit to make him drop it. I know, this is a lot. I'm taking my third shot with Animus, and this is going to be a sharpshooter shot, and that's not a crit, but that's pretty good. That's 29 to hit?
Matt: That hits.
Taliesin: All right, so this is 1d10 plus 1d6. That's terrible. That's 20 points of damage, two points of psychic damage, and he has to make a strength saving throw or he drops his sword. DC 20.
Matt: He gets a 20 exactly. 15 plus five. But he did take the damage, so he has to make a concentration, which he makes. DC 11, because it's half the damage.
Taliesin: Concentration? Oh, for that. That's fine. Just because we're at that point where I'm panicking, let's burn an action surge. Boom. Three more shots on the asshole.
Marisha: Are you shooting at Vecna?
Taliesin: No, Vecna I'm not shooting because he's laughing off my bullets.
Matt: Most of the impact deflects off the plate.
Marisha: You're shooting at the death knight?
Taliesin: I'm shooting at the death knight, so now I'm going to do a grit shot. I'm going to burn for dead-eye sharpshooter. That's 27?
Matt: 27? Okay, that hits.
Taliesin: And that's-- oh my fucking god! 20 points of damage, plus one point of psychic damage.
Sam: You're fine. You're good.
Taliesin: Burning another--
Sam: It's the last thing.
Taliesin: I've got more. I've got three more. I keep killing things. That's 17 to hit?
Matt: 17. You watch as he's concentrating on that one spell, and as the one shot hits him, the second one, he puts his arm up and seems to deflect it with his hand.
Taliesin: Did he make a constitution save against the last one?
Matt: Yes, he did.
Taliesin: Okay. This is my last shot. I'm burning another grit, and natural 20. Okay, so that's going to be-- come on. That's better!
Matt: I forgot to mention. Vecna took extra damage from your crit earlier.
Taliesin: Yes, he did. He took 15 points of extra damage, halved. 18, 21, 22, 23, 30 points of damage, plus five psychic damage, and he's going to take 15 points of damage, plus three psychic damage next round.
Matt: That was a 16 and a one, so with his constitution bonus, he saves. He maintains concentration.
Taliesin: Oh my fucking god!
Matt: It's hard to break. He was designed for that.
Taliesin: I'm going to use my bonus action to reload, and that's my fucking turn.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: That was a long turn.
Taliesin: I know.
Sam: You did good.
Matt: All right. End of Percy's turn. Scanlan.
Sam: Okay.
Matt: Percy, do you want to move on your turn?
Taliesin: No. There's nowhere. I'm as far away from everybody as I can currently be. There's nowhere else.
Matt: I'm letting you know, as it currently stands. Delilah's down.
Taliesin: Delilah's down.
Matt: And two figures that look pretty much untouched. Scanlan?
Marisha: What are you trying to say?
Matt: I'm saying, be mindful of your choices.
Taliesin: You know what? I'm going to start making a beeline straight for Keyleth. Fuck it. I'm going to see if I can get some cover behind--
Marisha: Are we going to bail? What do we do?
Taliesin: I'm fucking bailing.
Matt: That's up to you. You do have one of them down, and you have two--
Travis: If you can bail--
Marisha: But Grog.
Taliesin: We can get Grog back. We've just got to get everybody up.
Travis: You don't even know where I am.
Liam: You can find him.
Marisha: What about you?
Liam: I'm gone. There's no finding me. I'm gone.
Taliesin: We're picking up armor.
Matt: Scanlan?
Sam: I grab Pikey-poo and Dimension Door straight to Vex's beautiful dead body.
Travis: Like a dead Juliet.
Sam: I will inspire Pike. I don't know if that helps whatever ritual you're about to do, but maybe.
Travis: Revivify.
Taliesin: Revivify.
Ashley: What do you get if you're inspired?
Matt: You get a d12 that you can spend on something. Which, as you release Revivify, you reach down and grab the cold, lifeless hand of Vex. I need you to roll a wisdom check.
Sam: With inspiration.
Matt: Should she need it.
Ashley: And don't I get gnome cunning, so I have advantage on it?
Matt: No. It's not a saving throw. It's just a check. Roll a d20 and add your wisdom modifier.
Taliesin: We will grab everything we fucking can.
Ashley: 18.
Matt: 18? Yeah. Your breath comes in.
Ashley: Hi.
Laura: Pike. Are they dead?
Ashley: No.
Matt: You look over to your side, and you see Delilah on the ground, her head scattered and exploded on the ground, the one yellowish-green eye still moving around and taking in the scenery. You glance up, and you see Vecna still lording over, a big smile on his face. You see the other armored knight walking around, the plated black helmet guarding any expression except for these glowing red dots, the eyes that peer through.
Sam: I'm using any movement I have to pick up the dust of my fallen friend, if there is any dust.
Matt: There's the dust and his equipment. Those are the two things that are left.
Sam: Pick up whatever I can.
Marisha: Scoop him into a little vial.
Liam: (vacuuming noises) (laughter)
Sam: (fake sneeze) Oh no!
Taliesin: This is no time for allergies. Fuck!
Matt: All right, so you get your hands up in the armor and some dust and you gather it in your hand. There's Scanlan. There's you. There's Vex, Pike.
Marisha: So we're all together?
Matt: Well, Percy's there and Grog is somewhere.
Marisha: Percy.
Taliesin: I got as far as I could.
Sam: I'm done. That's all I can do.
Ashley: So bonus action.
Sam: I don't know if you can do a bonus action.
Ashley: Can I do a bonus action?
Matt: Yeah.
Ashley: Okay.
Taliesin: You need healing like a mother. Don't shrug at me.
Sam: She's fine.
Ashley: I'm going to cast Healing Word on Vex.
Matt: Level two?
Ashley: Level four.
Matt: Because you've already cast Revivify.
Ashley: Level two.
Matt: So 2d4 plus your wisdom modifier, I think.
Sam: I'm already rolling Vax.
Laura: You're mixing him with your suude?
Sam: Yeah.
Ashley: Ten hit points.
Sam: Tuck it behind my ear for later.
Taliesin: It doesn't matter anymore.
Laura: I haven't seen Vax yet. I haven't seen what happened.
Ashley: Can I move?
Matt: No, because you already took your turn.
Ashley: Oh my god.
Matt: So that ends your turn? Scanlan, you moved up there and you grabbed the stuff. That's your turn. Keyleth?
Marisha: Oh god. Okay. Are we trying to get to me so I can get us all out?
Sam: Yeah, but it's going to take another turn.
Laura: For Percy to get there.
Marisha: But everyone's coming this way, right? Everyone's coming this way? Then I'm going to-- fucking hell. How does Fire Storm work? I know it's ten ten-foot cubes. Does it have to be on the ground, or can I hit him up there? Can I rain-- "justice rains from above!" Can I do that?
Taliesin: I haven't touched that game in so long.
Matt: You can arrange as you wish. Each cube must have at least one face adjacent to the face of another cube. Yeah, you can. Choose a location you see within range, so I don't see why you couldn't. You can create a lava fall, essentially.
Taliesin: You'd have to pick one of the two of them to hit.
Matt: You pick one, and then you create a bunch of cubes that chain off it.
Taliesin: You can hit them both.
Marisha: But I'm not going to be able to hit the death knight and Vecna?
Matt: Probably not. Not without hitting Scanlan or yourself in the process.
Marisha: What if I got out of the way. Could I?
Matt: We can try it.
Marisha: I'm going to do a bonus action and I'm going to go air elemental. Full-on, wrath of my people and my hometown, and I'm going to levitate in a cool tornado-y thing.
Matt: Are there any material components for Fire Storm? No, there is not. You can cast that in your form. You levitate up. We'll say right there.
Taliesin: There's a lot of dead bodies on the ground, man.
Matt: I know. This is rough, man. We'll say there.
Marisha: That's high, but that's okay.
Matt: How high did you want it?
Marisha: In between, but don't worry about it. I'm going to right onto Vecna and try and swarm it down towards the death knight.
Matt: How many cubes is it?
Marisha: Ten ten-foot cubes.
Matt: That's ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Just barely get him. Just barely.
Taliesin: That will do.
Matt: Hold on.
Marisha: What do you mean, hold on?
Travis: There are some legendary things that I think might be happening.
Taliesin: I get that vibe.
Matt: Not legendary. As you swarm up and begin to formulate the spell, Vecna looks at at you, and you can see with the vacant space where the hand is, there's almost an arcane flash of a hand that goes, (clicks tongue). He's going to attempt to Counterspell you.
Taliesin: Roll a one!
Marisha: What does he have to roll? Under my DC?
Matt: It has to beat your DC. No, sorry. The level of the spell, which would be 17. Which succeeds. He rolled a 14 plus ten, so 24. As you formulate the spell, you watch as the flames sputter out.
Laura: Can you come back down to the ground?
Marisha: Yeah, I'll try and levitate down a bit.
Matt: You were about there, and with your flying speed, you can land back down on the ground if you want. Sorry. Is that your turn, Keyleth?
Marisha: I guess so.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: What does it look like when you're looking out at all of us and we're so sad?
Matt: It feels awful.
Travis: I love it!
Taliesin: You're a liar. You're a lying liar.
Matt: It legitimately feels awful, but we were building to this for a long time. I've got to play it.
Travis: There's a god floating in the air.
Matt: Not a god yet.
Travis: Not a god yet.
Matt: That you know of.
Laura: He'll be a god in our next damn campaign when we're all dead.
Matt: He's going to use his last legendary action at the end of Keyleth's turn to cast a cantrip at you, Vex, as you just got back to consciousness. He's going to reach out with a Flame Bolt.
Laura: It's because I called him a dipshit when he was talking earlier.
Travis: You did blurt that out.
Matt: You did. You did taunt him.
Laura: He is a dipshit. Before he does his cantrip, I'm going to go, you can go ahead and live forever, but you'll still be fucking ugly the whole damn time! (laughter)
Matt: Disadvantage because you're prone on the ground and it's a ranged attack. That is a two plus 16. That is an 18.
Laura: To my armor class? He doesn't hit.
Matt: I rolled a natural 20 and a two, by the way, so if you weren't prone?
Taliesin: He would have--
Laura: Destroyed me.
Travis: You would be dust.
Matt: As he points down with his still-missing hand, releases this bolt and you see this flare up in the air and rush towards you, and you roll out of the way and it (impact noise) slams into the stone below you. You hear it crack and break the area where your head once was. Now it's Vecna's turn.
Travis: Now. (laughs) Now?
Ashley: That wasn't his turn?
Matt: That was a legendary action.
Ashley: That was a legendary action? That's right. I don't want any of it!
Taliesin: None of us want this.
Travis: I don't want it! I don't like it!
Ashley: I don't even want to play.
Travis: Taryon's back in Whitestone having a fucking ball.
Taliesin: Taryon's sitting with a cup of tea.
Sam: No, Taryon's on the floor, weeping, holding his necklace.
All: Oh!
Ashley: He doesn't know who it is.
Taliesin: We've got one way down. We are all having the thumpa-thumpa right now.
Laura: It's red. All flashing red.
Matt: Okay.
Ashley: Why did you say okay that way?
Sam: Liam can be Taryon now! (laughs)
Taliesin: You're terrible.
Sam: No! It's an established character we already have artwork for. Why let it go to waste? He's done prissy boys before.
Travis: Look at Matt's face.
Matt: Vecna's going to lean down, seeing that you just brought life back to Vex--
Travis: Don't you do it!
Laura: Matthew, don't do it!
Matt: "Join your friend."
All: No!
Sam: I will 6th-level Counterspell. (cheering)
Travis: We will not go quietly into the night!
Sam: I will sing at him, (singing) Counterspell, baby don't hurt me. Don't hurt me no more. Counterspell!
Matt: Okay. Roll a d20.
Matt: It's a 7th-level Finger of Death.
Laura: Is that a natural 20?
Taliesin: No.
Marisha: Scanlan! No!
Travis: What is this up and down cardiac arrrest game?
Matt: Natural one?
Taliesin: Stop rolling that die.
Laura: And you're below 100?
Travis: It really is a one?
Taliesin: It really was a one.
Sam: I can add things to it, right?
Taliesin: No, you can't.
Matt: 7d8. I need you to make a constitution saving throw.
Ashley: I make a constitution saving throw? Okay.
Sam: You're still inspired.
Laura: You're inspired!
Ashley: "You're spired!"
Laura: Inspired. Use it!
Ashley: Okay.
Travis: It's a d10, right?
Sam: d12 on top of that.
Matt: What did you roll?
Ashley: 13.
Liam: Plus the inspiration.
Ashley: No, just the 13. Plus-- 19?
Matt: No. You take 67 points of necrotic damage.
Laura: It wasn't Power Word Kill, it was Finger of Death?
Matt: No, he'd already used his Power Word Kill. Remember, he's not a god yet.
Ashley: Okay.
Laura: Just the one. Just the one Power Word Kill.
Travis: The fact that he's not a god gives me diarrhea feelings.
Ashley: Okay.
Matt: All right, and he's going to move back a bit, frustrated at the--
Sam: At everything.
Matt: At your attempts to Counterspell. Actually, no. He laughed at that. "Nice try."
Sam: It wasn't my best performance.
Matt: All right, that's going to end his turn. Delilah's out. Grog.
Travis: (laughs)
Matt: Make a stealth check.
Travis: Cool. Right. Pass Without a Trace is still going, right?
Matt: Nope.
Travis: That's a one.
Taliesin: Hello?
Matt: As you're there, Grog, you hear (screeching). A cloud of screeches, as about nine of these gloom stalkers all start (whoosh) going into a dive towards you.
Sam: Maybe one of them is our friend Mr. Mistoffelees.
Marisha: Mr. Mistoffelees, come back!
Travis: Am I going to do anything? How far away is the nearest structure?
Matt: Nothing. It's a crater. You're where the city used to be. You have at least a mile to each side of nothing but crater.
Taliesin: Fuck!
Ashley: He's all by his lonesome!
Taliesin: One more round.
Sam: He doesn't know.
Marisha: He could be stuck there forever!
Taliesin: There's nothing we can do right now.
Travis: I'm going to go into a frenzied rage, and I'm going to use my second wind to heal 1d10 plus my fighter level. Three, six. Six points, yay.
Taliesin: How close to you do we have to be?
Marisha: We have to be touching.
Sam: And you have to not be wind.
Marisha: I can be wind now.
Travis: I don't have any fighter things, so that's my turn.
Matt: That's your turn. Okay. Ending your turn. Dark energy suffuses the landscape in the area. Actually, no. I'm not going to use that one because nobody has necrotic resistance right now. More undead are going to pop up. Let's see how many. That's actually a shitty roll. Four undead pop up.
Taliesin: They're bullshit. We don't care.
Matt: All righty. That's going to be an attack on you. It has advantage because you're prone and it's in melee. That's a 17. Still doesn't hit. High armor. You're ducking out of the way. The skeleton is (tink) hitting the ground. It's also attacking at you, Pike. That's cocked. Natural one. It goes to strike you, and it doesn't even hit you. The holy symbol of Sarenrae flares, and it (raspy cry) pulls away from the blast of vibrant, radiant energy. There's going to be one attacking you, Scanlan. That is a 20 to hit?
Sam: Oh yeah.
Matt: All right. You take eight points of slashing damage. And attacking you, Percival, that's another 20.
Taliesin: That is my armor class.
Matt: It hits you. You take 11 points of slashing damage as it cuts through you.
Taliesin: I don't even acknowledge its existence. I am definitely not amused.
Marisha: What was the name of that one city, you guys?
Taliesin: Where is your dad from?
Marisha: Syngorn. Is Syngorn still in the Feywild?
Laura: No.
Taliesin: Damn it.
Marisha: Where did we go? What city in the Feywild did we go to?
Laura: We can go to the pond.
Travis: The death knight.
Matt: Steps forward, seeing Scanlan attempt to shrug off all these spells, comes rushing forward, and you watch as its blade begins to empower this dark, black shadow, similar to the gloom stalkers you've seen before. As he brings the sword and arcs it down with tremendous might, you hear the crack of thunder as this Staggering Smite slams into you, or tries to, at least.
Sam: That sounds bad.
Taliesin: That's bad. Do you have a reaction?
Sam: I used it already.
Matt: Shitty roll. 16 to hit?
Sam: Oh yeah, that hits.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: I think I'm not attuned-- yeah.
Matt: You take ten points of slashing damage, plus 17 points of necrotic damage.
Taliesin: 27.
Matt: And as part of the Staggering Smite, you also take 14 points of psychic damage, and make a wisdom saving throw.
Sam: Against magic? That's better. 17.
Matt: 17? His spell DC is 18, unfortunately. On a failed save, you have a disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks, and you can't take reactions until the end of your next turn, so you can't Counterspell.
Taliesin: Scanlan's getting whaled on.
Sam: Disadvantage on all attack rolls?
Matt: Oh, but that's a concentration spell, so he's not going to maintain the concentration. You take the damage, and he lets it go. You don't have a disadvantage. Otherwise, he would lose other bits of concentration.
Laura: Other bits of concentration.
Matt: All right, so that brings us to Vex. Your turn.
Laura: (laughing) I get to go?
Matt: Yeah. Sorry!
Sam: You're alive.
Matt: Sorry, guys. You walked into the lion's den.
Laura: Oh yeah, we did.
Liam: I never did a single thing in this fight.
Laura: I know. This is the first thing I've done. I stand up.
Taliesin: If we're smart--
Marisha: I can bring you back.
Taliesin: I'm heading towards where you are. I'm heading towards the deceased body of Delilah.
Laura: I'm going to, as a bonus action, down my biggest healing potion, which is one greater healing potion.
Matt: Go for it.
Liam: There's also a superior healing potion lying on the ground amongst all my shit.
Laura: No. It's in your armor.
Matt: Greater is 4d4 plus four.
Sam: Okay, it's something.
Laura: 13 plus four is 17 healing points, and I'm going to move closer to Keyleth.
Taliesin: She can move to us. Never mind.
Marisha: We have to all be holding hands, y'all.
Laura: Can I put myself in between Percy and Keyleth so I can reach my hand out?
Taliesin: I'm going to be making a beeline for everybody else. Everybody's in that big clump.
Laura: We're all in a clump, so we can still touch? I don't need to move anywhere in order to be able to touch her?
Taliesin: You'll be able to move before you cast Plane Shift, right?
Marisha: Yes.
Taliesin: So as long as we're all touching, she can get to us. We just need to clump, and I move last, so I'm fine. Is that right? Yeah, I move last.
Matt: Keyleth moves last. Keyleth and Scanlan.
Laura: Okay, I'm going to shoot at the death knight.
Matt: Go for it.
Laura: With my 21?
Matt: 21 actually hits.
Laura: With my Blazing Bowstring, and I want to make it a bramble shot.
Travis: Hit him hard.
Laura: Is anybody standing next to him?
Matt: Scanlan and Keyleth.
Laura: Sweet.
Marisha: Feel free to hit me. I don't care. I can't be grappled.
Taliesin: Doesn't matter. She just gets extra points--
Marisha: Oh, he's flanked.
Laura: 23 plus eight is 31, right? 33 plus 1d6 lightning damage. 39, and then 3d6 sneak attack. 11 additional, so that's--
Travis: 50.
Laura: Oh, and the Blazing Bowstring. Six additional from that.
Matt: 56 points of damage from one shot. That is a 23 on his strength save, so as the arrow hits, you see the burst of flame. It pierces the armor, and you see the brambles extend and tear around him. He looks up at you and you watch as flames (fire noises) burn out of the armor. The arrow burns away, and the brambles ignite and fafll to ash around him.
Laura: Not surprising. What about his concentration?
Taliesin: Come on.
Matt: That's going to be... half of 56? Oh man, he's going to have to roll really high.
Taliesin: No!
Marisha: No!
Matt: Hold on. Half of 56 is--
Sam: 28.
Matt: 28. No, he rolled a 19 plus five. (cheering)
Matt: As the flames ignite and burn around, the impact still causes him to lose the spell, and you watch as a vacuum fills, and Grog, just as you see this barrage of gloom stalkers, ready to grab and tear you apart, you (poof) out and then (whoosh) appear in that space where you once were.
Travis: Huh?
Ashley: Grog! You're back!
Marisha: Grog, we've got to get out!
Matt: All right, that ends your turn, Vex?
Laura: No, I get to attack him again.
Matt: Go for it.
Taliesin: We're in a nice little clump, aren't we?
Laura: That one definitely hits. This is way less damage. 20 damage on the second one.
Matt: All righty. You can sense there's shadow and smoke pouring out from under the armor as the frustration of lost concentration is there. The second arrow hits the shoulder. Staring straight at you, angrily.
Laura: Keyleth, get us out of here?
Marisha: Hold hands.
Taliesin: I think we're all in physical contact, at this point, except for me.
Matt: That ends Vex's turn?
Laura: Where's Vax?
Taliesin: Well...
Marisha: We'll talk later!
Taliesin: Working on it. Do you have all of his stuff?
Sam: As much as I can carry.
Matt: Armor, daggers. Roll an investigation check.
Marisha: Dust?
Liam: Boots, his voice says from beyond the grave.
Sam: 30.
Matt: You rustled through the dust when you went through and spent the turn grabbing what you can. You get most of his important magical items.
Marisha: And dust.
Matt: And a little bit of dust.
Sam: Those boots are gone!
Taliesin: Next time we fight Vecna, he's going to be wearing some very nice boots.
Laura: No.
Taliesin: I'm kidding.
Liam: He'll be Finger of Deathing me double-time.
Ashley: Are we trying to get out of here? What are we doing?
Taliesin: We are trying to get out of here.
Ashley: But then what?! We still have to fight him!
Laura: Yeah, but then we'll be able to recover a little bit and figure out what we're doing.
Taliesin: We're going to die here.
Ashley: Okay, I'll run to-- sorry, I'm stuttering. Keyleth's doing it?
Taliesin: As long as we're all touching, it doesn't matter where Keyleth is, but Turn Undead would help, maybe?
Laura: Or heal us.
Taliesin: Healing or Turn Undead.
Ashley: When's your turn up?
Taliesin: I'm coming up, right?
Laura: And you're holding your action, Keyleth?
Matt: Yes, after Pike's turn.
Ashley: Okay. I'm going to do Mass Cure Wounds at 6th level. Let's see.
Taliesin: I'm going to use the ring of counting. This is actually proving to be invaluable.
Marisha: It's very handy.
Laura: What? What did you just think of?
Travis: Nothing.
Taliesin: Later. We need a bigger boat.
Ashley: Fuck, this is a bad roll.
Sam: Is this a new round since my last Counterspell?
Matt: What was the last one you countered and failed? That was on Vecna's turn, so when it comes back to your turn, it will be.
Taliesin: Not yet.
Ashley: 26 points. I rolled so badly.
Laura: 26 is great.
Ashley: And then... am I able to also, at this point, see if I can channel divinity?
Matt: It's an action to do that.
Ashley: It's not like she's going to show up. Okay. Sorry. I'm so hot.
Sam: That's what I say to myself every morning.
Liam: Your extensions look good, but I feel like that is...
Ashley: Okay. I'm just hanging out.
Matt: Okay. That's Pike's turn.
Marisha: Are we all holding hands? Are we all in position?
Sam: Wait, did you just cure our wounds?
Taliesin: Yeah, we just got 26 points back.
Ashley: Wait. Can I do a Mass Healing Word as my bonus action?
Matt: What level? No, because you already did a higher-level. You can't do that, unfortunately.
Sam: You can do it to one person.
Ashley: I'll do one person. Who's closest to me?
Taliesin: She's probably at the bottom.
Ashley: Where are you at? Oh yeah, you're nothing. Let me do the Healing Word.
Laura: You're nothing! You're nobody!
Travis: You'll never mean nothing in this world!
Matt: At the end of your turn, Pike, Vecna's going to go ahead and cast-- you hear the voice enter your mind once more, Pike. "Don't worry. If you love her that much, I'll send her to you." Make a dexterity saving throw.
Sam: Oh no, dexterity.
Matt: Let me see if it's dexterity or constitution. Let me check real fast.
Laura: What's he doing?
Sam: He's trying to hurt our Pikey.
Matt: That is a dexterity. Make a dexterity saving throw.
Ashley: 16.
Taliesin: Nope.
Ashley: I knew it was too low.
Matt: All right. You take 78 points of force damage.
Ashley: How much?
Matt: 78.
Ashley: 78. Okay. That is okay. I'm unconscious--
Matt: However, if it brings you to zero, it turns you to dust.
Laura: But her armor!
Matt: But the armor.
Travis: Oh!
Sam: It never got her to zero.
Matt: As soon as you hit zero, the armor flickers in, and the divine--
Marisha: Oh my god.
Taliesin: Which also means that all the fucking skeletons take damage!
Matt: Yep. As the ray hits you and you feel your flesh begin to dissipate, the blessing of Pelor and the guidance of Sarenrae flicker into you, and you watch as light and flames (explosion noise) burst out of her like a Doctor regenerating. As the fire consumes the area, roll your damage for your armor. Thank you for reminding me of that.
Travis: Plate of the Dawnmartyr, you guys.
Taliesin: I was about to say, I know the stats of the Dawnmartyr really well right now, for reasons.
Travis: They take 6d6 fire damage.
Laura: 6d6 fire damage!
Travis: The ones within melee.
Matt: To all hostile creatures, correct?
Taliesin: Yep.
Matt: Not all creatures?
Laura: All hostile.
Matt: That's a very important distinction.
Laura: That was terrible!
Ashley: 14. You know what? It's fine. I'm alive.
Matt: Okay, so as the flames burn out, you watch as the skeletons that catch flame, their bone burning to black, but they're still standing. Okay. That brings us to Percy.
Ashley: Nothing is going well!
Taliesin: Are we a reasonable chain?
Laura: Yeah, we're just waiting on you to make the touch.
Taliesin: There's nobody breaking the chain? I'm going to move six points in the direction of Delilah because I'm going to bring her with me because I don't want that dead body there. Do I make it in six moves? And while I'm running, just for fucking fun, I'm going to take three shots at that armor, and I'm going to push him the fuck back, if that's okay. I'm going to push that knight back. I'm going to try and do a force push.
Laura: And you're saving your action until we're all touching?
Taliesin: Yeah. It's about to be. We're all touching. Let's get rid of that fucker.
Marisha: We are getting out of here, right?
Taliesin: We're getting the fuck out of here.
Laura: Oh, I thought you were saving your action.
Marisha: I rolled a really fucking shitty initiative.
Taliesin: That's a 27 to hit? The knight.
Matt: That hits, yes.
Taliesin: Okay, and that's a torso push. I'm only going to take the one shot. I don't even care anymore; I'm just pushing him away.
Matt: He's pushed ten feet?
Taliesin: He's pushed ten feet back from my position.
Matt: Does he make a save for that?
Taliesin: There's no save for that, and then he takes a disturbingly sad nine points of damage, plus six points psychic damage. But he's ten feet back. We're all touching. I'm going to save the rest of my attack for anybody who tries to get in the way of this shit. If anybody interrupts us, I've got two more shots ready to go. Also burning a heal for fun, as well.
Matt: Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: I will Lightning Bolt at level four the armor knight guy.
Taliesin: I'm also holding onto Delilah.
Sam: He's behind me, so I'll do it from my ass. (laughter)
Liam: I love you so much.
Sam: I'll lift up my leg a little bit. Squeeze it out.
Liam: Like a dog at a fire hydrant.
Sam: It's 8d6, but at level four it's 9d6, I think?
Matt: Level four, it's 9d6, yeah. He did not make his save. He rolled a nine plus six. 15.
Taliesin: Yay! I'm not quite at full.
Matt: He has advantage on his saves against magical effects and spells. He rolled worse.
Sam: 35.
Matt: 35 points of damage. The bolt (lightning noise) through him at the same time he's blasted back by Percy's hit and skids. You see the smoke rise up. Like the Terminator, he keeps moving forward.
Sam: I'll use my movement to gather whatever bits of Vax I can still see.
Taliesin: Put your hands in it.
Sam: And get into "posish."
Taliesin: We're ready to burn.
Sam: I will bonus action Healing Word Pikey-poo, which is for me-- what is Healing Word? It's 2d4 plus six?
Matt: Yes.
Sam: Ten.
Matt: At the end of Scanlan's turn--
Taliesin: Fuck no!
Travis: Let's just have a conversation about this. We're adults.
Laura: What is this game, Matthew? Don't do it!
Matt: He is going to take a shot at Pike with a Firebolt cantrip.
Taliesin: You have a reaction.
Sam: I do, but I want to save it.
Ashley: Bob and weave. I can bob and weave.
Taliesin: There's no save. This is it.
Sam: Do people have to be alive to get out of here?
Matt: That is a 21. What's your armor class?
Ashley: 23.
Travis: It doesn't even hit!
Liam: Eat a dick!
Ashley: Eat a bag of dicks!
Travis: At level five?
Matt: I rolled a five. It's a cantrip. It fires the bolt towards you; you're barely holding on. As you turn around, the flame hits you, but your armor absorbs it. No impact. Okay.
Laura: I need Taco Bell right now in my life!
Ashley: I know. I want Taco Bell so bad. We might have cheats tonight.
Matt: That's the end of Scanlan's turn. Keyleth?
Marisha: Are we all here?
Taliesin: We're all here.
Marisha: We're all sure about this? We're out? 100%?
Taliesin: We're dying.
Travis: No, let's stay and fight.
Marisha: We're on this plane, right?
Travis: Yeah, we're on the material plane.
Marisha: Then we're going to the Feywild! And we all hold hands--
Matt: Are you turning back to your form, then?
Marisha: Yes, I drop form and I pull out my tuning fork and my flowers, and I think deep about the Gilded Run and the Shademirk Bog and the beautiful pond that we appeared around, that we know there's a portal right near it. That's what I think about strongly, and I say, everyone think about the pretty ponds!
Liam: Feywild Spring Break, motherfuckers!
Marisha: Spring Break 2017, Feywild!
Taliesin: Roll. You're a good man.
Matt: Vecna's going to attempt to Counterspell.
Sam: Yep. 7th-level Counterspell against him. (laughter)
Travis: I knew that's what you were waiting for!
Matt: That was some old-school Magic  The Gathering shit, right there.
Liam: Do it, Scanlan. Do it.
Ashley: You just pulled out the wild Uno card. (laughter)
Taliesin: We're not happy yet.
Matt: So 7th-level Counterspell. Yeah, you don't have to roll. (cheering)
Matt: Yeah. Let me check real fast. I need to confirm this real fast.
Laura: Scanlan's back.
Liam: Shorthalt's back.
Travis: "I'd rather not use it."
Matt: Yeah, no. The only spell he even had left to Counterspell was 7th level. Yeah, (poof).
Sam: Let's go.
Matt: As the glyph of shattering begins to coalesce around his fingers in one hand and the wrist on the other, you strike up a Counterspell of your own.
Sam: Sure. I will say to him, this time-- I've got nothing left. I will sing to him, (singing) I'm beautiful. I'm beautiful, it's true. You saw my face in a crowded place, and you didn't know what to do because I just took a shit on you.
Ashley: Oh my god.
Matt: The last thing you hear as the spell begins to take effect is the whispered voice of Vecna throughout all of your heads say, "What?" (laughter)
Matt: Before (spell noise) you are all yanked through a familiar tunnel of darkness and then thrust out into the center of a clustered, dense forest in the Feywild.
Sam: Oh god. Have I been there? Wait, was that me? Yes. Okay.
Marisha: I'm sorry. I would have taken us home, but we were already there, and I had to go somewhere else.
Laura: Where's Vax?
Matt: And that's where we're going to end. (groaning)
Liam: (fake crying) You sadistic motherfucker! You cut it right there?! I was okay until right then!
Taliesin: That's not nice.
Matt: I'm so sorry.
Taliesin: Nothing feels good.
Liam: I was okay until right then!
Ashley: Let's do one more hour.
Travis: That was amazing. That was brutal. We didn't have a fucking chance.
Taliesin: No, there was not a fucking prayer.
Liam: What else were we going to do? Set up an Orange Julius stand by that tower? Of course we were going to go into that tower.
Travis: Of course! But we didn't know how fucked we were until we got up there. We had to go.
Marisha: I thought that we were pretty badass when we took the tower down, and we were not.
Ashley: No.
Marisha: I can get you back, man. I can get you fucking back!
Sam: Can you? Without a body?
Matt: We're going to have some discussions.
Sam: Without a body?
Marisha: But True Resurrection says I can.
Matt: Marisha. We'll have some discussions. Anyway. Thank you guys so much for watching. Thanks for kicking in for a taste of the final arc. Holy shit.
Taliesin: You know what, I'm grateful that we're not--
Matt: Oh man. There was part of me, where either they were going to end up waiting-- if that didn't break concentration, they were either going to wait for you and probably lose a lot more, possibly Keyleth once she realized what was going on. Or left without you. You would have come back.
Laura: And we would have been gone.
Travis: And I would have to have won the game all by myself.
Sam: Which you've already done.
Travis: Or I would have taken the Deck and been like--
Liam: Number one lesson. The one takeaway tonight. The one takeaway is just how OP Vax'ildan is. (laughter)
Matt: This is true.
Laura: If he can't move, he's fucked.
Travis: Boots no longer.
Marisha: I can't believe I fucking dumped my 9th-level spell in you, and then you got tied down. It made zero fucking difference.
Liam: You did great.
Marisha: We both wasted our fucking 9th-level spells.
Sam: They're hard to use. We've got to learn to use them better.
Liam: You've got one chance to do something fucking amazing.
Laura: Vecna is out and ready to fucking destroy.
Matt: We'll pick up on this next week.
Sam: Wow. I'm shaking.
Matt: Me, too. All right, guys. Thank you so much. Have a wonderful night. We'll see you soon, and is it Thursday yet?
Travis: Nope! It's Thursday right now!
Liam: Last Thursday.
Matt: Good night, guys. [music]

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons and Dragons. I think we're recording, because my camera light's not on, but nevertheless, welcome. (laughs)
Travis: We're totally recording.
Matt: I'm pretty sure we are. Anyway guys, welcome, we have a fantastic guest who will be joining us later this evening, but before we get to that we have announcements to go over real fast. First and foremost, tonight's episode is sponsored by a new sponsor, a fantastic group called Quidd! If you want to talk about that first?
Sam: Hi, guys. Vacation Sam here. Quidd is our sponsor tonight, a fantastic new sticker app for your phone. You can check it out at bitly, that's bit.ly/crquidd. I didn't know much about the company, but Quidd sounded vaguely British, so little-known fact about me, I have access to the BBC archives at home, so I did some snooping and sure enough, I found a World War II newsreel transcript that talked about Quidd, so I thought I would do a dramatic reading of it for you right now.
Liam: Here we go.
Sam: News from the front! This is Nigel J. Creamhutch reporting from BBC London. March 23, 1944 may be a turning point in WWII as PM Churchill announces a new weapon in the fight against those devilish Nazis. They're calling it Quidd, a new app where you can collect stickers, cards and Funko figures on your telephone device. Our lads on the frontlines are already using it! We spoke with Lieutenant Neville Bingham of the Royal Navy. Right, yeah, Quidd's this free app available on the Apple App Store and Google Play, and it's helping us drive Hitler back to Berlin. But it's not just our Tommies. The Reds have discovered Quidd as well! We spoke with tank commander Ivan Bashenko. With Quidd, Russian army is strongest in world. Morale better now with thousands of stickers to collect that can be used like emojis in messages to your friends. Stalingrad will not fall with these cute stickers! Why, they're even using Quidd across the pond! We spoke with American sergeant John Smith, an American Doughboy. I'm John, an American. We American GIs love to collect stickers from brands like Rick and Morty, Bob's Burgers, Family Guy, Breaking Bad, Star Trek, and newly announced Game of Thrones. Take that, Emperor Hirohito! Well, there you have it, ladies and gents. Your British Armed Forces and our allies will defeat the Nazis and win the Second Great War if you go to bit.ly/crquidd and check out Quidd. Good night, good luck, and god save the queen, pip pip! (cheering)
Travis: I'm so glad that's available on the BBC.
Sam: Yeah, it was a weird transcript. I would have shown the newsreel, but it was just a transcript.
Matt: Fair enough. Well, thank you for the update on that, and thank you, Quidd for sponsoring tonight's episode. Really appreciate it.
Liam: Did they win the war?
Sam: Find out next time! (laughter)
Matt: All righty, let's see. Do you have any merch updates at all, Laura?
Laura: There's stuff in the store!
Matt: There you go. Perfect. Good, I like it, thank you. The Green Ronin Campaign Guide. Pre-orders go up on Monday, guys!
All: What!
Laura: Oh my god.
Matt: Yes, and if you get the book and the pdf, I think the pdf is available immediately, so some of you will have access to actually read the book on Monday.
Laura: Are you so nervous, Matt?
Matt: I'm so nervous. (laughs nervously)
Taliesin: People can actually, in real time, call us when we're wrong on our own stuff.
Travis: What do you mean, finally? They do that every week.
Marisha: Finally? Although you are Taliesin Jaffe.
Taliesin: This is a level of pain I've only dreamed of; I'm very excited.
Liam: Hey. We're so proud of you.
Travis: Yeah, nice job with the words and stuff.
Sam: Hold on though, we haven't read it yet. What if it's terribly written, by a child?
Laura: We'll find out he used crayon. It's all written in marker.
Matt: Probably. Do you know how hard it is to get crayon printed these days?
Marisha: Only if the writers' room dropped the ball.
Matt: Well, I hope you guys enjoy it, so look forward to that. The podcast is now episodes 11 through 20, right? Up on the Apple Store. So you can go ahead and download those, which are awesome.
Marisha: Yep, Apple and Google Play.
Matt: Yes. And those are the ones. Of course we'll have Talks Machina next Tuesday at 7:00pm about this episode tonight, here on Twitch and Alpha, 7:00pm Pacific, with our fantastic host Brian Foster, so you can check that out. Wednesday Club next week for you?
Taliesin: Wednesday Club, we're talking about Comic Con, because Comic Con is coming up, and we're going to try and give you a first-timer's guide to Comic Con: If you've never been to one, what to expect, what to do for fun, and all sorts of things that you could see or do in San Diego. Other than us. Thank you, I was very proud of last night.
Matt: We're not having a show next week, we're going to be at Comic Con. Yeah, we have a week off. So we'll miss you guys next week, but we do have our Critical Role panel on Saturday at Comic Con, it's at 10:30am in Room 6...
Travis: BC... E.
Matt: It's a nice big room. You guys should come, we're going to have silly questions, Q and A, conversations, stories and a lot of funness and some cool surprises!
Sam: Prizes?
Taliesin: Prizes?
Matt: Surprises!
Marisha: Oh yeah, we have some announcements.
Matt: So hopefully you guys can make it at San Diego Comic Con. If you're going to be there we'd love to see you. And last but not least, Sagas of Sundry: Dread. The third episode went up today.
Matt: (perfect unison) Shit's getting real.
Marisha: (perfect unison) Shit's getting real.
Matt: I'm going to marry you. (laughter)
Matt: What's that? Oh that's right, and at GenCon next month we have our live show, we mentioned it last week. Tickets are still on sale for the general admission. We're looking forward to having you guys there, it's Friday evening.
Travis: Yeah, it's Friday evening, 7 30. In fact, we got an even bigger theatre this year. The last theatre had 1,500 seats, we're like, oh, we'll never get that many people, and it went (explosion sound). It filled up, so we got a 2,500 seat theatre. It's massive, it's a huge party, if you didn't join us last year, you want to come to this mayhem. It's so much fun. You don't need passes to GenCon, by the way, you don't have to have a badge or anything for that, it's a standalone thing. There are definitely tickets still available, it's going to be super fun.
Sam: I feel like with that many people we should have beach balls in the audience, and they can do the wave.
Matt: Inflatable d20s to throw out there...
Marisha: (gasps) You can get them. They're on ThinkGeek I think.
Matt: This is a terrible idea.
Travis: It's a great idea!
Matt: Anyway, without further ado, I think that concludes our announcements, and as such, let us dive into tonight's episode of Critical Role. [dramatic music]
Matt: Hello, everyone, and welcome back. So where we left off last time. Vox Machina, having finally encountered the Undying King, returned in physical form in the Shadowfell, did battle and fled, quite unprepared for that venture, and gathered some tidbits of information about what Vecna's plans may be. Upon returning and discovering that your disintegrated Vax has returned through some deal he made with his patron the Raven Queen after disintegrating, you decided to go ahead and try and gather more information about this and beseech some of the higher powers within Exandria. Pike talked to Sarenrae and was given the invitation to come visit her in Elysium on the Island of Renewal, and upon gathering your materials and causing a mess in Vasselheim, you got together and went to meet this fantastic Everlight. On her island, you spoke with her. She gathered some information from you, as Vecna seemed to be blocking at least the influence and vision from a lot of the deities, and then gave her blessing unto Pike, transferring you over to one of the other gods that lives among the Blessed Fields of Elysium: Pelor, the Dawnfather. You then walked through the orchards that led to the Fortress of the Sun where he resides, spoke with some of the guardians there, and were led into the center of the citadel, where you met, in the central throne room under the Zenith Tower, Pelor himself. Upon exchanging information, you spoke of your need to gather the favor of certain gods in the battles to come, and were given a challenge. To step up to plate: Vex'ahlia. You accepted the challenge and racing to the top of the tower, the zenith, before the fires could be extinguished in the brazier that awaited you, you threw yourself into the fire, and upon the party speaking on what it was that made Vex'ahlia such an important member of not just your team, but your family, and gave you strength, she was imbued with a blessing of the Dawnfather himself. After which, we left off as you exited the front of the Fortress of the Sun, stepped into the central glade that marks the center of the seemingly endless orchards that surround this region, and Vox Machina, what would you like to do?
Travis: Eat all of the fruit.
Laura: No.
Travis: It was really good. It was just fruit, by the way. Like I said.
Sam: We're still in heaven right now?
Laura: We're still in Elysium.
Taliesin: It's not quite heaven.
Travis: Are there any other gods here that we should curry favor with? For? Of?
Laura: Are there any more gods here? Not that we know of.
Sam: We forgot to ask.
Travis: Did we?
Laura: Yeah. I don't think Ioun is here.
Matt: You're looking at the series of the Sun Tree cousins, one of which you've met, scattered amongst this glade surrounding the central citadel.
Marisha: What a douche.
Sam: No other people? Guards? Nothing.
Matt: You have the guards behind you, the large planetar and deva entities that stand there, armored in their golden plate, after ushering you out, are standing guard.
Laura: Maybe we can ask them.
Sam: Sure. I'll go up to one and say, hello there, big fellow.
Matt: Standing a full ten feet taller than you, practically, the wings slightly bent, the large planar entity kneels down. "Hello."
Sam: Hello. Vacation Scanlan here. Couple questions. By the way, was he one of the ones who fought in there?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Sam: Oh. Do they all look alike? 17 plus one.
Matt: Hard to tell. You didn't pay a lot of attention.
Sam: Okay. Hey, just wondering, a few questions. A: How does one get out of here? Is there a door to another plane?
Matt: "I imagine the same way you came in."
Sam: A god brought us here. All right, cool. Number two: Are there any other like your Dawnfather around here? Any other gods in the area?
Matt: "Across Elysium, there are two deities that call it home: the Dawnfather and the Everlight."
Sam: So we covered our bases. Out of curiosity What are you called?
Matt: He looks very closely, and you get sense that part of its nature is scanning through you; it's getting a sense and a read of you as an individual, and it says, "No one you need to worry about." Stands up and then takes two steps back (heavy footfalls) into place and looks straight ahead.
Marisha: Scanlan, you should remember that line, that's a good one.
Sam: Yeah. I already forgot it. I'm too intimidated. Was it no one or something? I don't know. Well, good speaking to you.
Matt: Still looks out. Doesn't respond.
Sam: Well, how do we get out of here? Can she take us home?
Marisha: Yeah.
Liam: She does on the daily.
Sam: I know, but I don't know. They talked about some sort of a gate that keeps the gods out and the bad gods in.
Matt: To remind you of what happened last time. There was talking about possibly... or at least there was the Trammel, the Prime Trammels that were used previously to seal the Chained Oblivion, Tharizdun, and that the orchestrator, the designer of those was Ioun, the Knowing Goddess. Ioun, however, has sealed herself away, being a wounded god, long recovering, and the only information that Pelor has of where she hid herself, the key, essentially, is not an object but a person. You're seeking an individual, of which you were given a solar light map of a single small home in a forest ravine not far from a place that you've noticed was near the Pools of Wittebak, which is in the Cliffkeep Mountains.
Sam: Yeah, but there was also a mention of some Divine Gate that keeps people from--
Matt: Well, the Divine Gate is a known existing entity. It's essentially a large gate that prevents the gods from returning to the Prime Material Plane.
Liam: It's like a metaphysical screen door that keeps flies out.
Laura: So the gods can't get in and out.
Sam: Sure, sure.
Marisha: Yeah, the Prime Trammel. Which we now have to get--
Laura: We have to get near the the Cliffkeep Range, near the Pools of Wittebak, is where we need to go.
Marisha: And the Cliffkeep is not too far from Whitestone?
Matt: Cliffkeep Mountains go across a lot of the northern side of Tal'Dorei, from what you're familiar with. Like, we're talking Kraghammer to Gatshadow to the Jorenn Village. There's a lot of things. It's like a big horizontal mountain range that caps the top part of the continent.
Marisha: Do I recognize the city that I can get us to that's close?
Matt: Fort Daxio or Kraghammer.
Sam: Haven't been to Kraghammer for a while, although Daxio might be worth a check.
Taliesin: What's closest to the pools?
Matt: Probably Terrah or the Pools of Wittebak. Those are the two that are closest.
Laura: What is Terrah?
Marisha: My home.
Matt: Terrah's not your home.
Marisha: Sorry. Sorry, Terrah is the Earth Ashari.
Sam: My other home, summer home.
Matt: The home away from home.
Liam: Can you also remind me where my Vecdar made me feel Vecna-- where on the Prime Material Plane?
Matt: Yes. Oh, where?
Liam: Yeah, we talked about it, but I can't remember.
Matt: You did, yes. It seemed to be hundreds of miles northwest of Vasselheim. You didn't sense any movement, but you knew the general direction and distance.
Liam: And that was yesterday.
Matt: Correct.
Laura: Teacher?
Matt: Yes, Laura?
Laura: I was excited the last game and somehow have misplaced my Pelor champion piece of paper.
Liam: Oh, she doesn't get to have it now. That's how that works.
Laura: I don't know how it happened! It's not with my stuffs.
Matt: That's okay, I remember what it does, and if you decide to use it--
Laura: You'll tell me? Okay.
Matt: I won't tell you. You tell me you want to use it.
Laura: Oh shit, okay. I'm sorry. I had it, and it's not here.
Taliesin: It's weird how he's so nice and yet it still feels like you are in so much trouble.
Laura: I'm in a lot of trouble, you guys.
Liam: He's calm, but indifferent. Like the Dawnfather.
Matt: All right, so what would you like to do?
Travis: Yeah, what would we like to do?
Marisha: Should we go to Terrah? Check in with them, I guess, while we're there?
Taliesin: Seems prudent.
Marisha: And talk to Pa'tice.
Travis: Yeah.
Marisha: All right. We ready to go?
Taliesin: I'm very ready to go. This is lovely and everything, but I've had my fill.
Marisha: I will burn my 8th-level spell slot to Plane Shift us to Terrah.
Matt: To Terrah, all righty.
Marisha: Mind the gap.
Taliesin: What gap?
Marisha: Don't worry about it.
Travis: No effects from eating that fruit, right?
Matt: No, you didn't sense any effects from that fruit, at the moment.
Travis: Didn't remove a curse or anything?
Matt: No, you didn't. Nothing really caught you up to speed, in that.
Laura: Are we by those fruit trees again?
Matt: There are no fruit-bearing trees directly near you. The Sun Trees are around you. Further in they do, yes. All righty. Bringing up my notes on Terrah, since that's where you're going.
Marisha: Yeah, I should probably--
Laura: I'm so confused about the order of things. If we go to Ioun, and we don't have everything we need for this Prime Trammel, are we fucked? I know we need godly power in order to imbue them, right? Or something?
Liam: Either here or soon we need to sit and work this out.
Sam: What do we need to bring into the trammel?
Laura: Well, Pelor gave me this. Snap, snap, snap, zip. This. It's a stone and it's supposed to be strong enough to--
Liam: Power the trammel?
Laura: Part of it? Not all of it.
Marisha: We need to collect more, though, right? We have to get like eight or something.
Sam: Wait, it said that?
Matt: You weren't given any indication as to how many you needed.
Laura: But it did seem like this is not enough.
Marisha: Oh no, wait, Ioun was healing for eight centuries. That's where I got that number. Sorry.
Travis: I could do it, too. Five. Five stones of power.
Matt: All right, so as you complete your spell, Keyleth, you step through the base of the nearest tree, possibly the same one you spoke with earlier if you want to be a dick about it.
Marisha: Oh yeah! Let's walk through that asshole. That sounds worse for us. But fuck it.
Matt: All right, you aggressively stampede through the center of this one tree and emerge on the other side from one of the surrounding trees on the Terrah village. There are a number of these pseudo-petrified or dried-out large-trunk trees that seem to have slowly died off from the heavy tectonic shifts and small quakes that happen in this area, that have made a lot of the land unable to support large forms of plant life, or at least the trees that used to exist here. So you step out and emerge from the exterior of the village as it domes down into this small crater that you recall seeing before, where most of the village inhabits the central portion, and the village is there before you.
Marisha: What were the shard things called again?
Matt: The shard things?
Marisha: The things we need to collect?
Matt: There wasn't really a name for them more than they're small pieces of essence of the deity.
Marisha: So we need pieces of god.
Liam: Does the little seed of light given to my sister look anything like the little seed that Scanlan and Vax saw from riding the shadow creature in the sky?
Matt: No. In a sense that it's a small source of power of some kind, but what you saw there was maybe about that large on the platform. What she has is bead size.
Laura: Is it this size? Or this size?
Matt: Comparable to each. So you stand outside of Terrah. What are you doing?
Sam: What time of day is it? How tired are we?
Matt: Based on when you left, it would still be probably-- well, you were over in Vasselheim, which means it's getting dark, actually. I'd say with the way the sun has passed through the sky now, you've just gotten past dusk. There's still light in the sky, but it's going from oranges to purples to dark blues on the horizon, and you can see hints of firelight, torchlight and candlelight from within the actual city below.
Sam: Well, what are we going to need on this trip? Maybe we should get whatever supplies we need. Is it far? Are we going to become gas?
Travis: Are we going underground?
Marisha: Oh, to Terrah?
Sam: No, we'e in Terrah. But the next day, we're going to the--
Taliesin: To the pools.
Marisha: Do we want to stay the night here, then? I can't mist us right now. I'm tapped out. Camp here.
Laura: Vax? Can you sense Vecna? Is he still in the same place?
Liam: I can sense him?
Matt: You can sense him. He is, from your current location, thousands of miles from you.
Laura: Oh, hard to tell, then?
Liam: He's still really shitty, though.
Matt: Yeah, very heavy west-northwest direction from you, currently.
Sam: Well, sleep? Do we need to get any intel on where these pools are? Do we need anything?
Laura: We should maybe talk to the people of Terrah? It's not that late.
Marisha: Yeah, let's go. They have a spare room for us.
Travis: Are you the leader of all the people?
Marisha: I'm the leader of the Air Ashari and the Voice of the Tempest.
Travis: Is that a yes or a no? You don't have to fucking brag.
Marisha: No, there's four of us, and I'm one of the four.
Sam: Do you know the one who lives here?
Marisha: I do.
Sam: Then let's go see him or her. Or they.
Marisha: No, we can just go, like I was saying five minutes ago. Let's just go.
Matt: All right. So as you walk down into the village, a number of the guardians step out quickly, seeing an approaching party, however, recognizing Keyleth and her station immediately, turn into an escort that leads you to the center portion of the village.
Marisha: I request Pa'tice.
Matt: Quickly enough, they go and retrieve Pa'tice. You see the elderly form of the leader you've met before step out, the graying hair, the weathered dark skin tones, the long greens and brown leathers that drape off, showing hints of the knees and lower feet, the large walking staff that he carries at his side as he approaches and the headdress that seems to be a combination of thick twines and shale shards that have been woven in, steps forward. "Keyleth. An unexpected visit, most definitely."
Marisha: Kaitiaki.
Matt: "Kaitiaki."
Marisha: Pa'tice, I am so sorry for the late intrusion. We've just gotten back from the plane of Elysium, so we're a little tired. Yeah, we're fighting a god right now, well, more of like a demi-god, so have you heard of Vecna? Sorry, I'm probably getting ahead of myself. Do you have any food? Let's talk over dinner.
Matt: "We have food, yes. You are guests of Terrah. Please, we will provide whatever you require. Come, provide them a meal!" And he puts his hand out and they run off quickly.
Taliesin: I like that people just feed us. We show up, and there's food.
Sam: You've been used to that your whole life.
Taliesin: Not at home.
Sam: I have to sing for dinner. You just say--
Taliesin: Have you ever tried not singing for dinner?
Sam: Maybe I'll get more food.
Taliesin: You might!
Liam: You did have one year-ish where you were on the skids. You did your Prince and the Pauper bit for a little bit.
Taliesin: It's a big vague, but yes. I was on a boat for quite a while.
Travis: Oh my god, can we eat food? (laughter)
Matt: And quick as that, you guys make your way down. It's a modest meal, but it's a meal nonetheless. Mostly hunted creatures of the local mountainside, some dried beets and root.
Marisha: We always try to source locally.
Taliesin: Charmingly provincial.
Matt: (laughs)
Laura: Keyleth, perhaps you should let your people know that the world is in danger.
Marisha: So the world's in danger, as she said--
Sam: The waiter is like, what?
Liam: Runs out the door.
Marisha: Aw shit! I just induced panic.
Matt: Pa'tice, who's sat down with you, says quickly, "We have been made aware via the other Ashari that there is some danger possibly coming. We are awaiting word of what to do other than keep ourselves in a defensive position. We have to guard the rift, of course. But should there be a call to action, we'll do what we can. I'm unfamiliar with this Vecna, but whatever you plan, please be careful."
Marisha: (sighs) Okay. More than anything, I think I would want you all to be relief for the surrounding area and surrounding villages if anything disastrous were to happen. I know you have to guard the rift and that is insanely important and especially right now with someone like Vecna who could potentially abuse that. But if anything were to happen, I don't know if you could house extra people during a disaster.
Matt: "We are quite good at assembling makeshift and temporary lodging. The rock is our friend, if you will."
Marisha: Yeah, that's more, I think, what we would need.
Matt: "Of course, of course! Not a worry."
Marisha: Currently, Vecna is just north of Vasselheim, close to Pyrah.
Matt: "Have you asked Pyrah for aid, as well?"
Marisha: They've also been put on alert, but we have not personally been there yet since this has happened.
Matt: "Well. Good. They're closer. But we're happy to help if we can."
Marisha: Yeah. Thank you.
Laura: Things are happening very quickly. We just happened here first.
Matt: "We're happy to help. Where are you off to?"
Sam: The Pools of Wittebak.
Matt: "What brings you towards the Pools of Wittebak?"
Sam: You know this place?
Matt: "It is a series of poisoned wells and hulking, stupid giants."
Sam: Hulking, stupid giants?
Laura: Giants? At the pools?
Matt: "Yes."
Laura: I thought it was something about gnomes there.
Matt: "It was once."
Sam: They grew. (laughter)
Laura: Is that something you can do, Scanlan?
Sam: I don't know. (laughs)
Matt: "They're geothermic large puddles across the mountainside. Various minerals being lifted up from the deep waters beneath the mountain. Heated, bubbling, boiling, steaming. But the giants moved in hundreds of years ago, stomped around, and ended up filling the entire subterranean gnomish city of Wittebak with fumes and poison. Killed most of them, and the rest fled to Kraghammer."
Liam: Do you all ever broach the area or do you just stay clear of it?
Matt: "Best to avoid, we have our own business to deal with. And it's 100 miles from here. It's not much of an issue."
Taliesin: And the pools are naturally poisonous?
Matt: "Well, some are toxic, some are not, but since the giants moved in and ruptured some of the natural formations, some of them have grown toxic or acidic, yes."
Marisha: Do you know if people still try to live there? We're looking for someone.
Matt: "If they are, they're foolish."
Marisha: Okay.
Taliesin: That's our kind of people.
Laura: Maybe the person we're looking for is a giant.
Marisha: Maybe.
Sam: Do you know what type of giant? We've seen a few types of giants. Do you know their make and model?
Matt: "The dumbest. Hill giants."
Laura: Hill giants.
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: "Easy to outsmart, difficult to outrun. They'll eat anything, even small little gnomes."
Laura: Seems like they ate a lot of them.
Sam: (laughing) I guess so.
Laura: Pasty, I have a question. Do you know anything about Ioun?
Matt: "I know of the name."
Laura: But not much.
Matt: "We're not the most devoted people."
Laura: I know.
Marisha: I saw that. (laughter)
Matt: "I can't imagine I'd have any information you wouldn't."
Laura: Okay. Just checking.
Matt: "My apologies."
Laura: This food is really good.
Matt: "Yes! Enjoy your meal!" And he gets up and walks away.
Taliesin: He was so officious.
Laura: I thought we were walking into a fucking lake with gnomes living there. I didn't realize we were going to fight giants.
Travis: This got so much better all of a sudden.
Taliesin: If it were easy, it really wouldn't be us, would it?
Marisha: So the question is, is there actually someone of some minor intelligence living there that is this magical key, or did that person get eaten by a giant?
Taliesin: I cannot believe I'm about to say this. I'm inclined to believe the god. They're in the position where trying to trick us out of leaving is not necessary. They could've just told us to leave and be done with it. That information just wouldn't suit them, I don't think.
Marisha: I'm not saying it's bad information, I'm just wondering who the key is.
Laura: It's possible the key is now inside of a giant's stomach. In which case, it still would be inside of someone. Just a different someone.
Marisha: Yeah. Maybe they're still living inside. Maybe it's like a Moby Dick situation.
Matt: You do recall the map that was shown to you by the Dawnfather Pelor. It was adjacent to the pools, not actually in the Pools of Wittebak. It was within a forest, and was a home.
Laura: Oh! I remember it now! It was a home inside. Oh, I drew a little map of it. Yep, that's it. Yes, it's adjacent to the pools, but there's a home in a forest. Did you like it? That's what my map was.
Marisha: Can we theoretically just mist over everywhere?
Laura: I mean and look out for a home in the forest? We'll have to fly pretty low. I'm assuming the home is going to be covered by treetop.
Travis: We never travel traditionally anymore. I'm just saying, I miss the romantic aspects of traveling the countryside. It's like fast forward, immediate gratification, fucking you know.
Sam: The Dawnfather said we must hurry or else the world will end.
Laura: It's very far. We could Misty Step to the forest and then walk in the forest?
Travis: Why are you fucking talking to me like I'm a child?
Laura: No reason, darling.
Travis: Okay. That would-- okay. (laughter)
Liam: Once this is all done, Grog, you and I will go on a long trek together.
Travis: Yeah? Yeah. I dig that.
Laura: Don't be dark and creepy and make it sound like you're being nice. I know you're being dark and creepy right now.
Travis: Oh, hey. Don't get after my camping partner like that, all right? Shit. Chill.
Liam: Can't predict this one.
Travis: No marshmallows for this witch.
Marisha: It is a little weird to be making promises, though.
Taliesin: Well, on that chipper little side note, I think we should turn in for the evening.
Sam: Yes, do we have lodging?
Matt: Lodging is provided for you. They have a number of various guest tents and small buildings that provide you with space. Not the highest of quality of places you've slept in, probably, and if you wanted to provide your mansion instead, you're welcome to, but ample food, quiet sleep. It's a comfortable evening's rest. You all find yourselves through the evening. As you sleep, and having this being the first time many of you have slept in Terrah, it takes you a while. There is just a general low hum or vibration to the ground that you sleep on. You get the sense it's probably proximity to the Rift, but there is this slow, perpetual (rumbling). It's like a weird, low rumble. Like a heavy bass sound that never seems to dissipate that you hadn't noticed until you were trying to quietly sleep. But it's not off-putting and within ten or 15 minutes, it actually almost helps to lull you to rest. You all come to in the morning, gather your supplies, and are preparing for the next leg of your journey. What do you wish to do?
Travis: Could I attune, either before I go to sleep or when I wake up, to the Dwarven Thrower instead of the Bloodaxe?
Matt: You may. All right. Any other attunements, anyone wishes to--
Liam: I'll set the Deathwalker's Ward to acid.
Matt: All right, to acid. Boom.
Laura: Before everyone else gets up, can I go find where Vax is sleeping?
Matt: You may.
Laura: This is a tent. What do I do? Do I knock? Do I shake it? I'm not sure. Scratch?
Matt: They're lodging made from large pieces of shale and rock, jammed into a somewhat triangular pattern to form an earth yurt, if you will.
Laura: Oi. Vax. Are you naked?
Liam: Yes.
Laura: Put some clothes on, then. Jesus. Keyleth, sorry.
Marisha: Keyleth opens the shamble door first with a little earth movement. I'm dressed. Yeah. I'm not like that.
Laura: You don't sleep naked?
Marisha: I'm going to go get coffee.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: (laughs) Keyleth darts off in the distance and the two of you are left within the tent.
Laura: Are you decent?
Liam: Yes.
Laura: I'm coming in.
Liam: I'm still naked.
Laura: Ugh, come on! So fucking weird. (groans) I turn my back to him.
Liam: I start putting on the rest of my armor.
Matt: Okay. (laughs)
Laura: Can I ask you a question? Well, I'm going to.
Liam: Of course you can.
Laura: I look down at my feet. Why didn't you ever try to take these back?
Liam: Well, they're going to be yours, anyway.
Laura: Oh, Jesus. You know, the only reason I do things is that I take great joy in irritating you. If you don't show irritation, it makes it not worth it. (sighs) Can I turn around now? I'm turning around.
Liam: I am covered.
Laura: Good. Why are you so calm? You're so calm and confident now. It's weird.
Liam: I mean, I'm on bonus time.
Laura: Is he still cold?
Matt: His skin is colder than a warm body, yes.
Liam: But I'm not Bobby Drake, right?
Laura: What's his heartbeat like?
Matt: (very slow heartbeat)
Laura: (groans) Jeez!
Taliesin: Wow, way to hang onto that one, Matt.
Liam: But look. (slashing noise) I mean, look.
Laura: Is there blood?
Matt: Yeah, he bleeds, and it's a pretty open wound. You watch as the wound slowly seals itself up.
Laura: (gasping) No fucking way!
Liam: Oh, I didn't know it did that. (laughter)
Laura: That's really cool.
Liam: Thank you!
Laura: Wow.
Liam: I don't know, this is the dumbest conversation. This is bonus time. I shouldn't be here. It was the long sleep or come back and help.
Laura: So she gave you the option and then you came back and now you're what? Super? Super half-elf?
Liam: Well, I'm just following through on a promise made.
Laura: And we defeat Vecna and you're done, you're gone. That's it? Instant? Is it like we kill him and you're gone that second or is it like we kill him and you're here for another week or until the Raven Queen realizes that you're still here?
Liam: There isn't really a handbook.
Laura: She didn't tell you?
Liam: When Vecna is destroyed, she will call me back to where I would be right now. I expect everyone-- Keyleth and I have barely spoken-- I expect everyone to be sad, but I wish you wouldn't be so sad, not exorbitantly so, because I--
Laura: Exorbitant? That's a good word.
Liam: I read. Not as much as some, but I read. This is the path that I have chosen for myself and I did it based out of desperation, at first. But everyone dies.
Laura: I know.
Liam: And I think our group has become a little spoiled. We're not your ordinary group of idiots. We have blessings.
Laura: We're blessed idiots.
Liam: Blessed idiots, yes, and I know that we've gotten used to feeling like we can overcome losing anyone, but your average farmer or seamstress doesn't come back. And everybody dies, and all that matters is what you do with what you have, and I have done a lot, and I've taken great pride watching all that you have done. And I have good friends and I have fallen in love. More than most, I've had.
Laura: Yeah. After you die, do you stand by her side?
Liam: That I don't really know. I imagine she'll keep me close.
Laura: Do you like her now?
Liam: Yes.
Laura: That's good.
Liam: She's necessary and she's of use, and I like that.
Laura: She brought you back to us for a while. I like her, too. Anyway, do you want the fucking boots back? Fuck! Yeah, sure, yes, fine, that's fine. I wanted to give them back, so there you go. I'm glad you asked for them back.
Liam: I don't have a lot of time. They really are my favorite thing.
Laura: I know.
Liam: Physical thing.
Laura: Just make sure you write it down somewhere that after you go back to the Raven Queen that your sister is your favorite in the universe.
Liam: Dear, every stitch on my body is yours when I am gone.
Laura: I don't want every stitch. None of it's worth you leaving.
Liam: I slide my feet into the shoes and I wiggle my toes around. Oh, I'm sorry. I also have a confession to make.
Laura: What?
Liam: I don't exactly have your shoes anymore.
Laura: What?!
Liam: I think that I left them in the Feywild.
Laura: The Feywild?
Liam: Yeah, I think I dropped them into a bog. They didn't fit me.
Laura: You are a motherfucker. You couldn't have just put them in the Bag of Holding?
Liam: I'm still me.
Laura: Great, wonderful. I like being barefoot.
Liam: You have very cute, small feet that fit in the boots that you gave me that did not fit my feet.
Laura: That's great.
Liam: There's probably shoes here.
Laura: Probably. All right.
Liam: I pull out her shoes and I put them down.
Laura: Well, at least there's that!
Matt: Got your shoes back. Keyleth returns with some coffee. The rest of you come to consciousness, and the morning sun is now blaring down over the Cliffkeep. It's a strangely clear sky for the north. While a lot of it is relatively cold usually, you're used to seeing the snow- capped mountaintops-- oh, you found it! There you go.
Taliesin: It was with you the whole time.
Liam: Must have been inside your shoes.
Laura: Oh my gosh! I put it in the safe place and I didn't realize it!
Travis: Thank you, chat.
Laura: Did they really know where I put it?
Travis: Yeah, they know where your shit is.
Sam: The chat knew where you put your stuff?
Travis: "It's in the page in front of your blue divider."
Sam: No way!
Laura: Wow, thank you. Thank you, guys!
Liam: How many fingers am I holding up?
Matt: So bringing it back in, guys.
Sam: Yes, we have a guest.
Matt: Yes. At some point. So what do you guys want to do?
Sam: Set off! For the Pools of Hatabah! (laughter)
Taliesin: For the forest near the Pools of--
Sam: The adjacent to the Pools of Hatafah.
Travis: We didn't want to bring any extra muscle with us, do we, from these peeps? Oh wait, we're misting a long ways away. Never mind. Sorry. Forget it.
Liam: Grog, you are our extra muscle.
Travis: See! High five! Up top.
Liam: I'm not dead.
Travis: His hand's cold.
Matt: So you're traversing via your Wind Walk?
Marisha: I guess. Are we wind walking there?
Laura: (mispronouncing) Wind.
Marisha: (mispronouncing) Wind walk? Wind walking.
Liam: (mispronouncing) Wil Wheaton!
Sam: Hey, before we leave, real quick  Kiki.
Marisha: Yes.
Sam: Can you send messages or anything?
Marisha: No, man. We have been through this with our entire group so many times.
Sam: It's just you're so powerful.
Marisha: Thank you.
Sam: Let's go.
Marisha: What do you need?
Sam: I would send a letter, but it'll take weeks. So forget it. We'll be somewhere close to somewhere with magic soon.
Marisha: We can leave it in the hands of the Ashari, see if they can find somebody.
Sam: You trust these folks?
Marisha: Yeah. They're all right.
Taliesin: They're not the worst.
Marisha: They're not the worst.
Sam: All right, I'll scribble a little note and say-- well, no, there's no way they can get it to-- it's too far! It's too far!
Taliesin: I was really excited to see your face when you handed it to them and they're like, what are we supposed to do with this?
Sam: Here, I'll show you, Grog.
Travis: Write it out, bitch!
Sam: I write, a sphincter says what.
Travis: A. As. Good message. That's a big word at the front.
Laura: You could have gotten the last one, though.
Travis: What!
Sam: Yes!
Matt: Pike taps you on the shoulder and is like, "I'll teach you that later."
Taliesin: Thank you for the Ashley Johnson simulator. That was weirdly comforting.
Matt: Curse you, Blindspot!
Travis: Yeah! Are we misting?
Sam: Yeah, let's do it.
Laura: Should we eat a feast first, or should we save that?
Taliesin: Let's save that.
Laura: Okay. I don't know what we're going to find!
Matt: That's up to you guys. So preparations being done, you gather your materials, Keyleth completes the Wind Walk spell and you all feel yourselves grow slightly lighter on your toes. You concentrate. Over the minute transformation, you turn into your mist forms and take off in what direction?
Marisha: Towards the Falafel Pools!
Sam: We wrote it down.
Taliesin: Falafel pool is actually really tasty.
Travis: Pools of Wittebak.
Laura: Yeah! Towards the mountains!
Sam: He said "which direction?" He did not say "Where are you going?" He said "which direction?"
Laura: We got to look at our map.
Marisha: We have it on the map!
Laura: We have a map!
Matt: Okay! Well, you have Terrah locked down. The Pools of Wittebak would not be on your specific map that you acquired earlier. You can ask around within Terrah within a brief time and figure it out. Somewhere between 100 and 120 miles, and he points in a specific direction. You mark the sun's traveling and where certain landmarks are.
Marisha: I quickly do the math of how fast I can travel and be like okay, it shouldn't take long.
Matt: It's an eastward direction from where you are.
Taliesin: You did actually, legitimately point east, too, which makes that even better.
Matt: That's weird.
Taliesin: Yeah, that is weird.
Matt: I'm putting points in my nature skill. Or survival, I guess. Anyway, too many editions in my head. (laughs) As you all take off into the morning sky, you begin to rocket over, and you're hitting jets of wind that are beginning to find their way over the mountain ranges, and you get blown a little off-course, but you maintain concentration as best you can in that direction. Who is leading this venture?
Sam: I've been there. No, I knew of it, right?
Matt: You knew of it, yeah.
Sam: But I don't know exactly where.
Laura: After listening to everybody, I'll lead the way. That way, I can keep an eye out for the forest next, too, and the house and all the things we're looking for. I got a good look at the map that Pelor held up in front of us, as well.
Matt: Right. Okay, cool. I need you to go ahead and make a survival check. Actually, for this, I'm gonna say-- yeah, because it would be tracking in the wilderness. So survival.
Laura: Survival? Great. Any advantage on that?
Sam: Wilderness is your favored terrain.
Matt: It's mountains, technically.
Laura: That's also my favored.
Matt: Then yeah, roll again.
Travis: Because that was a one.
Laura: Oh! So much better. 28.
Matt: Okay, that'll do it. Your speed is tremendous when in this form, so what would have been an extended trek on foot over a series of days, it takes you mere hours to eventually get to a point where you crest one heavy peak. On the opposite side, you can see down the cliffside, the edge reaches a slight precipice, and there you can see what looks to be for a mile or so a cluster of dozens and dozens of pools of water of different sizes, all jammed together in a geothermic cluster, where you can see bright greens that move to a deep orange-maroon at the edges from the various mineral deposits that have collected over hundreds and hundreds of years. You can see large columns of smoke and steam of different chemical colors rising out of various large pools, and at a glance down, you can see a number of shapes: a number of hulking, humanoid shapes; somewhere in the neighborhood of 40 to 50 or so scattered at different pools, moving in small clusters or gangs. Some of them are jumping in, cannonballing and swimming through the actual pools. Some of them are lounging around and lying. Some of them appear to be returning, dragging things from the nearby forest on the eastern side of the bank.
Marisha: This is a vacation spot. What's that water park nearby?
Laura: Wet 'N' Wild?
Matt: Essentially, for a few hundred years, you get the sense that the Pools of Wittebak have been a hill giant water park. You can see these large mounds of mud and scrap wood and things that have been built into these large hill giant domiciles onto the side of the mountain not far from the pools. It's become a definite hill giant wandering zone. So do you guys continue over the pools, down towards the nearby forest ridge?
Laura: Yeah, past the pools.
Matt: All righty. You come to the forest ridge, and you can see it's not thick forest. The ravine comes down off the precipice where the pools are. You get a few hundred-- I'd say, actually more than that. A thousand or more feet away from that precipice before plants even begin to grow. It looks like whatever toxic chemicals have burbled up in some of these pools have made a lot of the ground there unable to give any forest life or sustain any large trees. As soon as the forest begins, it's a dense little pocket, maybe a mile and a half, two miles across. That's what you've got. What do you guys want to do?
Laura: Oh man. I should try to track any footprints in there and see if there's something around the edges, maybe, that lead back to-- shit, I don't fucking know. It's only a couple of miles.
Matt: If you guys begin to do a loop-over, who's doing a quick pass over the patch of forest? All right, make a perception check.
Laura: It's the forest. Do I get advantage on that one? Perception? What is that, 21? 21.
Taliesin: 12.
Matt: Okay. Glancing over, you don't see any major glades or clearings. There doesn't appear to be any sign of bastions of civilization or any sort of logging going on. There's no areas where trees have been cut or cleared. It's a featureless forest top, from what you can see.
Laura: Can we fly down lower to where we're in between the trees?
Matt: You can go down into the forest, if you'd like. All right, who's going into the forest, then?
Marisha: I'll go.
Laura: I'll go. All of us?
Matt: So with Pike following suit, you guys all swoop down through the boughs of the trees and into the center of the forest itself. Within there, it's not a super thick canopy; it's not as heavy as the Feywild or some of the recent forests that cluster around Vasselheim. There are breaks in the canopy where you can see the sunbeams come through from the morning sun that's rising up higher and higher in the sky as you've traveled. The mist has burned away in this area, so it's a nice, warm forest. Glancing about, there is a lot of life in here. You can see signs of squirrels. You rush by what was a family of wolverine-like creatures that are rustling by. As soon as the wind scoots in and your mist forms come rocketing past, they all scatter and run off into the shadows. There's a lot of forest ground here to cover. For you to really super track with advantage, you'd have to go into human form. I'd give you a regular roll if you want to try and track in your mist form.
Laura: Not so much tracking right now, just a loose passover as we're going, looking for any kind of hunting traps or trails, signs of life of things that have been traversed a lot.
Matt: I'd say make an investigation check.
Laura: 27.
Matt: 27. Begin coasting through tree after tree through small, tiny bits of clearing that immediately come into large clusters of trunks and knotted branches that all merge and cluster at different intersections. After about 20 or so minutes of this, trying to do a large spiral around the forest inward, out of the corner of your eye, Vex'ahlia, you glance over and see a quick glimpse of something that appears to be more structured. You look back and rush over and there you see amongst the trees what appears to be a humble-looking two-story home. You see a small balcony built on the second floor that goes over one of the larger rooms in the bottom floor. It's not huge, by any means, and is hidden by a lot of the local brush and trees there. Can't get a lot more detail at this distance, though.
Laura: Okay. We land. I land.
Marisha: I follow.
Laura: And behind a tree, I'm going to take form.
Matt: You take your form? Okay. So all of you land and follow Vex?
Sam: Yeah!
Matt: You all take a minute to go back to your physical forms. You glance over, and there it is, standing before you. It's very shaded in this part of the forest. You can see a little bit of what looks to be interior light, very faint.
Travis: Like a normal person-sized dwelling?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Travis: Natural 20!
Laura: Yay!
Matt: It would be a little small for you, Grog. But you could walk in it. Proportionally, it looks maybe like it was built for a little bit of a smaller person.
Travis: Okay.
Liam: I want to start eyeballing the ground of the house for any kinds of traps set out. Is that investigation, yeah?
Matt: That is investigation.
Liam: 18.
Matt: 18. Okay. So you guys begin to slowly--
Travis: Wait. Before we do, there are no random nudist giants that have run over in this area, right? There's nobody sees us over here taking off?
Taliesin: You're worried about giants streaking?
Travis: Not particularly.
Taliesin: That was very specific.
Travis: Well, yeah, have you ever seen a giant naked? You'll never forget it.
Taliesin: I might. I don't know.
Sam: Are you suggesting we set up a perimeter?
Travis: Yeah! I mean, it's a tiny house, I don't really want to go in there. I like having exits I fit through.
Laura: I don't want whoever it is to think that we threaten them in any way. But then, if they threaten us, I wouldn't want them to attack us, either.
Travis: Yeah, I'll just knock the house down from the outside.
Taliesin: Let's keep this structure standing for now.
Travis: I'll stay outside.
Sam: Are we knocking properly or are we just going to Invisibility in and see who's in there?
Laura: I feel like maybe knock properly.
Taliesin: If you think long and hard about it, it's not like manners have failed us very often.
Laura: Yeah. But do keep an eye out for traps or anything weird on the way up.
Marisha: I think we've failed at manners often.
Taliesin: We fail at manners more often. We'll see how this goes. We'll try being nice.
Travis: I'll stay out here.
Sam: I'll go knock on the door. It seems like a smallish door, right?
Laura: Yeah, I'll go with you.
Matt: Okay, so what's the marching order?
Sam: I'll go first.
Liam: Nothing perked up my spidey-sense?
Matt: From this current glance, no. You guys are behind a tree at a distance.
Travis: No nude giants, right?
Matt: Currently, no, but you're keeping an eye out.
Laura: I'm walking with a smile, looking very friendly.
Matt: Who's leading the charge?
Sam: I'll go knock.
Laura: I'll walk behind Scanlan.
Matt: We have Scanlan and Vex'ahlia.
Liam: I'm going to go, as well, and continue to eyeball for traps.
Taliesin: I'll be hanging back a bit, as well.
Marisha: I'll be comfortably back, as well.
Sam: Before we knock, what were we told was in this thing?
Travis: The key.
Sam: The key. Inside a person, inside a house.
Laura: It's possible the person is the key; we're not sure.
Matt: Is Trinket within your necklace for this?
Laura: No, he's out.
Matt: Okay, Trinket is out alongside you. Grog?
Laura: He's a very friendly bear, look at him!
Travis: I'm outside the house.
Laura: Trinket, smile! Be friendly!
Matt: As you get across this small walkway towards the front, as you're walking with a big smile, Vex'ahlia, something catches your eye on the ground right before her and you watch as she steps forward. You reach out and grab her wrist and hold her back before she steps down.
Laura: What is it?
Matt: There is a large, rusted, iron bear trap that is open that you almost stepped right into.
Travis: That would be have been donesies.
Laura: I was being friendly, and it almost crushed me. Trinket, be careful, this thing was made for you.
Matt: Trinket walks up to it.
Laura: No, no, be careful! Spit on it!
Matt: (growling)
Laura: Can he spit? Can Trinket spit?
Matt: (bear spitting) It's not very-- it's more of a power drool, if you will.
Liam: Is it easy enough to walk around?
Matt: You can walk around that one, and you begin to see what looks to be seven other ones that are clustered around.
Taliesin: This is probably a giant-infested forest.
Marisha: Yes, that's exactly why. Bear traps are the biggest thing you can get for a giant.
Sam: Can we evade them and get into--
Matt: You begin to walk around. Yeah, you would, actually. As you step around one, you can see, at the front door, there is a welcome mat that says "welcome." As you're approaching it, you can see the welcome mat, there's just something a little off about it. Like, it's raised higher than the ground should be.
Travis: Willkommen.
Marisha: Trapped?
Liam: Well, I could attempt to dicker with it, but we could just knock the door over it if we really are going on manners.
Taliesin: Double-check to make sure the door isn't a problem, either. I'd imagine if the welcome mat is.
Liam: The door's going to blow up if we knock on it? I mean, we don't have much luck with doors.
Laura: Can I grab a stick and lift the edge of the mat up?
Liam: Do you want to do that?
Matt: Are you stopping her from doing that?
Liam: Yes, I am! Let me take a look at it, please! I've already detected it. I will attempt to disarm it with thieves' tools, correct?
Matt: Yes.
Liam: That's fine. That is a 29.
Matt: You walk over. You look and you watch. There's a small cord that is hidden amongst the brush that runs from underneath the mat through a small ring that goes up from the house, then up a branch or vine, so it's hidden amongst them. You look straight up about 40 feet, you see a nice, solid, thick trunk that is just (creaking).
Travis: That's some Predator shit!
Matt: Right above the door.
Taliesin: I feel like there's a complicated story that goes along with all of this. I'm really excited by it.
Marisha: Is this going to be an Uncharted kind of adventure?
Taliesin: We have found the cabin of Macaulay Culkin!
Matt: So knowing this, you walk over and grab the cord. Looking to see where the leverage is, you motion to Grog to come over and hold it. You find another piece of heavy stone that is by the wall to the side. With Grog's help, you snip it, bring it over, and tie it onto the edge of this piece of the stonework, like a small pole that was placed at the base of the house. It holds the weight of this suspended trunk and it no longer triggers based on the step.
Liam: Percy, I'm sorry, I know you like a good Rube Goldberg.
Taliesin: I was really excited by this thing. It's a shame to dismantle it.
Laura: It's still there. Maybe when we leave, we can crash it down.
Liam: Does the door look hinky at all?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Marisha: You did say kinky, right?
Liam: I said hinky. 18.
Matt: 18. It does not appear to be trapped, per se. It does appear to be locked.
Liam: Yeah, well, I don't want to pick it.
Laura: I want to use a stick, and oh! Here, Scanlan, you were going to knock.
Sam: (chuckles) What is this stick?
Laura: So that you don't have to touch the door in case it's magic.
Matt: Which as a note, the door, at full height, is about at the shoulders of most of you. You recognize this. This is definitely a homestead built on the scale for probably halfling or gnome. It's still pretty big for a gnomish home, meaning it's a little more spacious headroom, you'd probably be able to stand in comfortably, except for you, Grog, you're probably a little hunched.
Liam: So it's like an ostentatious gnome door. Little more than is needed.
Sam: Like me. I'll just rap on the door with my knuckles.
Matt: Okay. There is an awkward pause.
Sam: Hello? Bidet?
Matt: Darin, if you want to go ahead onto the stage, please. (cheering)
Laura: I'm glad he didn't murder us with his bear traps.
Sam: You need this? Oh, you need this. Oh! I've been goosed.
Liam: Hey, chaotic evil necromancer gnome.
Matt: You weren't supposed to tell them.
Darin: I didn't.
Matt: So you hear amongst your business for the day, out of nowhere (knocking) on the door.
Sam: Kaitiaki!
Darin: I open it.
Matt: Okay, you hear (clicking) what sounds like six or seven different locks unlock on the door, as it slowly swings open, and before them what do they see?
Darin: A very small, elderly gnome, bald on top, with a long white beard, and a bit of a distant look in his eyes, and he looks at you and says, are you real?
Laura: I think so.
Darin: You're real? Prove it! Say that you're real to my invisible frog companion.
Sam: I will step forward and say, hello, there. (whispers) I'm real.
Darin: Yes, you're real. There is no invisible frog companion. The voices in my head would not have spoken to that. (stuttering) They know a little bit better than that, but that doesn't matter, I haven't had people here in over 35 years. (laughs) But you're here! And you're real! Go away. (laughter)
Darin: Demistrik, show them out.
Matt: You watch as two tiny red claws come around the corner as these tiny, impish wings unfurl. You watch as a tiny imp releases from the edge of the doorframe. (wings beating) "Get out!" (door slamming) and slams the door.
Darin: And show yourself out, Demistrik. I don't need you here, 19 years of you is more than enough.
Matt: You hear muffling argument through the door as the voice goes, "I'll stay where I damn please. You gave me permission to stay. If anyone is going to leave, you're going to leave!"
Darin: I think you should go to Kraghammer and become a circus performer with a little tin cup and a little hat and say, "Oh dear, I am Demistrik, the magical imp." That's where you belong, I tell you right now.
Matt: "Sounds like a lot more fun than having to deal with you on a daily basis, you son of a--"
Darin: (offended cry) Language, imp!
Matt: The door creaks open once more. "Sorry." (door closing)
Darin: The door creaks open again. I'm sorry, as well. (whispering) For him, he's awful.
Liam: I stick my foot in!
Darin: No! (laughter)
Liam: I'm really very sorry to bother you, although I'm delighted to make your acquaintance. I'm having a very hard time not just smiling like an idiot. Could we trouble you just for a few moments? We mean no harm at all. We do need to talk to you. We've come a very long way... as farts. That's got to count for something.
Laura: (sing-songy) We could give you some interesting conversation. 35 years is a very long time.
Liam: We've done a lot, we've seen a lot, we could tell you all about it.
Sam: I play an old, traditional gnome song to soften him a bit.
Matt: Make a performance check.
Laura: What is an old gnome song?
Sam: I don't know. (laughter)
Sam: 24.
Matt: It's been a long time since you've heard music, let alone one that scratches an old memory of childhood. It's nice.
Taliesin: It's more or less whatever strikes your fancy, to be fair.
All: (humming Going to the Chapel)
Matt: You see the imp in the back going, "Ugh! Stop that racket!"
Darin: You don't even appreciate music. What would an imp song sound like? You can't say one, can you? Because you don't have music where you're from.
Matt: "I can, but it'll cause your ears to bleed! It sounds like this." (screeching)
Darin: I find that very entertaining.
Matt: "You're such a liar!" The imp (poof) vanishes before you.
Darin: He's gone. Don't worry about him. He gets a little bit... testy, if you will.
Sam: May we speak? May we have a moment of your time?
Darin: Oh, well... Very well. You can come in if you like. Oh! Be careful, there's illusions and thingamabobbers.
Liam: (stammers) Sorry, that's infectious. We have a really big guy. Are you all right with him coming in? Grog, are you all right with coming in?
Travis: How the fuck do I get in that damn door?
Liam: Have you not crawled on all fours before?
Taliesin: You should try it if you haven't; it's quite delightful.
Travis: Are you lying?
Taliesin: No. For once, no, I'm not.
Travis: Can I do an insight check on Percy?
Matt: Sure.
Travis: 19.
Taliesin: I have never actually been quite so honest in my entire life. I think you'll find it very therapeutic.
Travis: I roll in on all fours.
Taliesin: How does it feel?
Travis: I'm waiting for it to kick in.
Taliesin: Crawl forward, back a bit, stretch, downward dog, stretch.
Matt: You watch as this large, gray-skinned mountain of a man crawls his way in. You could duck-walk through if you really wanted to. This is worse than Gandalf in Bag End. All fours is probably the most comfortable means of transport through the house. But you walk in and immediately, you watch as your new gnomish friend is going around and quickly disabling small things, putting small keys and tying off strings and wires you saw that were set up around portions of the room.
Taliesin: I am going to try and map this in my head, the crazy stuff I'm seeing right now.
Matt: This place is a hoarder's den. You see shelves and shelves of books and papers and scrolls and stacks of them. You see on bits of furniture and chairs more stacks of books and sacks and satchels and quills and inkwells. Some spilled and left and dried long ago. This place is very lived-in, very chaotic, and very unique.
Liam: The first thing that I do as we come in is I scan the room, or rooms, for more Macaulay Culkin shenanigans.
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Taliesin: Maculkins. I think we can just call them Maculkins now.
Liam: That is a 21.
Matt: Okay. You do see there's one portion of the floor that he keeps avoiding, instinctually, that catches your attention. You're like, "why does he keep walking around that?"
Marisha: What's your name, friend?
Darin: Oh, well, that was taken from me a very long time ago. I only have what they call me. You know, names are an odd thing, aren't they? Sometimes a name can stick to you like blood on a knife or your fingers on a wallet that might not be your property, and then who you were is not who you are and yet... here we are.
Marisha: That oddly made way too much sense.
Sam: What do they call you?
Darin: They call me Sprigg. There's more. They call me Sprigg the Obnoxious.
Sam: Sprigg the Obnoxious?
Darin: Yes. It's not my given name; it was a name that was given to me when it was given to me.
Liam: Did you used to be obnoxious? Because I'm not picking that up.
Darin: Oh. We're rarely who we used to be.
Taliesin: Is there mercury in those pools? (laughter)
Darin: Who? Is that a friend of yours?
Taliesin: I sometimes will talk to the fourth wall. It's a thing; ignore it.
Darin: It's a domicile. There has to be four walls. If there weren't, it would be a yurt. I don't live in a yurt, dear boy.
Marisha: I sometimes live in a yurt. They're quite nice.
Darin: I have nothing against yurts. (laughs) Like a stick that you would put in a yurt so it wouldn't fall over. I would want it to fall over, therefore, I have nothing against yurts. (wheezing laughter) Demistrik!
Matt: The imp just appears across the room and just goes, "Good one. That was-- I am so sorry."
Laura: Pike? Do you think maybe a Greater Restoration is in order?
Matt: Pike goes, "Why?"
Laura: No reason.
Matt: "Could I just touch your hand for a second? Is that okay?"
Darin: (stuttering) Why?
Matt: "Just to see if we can help your day."
Darin: Do you not think that I'm real?
Matt: "Probably not."
Darin: I assure you, I'm real. I'm here. My companions are long gone. They were like you, like you, like you, and you, and you, and I'm all that is left. You are looking into a mirror of your future.
Sam: I'm going to look like you, or you're going to look like me?
Marisha: No, I know what he means. Who were your companions?
Darin: Memories. They're all memories now. I don't even remember their names. I remember some of them, but we were heroes and now I am here.
Marisha: Oh no.
Liam: Were there no other gnome folk in your party?
Darin: No, there was one like you, there was a big one, a mighty one. There was one like you, brave and kind.
Laura: That's like me! That's exactly like me.
Darin: There was one like you. Smart, yet sad. And you, as well. Yeah, and I was you.
Matt: Pike goes, "Please?" She grabs your hand and concentrates for a second, you watch as the holy symbol flares for a moment and the warmth passes through her arms into your hand. And it feels nice. It's like holding a freshly heated cup of tea. And as the spell completes and she pulls back. "That's all. Thank you."
Darin: Thank you, very kind of you. Don't ever do that again.
Matt: "Right, okay. Okay."
Sam: Your companions. Not to bring up sad times. How long ago did they go away? Perish?
Darin: 37 years.
Sam: And how, was it in a fight?
Darin: Oh, yes.
Sam: Against a powerful entity?
Darin: Oh no. Against ignorance, against bravery that should never have been. And that's why I'm here and they're not, because I ran, you see. I'm your future. You'll all be gone. You and you and you and you and you, and you'll be left.
Liam: While listening to all that, Vax slid his hand into Keyleth's and quietly listened to the whole thing.
Darin: Oh, well. Perhaps we should talk of other things. Should we?
Sam: Yes. Yes, we want this to be a positive visit for you, so is there anything we can tell you from the world outside that you might be curious about?
Darin: The world outside? Who needs the world outside? I have everything here, and what I need, dear boy, I have taken from Kraghammer. All these books over there, you see, those are mine. They should have been mine to begin with, and I took them, and now they are mine. (wheezing laughter)
Taliesin: I'm going to peruse some of these titles, quietly.
Sam: The books, you mean?
Darin: Yes. You'd like to look at the books, would you?
Taliesin: I find it's the easiest way to learn quite a bit about a person.
Darin: Oh, you're very welcome to look at anything you like. What will you give me, dear boy? I require something. And yet, what do I need, living here? Not much. Intelligence, no. Secrets, no. Love, no. Sadness, bravery, power. What do you have that you would give me?
Travis: I reach in the Bag of Holding. I take out Percy's glasses. Would you care for a pair of these testicl-- spectacles?
Darin: I seek power, dear boy, not silliness. If I wanted silliness, I would talk to a Sun Tree. No one ever should talk to a Sun Tree, they should only listen to a Sun Tree. And so I shall say again, if you would like to peruse my book and perhaps find what you are looking for, what will you give me that would bring power and redemption into my life?
Sam: What do you have, Grog?
Laura: (whispering) Give him some ale.
Travis: But that's not fucking power.
Laura: You don't know. Bet it's been a while since he's had some of that.
Darin: It seems you have powerful items.
Travis: I do. I have these Bracers of Defense.
Darin: Ah, but that is strength. I require power.
Travis: (softly) Shit. Fuck.
Taliesin: Well, I reach into my bag and start cleaning a small green shard of residuum, polishing it.
Darin: Demistrik! If you excuse me for a just-- while you look, I'll just talk to my imp. You'll pardon us. (whispering) A word, Demistrik?
Matt: "Ugh. Just one moment. What?"
Darin: The big one worries me. I think we should have a code in case we have to jump him.
Matt: "What code would you wish?"
Darin: Goliath grab! But we need to remember that. We need to remember that.
Matt: "Goliath grab. Good luck!"
Darin: We need some sort of mnemonic device to remember goliath grab. G, goodness gracious, grab that goliath. O?
Matt: "O? Huh. I'll tell you what, I've got your back."
Darin: I don't feel that at all. You're right in front of me. How could you have my back? (wheezing chuckle) I got you. (laughing) Go away. So what do you have for me? You've had ample time to look in your Bag of Holding to produce something very--
Travis: Powerful. Well, I do have one thing that seems to be pretty powerful.
Marisha: Oh no, Grog.
Travis: I pull out of the Bag of Holding a small leather case. I open the flap. I don't know if you have any interest in this, but my experience with these items has been very extreme. Would you care to take a card?
Darin: Would you care to give them to me?
Sam: All or just one?
Travis: No, you can pick a card.
Matt: Make an arcana check. Roll a d20 and add your arcana skill modifier to it.
Taliesin: You are a madman.
Darin: 15.
Matt: 15. You don't recognize what he's holding in his hands, but you immediately see the leather casing around it, and your essence being able to read certain elements of magic-- It does appear to be a powerful enchantment, whatever he has procured from the bag.
Darin: Indeed. Perhaps one card for one book?
Travis: Yeah, sure. I mean, Percy, do you have a book out of all of these that you want to read?
Darin: What are you looking for? What do you seek? What knowledge? I've got it all here.
Sam: We seek a key.
Laura: To find a very ancient goddess--
Darin: Oh, don't say Ioun.
Taliesin: We're not going to say Ioun.
Darin: You just did!
Liam: Is there another name that you would like us to use? Like a nickname instead of Ioun?
Darin: The Broken Goddess. I know more than Ioun, please! Ioun. Gods, what do they know? We know more than they, for we exist! We live! We adventure! They merely observe. Am I right?
Sam: You have a point. They don't do much for us in the day-to-day.
Taliesin: Are you saying you know more than Ioun?
Darin: Of course I know more than Ioun.
Taliesin: Can you prove that you know more than Ioun?
Darin: Yes.
Taliesin: So if I ask you a question that is almost impossible to answer, you could answer it before Ioun could answer it?
Darin: Could Ioun create a rock so heavy that even she couldn't lift it?
Taliesin: Oh, please. I'm far too clever to ask such a simple question. That's easy. I would have to ask something that was very difficult to answer.
Darin: I will give you your answer if you give me a card.
Liam: You know, I was just saying what a good idea I thought it was, but I thought you were talking about the entire deck, Grog. I think the entire deck is a fairer thing than to have him pull a card, because that seems unpredictable to me.
Travis: Yeah, that sounds perfect to me.
Liam: We're all in a small, enclosed space together, Grog, and I like this fellow.
Laura: Sprigg, it is quite powerful, yes, but also maybe slightly dangerous.
Taliesin: A bit dangerous, to be fair.
Darin: I'm here alone. Well, there's... oh, yes. Go peddle your papers somewhere where they'd like papers peddled!
Laura: You're not alone at the moment.
Darin: That's true!
Laura: This is very true. And I'd rather not put my life in the hands of you, not knowing you very well.
Darin: Some did. I'm here.
Laura: Yes.
Darin: They are not.
Laura: So something bad could happen, and you'd run away, and we'd be stuck here?
Darin: No. 37 years. I ran away. I've been here deciding how to live again, how not to run away. That's what all this is about, isn't it? You can't just hide from the world. I've done it! Done it for a long, long time. Maybe you being here means that I should hide no longer. Or maybe I just have an invisible frog friend. Maybe I have nothing here, and nothing here.
Taliesin: Whoever has devised these contraptions and created this safety for you is a genius. I'm not saying you're necessarily--
Darin: It was both of us.
Taliesin: I somehow don't think so.
Darin: What?
Matt: "It was all me."
Taliesin: I've had my own demons to contend with in my life, to make me doubt my own intelligence. I get the sense that your compatriot-- I hate to call it friend, here--
Darin: I hate to call it friend, and yet I do. Isn't that right, friend?
Matt: "Unfortunately."
Taliesin: What are you doing here?
Darin: You can tell them.
Matt: "No!"
Darin: Just tell him.
Matt: "No! Why, because he asked me?"
Darin: Yes! Be polite. They're guests in our home.
Matt: "Oh, it's not our home."
Darin: 19 years you've been here, ever since your master died trying to enter and got tricked into one of my traps, and now you're here-- does that answer your question?-- now, why don't you tell him what I just said?
Matt: "My master died trying to get in here on one of the traps, and now I call this my home."
Darin: Beautifully said. Bravo. You should be a little performer in Kraghammer. You know what the reviews would be? Not very good! Shameful behavior. Abysmal behavior from the Abyss itself!
Taliesin: We don't have much. Many of the things that we carry are very dangerous. Obviously, you have a great deal of genius here. I'm going to show him the elemental shard. I don't know if this would interest you, but I consider it to be of great value.
Matt: So you're showing him the residuum piece?
Taliesin: The last piece of residuum I have.
Matt: All right. So this is a sliver of what looks like green glass. It's finely polished, about that thick, that long. You've read about this. You've read that condensed residuum is very susceptible to enchantment and/or the focusing of short-term magic spells. It's expensive, it's lauded, it's hard to find.
Darin: I will use that Ring of Telekinesis to lift it up and take a better look at it.
Matt: You watch as it darts out of your hand and wisps up, maybe two feet ahead of him, and slowly rotates above him as he inspects it.
Taliesin: Impressive, but not as impressive as the giant log.
Darin: Oh, yes. But is there power in this, dear boy? Or are there only secrets? For you are secrets. He is power.
Taliesin: I may be secrets, and that is of me, but I believe there is power in its secret. People died for that. Many people.
Darin: People die every day. Except me. That's my punishment, child. I live on. I live on with my shame and my intelligence and you.
Laura: Because of Ioun?
Marisha: What's your relationship to her?
Darin: What is anyone's relationship to a god?
Marisha: Good question.
Laura: Some of us are champions. Some of them don't like them. Some of them worship them but don't really get respect. What's yours?
Darin: All of that and more.
Laura: So you're a champion? Are you a champion of Ioun?
Marisha: You're a champion of Ioun. Of course he's a champion of Ioun.
Darin: I wouldn't say that.
Taliesin: But we might, wouldn't we?
Darin: Champion of Ioun?
Matt: (demonic cackling)
Darin: Are you going to start calling me Ioun's Champion?
Matt: "Only if it bothers you, Ioun's Champion!"
Darin: I like it. Drat, eh? Drat. You tell them what you know of Ioun.
Matt: "She's a heinous bitch who got what's coming to her 800 years ago."
Marisha: What?
Darin: It's a bit common, but that is his belief. What is yours? What is your thought about Ioun?
Sam: We know that she possesses knowledge that could help us in our quest to save the world, and therefore, no matter what her personality is, she is valuable to us.
Darin: And yet, is there value in saving the world? Or should you just let it all go away?
Laura: No, no, I think we should save it.
Sam: Yeah, we're pro-world here.
Darin: Are you? That is interesting.
Liam: Sprigg, you're seeking power.
Darin: I seek redemption. There is great power in redemption.
Liam: We offer you redemption. Collaborating with us grants you the power to fell a would-be god.
Darin: Excuse me. For one second. Can I speak to you for just a second?
Matt: (flapping wings) "What?"
Darin: He's tricky. I think we should get a mnemonic device on what we need to do if he becomes too tricky. We should say, elf boy grab! E! For egads! There's an elf, we should grab him. L! Let's grab that elf boy.
Matt: "Right, all right." You guys can hear all of this.
Darin: F. Forsooth, I shall grab this elf boy!
Liam: I'm not an elf. Not an elf.
Marisha: Why do people like calling you elf boy and elf girl?
Liam: We have vaguely pointed ears. Not even fully pointed ears. My mother was not an elf.
Darin: Just a second. He's not an elf!
Matt: "We'll stick with the device. I've got your back."
Darin: I still don't feel it.
Matt: "You will."
Darin: All right. Hello!
Sam: Hi. Hi, mirror man. Listen.
Darin: All right.
Sam: Let's cut to the chase here. We need information from you.
Darin: Indeed.
Sam: You need something from us. Grog, give him a card.
Marisha: Wait.
Sam: We're dancing around this! We need this man!
Laura: He took the stone! Are you taking the stone?
Sam: Are you going to take the stone as a source of power? He said it's too mysterious.
Liam: I thought we were talking about redemption.
Darin: If you'll allow me. You've been very quiet.
Marisha: Yes, I'm a little freaked out right now. You're my worst fear incarnate. Sorry, that seemed very rude. My worst nightmare incarnate.
Darin: That didn't make it any better, dear child!
Matt: (cackling)
Darin: (shushing) Go ahead. Why am I your worst fear in a carnation?
Marisha: I've seen you in my dreams.
Darin: Hear that?
Matt: "Go get her, tiger."
Laura: Trinket starts chasing the imp around the room.
Matt: "No!" Up into the corner, (hissing). Turns invisible.
Darin: Oh, I guess you found that unbearable!
Sam: That was a good pun.
Matt: You hear the tiniest little demonic fart by your ear.
Liam: I'm also gently steering Trinket away from the floorboard in the middle of the room as he walked by.
Marisha: Somehow everything you have said since the minute we've walked into this building has made 100% sense, and I think that's what scares me the most, is I understand everything you've said.
Darin: It should scare you the most. I was one of you. I did what you did. 37 years ago, I did it. And we fought, and we fought, and they were right here. They were right here!
Sam: Who is they?
Darin: My companions.
Sam: And who were you fighting against? You, we?
Travis: Vecna.
Darin: No.
Sam: Gods?
Darin: It was silly. It was hobgoblins. It should never have happened. It was a simple fight, and they died, and I ran, and I can't even remember their names.
Liam: Sprigg.
Darin: Yes?
Liam: Would you like to be needed again? Maybe it's time to stop running.
Darin: What would I do?
Marisha: We can grant you power in items, but I don't want to speak for all of us, but I think all of us can speak a little bit to the fact that items don't grant you as much inner power as you expect them to.
Laura: Unless they're boots. And then they're amazing.
Marisha: Unless they're very highly argued and debated-upon boots, in which case I still think the argument--
Darin: Are we about to have a debate about boots? I'm against them! Your turn.
Laura: I am for them, usually.
Darin: Continue, Councilor, but watch yourself.
Laura: Have you any idea where the key to Ioun is?
Darin: In the boots? We're talking about boots, are we?
Laura: Yes. Boots that hold a key to Ioun's location. Specifically.
Darin: I think the key might be here, but I don't really know.
Liam: Sprigg, the world is on the brink right now. It's worse than hobgoblins. We've come here in great need, and the world is in great need, and the power that I offer you is making a difference.
Darin: Then make me believe in Ioun. We'll make a difference together.
Liam: Make you believe?
Marisha: Of course he believes. Believing is not the question.
Darin: Books everywhere, you see. That's something you can hold. That's something you can learn.
Marisha: That's something that's tangible. Ioun is distant.
Laura: But she could be tangible if you'd help us find her.
Marisha: What if we have found her? What if Sprigg is right? What if all of the information that Ioun knows is here in Sprigg?
Taliesin: I really want to look at these. I want to look at these books really quickly. I'm having a moment. I just want to start looking at these titles. What are these books?
Matt: You go over and start walking towards the edge of the nearest bookcase, and all of you at once-- everyone but Sprigg, actually-- suddenly hear a voice come through, filling your mind, filling your consciousness, filling your ears. Sourceless, delivered to your consciousness directly. "Thank you for showing me where he is." And that's where we're going to take a break.
Liam: Fuck!
Marisha: How? We don't have the eye! What a cock!
Taliesin: Oh my god, he's been in the troll dick all along.
Marisha: It's always been the troll dick.
Matt: All right, we'll be in just a minute. We'll be back here in a few minutes, guys. For the Twitch giveaway, we have this awesome Peruvian walnut dice tray, leather interior. It's very nice. It's the same type that I have, actually, back here, which is nice. Giving it away for somebody in the Twitch chat, so run on over, and the code for the evening is Sprigg. S-P-R-I...
Darin: G-G.
Matt: G-G. Double G.
Darin: S-P-R-I-G-G spells Sprigg, ladies and gentlemen, if you want to win that valuable prize.
Matt: So pay attention in the chat. When it's time to, go ahead and enter Sprigg into the chat, and one lucky winner will be announced when we get back here. See you guys in a few minutes! [break]
Matt: Hello, everyone, and welcome back. All right, so first and foremost, we have our winner for the dice tray from Wyrmwood. That is our friend k0sn1ght, spelled in the way that you spell your XBox Live name: k0sn1ght. Congratulations, you are the winner. Go ahead and contact Danoba and get your information and we'll get that shipped out to you. Bringing us back in.
Taliesin: That was fast.
Matt: Last we left off, you all, almost all of you, heard a singular familiar voice. The low, gravelly undead voice of The Whispered One fills your minds, saying, "Thank you for showing me where he is." In that moment where you all pause in place, you hear a series of simultaneous sounds (arrows firing) as a number of heavy crossbow bolts from nearby windows all fire simultaneously at Sprigg.
Marisha: Do I have time for a reaction?
Matt: No, you do not. This is a surprise round.
Liam: This is the sound of bolts, no.
Travis: It's all right, he can't die. It's cool. We're all right.
Matt: So that first one is a 24. What's your armor class?
Darin: My armor class is 19.
Matt: Okay! So you take 23 points of piercing damage.
Darin: Okay. Oh, there we go.
Matt: That's 17. That misses you. It strikes your shoulder and glances off. One bolt sinks into your chest and you look down and you see it's this big, long heavy metal bolt and it's jutting out from the side of where your shoulder and pec is. Another one rushes by and glances off your other shoulder. The third one--
Darin: Well, this is different.
Matt: That hits. That's a 25. That's 23 points of piercing damage.
Taliesin: Oh no.
Matt: That one actually misses; a six and a one. It slams into one of the nearby books right behind you, barely moving past your cheek. Fifth one, that is a 19 exactly, so you take 24 points of damage.
Laura: How many fucking bolts are there?
Marisha: 24?
Matt: They're all sneak attack. And that is 20.
Darin: Another one?
Matt: Another one.
Darin: Okay.
Matt: That one's going to be 26 points of piercing damage.
Darin: I'm gone.
Matt: You guys watch as all these bolts (arrows firing and impacting) into Sprigg's body and Sprigg falls back, unconscious on the side of the room. I'm going to bring out a map now.
Darin: Fly, you fools!
Marisha: (yelling) No, Sprigg!
Sam: Darin, it was really great having you on. Thanks so much.
Laura: Whoa, cool!
Sam: Whoa, this is a cute house!
Laura: Oh, I can't see inside of it.
Matt: Moving the top floor off.
Liam: There's crates of apples!
Sam: There's a sack of something in the corner! Oh my god, how are we all going to fit in there?
Matt: Sprigg is currently unconscious on the ground there. Percival was there talking. Trinket is off to the side.
Laura: Trinket! Where's the imp?
Matt: The imp is not currently visible. Pike would be over on the side here. Keyleth, Vax, where would you guys see yourselves right now? Actually, tell me where you would be. I think that's what I'm trying to ask.
Liam: I would be right next to Keyleth because I was holding her hand.
Matt: As I chuck you onto the ground.
Liam: It's all right. It's fine.
Matt: Yeah, comes back in a day later. All right, cool. So you're there holding that. Scanlan, where would you be?
Sam: Near Sprigg-ish.
Matt: All right, so I'll put you right there next to the scroll in the ground.
Liam: And Matt? Could you touch on the map where the bad man touched you? No, where the bad floorboard is?
Matt: Yes, actually, I can do that.
Liam: None of you know this.
Matt: None of you know this, except for you, which is actually why I'm not going to show you. You know how to avoid it, but nobody else knows where it is.
Laura: Where is the front door?
Matt: The front door is right there.
Liam: There, over by Grog on your right.
Sam: These trees need to move.
Laura: I know, these trees are a pain in our butts. Oh no.
Sam: There's cloaked men everywhere
Matt: You watch as one that was up in the stairs vanishes up top.
Travis: Oh, he actually made it upstairs?
Matt: He fired, and then ducked up there. I need everyone to roll initiative.
Sam: Initiative?
Matt: Yes. Including you, even though you're on the ground.
Marisha: Don't. Fuck. Me. Gil. It's fine. Gil did all right.
Sam: I don't trust Gil. I never roll on his dice.
Liam: Rarely. I have, but I got my Matt Colville meteorite.
Matt: 25 to 20?
Taliesin: 23.
Liam: 20.
Travis: 22.
Matt: Oh wow, so we have Percy, we have Grog, and Vax. Okay, 20 to 15?
Sam: 19.
Laura: Should somebody roll for Pike?
Matt: Yes, actually. Okay, yeah.
Darin: Also a 19.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: You've got a very low initiative bonus.
Matt: All righty, anybody else?
Laura: 13.
Marisha: 12. I don't know why I did deuces. 12.
Taliesin: Peace out.
Sam: NKOTB.
Marisha: 12 initiative, Wu Tang out.
Taliesin: That's our next shirt.
Sam: Quidd, everyone. Quidd.
Laura: Quidd.
Liam: Quid pro quo.
Matt: All right, so top of the combat round. The surprise round is done, you watch Sprigg fall to the ground, bolts sticking out of the side of the neck, the shoulder, and the body. Unconscious, now beginning to pool blood underneath where he's bleeding out, and you glance around and you see a series of shaded figures in the windows that all dart out of the way.
Marisha: Cowards.
Laura: Dicks.
Sam: Oh, they left. The fight's over, everyone.
Matt: Percy, you're up first.
Taliesin: Wow, this is a lot that happened. I'm going to click my boots, and I'm going to run up the wall and run upstairs.
Matt: Which, for the purposes of this, I will place the upstairs over here. So as you dart up, Percival, you run up the stairway there where the one guy you saw was standing.
Taliesin: Is he right there?
Matt: Yeah, he ducked out of the way, and there's also one figure that you recognize from the Shadowfell earlier. You see one of the ghastly creatures that was darting through the ruins leaping from from rooftop to rooftop. Its skin is grayish and long, its limbs lanky, its fingers curled into claws, and this long tongue dangling from his jaws, it's getting ready to run down the stairs as you charge him, and it goes (growls).
Taliesin: Manners! Action Surge!
Marisha: Yay, Manners!
Matt: Okay then.
Marisha: We're bad at manners, until now!
Matt: All righty, so what's the saving throw on that one?
Taliesin: It's a DC 20 strength. Oh, I'm sorry, no. Never mind. It's an attack roll.
Matt: Okay, so you have to roll first to see if you hit it.
Taliesin: 18.
Matt: 18? Yeah, that definitely hits. It hits, and you watch as you pull the sphere out and chuck it in the direction of the creature. Pulls its claws back, slams into its chest, and then unravels. It falls to the ground, prone, unable to move, right there in the middle of the floor.
Taliesin: Just making sure that I can do this.
Matt: Was that your action, there, doing that?
Taliesin: That was my action surge. I can only do one round. Just seeing if I have anything at a bonus that I can do.
Matt: You spent your action--?
Taliesin: My action, I activated my boots. My action surge activating that. Do I have anything I can do with a bonus action?
Matt: Not really.
Taliesin: I'm going to turn to the other guy and pull the ripcord on the glove angrily. (revving)
Matt: You load up Diplomacy. Good. That's your turn, Percy. Grog, you're up.
Travis: Me? Oh? Can I go into a rage?
Matt: Yes, you may.
Travis: And he fell where?
Matt: He fell right there, on the ground, currently bleeding out.
Travis: Can I run over to Sprigg and shove a-- should I shove a health potion in his throat?
Laura: Well, we've got healers.
Travis: Right. I'll run upstairs to see where Percy went.
Matt: You rage-run just past Percival and you see there's one creature bound on the ground and there's another guy who's there with his crossbow, he's trying to reload, who sees Percival and is getting ready to pull it up as you leap in front.
Taliesin: Smash him!
Travis: Do you mind?
Taliesin: Please!
Travis: Yeah. (rage noises)
Matt: Go for it. Roll for a double attack.
Travis: Reckless! Not Great Weapon Master. Two-handed with the Dwarven Thrower. That's a lot. 30, minus-- oh, there is no minus. 32.
Matt: 32 hits. Second attack?
Travis: 31.
Matt: Hits. Go ahead and roll damage for both.
Travis: So they're not giants. So I just roll a d10. That's a ten. Rage damage. 25.
Matt: 25 damage on the first hit?
Travis: On the first one. Second one.
Laura: 24.
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: Nice. With your hammer, two hands, whack right across the side of its head. You see the jaw unhinge from the side. As he pulls back, it's hanging loosely there, and the second hit you clock right in the side of the temple, and it nearly goes unconscious, and picks itself up again, gets its crossbow ready. It's still holding. It's not down yet, but it's hurt badly. You can see now, up close, you can see these figures, they're dressed in very, very tight black leathers, cloaks enshrouding their body, the hood is still up, but you've knocked it back. There you see a human male in his late 40s, early 50s, the head shaved completely bald, a tattoo of black tendrils around the left eye, and the left eye is missing from the socket.
Travis: Black tendrils? Okay, cool. That's my turn.
Matt: That's your turn. All right. Grog's done. Vax, you're up.
Liam: Okay, let's talk this out. Click the Boots of Haste. I think, with 120 feet of movement, I can blur up the stairs to where Percy is in probably 50 or 60 feet. And then finish that movement and go past the guy, out the window, with all of my movement in 120 feet or less. Okay, so I'm doing that.
Matt: There's also a window here, a window here, and a window here. Just so you guys know, and a window here, if you wanted.
Liam: Definitely understand. Blur up the stairs, shoot past Percy, shoot past that guy, out the window.
Matt: You're on the balcony now, looking right about here.
Liam: Do I already see those guys?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Liam: 19 plus 14 is a hell of a lot.
Matt: 19 plus 14? Yeah, you do see them. And you glance down, you can see they're hiding amongst bushes, and they're specifically stealthed. But you're keen of eye enough to see where they're placed.
Liam: I stealth, hide. Bonus action to hide. I'm going to use Luck. That's better. 27.
Matt: 27. Okay. You're not sure if they see you or not.
Liam: All right, then from this spot, if they're in range, I'm going to throw Whisper at one of them.
Matt: Right now, you are currently up here. So you glance off and you can barely see one that's over the edge of the roof right there. That's the only one you can see.
Liam: But I can see them and I can ignore three-quarters cover because of Sharpshooter.
Matt: So you barely see the edge of one there. Sharpshooter. I'd say yeah, you can. You can hit both, if you want.
Liam: So the one that I can see, hidden, I will try to throw Whisper. I'm going to hopefully sneak attack him and bamf there. That is a 28.
Matt: 28. He does not see you. So you have advantage on that if you want to roll again.
Liam: Right. Natural 20.
Taliesin: Turn him into paste.
Liam: Okay. (counting)
Sam: Did Pike roll?
Matt: Pike did.
Laura: What did she get?
Matt: 11. Typical Pike.
Marisha: She's after me.
Laura: Well, no, but Sprigg is right after Scanlan. He's before we are. So I'd rather get him up before.
Liam: So that one is 60 on that guy.
Matt: 60 points of damage?
Liam: Yes, and I bamf there.
Matt: As you chuck the dagger, like right towards where the center of the shoulderblades connect in the back he (groans) and you watch as the crossbow that he had drops to the ground and he crumples over on top of it, but he slowly starts getting to his feet out of the bushes. He looks really hurt, but he's still standing. And you appear right next to him there.
Liam: So I did movement, I hid for my bonus, I have action-action as a paladin. And action.
Matt: You have attack-attack as a paladin.
Liam: Attack-attack as a paladin. And then my bonus action. That was the first of attack-attack, so now I'll just do a regular attack, which is a 20--
Laura: (sarcastically) I'm so glad he got those boots back, I'm just so glad.
Liam: 30.
Matt: 30 hits.
Liam: That is a ten and I'm going to pump him full of poison. He has to make a DC check on 15.
Matt: That is a seven. No. Four plus three.
Liam: So he also gets, that was ten plus 14 total. 20 total, between the dagger and the poison.
Matt: So the second dagger, you shiv him in the side and he (groans) goes to spin with the heavy crossbow and try and pull away, and as soon as the poison through him he goes, (gurgles) and you can see blood vomit down the front of his chest, his eyes roll back and he twinges and falls to the ground.
Liam: And there's another guy there who can see me, right?
Matt: Yeah, and he's hidden, but he's like (scared, heavy breathing).
Liam: Whisper.
Matt: Okay, he's trying to see that you're not being seen.
Liam: That is 31. Yeah, okay. So that is two plus eight is ten, plus psychic damage. 18. I'm going to bamf there with Whisper.
Matt: Okay. All righty. You hit him and you stand there. You're right in front of him now. All righty. That ends your go. As you appear over on the other side, you realize that over in the clearing there, there is another one of the robed figures, this one clutching a long, black, smooth staff that crooks over in the front that looks like a hand holding an eye.
Marisha: What? Where? Who? There were more of them!
Liam: But you guys don't know that yet.
Matt: You guys don't know that yet, just him. Ending your turn, Vax. That guy on the ground is going to try and break free. That is a 17. DC 20?
Taliesin: DC 20.
Matt: It struggles on the ground and can't seem to break free of the current magic manacles that hold it in place.
Taliesin: Yeah, he's stuck. I love that we have floors!
Matt: Another one of these darts through the window, leaps across the way, right in front of Sprigg, and you being right there, Scanlan, goes, (angry hissing) and lashes out at you.
Marisha: He's going for Sprigg!
Taliesin: He's going for Scanlan.
Marisha: But because Scanlan's over Sprigg!
Taliesin: Oh, that's fair.
Matt: Makes two claw strikes at you. First one is 16 to hit.
Sam: Yes.
Matt: All right. You suffer eight points of slashing damage, and I need you make a constitution saving throw.
Sam: Oh boy. Not great. 16.
Matt: 16, okay.
Sam: Is it magical?
Matt: No, it is not magical, but you feel this pulse of some sort of necrotic disease hit your system, and you just manage to shrug it off. (relieved cheering)
Matt: The other claw comes towards you. That's a natural 20.
Sam: Natural 20 to hit, sure.
Matt: That is 30 points of slashing damage on the second hit. Make another saving throw, please.
Sam: That's 17.
Matt: 17. The second strike hits you and you feel as the side of your torso gets torn out of the side, the blood splatters onto Sprigg, who's already bloodied and now there's gnome blood on gnome blood. As you reach for your side, however, it does not take effect; you manage to shrug off.
Travis: Those are constitution saving throws?
Matt: Yeah. That ends the shadow ghast's turn. Sprigg, I need you to make a death saving throw, please. Roll a d20.
Liam: Come on, Sprigg!
Marisha: Come on, Sprigg!
Darin: 14.
Matt: Okay, so you're okay for now. You're stabilizing. You're not bleeding out, yet. Mark a success on your death saving throws there. Scanlan, what are you doing?
Sam: I am going to, bonus action-- down here, success, one.
Matt: Actually, before he even does that, what are you doing on your turn?
Sam: I'm going to heal him first.
Matt: That roll wouldn't matter because he may heal you before you come up. Don't worry about it.
Sam: I'll bonus action Healing Word him, 2nd-level. I will sing to him. I'll do a little line dance right in front of him and I'll say: (singing) I'll heal your heart, your achy breaky heart. I just don't think you'll understand. That if I heal your heart, your achy breaky heart, you got to wake up and kill a man!
All: Ooh!
Darin: (singing) If only you had used Mage Hand!
Sam: Nice!
Matt: So how much does he heal?
Sam: Seven plus six. 13.
Matt: You heal 13 hit points. That roll doesn't matter. You hear this echoing song in the back of your head. The second song today you've heard from your childhood. You come to consciousness. You wake up and look around you and you can see him singing to you as this giant horrible necrotic creature is looming right in front of you. You have metal bolts sticking out of your chest and an old sensation you haven't felt in a long time courses through your body, which is the need to survive.
Sam: It's my turn still.
Matt: It's both of your turns at the same time.
Sam: I will hold my turn.
Matt: What are you going to do?
Sam: Dimension Door, but I'm holding until either Pike or Keyleth heals him more. And I will also say to him, old man, do you have some fight left in you?
Darin: I hope so.
Sam: Hold that thought for one second.
Darin: Holding.
Matt: So what are you doing?
Darin: There's a bookcase, is there not?
Matt: There's bookcases here, bookcase there. There's books strewn and clustered in these corners.
Darin: I'd like to, if I could, use the Ring of Telekinesis to pull a bookcase down upon an attacker.
Matt: Okay. Currently there's a bunch of books up here on a shelf, you can pull them down on him if you'd like.
Darin: I would like to do that.
Matt: So from the ground, you yank a bunch of heavy tomes off of this large shelf that goes flying towards this creature. I'm going to make this a dexterity saving throw for it.
Marisha: The pen is mightier than the bookcase security!
Matt: What's the DC on the telekinesis ring?
Darin: Where was it? Ring of Telekinesis.
Matt: I'll pull it up here real fast. Looking up magical items really fast. I have it here. Oh, it's for the spell Telekinesis? That's right. What's your spell DC?
Darin: 17.
Matt: 17. No, that's a failure. So for this, go ahead and roll 3d6.
Sam: He failed, or the guy failed?
Matt: The guy failed. He didn't dodge out of the way. He's like, (confused snarling, book impacts) and gets pummeled from behind by a bunch of tomes, books, and random glass baubles that were on the shelf that shatter against the back of its head.
Darin: We have a six, we have a five, and we have a two. 13.
Matt: Then add your intelligence modifier.
Darin: My intelligence modifier is a four.
Matt: 17, nice! 17 points of damage to that one. As you slam it in the back of the head (impacts) and it doubles over and (snarling), its long tongue slashing around. You're still on the ground, and it's over you. Is there anything else you want to do on your turn?
Darin: Demistrik?!
Matt: You hear nothing.
Taliesin: Not cool.
Darin: Can I cast something?
Matt: That is an action to do that, so if you have a bonus action spell, you could do that.
Darin: I believe I do. Tasha's Hideous Laughter?
Matt: I believe that's an action to cast, unfortunately.
Darin: I don't think we have any bonus actions. Oh, are there any healing potions that I can use my Telekinesis to get a healing potion to me?
Matt: You can do that next round. The attack was your one action. You can stand on your feet, if you'd like to.
Darin: No, I'm gonna stay right here.
Matt: Got it. That ends your turn. Now, these guys go again.
Laura: That's good, they're at disadvantage, now, to hit you. They are! Because you're prone.
Matt: This guy's going to move in. This guy is still standing and is going to drop the crossbow and pull out his shortsword. Is going to go ahead and attack you, Grog, first. That is 13?
Travis: Misses.
Matt: And a 27.
Travis: That does hit.
Matt: You take five plus four, that's nine points of slashing damage, reduced to five, yeah. Round down, so it's four. Struck twice, missed both. Both of these guys are going to fire at-- one of them's going to fire at Sprigg on this end because it's their goal, here. With disadvantage, that is a 16? What's your AC again?
Darin: My AC is 19.
Matt: 19, yeah. It darts over you. It misses, it hits the side of the wall. The other guy's going to strike again with disadvantage. That's a 14. And you see the other guy pulling back with a crossbow and fire. You roll out of the way and it (arrow vibrating) into the wooden flooring right next to you.
Darin: Are there any traps that they hit?
Matt: No. That one is going to attack you, Vax, because you're right there in front of it. That's going to be a 13. Does not hit. Second strike, another 13. Both of its shortsword attacks, you duck out of the way and dodge, moving around very quickly. All righty. Those two right there, one of them is going to, because it saw that you got up, Scanlan, they're going to fire two bolts directly at you. That is a 16 to hit?
Sam: That hits.
Matt: Okay, and the second one is a 24.
Sam: Everything hits.
Matt: You are currently in base-to-base with one of their companions, so they both get sneak attack on you. 19 points of piercing damage from the first hit. 24 points of piercing damage from the second hit. And then they both duck around the side here.
Sam: What was the second one? 24.
Matt: They both, we'll say, they vanish from sight. You're not quite sure where they are right now. Those two also duck out of sight, not quite sure where they are, either. That ends their go. Now, the guy in the back right there, who noticed Vax show up, is going to, after you slaughter one of the guys, and stab the other one, is going to angrily go ahead and use Blight on you. Can you go ahead an make a constitution saving throw, please?
Liam: Natural 20. You fucking dick, necro guy!
Matt: All righty. That does half the damage.
Liam: It's still a lot.
Taliesin: I feel like a natural 20 should auto-fail this.
Laura: I know, right?
Matt: 21 points of necrotic damage to you.
Liam: All righty.
Matt: And is going to-- four, five, six. All righty. That ends his turn. Vex, you're up.
Laura: I'm going to run over to the window that those guys disappeared from.
Matt: Over this way or this way?
Laura: Right there, yeah. Can I see that motherfucker? Did I see him run past the window?
Matt: You know what? Yes, because he was not stealthing. You watch as he darts by, and you would have a shot, yeah.
Laura: All right, then I'm going to shoot at him. I'm going to Hunter's Mark him!
Matt: All righty, look at that!
Laura: Trinket doesn't have enough movement to get over by him, does he?
Matt: No, but Trinket can attack whatever's in your area, too.
Laura: I'm going to attack him with my Bramble Shot. With the Blazing Bowstring. Ooh, yeah. That's a 31.
Matt: 31? That hits!
Laura: Yes! Okay! Do I get sneak attack on him? I don't, do I?
Matt: No.
Laura: Damn! At least I got Hunter's Mark. Okay.
Liam: Hey Matt, I realized. I never shot out the wings, so I shouldn't have had as much movement as I did, so I think we should take the damage back from my last attack.
Matt: (counting). 50 to get up to the top there, so at your double speed, you'd be at 60, threw the dagger and threw the dagger. You're fine. It still works out.
Laura: Okay, 28 plus my 4d8 piercing damage. That's balls.
Matt: You're on deck, Keyleth, just so you know.
Laura: Seven, nine, plus nine is 37. 37 points of damage.
Matt: The first arrow hits him in the stomach, doubles forward and pulls back. Now, glancing over, saw you rush up and couldn't get out in time and now is going to try and back up as you're taking the second shot.
Laura: Does he roll a DC of over 17? A strength save?
Matt: Rolls a natural 17. Literally. Strength save? Minus one strength modifier. (cheering)
Matt: Oh, silly necromancer. You and your strength of nine. All right, so he is currently entangled in the brambles as the vines wrap around and pull him in, almost near the tree. You see the staff is pulled close to his chest.
Laura: Nice. Then I am going to shoot him. Oh, wait! I didn't add my Blazing Bowstring damage. Eight more for the Blazing Bowstring. And then I'm going to shoot him again. I'm just asking: do you get sneak attack damage if they're restrained?
Matt: You do, yeah. You can do that. You have advantage on the attack, remember, because he's restrained.
Laura: That's okay. Eight plus 14 is what? 32?
Matt: Yeah, that hits.
Laura: Oh gosh! Okay! Ten, 11, 12, 13, plus sneak attack. 13. What's that? Ten. So 23. And then Hunter's Mark. Plus one. 24.
Matt: 24. Nice. The second arrow hits right in the throat, and you can see it doesn't hit anything vital, but you can see blood's starting to pour out. It's one of those things that if he were to pull it out, it would probably be very bad. But he's leaving it in right now. He's looking pretty rough.
Travis: The necromancer is?
Matt: Yeah. All righty. That ends your turn? Keyleth, your turn.
Laura: I'm going to step away from the window.
Matt: Okay. Step away from the window.
Laura: No, against the wall.
Matt: Against the wall there? You push the table back a bit; book almost falls off the top. What's Trinket doing?
Laura: Trinket is going to run over to Sprigg and Scanlan.
Matt: Up to Scanlan, or the guy who's there?
Laura: Just to the guy.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Just try to growl at him and scare him because he can't attack him.
Taliesin: He's technically now engaged with the bear, so if he walks away, the bear gets an attack of opportunity.
Matt: That's true. That ends your turn. Trinket goes (roars) right in front of the creature. Keyleth, what are you doing?
Marisha: Okay. In my weird, emotional panic, Keyleth is going to turn and look around and she sees Vex firing a bow and Sprigg down on the floor, and she's upset, and she's just going to scream at the top of her lungs and do a Fire Storm around the building. Just (screams) and then I'm going to go (boof) where I think people might be in my rage.
Matt: Okay! So around the building where?
Marisha: Around the building. Sorry, Vax. I don't really know you're there, but around here and around here, and I'm sure I see Vex shooting at things, right? I'm going to try and go around.
Matt: So you have right here.
Marisha: Here, around, and that way.
Matt: All right. Okay, because you didn't see Vax outside.
Marisha: No. He's getting hit.
Matt: You saw Vax run upstairs.
Marisha: I just know there were people shooting through this window and through this window, so I'm doing a perimeter around.
Matt: How many squares is it? Ten, right?
Marisha: Ten ten-by-tens.
Matt: These two here get caught in it, as well as Vax and that guy there.
Laura: What about the magician guy?
Matt: If she's doing a perimeter? No.
Laura: Did you know that I was shooting at somebody?
Matt: She doesn't see the magician. Doesn't know where it is. "The Magician." The Prestige!
Liam: I have evasion.
Matt: Which means it's either half or nothing.
Liam: Right. At advantage because of the boots. What do I have to match?
Matt: Her DC, which is 21, right?
Marisha: 21.
Matt: Dexterity saving throw.
Liam: Oh yeah, way higher than that. We're good.
Matt: Yeah, you take no damage. You duck out of the Fire Storm just in time for it to (raging fire).
Marisha: I need two more d10s.
Liam: Yeah, dexterity save, man. Area effect.
Taliesin: Smoky d10 and spiky d10. And you get rerolls!
Marisha: I reroll ones. None of these are ones, unfortunately. (counting)
Darin: I just noticed the little lanterns glowing. Bravo!
Matt: Oh! Bravo to Dwarven Forge, man.
Sam: Well, it's your house.
Matt: True. Good torches you have in there.
Travis: Way to be energy-conscious with those LEDs!
Marisha: 39 fire damage.
Matt: 39 damage. This guy incinerates. He screams and burns. He manages to dodge partway out, but even the partial damage burns him and he (screams). You see him run off into the forest ten or so steps, on fire, like a stun man shot in a movie before he (impact) on the ground and smolders there in the distance. Those guys take it. What was the amount again?
Marisha: 39, and they're on fire.
Taliesin: It's hard to stealth when you're on fire.
Matt: They're both on fire.
Marisha: So that was my action. I'm going to do that out of my staff as I slam it down. I'm going to look at Sprigg and say: gods damn it, Sprigg! And I'm going to use that as my Healing Word, and I'm going to cast Healing Word at second level. Which is 2d4. 11 points to you. And then I'm going to use my free action that I have to turn into a fire elemental.
Matt: Your free action?
Marisha: Changing into something's not a bonus, it's a free action to change into my beast shape. Circle of the Moon, bitch!
Sam: Did you just call your fiancé--
Travis: -- a bitch?
Marisha: No! Combat wild shape.
Matt: Combat Wild Shape makes it a bonus action, as opposed to an action. That's the difference.
Liam: I would like to retract my "bitch," please.
Marisha: All right, so I'm just Keyleth.
Matt: Does that end your turn? All right, so as Keyleth's turn ends, it comes to Pike's. The entire exterior perimeter of this part of the house is on fire. Flames are now starting to catch. It is dry wood; the entire building is made from wood of the forest, so your home is now in flames.
Marisha: Wait, hang on. No, I'm doing the perimeter. I did think about this, which is why I didn't attack the guy in the house.
Travis: If you napalm the forest, the trees will probably catch fire.
Liam: It's a quick jump, though.
Matt: In order to do the perimeter, it's not a blazing inferno, but it's starting to catch. Flames are starting to lick up the sides.
Liam: End it quick, we can save it.
Matt: Fire Storm's a dangerous spell.
Laura: Let's try to save those books before they all burn.
Sam: He's an old guy. We were either going to kill him or burn his house down.
Matt: It's Vox Machina's MO, man!
Sam: It was always going to end this way.
Taliesin: Things you own end up owning you.
Darin: So glad I wore a jacket.
Matt: Pike is going to rush forward and is also going to attempt to Healing Word you at level two. It's a heal fountain on you. That is six plus five. That's 11 hit points you heal.
Sam: As soon as she does that, I grab him and we Dimension Door out the house.
Matt: Where do you Dimension Door?
Sam: To the only place I know  front of the house. Outside the front door. Not right outside, but towards the edge of the map there.
Matt: Over here?
Sam: Yeah, anywhere around there, on approach to the house.
Travis: Or do you want to be more over yonder?
Sam: Where's the front door to the house?
Marisha: Right there.
Sam: So I'd be 20 feet, the way we approached to the house. So where you got it, if that's the way we approached.
Matt: You guys approached this direction. So you're there. Make a perception check, Scanlan.
Sam: Okay. Ten.
Matt: Okay. You don't see the two hidden fellows over here. You see something large and hulking moving through the forest this direction, at a quick glance.
Sam: Is it naked?
Matt: No.
Taliesin: Then we're going to be okay.
Matt: You guys have pulled out of that house. You're still on the ground and all of a sudden your body physically shifts, and you're looking up at the trees. You glance around and you can see the back of your house, you can hear the frantic fray going on. You see the necromancer who's currently covered in brambles and held in place. You see a couple of guys on fire, on the side screaming on the side of the house, and your house starting to catch fire. That's okay. Pike, on her turn, is going to--
Marisha: Keyleth has anger issues. It's fine.
Matt: Because it's a single target...
Sam: It's the "This is fine" meme, except it's just Keyleth.
Matt: She's going to cast a level five Guiding Bolt because that's what Pike does. So ranged spell attack against that guy. 11 plus-- yeah, that hits. That's a 21. So that is 8d6 radiant damage. Nice. 19.
Laura: Is she doing it to the magician?
Matt: No, this guy right there, in the room.
Sam: He's an illusionist, Laura.
Travis: Is she doing it against Copperfield? Is David Blaine with them?
Matt: So after she heals Sprigg, and Sprigg vanishes, she grabs her holy symbol and goes, "Chill out!" and shoots this giant flashing beam of divine energy that slams into it. You watch as a lot of its flesh burns away from the impact. It's still standing, but it's a shining beacon. The next attack against it has advantage. And then Pike's going to back up with you, Vex, towards the back where the bookcase is and goes, "You smell something?" You now hear, simultaneously, (slow thudding) and watch as the side wall and the back wall explode inward, as splinters of wood and stone (crashing) comes from this wall here--
Laura: Oh no, all of his stuff!
Marisha: So I didn't destroy your house first.
Liam: Flames! Flames, less of a thing.
Taliesin: On the side of the house.
Liam: Flames on the side of the house!
Matt: Two familiar hulking entities come barrelling into the chamber. Remember those giant things you saw walking through the Shadowfell that you barely avoided with the mask?
Marisha: The censer?
Matt: Who has the censer? Not on you right now. You don't carry a fucking giant smoking censer with you!
Laura: Oh, really? I didn't realize it was that big.
Taliesin: I think at that point, I think we put it in the Bag of Holding.
Sam: But you did make a bunch of those herbs.
Marisha: I do have the herbs.
Sam: And there's a shit-ton of shit on fire right now.
Matt: They burst through. (roaring) This big yell echoes through their metal masks. It sounds like this horrible-- imagine a giant vocal scream that's peaking on the audio level against a tinny metallic speaker.
Liam: (Bane voice) Your punishment will be more severe!
Matt: Essentially. This one's going to go after Keyleth. This one's going to make two swipes at Trinket because Trinket's right there. As they barrel through, part of the roof breaks. Guys up top, Percy and Grog, you feel the ground buckle a little bit below you and you drop about two or three inches as the building is starting to lose its physical frame.
Taliesin: Oh god, Grog, what did Keyleth do?
Travis: Thanks, Keyleth. You beat me by one second!
Taliesin: I'm well aware. It was totally worth it.
Marisha: #thanksKeyleth.
Matt: That's one's going to go ahead and do two slam attacks against Keyleth.
Marisha: Yeah, I've earned it. Come on!
Matt: That's 23 to hit.
Marisha: Yeah, that hits.
Matt: And that's a 29 to hit.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: That's 20 points of bludgeoning damage from the first hit. And the second one is 30 points of bludgeoning damage. (two slams) And it slams you. The second fist actually pins you up against the wall there, and you feel ribs crack inside your chest and now-- they're both down low in this hulking mass. They're almost wider than they are any other dimension with how they're crouched down and the thickness of their body. They're taking up almost the entirety of the room right now.
Marisha: You said 30 points, right?
Matt: Yes, for the second one.
Marisha: So I'm at 83 points.
Matt: Correct. The other one's going to slam twice into Trinket. Giant fists. That's going to be a 28.
Laura: 28 hits.
Matt: And a 22.
Laura: 22 hits.
Matt: That is five plus six. 11 points of bludgeoning damage to Trinket.
Laura: Halved.
Matt: Halved, correct. And 22 points of bludgeoning damage, halved.
Laura: Okay, so 11 plus six is 27 points.
Matt: That ends their go. We're at the top of the round. Percy, you're upstairs.
Taliesin: Okay, this all happened. That's awkward. That's okay, I know where I am. I'm going to run out onto the balcony really quick.
Marisha: There's room over here.
Travis: That guy's still up there with us, right?
Taliesin: Yeah. I figure you're going to handle him. Grog, take care of these two. What do I see outside on the balcony?
Matt: You see, currently down below-- make a perception check. Actually, you wouldn't even see them from your perspective.
Taliesin: I just rolled a natural 20.
Matt: Right, it's blocking your vision from this side. You do see Scanlan, you see Sprigg who is currently conscious, you see this necromancer who is currently held with brambles, and you see two streaking flames and hear screams on this side of the building.
Taliesin: Weird question, really quickly. Where is that giant log trap?
Matt: Right there.
Taliesin: How much swing does it have? Is it locked all the way over here, or is it hung back there?
Matt: It looks more like a drop.
Taliesin: Oh, so it's a drop on the door. Good to know. In the meantime, I'm going to run on the exterior of the wall, like right over here, if that makes sense. That's going to be my movement. I'm going to take some fun, happy pot shots at these bastards.
Laura: At the necromancer?
Taliesin: At the necromancer! Let's start with that bound necromancer. He's fun.
Liam: With the Vecna eye.
Taliesin: With the Vecna eye. He's bound, so I have advantage to hit him?
Matt: Yes, you do.
Taliesin: All right, I'm going to use my Animus gun so I still have a hand open, and I'm also going to burn a point of grit so that I can get him to drop his staff. Here we go with advantage. Oh darn, it was so close. 28.
Matt: That hits.
Taliesin: That's-- ooh! Fancy. 18 points of damage, four points of psychic damage, and he has to make a strength saving throw or drops his items.
Matt: Oh, don't worry, he drops the staff, because there's not much left of his head. When you hit the arm, the staff's clutching, but you slam it and it hits the side of the head and causes the right side of the face to explode against the tree, the brambles still clutching as it falls limp to the ground, and they crush the body into a small rock of flesh.
Taliesin: That'll do.
Marisha: You get a grit point back, right?
Laura: You get a grit point back, you get a grit point back!
Matt: You just barely see them; they have three-quarters cover. But you have sharpshooter.
Taliesin: Three-quarters cover, what does that mean in this crazy world? I'm going to burn a grit for advantage and shoot one of them.
Matt: The one right furthest on the side there?
Taliesin: Yeah. I'll start there. Let's give it a shot. I love advantage; it's so wonderful. 32. I really should have done extra damage. So that's 1d10 plus six. That hits, obviously. 32 to hit?
Matt: Yeah, that hits. Goodbye, necromancer.
Taliesin: 17 points of damage plus two points of psychic damage.
Matt: How much was that, sorry?
Taliesin: 17 points of damage plus two points of psychic damage.
Matt: Okay. All right, he's still standing. (bullet impact, yelps) He starts looking up to see where the shot came from as the giant bullet wound through the torso and out the back of the shoulder was clean through. You hear him breathing, gasping for breath. (gasping)
Taliesin: I'm going to take another shot at him. I'm going to make this a sharpshooter shot, and again with advantage because that's fun. Here we go. Damn! Almost a crit. That's 29. That hits.
Matt: That hits, yeah. Go ahead and roll damage.
Taliesin: 14 points of damage-- I'm sorry, 24 points of damage plus two points of psychic damage.
Matt: He falls to the ground, face first. The second shot hits him in the chest. He just goes down, crumples. His body begins to smolder.
Taliesin: I use my bonus action to reload and stare at the nice person below me.
Matt: That ends Percival's turn. Grog, you're up. You hear, downstairs, the (heavy thudding). There's the guy in front of you who's like, (angry breathing). What are you going to do?
Travis: Can I smash my Titanstone Knuckles together and cast Enlarge on myself?
Matt: You can! And your head goes into the roof! (thudding)
Marisha: We're real sorry about your house.
Darin: It wasn't a house. It was a prison.
Laura: Well, then you're welcome.
Travis: I'm hoping the floor gives.
Matt: The floor gives out. As your head (crashing) into the ceiling (creaking, crashing) it falls out from under you. You come falling down on top of this guy. Rubble falls around. Keyleth, I need you to make a dexterity saving throw. I need Trinket to make a dexterity saving throw. The other shadow ghast fails.
Marisha: Nine.
Laura: 14.
Matt: Trinket, you, and the shadow ghast all take 22 points of bludgeoning damage as the roof caves in over on top. Large part of the upper floor now falls and this guy stumbles and is now prone there. He also takes damage. You take 22 points of bludgeoning damage from falling through the wreckage. Trinket's is halved, yes.
Marisha: Ugh, debris, ugh!
Matt: That kills him. The shadow ghast right here.
Travis: Because he had barely any left.
Matt: Yeah. He's like, "Huh?" (crashing) Gets rained on with rubble, broken, splintered wood and stone.
Travis: The guy in Manners, he fell too, right?
Matt: His part of the ceiling didn't fully collapse. He's just out of the way. He's dangling off the edge right now, as he shakes, it's making its way towards the hole. The whole ceiling didn't collapse, just the area right below.
Travis: Beautiful. Can I take Tweedledee to my right and make two reckless attacks against him? They're not giants, right?
Matt: No, they're not giants. They're considered undead.
Travis: They're considered undead. 30 to hit. And the second one.
Matt: Big targets.
Travis: 29.
Matt: Hits.
Travis: So ten. 24 points. Plus the Enlarge-- 25.
Matt: 25 with the first hit. (whack)
Travis: 22 with the second one.
Matt: 22 damage on the second hit. (whacks) You're hitting him. Laying on its back, it has these metal spikes jamming out of its flesh. You can see portions of other creatures that it had slain that have been jammed on these spikes and rotted away on its armor. So as you're hitting it, you're knocking away parts of partially decomposed creatures that previously fell in battle to one of these creatures. As you're slamming into it, you can see it's just rippling, partially decayed muscle that seems to be unnaturally strengthened by whatever necrotic energy keeps it stitched together and alive. It's a thick sack of hit points.
Travis: Wow. Cool. Good to know.
Matt: Is that your turn; are you doing anything else?
Travis: That's interesting. I'm going to go into a frenzied rage as my bonus action.
Matt: Okay, and that's the end of your turn? Okay. End of Grog's turn. Vax, you're up. You heard all this go on and now the whole building is starting to catch fire.
Liam: I'm going to bolt to that window.
Matt: Right there?
Liam: No, other way. So I have a view of Keyleth, the creature, and Grog. I'm going to throw Whisper-- I've got sharpshooter-- at that thing, and bamf there.
Matt: I will say, at proximity to the flames that are starting to catch, you do take three points of fire damage.
Liam: Fine.
Matt: You threw the dagger at the big guy?
Liam: Whisper goes to the window at that guy there.
Matt: Go ahead and roll an attack.
Liam: And it's flanking, right? Because of where Grog is, or Keyleth?
Matt: It's not flanking, but you get to add sneak attack modifier.
Liam: Okay. Yeah, that's fine. That's 32.
Matt: Yeah, that hits. So you appear next to it.
Liam: Three plus psychic damage is four plus this junk. (counting) 33, doubled to 66 plus psychic damage is 74. Bamf there.
Matt: And you appear next to it. As the dagger sinks into its torso, you watch as its chest muscles and the iron cage-like armor around it seems to swallow the dagger. As it goes inside, you watch as some of the muscles all of a sudden (squelch) fall off of its body, like whatever energy's holding it together is untethered and this weird, fleshy, stitched-together creature is starting to fall apart. It's looking pretty hurt.
Liam: Okay, so here's what I wanted to do. So movement-- and I have action-action, action, action-- action-action, action, bonus action.
Travis: (repeating) Action, action--
Laura: (repeating) Action, action--
Marisha: (repeating) Action, action--
Liam: Guys, it's the rules in the book! You can bust my balls all you want--
Matt: Well, that's your first attack, so you have your second attack.
Liam: So action-action for my regular attack, right?
Matt: Attack-attack!
Liam: It's just semantics. Attack-attack, hasted action, bonus action. So that was the first of my attack-attacks. And here's the second one.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: 30.
Matt: Well, we have dagger, dagger, dagger. Now we have attack, attack, attack, attack, attack, attack as our next t-shirt. (laughter)
Liam: I'm dumping a level two Smite into this, against an undead. That's seven, 10, 11. Ooh, it's cocked. 17 for that hit.
Matt: 17 with the additional--?
Liam: With attack-attack.
Matt: Right. Well, but you said you dumped Divine Smite into that?
Liam: Into that one.
Matt: You did the additional damage for it being undead? Okay, so that was how much total?
Liam: Whatever I just said. It was like 16.
Travis: 17.
Matt: 17. 17 will do it, actually. So as you rush in with the second dagger, you jam up into the same space where it's falling apart, and you hear this dull (shockwave sound) on the inside as the divine energy radiates from the strike and its body (slurping) sloughs off of the bones and around your arm. It slowly falls around your arm like old gelatin and (slurping) slips into the ground, covering the floor around you.
Liam: Okay, I'm going to do the old crouch. Not that she needs it, but crouch in front of Keyleth. And then I have my hasted action for an attack and bonus action for an attack into the other one. 29, and the second one is higher than 29. I'm going to dump Smite into it. Three-- you're making me mess up the math, Laura!
Laura: Psychic damage.
Liam: (laughing) I can't keep track of the math!
Matt: (singing) Epic-level DND!
Liam: 25 on that towards that guy, with Smite added. And then the last dagger, with Smite, at level one, is two plus is 10, 14, 19.
Matt: 19, okay.
Liam: I dumped a ton of Smite into that.
Matt: You didn't add your modifier to the third strike, right?
Liam: I don't know, so why don't you just minus six? 19, so we'll call it 13. Some people might have been catcalling me while I was trying to do math.
Matt: That's okay. No worries. You hit with the two final strikes. They blast into it. You watch as some of the armor gets thrown off its body. It takes a little hit, but the other creature looks like it's largely all right. That finishes Vax's turn.
Liam: Let me enjoy my last two months of life!
Matt: Shadow ghast. What's the DC on the sphere again?
Sam: 20.
Matt: Is it 20? 19. He can't escape from this freaking sphere. The shadow ghast is up on the second floor going (growling). Manners, man. All right. Scanlan and Sprigg, what do you guys want to do?
Darin: I have a question. The gentleman who had an arrow in his throat: he's gone, right? He's been blown apart.
Matt: Yeah. Actually, make a perception check.
Darin: Okay. That's a d20, isn't it?
Matt: Yep, d20 and then add your perception modifier.
Darin: Got it. That's a 17.
Matt: A 17, okay. You glance over and you see two guys who are hiding amongst the bushes on the side there.
Darin: Now, it's too far away to cast a spell.
Matt: No, depending on the spell's range, depending on what you want to do.
Darin: Tasha's Hideous Laughter.
Matt: That we can do.
Marisha: That's such a good spell.
Matt: It's a fun one. So bringing up Tasha's here, looking at the range. There we go. It's a 30-feet range, so you want to get up and get a little closer, probably.
Darin: I will do that, if I could.
Matt: All right, so that's half your movement, and you can move two more spaces. You can hit one guy. So one guy of these two you can select.
Darin: The first one.
Matt: That one there? All righty.
Darin: Yes. I think his name is Dave? Roll a perception?
Matt: Make a saving throw, a wisdom save. That is a ten! Your spell DC is a 17. You watch as the guy there who has his crossbow out and sees you get up, spins around, has this giant, heavy crossbow, the bolt very recognizable because you still have three of them in your body. Aims it towards you and then suddenly (maniacal laughter) and drops the crossbow to the ground and doubles over laughing, falling to the ground and is now kicking and laughing like a hyena right now, unable to do anything.
Darin: Knock knock!
Matt: (maniacal laughter)
Darin: Right! (laughter)
Matt: All right, is that your turn?
Darin: Yes, it is.
Matt: All right.
Sam: There's another guy over there? Have I seen him yet?
Matt: You haven't, actually. You do see this guy's on fire right now, who is still around.
Sam: Oh, I see somebody.
Matt: Yeah, and you can see that hulking figure come running through, and you hear the (explosion) through the back of the building.
Sam: For the beginning of the round, I'll say, guys, I think large giants are coming. Be aware.
Laura: (screaming)
Travis: (screaming)
Sam: What? I can't hear you! Speak clearly!
Liam: Threepio! Where could he be?!
Sam: Okay. Shit. I'll approach the guy I can see burning, on fire. That's where the front door is, right? Is he in front of the front door?
Matt: The log is right up in this area.
Sam: Oh yeah. That. So I'll take out my Wand of Magic Missiles, and I will just take down the rope.
Matt: Okay. You watch as three missiles fire out of the wand and slam into the bits of rope up top. As they explode, it's enough of an impact to cause it, as opposed to fall straight down, just spin and fall. I'm going to go ahead and roll a dice to see which direction it's going to land from its front point. So we'll say inward would be one, two, three, four, five, six. That's a six. So it plummets down, hits the ceiling, scrapes off and slams down onto him. He's going to try and make a dexterity saving throw. That is a seven plus four, nope. That's an 11. Go ahead and roll 4d8 please.
Laura: 4d8?
Darin: Is this Dr. Comedy, who's writhing in laughter?
Matt: I think so. Oh. No, sorry, he's over here. This guy's on fire from her earlier.
Sam: Oh, that's a five. 16.
Matt: 16 points of damage to him.
Sam: That's not a lot.
Laura: You only got 16 on 4d8?
Matt: It's not enough to kill him, but it slams on him and then falls over. You see as both of his flaming hands on the ground going, (groans). He's currently restrained underneath it right there, and on fire.
Darin: Knock knock. (laughter)
Matt: All right, you going to stay where you are?
Sam: No. I'm going to move towards any entrance or window I see. I can't really see over there.
Matt: There's a window here, window here. This one has flames in front of it. This one's available.
Sam: I'll go towards that [no audio] other one.
Matt: Okay. Four, five. That's as far as you can move there. You see the guy on the ground who's laughing in front of you.
Sam: Yeah, no thanks to him. And for a bonus, I guess I will inspire Darin De Paul, or rather, Sprigg.
Liam: Why not both?
Sam: I will sing to him, (singing) You had a bad day, you gettin' knocked down. I sing you a song just to turn it around! You say you don't know, but please don't die. I'll sing you this song and maybe you'll go for a ride. You had a bad day. (speaking) I don't know how that song goes.
Matt: All righty, so you get an inspiration die. You get a d12 that you can use on any sort of skill. You don't have to use it right now, but whenever you use a skill check or an ability check you can add that to it if you want to. There you go.
Darin: Thank you. You know, I had a bad day.
Sam: (singing) You had a bad day. (groaning and laughing)
Matt: All right, so now it's the assassin's turn. Keyleth, how much fire damage does it do when they're on fire? Is it d10?
Marisha: (stuttering) Oh jeez. Fire Storm. Yeah, no. d10.
Matt: Thought so. All right, he takes eight fire damage.
Taliesin: Yay! Under a log.
Matt: Under a log. He's going to try and break free from restraint. Nope, that is a 14. He cannot move that giant tree that's currently crushing him on the ground. He tries to reach out for his crossbow and aim it out towards Sprigg with one hand because it's still loaded. But he has super disadvantage on this strike.
Sam: Super disadvantage. Is that in the book?
Matt: It is now.
Laura: That's in the new campaign guide. Super disadvantage. Only when you're stuck under a tree on fire.
Matt: Sure, I'll do all three. All right. Eight, 12, 12. I made him roll super disadvantage. What does this remind me of? Like a terrible old sci-fi movie where the bad guy's on the ground with the gun trying to aim it at the hero with his final shot and the hero just walks up and steps on the gun. You (whoosh) sidestep the bolt as it fires. Nothing on you.
Darin: Of course.
Matt: The crossbow drops, (grunting).
Darin: Knock knock.
Matt: (crying) On fire. All righty, that ends his turn.
Darin: (whispering) Comedy comes in threes.
Matt: This guy back here is going to go ahead and since you're the one who has his friend writhing on the ground, is going to go ahead and try to shoot you with his crossbow. You do see him, although he's unaware of that, so he thinks it's a sneak attack shot. That is a 14.
Taliesin: You got to get better cultists, man.
Matt: I know, seriously. They come in large numbers, so yeah. This one just (impact sound) hits the tree to your left. His aim's off.
Travis: He's missing an eye. His depth perception sucks.
Matt: Exactly. And he goes ahead and darts behind this building there, vanishing.
Sam: Did I see the bolt or any indication that he exists?
Matt: You do. He reveals himself when he fires. So you watched him come out of the bushes and (whoosh) fire and then duck around the side of the building. The guy on the ground is going to try and save against your spell. That is a 13 plus zero. Nope. He's still laughing. He's just on the ground, (laughing). Tears in his eyes now.
Taliesin: I love that spell.
Matt: That's the end of the assassins' turn. Necro's dead. Vex, you're up.
Laura: I'm going to Hunter's Mark the big undead monster in the room. And then I'm going to shoot him! With the Blazing Bowstring!
Taliesin: Be careful. You might catch the building on fire.
Laura: Oh, but I'm going to use the sharpshooter thing.
Matt: Take minus five and do additional damage? Okay.
Laura: Which I don't know if I should have done that on this particular one. It was 17 to hit.
Matt: 17 is exactly his armor class.
Liam: Yas, Pelor queen! (laughter)
Laura: Five plus eight is 13. Plus sneak attack, because he's got Trinket next to him. 13, 18, 23, sorry! 23 and then lightning damage. 24. 25, 26. And then Blazing Bowstring. God dang! 27.
Matt: Okay, 27. So that's your first strike. (arrow shot) First one just (impact sound) hits in the side and you see the bolt of energy arc out and the flames burn up the arrow. By the way, the wall behind you is starting to get really warm.
Laura: I'm going to move forward. I'm going to actually move toward the corner where Keyleth is.
Matt: There's a guy on the ground there.
Laura: Oh, there is?
Matt: Yeah. So you've got to step over him.
Laura: I'm going to step on him.
Matt: As you move past, he does get a swing with his shortsword at you. Oh, wow. That's a 25.
Laura: Oh, wow. He hits me. Probably because I stepped on him.
Matt: I think so. So you take nine points of slashing damage. Just like, (pain sound) as you're walking past.
Laura: (pain sound) Fuck. Ah, shit. Okay, I'm going to hit the big hulking thing again.
Matt: I realized he had disadvantage, but I rolled another 18, so it's fine.
Laura: Oh, okay, well, yeah. I'm going to do the same thing with the big hulking guy.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: 25 to hit.
Matt: 25 hits.
Laura: Oh, I didn't add plus ten to the previous one!
Matt: Because of the sharpshooter, all right. 39 last time. So go ahead and take a swing at it.
Laura: Thanks! 14.
Matt: You're up next, Keyleth.
Laura: 14 plus six is 20.
Sam: Figure out how you're going to ruin Darin's life more.
Marisha: I know. That's my one goal in life. I'm a big old homewrecker.
Laura: I think that's just 32 because I don't get sneak attack again.
Matt: All right. So the second arrow slams into him. It's still holding firm. It's taking the hits and you see parts of its body are starting to spill black liquid out of the wounds and (growls) its red eyes still beaming out from behind the metal mask in front of its face. Its arm swings back and tears some of the ceiling beams out with it. It's looking pretty rickety right now. So that ends your turn?
Laura: I guess so.
Marisha: Is it in a fireproof safe? No? Okay!
Matt: Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: All right. So I have this big asshole in front of me, yeah? The house is catching on fire, right? Yeah. Nope, she'd still be really upset and really angry. So continuing what I was saying before, she's gonna rage a little bit more and go into her fire elemental self.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Unable to contain her frustration--
Taliesin: This is a good plan.
Matt: You technically entered the space of the guy who's on the ground, becoming a fire elemental, which lights him on fire. (screams)
Marisha: Even more upset. I'm gonna move right in the space of this guy.
Matt: (whoosh) So occupying his space from this side, we'll say. She can catch you guys on fire.
Laura: But she doesn't have to.
Matt: I'll double-check that real fast.
Marisha: I mean, I'm magical.
Taliesin: Sparkle fire.
Marisha: I sparkle fire.
Liam: Also, we can take it.
Taliesin: Yeah, it's fire.
Matt: You know what? It can move through a space as narrow as one inch wide, so I'll say yes, you can maneuver through. Only if you want to, can you set things on fire.
Marisha: I'm going to go into this guy's space, engulf in flames, and do my multi-attack, two slam touch attacks.
Matt: Go for it. He is now in flames.
Marisha: That's cocked. Ooh, that's good, that's good. 21.
Matt: 21, yeah.
Marisha: And 16.
Matt: 16 just misses.
Marisha: Fucking balls. Okay. No, plus six to 11. That's 17.
Matt: That hits. That's what you needed.
Marisha: So both of those hit. 2d6 plus three. First one is eight. Plus ten. 18 fire damage.
Matt: He's looking pretty hurt. As you slam him with both of your flaming hands and claw across his body, where the flame hits, you see it (hissing) singes through the flesh and drags charred remains of where the muscle once was where you dragged your claws through. The body's starting to shake as it's holding its form together.
Marisha: That's all I've got, I think. That's it.
Sam: No. You have action, action, action, action, action. (laughter)
Marisha: Bonus action.
Taliesin: Bonus action.
Laura: Hasted action.
Liam: Send all your complaints to Mike Mearls and Chris Perkins at Wizards of the Coast.
Sam: Matt, not to be a dick, but has anyone stepped on the trap on the floor?
Matt: Actually, you know what, Vax would have avoided it. Because Vax is in the spot where it was, but Vax knew where it was, so Vax would have probably gone over it.
Sam: So cool. You're doing the little splits over it.
Liam: Splitsing. Van Damme-ing it.
Matt: Wait, you wouldn't have, because when you threw the dagger--
Liam: Let's do it.
Matt: It's not a big deal. Thank you for pointing that out.
Sam: But your boots are gone.
Liam: She stole them again? How did you do it?
Matt: You guys glance upward as you hear a (deep swoosh) and up above you in the hole in the ceiling where there once was nothing but air, you see hovering above you a giant beholder just appear. (guttural moan) All of its eyestalks curling around it.
Marisha: What do you mean, it's not a big deal? That's the part that I'm confused about!
Matt: Thank you for that. So that finishes your turn, Keyleth. Pike's turn. Pike sees this--
Liam: If we're retconning that in, I'm retconning (blows raspberry) when I see it.
Darin: Don't get Gargamel angry.
Marisha: Does that mean that Keyleth would have seen the beholder beforehand? You know what, don't worry about it.
Matt: No. You were so angry-- it's in the hole above. You don't quite see where that hole was at the moment, you backed away.
Marisha: Man, so much blind rage.
Matt: So much blind rage. Look guys, that's what we're doing. So anyway, Pike does actually make an insight check, and says, "It's not real. Don't worry about it!"
Laura: Thanks, Pike.
Matt: Fixed. (laughter)
Laura: It's not a big deal, you guys.
Matt: Pike, however, is going to go ahead and make another Guiding Bolt at the large guy there. That's going to be a 20. That hits. That's going to be 4d6. 14 points of radiant damage, which will do it. So you watch as Pike blasts it in the face with the Guiding Bolt. As it hits, the mask gets thrown off, and where the head was beneath it, you see this empty black void with two red burning coals for eyes that blink out as soon as the mask is removed, and the whole body crumples to the ground and turns into a horrible, thick, black-purple ichor.
Laura: I'm going to have nightmares about that.
Sam: For sure.
Matt: The beholder is still upstairs, staying in place going (hoarse screaming). (laughter)
Matt: Yeah, it's that kind of thing.
Taliesin: Brilliant.
Matt: That ends Pike's turn. They're both dead. That brings us back. Percival, it's your turn. There's the one guy on the ground there. One's laughing. We'll say for the purposes of this, for the time, most everything there is not much of a threat at this point. So systematically, the guy on the ground who's hidden by the tree, you can just--
Taliesin: I'm ignoring him. I'm not even gonna deal. I'm just hopping in the window. I'm going to grab my little guy there. I'm going to bring him out to the balcony, and I'm going to unceremoniously toss him out of the house.
Sam: Defenestrated!
Matt: You throw him (thud). He lands.
Taliesin: And then I'm going to jump and I'm going to crawl down the rest of my way and join him outside the house. And try and jump around the fire, dragging him away from the fire.
Matt: Make an athletics check. Sorry, acrobatics check.
Taliesin: Acrobatics? Bless you for an acrobatics check. I'm rerolling that.
Matt: No, it's not a saving throw. You can't do that.
Taliesin: It's not a saving throw. Oh well, that's fine. That's a 16.
Matt: I'll say for the purposes of this--
Taliesin: I had the Spider Climb boots.
Matt: Right, I know. But Spider Climb boots only helps you if you keep on the surface. So as you leap, you manage to land on your feet, but the flames do catch you a bit, so you take six points of fire damage as you start to burn. For the purposes of time on this one, the guy who's currently under the log just burns to death there under the log. Pinned, he's trying to reach for his crossbow, but he's only fired the one bolt that was loaded in it. The guy on the ground is still laughing as you approach him.
Darin: Are there any rocks about?
Matt: Yeah, there's quite a few heavier rocks on the ground.
Darin: Well, I look at him, and I say, "It was a prison, but it was my prison." And I use the Telekinesis ring to lift a rock and drop it on his head.
Matt: (splat) A horrible sickening crack sound. It slams into the head. You lift it up. The laughing has stopped, but he's still moving and you can see the face is broken. The nose is smashed to the side and it's just blood. He's starting to try and get back up.
Darin: Well, tell them that Ethred Brokenbranch sends his regards.
Matt: Do you let him get up?
Darin: Yes.
Matt: He gets up. (grunting)
Sam: I'll Lightning Bolt him as he runs away.
Matt: Okay, we'll say for the purposes of this, he runs off in the distance (footsteps, yelp) and falls to the ground, no longer moving.
Travis: Can I kill the guy on the floor? Can he be mine, please? Can I please smash him? The guy that's lying on the floor in the house, please?
Taliesin: Just sit on him.
Travis: I haven't Gallaghered anybody in a while.
Matt: He's on the ground on fire now, going (frantic gasps) patting out the fire.
Laura: Oh, Grog, put him out!
Matt: He spends his action putting the fire out now, and is like, (frantic gasps).
Marisha: Keyleth takes a few steps back and motions as a fire elemental...
Travis: I skip on in and (gibberish yell).
Matt: He's like, (scream, impact). Just smashed on the ground. Red watermelon.
Laura: Fire's out, I'm assuming.
Marisha: I drop my fire form, turn, see my anger, destruction, get immediately guilty, and then do a Tidal Wave to quell the flames.
Matt: The building is standing, mostly. The whole front of it is blackened. The flames are gone. Most of the interior is destroyed. You have two giant holes in the back. Most of the upper ceiling is ruined. The house is in shambles.
Laura: What about the books?
Matt: A lot of them have been destroyed. Some of the ones on the back wall have been burned. Some of them have been burned by people in flames or made of flame or general black ichor that spilled out. The house is pretty wrecked.
Laura: Can I go over to them and see if I can find some books I think Percy would like?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Sam: I'm running over to see that staff with an eye in it.
Laura: 27.
Matt: 27? Okay. You start glancing through. You find some history books. You find some that relate to local history. You see some books that relate to various types of creatures; some animals and beasts. Many that are encyclopedias of various rivers and it's scattered everywhere. It's just universal knowledge of pretty much anything he can get his hands on. So some of it seems less useful than others but you hand-pick a few out that you think Percy would like.
Travis: I don't mean to ask the obvious question, but how did he know we were here?
Taliesin: No, that's not an obvious question. I have no idea.
Marisha: They have multiple eyes.
Laura: But how? Was he watching us? Is he scrying on us?
Taliesin: Must have.
Laura: Oh, he's fucking scrying on us.
Taliesin: Maybe he can feel you the way you can feel him.
Matt: You get the sense that's not how this works.
Taliesin: Yeah. I don't know.
Marisha: He had another eye, right?
Sam: Does that thing have an eye in it?
Matt: The staff you see? It's a carved eye. It's made of wood and paint. It's ornamental. It's mainly used as a focus, technically acts as a plus-one staff.
Travis: Sprigg. You said this place was a prison. Did you mean that?
Darin: Of course I meant it, boy. I've been there for years.
Travis: Could you leave? If you wanted.
Darin: Of course I can. The prison was more up here than in there.
Travis: Oh. Sorry about the prison, then.
Darin: Why would you be sorry? I asked you for power and redemption. Don't you feel you gave me that? We lived, child. We all lived.
Travis: Yep. Yes. That is indeed what I was hoping for.
Laura: I lean out the window. Hey, Sprigg!
Darin: Hello!
Laura: Hi.
Darin: Hi! How are you? I have some arrows in me at the moment. You like arrows, don't you?
Laura: I do. Come in here, I'll take them off your hands.
Darin: Okay. Question  if you do that, I'd probably die again.
Laura: I'll cure you, darling. Don't worry.
Darin: She called me darling.
Sam: She's the cutest.
Darin: (growls) I go in. (laughter)
Matt: You walk into your destroyed abode, managing to sidestep all the bear traps along the way. You've walked the path many times and you know it and I'm actually surprised none of you walked into any of them. You knew where most of them were, but none of you wandered out far enough into the open to do that. They're all inside. You can see your giant friend, of course, that you were talking to as you walked in is twice the size he was earlier. Previously where you had to hunch, you're now having to almost belly crawl inside the house.
Travis: But why? There's no separation between the first and the second floor.
Matt: So if you stand in that space, you're fine.
Travis: I'm in my space.
Taliesin: I'm going to prop our idiot up in the window so I can go in and keep an eye on him even while I'm inside.
Sam: We have a prisoner?
Taliesin: Yeah. I kept one.
Laura: But he's one of those creepy ghouls that probably doesn't speak.
Matt: And in the last minute or so has not been able to break free but is still trying.
Taliesin: He automatically fails until 24 hours has elapsed.
Matt: After the first failed save?
Taliesin: Any further attempts by the creature automatically fail until 24 hours have elapsed. He ain't going nowhere. It's mean, man.
Laura: Me and Pike can heal him as I take the arrows out.
Matt: Okay.
Darin: At last you've seen the point of me, eh?
Laura: (sarcastic laugh) Sprigg, anything valuable in here that you want to save before we get you out of here?
Darin: Would like my organs! Oh, I would like to save those.
Laura: Yes.
Darin: All right. No. There's nothing.
Laura: No keys to Ioun? You know where she is?
Darin: I might. I hope I do. I hope that I can give you the answers you seek.
Laura: I hope so, too. I cast Cure Wounds.
Matt: Pike casts Cure Wounds on you, as well, and you heal 18.
Darin: Do I know her name yet?
Matt: No, you do not.
Darin: Cleric.
Matt: "Pike."
Darin: Yes. Ethred. Or Sprigg. Whichever you like. You can call me Sprigg. Can you help me pray to Ioun? We need answers, and I think together we might find them.
Matt: "I can certainly try. Do you have any items of her iconography?"
Darin: Do I?
Matt: Yeah, actually. You just reach over and find one of the undamaged books.
Laura: You healed 19, by the way.
Darin: Thank you. Use this and you talk to her where I can't. At least, not yet.
Matt: "I don't know if I can talk to her. I'm not... But I can help you pray. I don't know if it'll be enough."
Darin: Let's give it a go. There's a first time for everything.
Matt: "Grog!"
Travis: Yeah?
Matt: "Can you help me clear some of the floor, please?"
Travis: Not a problem! (grunting) Keyleth, catch!
Marisha: Ah! Ow! (laughter)
Sam: Floorboards! In her face!
Travis: I thought you were on fire. I'm really sorry.
Matt: Pike takes you over to the center of the room and tells you. "Kneel with me. Now take this book and close your eyes and... apologize."
Darin: For what?
Matt: "For everything you said about Ioun."
Darin: (grumbles) All right. Well, look the other way. Find some things that are of value.
Travis: (whistles)
Laura: Trinket sits down next to him and stares, but I'll turn around.
Darin: All right. I don't know if you're listening, Ioun. It's been many years since I've actually spoken to a god. I'd like to express my deepest sorrow. You see, this home... didn't mean as much to me as life. And I think these people gave that to me. If you could give us... If you could give me anything, any little hint, it would be greatly appreciated and I would be a warrior in your name forevermore. Please. Was that okay, bear?
Matt: (huffs, licking) Licks the side of your face.
Darin: No, I'm not crying. You're crying, bear.
Matt: You sit there in silence with your eyes closed, concentrating, holding the book before you. Doesn't seem to be an answer. Just silence in the darkness. Nothing. Everyone wants to look at him-- still turned away?
Marisha: Keyleth is definitely staring, but pretending not to stare.
Taliesin: I'm watching through the book.
Laura: I'm leaning against the wall and staring at him now.
Matt: Nothing. Nothing responds. As you have your eyes closed, you hear this soft chuckle in the far corner of the room. (cackles) "Really? Praying, are you?"
Darin: Yes. Can you help?
Matt: "Do I look the kind of guy that would help?"
Darin: Yes. I've known you for 19 years and I think anybody's capable of anything, so why don't you do something unexpected?
Matt: "I think you're right. It's no longer your prison. It's not mine, either."
Darin: That's true.
Matt: (flapping) Flies out the window.
Taliesin: Oh shit.
Darin: Kraghammer has another performer, and not a very good one.
Matt: While you've been talking, by the way, and the silence has been sad. Taking in the slight emotional cut that not getting a response and putting yourself on that limb means nothing. The rest of you notice his torso is glowing bright blue.
Marisha: What? Is it really?
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: Your stomach is glowing.
Darin: Growing? What? I didn't eat anything. How could my stomach be growing?
Sam: You're blue balling.
Darin: What?
Sam: (whispering) Look down.
Matt: Pike looks at you and takes your hands and opens your arms and motions to your chest. And the book in your hand, you pull aside. You glance down and you can see, there's this soft, bluish glow that's emanating from your torso. Strange.
Darin: You see? I didn't have to believe in Ioun. I've found my religion. (chuckling) I'm Bluish! (laughter)
Travis: Aw, man!
Darin: It didn't happen!
Matt: No, it did. That's canon.
Darin: Wait a second, gentlemen. We'll restart for just a second. It'll be fine. That little imp is gone. So apparently, the key... is me.
Laura: Is you? It is you.
Sam: Is in you or is you?
Marisha: It is him. I've known it from the minute that I laid eyes upon him. It's him.
Travis: You did? You knew that the moment you saw him?
Marisha: No, I mean I had a hunch, I had a feeling, deep down inside. I can't say it. If I say it out loud and then if it's not true then I'm an asshole.
Liam: To be fair, we've only been here 12 minutes.
Darin: Yes. House gone. The imp gone. Burny, burny. Sad, sad. Pray, nothing happened. Now I'm blue. That's a day for you, isn't it?
Laura: So do you glow brighter the closer we get? What's the deal here?
Darin: I've never glowed before, child.
Laura: I think it's glown.
Darin: I've never glowned.
Sam: If you're the key, where's the lock? Where do we take you?
Darin: Well, I have been gone for many, many years, so English may have changed. To be fair. To be fair. I don't know. This is all new to me. I would have thought it would be in one of those tomes.
Taliesin: I'm going to pick up the book that he was holding when he was praying. I'm going to just try and read it.
Matt: Okay. You glance through it. The book is a simple book, talking about the construction of barricades and it looks like it was less the contents of the book and more just the image of the book itself.
Taliesin: I'm going to hand him the book again and see if maybe there's focus to be found. Maybe this is--
Matt: Okay. Make a perception check.
Taliesin: Oh, lord. Ooh. Let's call that a 28.
Matt: When you took the book from him and handed him another book, there was a very faint vibration to his body as you pulled it from him and gave it back to him. Which you haven't noticed, but there's a physical vibration to him.
Taliesin: If it's all-- with your permission, I'm going to take his hands.
Matt: Okay. You feel them, and you feel this very faint vibration to his body.
Marisha: Percy.
Taliesin: Yes.
Marisha: Continue holding his hands. I pull out the Tome of Quick Movement. Hold. Hold while I find the paper. Hold.
Laura: What if he's a tuning fork?
Marisha: (shushes)
Darin: That's very rude.
Marisha: Where is it? I have a lot of things.
Sam: Divining.
Darin: Oh yes. A divining rod. A rod to the divine. Perhaps I am a divining rod.
Laura: That's what I mean.
Darin: Well said, child!
Marisha: I pull out the fork we that we got to get to Elysium. Is it similar?
Matt: When you pull out the fork and you hold it, you recall that whenever you cast the spell Plane Shift, there was a faint vibration to the specific fork when you cast the spell.
Sam: He's the tuning fork.
Taliesin: He's the tuning fork.
Marisha: Oh no.
Laura: What, no? This is good!
Marisha: No, it is good. It's good, it's just... Oh, Sprigg. No, it's fine. It's good. I don't know. Everything in my life seems to have this impermanence factor about it. So I hope he's not something that can be used and discarded.
Darin: I haven't been used in 37 years.
Marisha: Sprigg.
Darin: It's all right. At least I wasn't discarded all that time.
Marisha: I'm sure it's fine, I just--
Darin: Look. Look at me. Just remember. Whatever happens, remember me. That's all that's important.
Liam: That's good advice.
Darin: That's all that we have. My friends are gone and I don't even remember their names. I don't remember Thetapax or Zephyr or... the guy with the nose. He was my favorite. (coughs and sniffles) Dusty in here, isn't it?
Marisha: Oh, Sprigg.
Darin: (sniffles and coughs) I remember. (softer) I remember. See? It's all up here. So whatever happens, keep me there. All right?
Marisha: I guess I have to start getting used to losing things.
Darin: Yes. Or you can be hidden away in a prison for 37 years. And that's not life, child. That's hiding. Don't hide.
Marisha: I've already built my own prison. They don't know. I'm already there.
Darin: You can break out. You can. It's hard. But you can do it. Just take the first step. And then you take another one. And then you take another one.
Marisha: And I grab his hand, and with that, I cast Plane Shift to wherever he is leading to go.
Matt: All right. The rest of you gathered hands for this?
Laura: I guess so.
Matt: All right.
Laura: Is there enough of us? Trinket, in the necklace. Quick!
Matt: Trinket. (roars) Into the necklace.
Darin: Wait. My invisible frog companion.
Sam: Is he real?
Darin: Yes. (laughter)
Matt: There is a sudden (sucking noise). A shuddering of power energy around you as you feel the vibration out of Sprigg's hand emanate throughout the entire loop you guys have created throughout your grasp. The familiar bright light flashes before you, and you feel your body being pulled through, at incredible speeds, through darkness. There. The familiar racing of the divine gate. (fast travel noise) As you pass through one of its many portholes. Then, adrift. By now you've-- the times you've passed through the gate, you've passed through it a handful of times since now. Adrift. Still holding hands, but the circle's beginning to turn into an oval. You can all glance around and see each other. Did you miss your destination? Did you overshoot? What's next? (whoosh) Another white flash. And suddenly you're at a destination. You glance around and you're standing within a small chamber. It resembles a decadent bathhouse but with no water nor occupants. It's empty. There are marble pillars stretching to a domed ceiling about 60 feet above you all. Silk-draped cloths drift and hang at odd angles throughout the ceiling. Glowing points of magical light latched within iron cages dangle at the edges of these pillars about 15 feet up that give the faint glow to an otherwise darkened room. There are walls on each side of this chamber, about 30 or 40 feet from you, and one arched hallway across from you that leads to the only other chamber you've seen.
Marisha: I immediately turn and look to see if Sprigg is still holding my hand.
Matt: Sprigg is still holding your hand.
Laura: See? All that fucking shit was for nothing! He's still alive!
Sam: Are you the same Sprigg as before?
Darin: I hope so. Let's ask my invisible frog companion. Well, I guess we'd better go find what we are looking for.
Marisha: Okay. Glad you're with us, Sprigg.
Darin: It's good to be alive.
Marisha: Yes, it is.
Darin: Remember that.
Marisha: Okay. I will.
Matt: As you guys walk forward towards the singular hallway, you go through the domed arch, and the hallway extends on. Featureless, smooth grey marble. Like a solid punch that seemed to have carved out whatever this material was. It extends for 100 feet. 150 feet. And even though there's very very faint light, and many of you can see through darkvision, there is a darkness about 60 feet from you that seems to consume what you can see. You can only see so far beyond that radius, and you're not quite sure where that oppressive shadow is coming from. The air is chilled, but not uncomfortably so. You can hear the distant sound of pinched winds whining through small spaces. A familiar sound from the many times you've spent underground, through caverns that had some openings that allowed air to streak through to the surface. A few steps more and suddenly the hallway opens into a second chamber. Into a library, if you could even call it that. Bookshelves that stretch upward for seemingly hundreds of feet, before flickering lights fell from your vision. You do not see where they stop. These columns of just tomes and cases and scrolls and parchments stacking as in tablets and any form of recorded information seem to just be infinite in front of you, to two sides of this road and upward. They seem to stretch in almost every direction, the walls to the side of you. You see columns ahead of you, and they tend to wind and curl like a labyrinth made of bookcases, to no end. It's very Escher-esque in how the further up you look, they tend to curve and shift and bend around each other. Your eyes, now attuned to the realms beyond mortality, you catch glimpses of shifting wind gathering books and turning pages. Spirits of the library, though sparse as they may be from this entry point, organizing. Reading and learning from whatever words are within. You begin to almost get vertigo, trying to contemplate the strange and overwhelming construction of such a wondrous place. An endless sea of stories. Spectral custodians keeping the tales of each other and the history of Exandria past, present, and binding the pages to tell what will eventually be the present, currently the future.
Taliesin: I've dreamed of this place.
Liam: Inside Matt's brain?
Taliesin: This is immortality. This is everything. (sighs, chuckles) I may never leave. I glide over to Vex and hold her close. This is stunning. My god, I think they may have actually forgotten all the idiot things I said yesterday.
Laura: Feels pretty good, doesn't it?
Taliesin: I think they've completely forgotten. I'm sorry. May have panicked.
Laura: I give him a kiss.
Taliesin: I'll be right back. I'm going to run towards one of those stacks, like a child.
Matt: Okay. You begin to take the first--
Taliesin: I'm doing a title run. I want to figure out the organizational system before I touch a book.
Matt: There are no words on any of the spines.
Taliesin: I pick one.
Matt: Okay. You pick.
Taliesin: All right. I pick it up. I look around to see if anybody has a problem. And I turn to the title page.
Matt: It's ironic you do this, because the book is in Celestial.
Taliesin: I read Celestial.
Matt: You do. It's ironic that you did that. (chuckles) Glancing through, it appears to be describing a birth. Describing a tunnel, then a light, then a cry.
Taliesin: I skip to the end. Last page.
Matt: It seems to be an older man, surrounded by his family--
Taliesin: I've got it. I put it down. I pick up another one.
Matt: You glance through this book.
Taliesin: First page.
Matt: Begins very similarly to the last one.
Taliesin: Last page.
Matt: This one actually ends with what appears to be a horseback riding accident.
Marisha: Oh god, they're souls.
Taliesin: 115 pages in.
Matt: 115 pages in you get to a page that seems to talk about the sorrow of a lost romance, and trying to deal, coping at a young adult age.
Taliesin: I put it back and I turn. They're made of people.
Laura: Wait, what? It's skin books?
Taliesin: It's people! And I'm going to find the most interesting spine and I'm going to turn to the first. Birth. Death.
Laura: I can't read that, dear.
Taliesin: Birth! Death! Sex. Birth, death, some disappointment. I am just gone. I'm running back and forth, finding whatever interesting spine I can. Are they all in Celestial?
Matt: They are currently. All the ones you've picked up are in Celestial.
Taliesin: Oh my god. Okay. This is great. All right. I'm eventually probably going to pass out from mild hyperventilation and have to sit down.
Laura: We should maybe find Ioun, don't you think?
Taliesin: If we must, yes. Just as an experiment, I'm going to think about Vesper and try and touch a book. I don't expect this to work, but I'm going to close my eyes and think about, and pick it up and flip through it.
Matt: Make a religion check.
Taliesin: Nope.
Matt: You grab a tome and pull it forth, and as you read through the story, it's an unfamiliar one.
Taliesin: There's a system. I will discover the system. I'm going to keep running around like a kid.
Matt: What are the rest of you guys doing while Percival is running around like a kid?
Travis: I'm not interested in the fucking books.
Marisha: Distracted by Percy, Keyleth just scans. Does anything in Primordial stick out?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Marisha: That's good. 29.
Matt: Glancing about, none of the spines have anything written on them, so you have to start pulling a few books out and opening them.
Marisha: I hold my hand over and pull.
Matt: You open it up. It's not in a language you understand.
Marisha: I put it back and get frustrated.
Taliesin: I've stopped. I'm good.
Liam: Watched her the whole time and quietly walk up behind and give her a hug from behind and don't say anything.
Sam: Are there any doors leading forward or back?
Matt: It's a labyrinth of bookshelves. There's a path forward between, two or three ahead of you, but then it comes to an end where it splits off in two directions. Like I said, they travel up infinitely, so you're not quite sure which way leads where.
Laura: Is Sprigg still glowing?
Matt: Sprigg is, actually-- There's a very faint blue glow in him that never really faded since your arrival.
Laura: I wonder if we could follow the glow. Warmer?
Marisha: Hey, Sprigg. Stand over there!
Darin: All right. I run to where she's pointing. Is there any change in the glow?
Matt: No noticeable change.
Marisha: Damn. Sprigg, stand over there!
Darin: I just was shot with a bunch of arrows, so give me a second. I run over there, stop halfway and go, ow, and then I continue. When I get there, any change in the glow?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Darin: Oh, it's a one.
Matt: No discernible difference.
Sam: You're inspired, if you want to use inspiration.
Matt: It's a natural one. It's an auto-fail.
Taliesin: Is there a card catalog?
Sam: Is there a central area info desk?
Matt: You can make an investigation check to begin to wander around and try to find your way.
Sam: Oh, that's a natural 20.
Matt: Scanlan seems to walk with purpose into one of the random rows.
Sam: I'm clutching my Ioun stone.
Matt: Okay. All right. Anyone else do anything?
Taliesin: He seems to have purpose. I'm giddily following behind.
Matt: Okay, Percy's following Scanlan.
Laura: I'm going to walk with Percy. Oh, and Trinket's out.
Matt: Okay. Trinket (bear grunt) looks confused and starts looking up.
Laura: I know. I know, dear.
Matt: Falls onto his back.
Sam: Are Vex and Percy walking with me?
Matt: Yes, they are.
Sam: I'm going to whip out my flute and I start going, (wedding march).
Taliesin: Oh. He may have heard.
Laura: He heard?
Taliesin: I thought you were going to die! I may have panicked.
Laura: Wait.
Taliesin: We were asked to plead for your life, and I may have panicked.
Laura: Who did you tell? Percival, who did you tell?
Sam: Look at your shirt.
Laura: What? (screams) No!
Taliesin: I panicked!
Laura: Percy!
Taliesin: I panicked! There was a giant glowing sun, and I may have panicked. Well, I was a bit vague, but I was--
Laura: A bit vague? Scanlan, what did he say?
Sam: Well.
Taliesin: Oh no.
Sam: First comes love. Then comes marriage.
Taliesin: I may have hinted that we might have eloped. May have hinted.
Sam: Wait, you're married?
Taliesin: I may have hinted.
Sam: Wait, no, you said you were betrothed to be married? Wait, you're married? Oh, wow, you just spilled it!
Taliesin: Silence! Cone of Silence!
Sam: They're married!
Matt: You try and yell, and it's making no sound. It is just absolute quiet. What are the rest of you guys doing?
Darin: I run in the corner and see if I glow again.
Liam: Keyleth and Vax heard the (wedding march), so we had a very different silent scene over in our spot.
Marisha: Yeah, Keyleth was quietly sobbing in Vax's arms and then heard (wedding march) and went (angry roar).
Laura: Why is that bad? Why was that angry?
Liam: Because we don't get that.
Laura: Oh.
Matt: Grog?
Sam: So you're going to ruin everyone else's joy. You're one of those couples.
Liam: Thank you, vacation Scanlan.
Marisha: Worst double date sangria partners ever.
Taliesin: He's back, ladies and gentlemen. He's back and taking no prisoners.
Sam: Are you guys going on vacation? We got a divorce.
Liam: It's the Debbie Downer SNL sketch.
Matt: Grog, what are you doing?
Travis: I'm as uncomfortable as I can possibly be. This is the worst-case scenario of my entire life. I'm not moving and hoping this is all over soon.
Taliesin: I love that.
Travis: It's just endless books, beyond what you can see! Are there chairs?
Laura: I feel like Pike would've comforted him.
Matt: Yeah, Pike comes over.
Travis: There are chairs?
Matt: No, there aren't. She goes, "Do you want to go with everyone else, Grog?"
Travis: I don't know. Do you?
Matt: "It's okay, yeah! They're walking."
Travis: I want to leave. Fast.
Matt: "The faster we follow them, then the faster we can go."
Travis: Okay. Let's go.
Matt: "I bet you could read some of these books."
Travis: I bet not. These are really tall books.
Matt: "Come on." She grabs your hand and begins tugging you behind her. What are you guys doing?
Marisha: Me and him?
Matt: Yeah.
Liam: Leaning into each other.
Matt: Okay. So you guys stay there.
Darin: I'm trying to see if I'm glowing anywhere.
Matt: You run around for a good minute and a half and you're not seeing any sort of change.
Darin: Nothing?
Matt: No.
Darin: Can I go forward into the bookcases and look right and left to see where they lead?
Matt: Okay, yeah. You turn around the corner and see them disappear around the edge.
Darin: I'll continue.
Matt: Okay. So you follow them. As you guys are having this silent argument, Sprigg catches up to you, but you hear nothing, Sprigg, as they're all going...
Taliesin: I just turned it off. I got everyone to agree.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Hi. How's it going?
Darin: Glowing. You are, too! What's going on with that? Yeah, you seem to be blushing.
Laura: It's so hot in here. It's very hot in here.
Matt: Pike and Grog catch up around the corner.
Travis: What did you find? The way out? Exit?
Sam: Seems like it could be this way. We'll have to band together and go forward.
Travis: Really?
Sam: Yes.
Taliesin: Where did you get the sunglasses from?
Sam: It's glowing in here.
Matt: The Ioun stone actually is giving a faint glow similar to the glow that you see emanating from Sprigg's torso.
Sam: Is it glowing any more than--
Matt: Make a perception check.
Sam: Oh, okay. That's an eight. Maybe 11, I don't know. Do I add Jack of All Trades?
Matt: You do, yeah. If you're not--
Sam: I really want to know. I will inspire myself, and I'll add a d12. That makes it 16.
Matt: Okay. You start getting the sense, the further you walk, both your stone and Sprigg are beginning to emanate a slightly stronger glow, and so you guys begin to realize that this could be used as a path to something. You're not quite sure.
Sam: Let's keep going.
Matt: Okay. So everyone's going behind.
Liam: Imagination clarification, because a Silence effect went off there. Did Vax and Keyleth hear, "You're married?" Or was that all covered by Silence?
Matt: No, he crushed that in Silence.
Liam: So we heard the song, but that's it. Good to know.
Matt: Everyone else has gone ahead and vanished into the library. You guys are staying?
Liam: Noticing that we're totally alone, silently tug Keyleth down after them.
Taliesin: I felt that honesty was important at that moment.
Laura: No, it very much is. I'm very glad. I'm just surprised he didn't say anything. I spoke with him.
Sam: He was acting nobly. I won't tell anyone if you don't want me to.
Taliesin: We had to tell them eventually.
Matt: As you're following the stone, you hear some footfalls as Vax and Keyleth catch up to you guys.
Marisha: We already know. It's fine.
Liam: You're engaged. You don't have to--
Taliesin: Well.
Laura: I'm sorry I didn't tell you about that. Engagement. But you know.
Marisha: You fucking liars. You fucking liars! Just tell us! We know!
Laura: We got married.
Taliesin: We may have gotten married.
Marisha: Yeah. (sarcastically) Oh, surprise!
Taliesin: It was going to be--
Laura: (weakly) Celebration!
Taliesin: We didn't want to make it a thing. We wanted it to just be--
Sam: I think it's great.
Laura: Thank you, Scanlan.
Sam: It's wonderful when two people can fall in love and have each other forever and ever. That's nice. No, I mean it! You guys are great. You're super cute together. You'll make Whitestone-- You'll be celebrities there.
Travis: Do we have to get you gifts?
Sam: No, they eloped, so we're clear.
Taliesin: Very specifically, no. This place.
Marisha: Yeah, it's amazing. And Keyleth lights up her flame hands as she walks off in a fury.
Taliesin: Do you not know what this place means? Am I the only one who understands what this place means?
Travis: I would love to know.
Taliesin: It all matters!
Laura: None of us have forgotten.
Taliesin: No, I mean, really! It all matters! So much, and it's not going to go away! Nothing goes away!
Marisha: No, it only gets filed away in some library where no one else can experience it except for, what, one, maybe two people ever.
Taliesin: One and two people are all that it takes to experience something!
Matt: An echoing voice billows out from the right side of your troupe. A creaky, warm, matronly voice that surrounds and almost welcomes you with the intonation of a grandmother. It says, "Nothing is forever, Percival." You glance off to the right, and you can see there's a break in the bookcase. To your right, you see the shelves have stopped ahead in this direction to reveal a circular common area within the library, where the ground domes downward into an 80-foot-wide concave pit of cushions and tables, all standing at odd angles alongside this pit, but never sliding. Gravity seems to shift depending on where the dome stands. These tables hold teacups and writing implements and various other décor, and things that involve binding and writing. None of them slipping, all of them affixed to the table as the dome slowly comes to a central rest. Long, spiraling streams of silver, blue, and gray silk descend from the supposed ceiling that is beyond your sight, and they come down like drifting silks that push past as you enter the area. Sitting 40 feet from you in the center of the dome, no larger than a normal person, is an older woman with long, wavy silver hair. Her olive skin is somewhat weathered and wrinkled around her almond eyes, but the warmth of her smile, and her vibrant purple irises put you at ease immediately. Her blue and white robes tumble out from her form in tendrils of parchment that snake through the pillows like roots. She smiles as you turn and see her. "I felt that you would find me." And that's where we'll end tonight's session.
Sam: Wow, Matt. Wow, Darin!
Liam: Can everybody watching still at home give a round of applause for Darin?
Matt: Seriously. If you're available, you may want to, if you can, come and join us for the first half maybe. Not next week, but the week after Comic Con, if you're interested. Because I want to roleplay out you meeting Ioun.
Darin: It would be an honor. You know how important this is to me.
Matt: Great. I'll look forward to having you back in a couple weeks, then.
Darin: And I will see you next weekend, as well!
Matt: Yes, indeed. Oh, Comic Con. Guys, thank you so much. Great game, well done. Breaking stuff, apparently. Once again, we have no episode next week because we'll be at Comic Con, but we have our panel on Saturday for Critical Role. Love you guys, hope you have a wonderful night, and is it Thursday yet? Good night! [music]

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hi, everyone! Welcome to Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons and Dragons. Good job, Sam. Thank you for your patience. Sorry we were off last week. I'm doing much better, for those who are worried about it. Happy to be back. Missed you guys, and happy to be back at this table. So yeah! It's been a couple of weeks. Let's go ahead and get into some announcements real fast. First off, tonight we have our fantastic sponsor, Shadow of War!
Travis: Shadow of War! Oh shit!
Laura: Are we allowed to say what we did in it?
Matt: Yeah, a number of us actually worked in the game. It comes out October 10th, actually.
Sam: And the full name of the game is Middle Earth: Shadow of War, for all of those who are looking for it alphabetically.
Travis: The sequel to Middle Earth  Shadow of Mordor.
Sam: Yes, and many of us were in the game yelling our asses off. I played a little character known as Orc 4. It was so much! I did 20 recording sessions.
Travis: I remember talking to you! I was Commanding Orc 1.
Sam: Oh, nice.
Matt: I was Professional Orc 1, as well as the Witch King of Angmar, the head of the Nazgul. I'm pretty excited about that.
Laura: Oh, nice!
Liam: I was Troy Baker's fluffer. It's prestigious.
Sam: You were in it, right? No?
Liam: I'm in the first one.
Sam: Oh, what did you do in the first one?
Liam: The thing I killed two weeks ago? That was me.
Sam: Laura, were you in it?
Laura: I am in it. I play the Blade of Galadriel.
Liam: You play a sword?!
Laura: I know! Get this, so I'm an assassin elf, right? She's really cool. The DLC is going to be about my character.
Sam: Do you have a number after your character?
Laura: No, it's the only one. It's the coolest thing! I don't think I ever told you this. When I saw the character design? She's a combo of Vex and Vax.
Matt: That's pretty great.
Laura: No, seriously, though, she's an elf chick. So she's an assassin. She's got dual-wielding, and she wears feathery armor. It's so freaking cool! So basically, it's like if Vax was a girl, which is Vex.
Travis: But with the sex appeal of Grog.
Laura: Of course, baby.
Matt: I will never forget being at the Shadow of War panel at Comic Con, and you mentioning the DLC and then going, "Has that even been announced yet?" And there was five seconds where I watched Laura wither away into a shell of a human before they went, "Oh, yeah, it's announced." And you reverted.
Laura: Even at this very moment, as I said it, aftershocks. "Was I supposed to say that?"
Liam: They scare you so bad that, even when it's official, I'm like "I'm in the--"
Travis: It's such a dope game. The Nemesis system has been improved on from last time. We can testify.
Sam: We're supposed to mention that on the 18th of this month, Shadow of War will be debuting a brand new live-action trailer that will take you near the game? No! Right into the game. Soon we'll need to choose whether to save or slay. During the break tonight, they're going to be showing off some awesome videos from the game. It drops October 10th. Go buy it and try to pick out our voices in the game as you slay us.
Travis: And make us rise to the higher echelons of the orc order.
Matt: By the way, if you haven't played the previous game, the Nemesis system is one of the coolest things I've played in many games in a long time. I'm going to challenge you guys to try and pick out not only who you voice orc-wise, but then to try and make sure our orcs rise to the very top. So you have nothing but generals from Critical Role. I challenge you for this. Because that would be pretty cool.
Liam: I hope you like hearing the word ranger.
Liam: Ranger!
Travis: Ranger!
Laura: Ranger!
Matt: It's going to be fun. All right, thank you, Shadow of War for being our sponsor tonight. We're excited about the game, and hope you are, too. Also, there's been a lot of insane weather tragedies that have been in the news recently. I want to make sure that everyone knows that if you want to help support relief for both of the hurricanes that have come and torn through the U.S., we have a link to the Red Cross to donate and be part of that. It'll be available in the chat and throughout the rest of the game tonight, so if you have the opportunity to help out, I highly recommend it. Come help these people that have lost a lot in the past couple weeks or so. Give what you can. I've given, and we really appreciate that support.
Travis: They'll let you delineate between Harvey and Irma, too, in case you want to pick one over the other. Harvey had a lot of support from J.J. Watt's $30+ million dollars. Irma, the damage is still accruing.
Matt: I grew up in Florida. I know the area well, and I have family out there that endured it. It's very close to me. So if you can, greatly appreciate it. Let's see here. Merch! Laura.
Laura: This feels so weird to say after you mentioned that.
Travis: Nah, but we make happy stuff.
Laura: Happy stuff! Which, by the way, you're wearing your Dalen's Closet shirt, Matt, and it matches your eyeballs so beautifully.
Travis: Ooh!
Matt: I'll show it to you, and my back brace, to make it really better.
Sam: Are we selling those in the store?
Matt: The back brace?
Travis: Critical Role back brace! Do you DM 20 hours a week? We've got something for you!
Liam: We missed an opportunity to put Backblaze on that back brace. (groaning)
Laura: Next time.
Matt: Next time.
Liam: No next time!
Laura: There are Dalen's Closet shirts in the store. Go check them out. There's tank tops. They're really cool; they're cheaper because they are sleeveless. That's less material. Dagger, Dagger, Dagger; it's been re-released. We have the Scanlan tee; we have all the tees. And it's getting cooler now, so the hoodie is still in the store; the softest hoodie ever is there. Go check it out. We have hats and we have key chains and necklaces and pencils and aprons and tarot cards, and other stuff. And more stuff coming! So keep your eyes peeled.
Matt: Thank you, Laura. Also reminding you guys, we have up to episode 40 of Critical Role now released on iTunes, Google, and geekandsundry.com has all the information for it. So if you want to listen to the podcast, or your friends have been like, "I don't want to watch it, but I just want to hear it."
Laura: I want to watch it, but I don't want to watch it.
Matt: It's good for commutes.
Marisha: Also, clarification, speaking of saying things prematurely before I should have. I've gotten a lot of questions being like, "What happened to that plan of rolling out one a day once a week?" Yeah, that plan didn't turn out to be feasible. And I might have said that-- I said it, and then I looked down at the announcement sheet and it said in parenthesis afterward, "But do not announce this part." Which, why was it even on our announcement sheet? Still my fault.
Matt: To be fair, I remember looking down at the sheet as you were announcing it.
Marisha: Oh shit. Anyway, it's never going to happen because they're easier to do in batch. So ten at a time. That's what you get.
Taliesin: It's like one cookie at a time. You can't bake one cookie at a time.
Marisha: It's just better to do them in a block.
Matt: Thank you for the heads-up on that. We announced a while back the Critical Role six-issue mini-series comic book. We announced last week that it's going through Dark Horse, which I'm super excited about.
Travis: DM is very excited.
Matt: Oh, yeah. Dark Horse was my introduction. I was probably in fourth grade when I got into the Alien comics through Dark Horse. I didn't realize there was more to explore. Dude, I've been a fan of them ever since. Being able to take this into their realm is brilliant. I'm so excited. First issue drops on the 20th, guys.
Marisha: The digital issue. The first issue releases digitally this coming Wednesday.
Sam: Is it good? I haven't read it.
Laura: It's so good!
Sam: Why have you all read it and I haven't?
Marisha: Because you don't read your emails.
Sam: Yeah, that's fair.
Liam: You show up ten minutes after we start, you leave an hour before we end the game every week.
Sam: That's true.
Matt: So that's coming up. It will be on Comixology, iBooks, Dark Horse Digital, Kindle, Nook, Google Play, etc. It's written by our good friend, Matt Colville. It's drawn beautifully by our good friend, Olivia Samson from the Critter community, and the coloring and lettering by Chris Northrop. Super stoked, hope you guys enjoy it. So look out for that next week.
Liam: Looks fucking awesome! The writing is awesome! The art is awesome!
Matt: What he said.
Laura: Did you already say about the physical copies, too? When those will be released?
Matt: We'll have a trade available in spring 2018.
Liam: It's coming out with the DLC for Middle Earth.
Matt: Yeah, to tie in with it. Of course, we have Talks Machina coming up this Tuesday at 7:00pm Pacific, here with our fantastic host, Brian. We'll be talking about our episode tonight. So look for that next week. All the Critical Role episodes are now available on Alpha. They've gone back and added the bells and whistles, the information, the stats, everything, for all the episodes before Alpha even launched. So if you ever watched it there, it's all updated.
Sam: I really should check my email!
Taliesin: We would miss this sense of wonder that we get to share with the community. It's really nice.
Marisha: They get your unbridled reaction.
Taliesin: It's like watching Home Alone next to Macaulay Culkin. It's great. I'm getting so much out of it.
Matt: All righty. Last few things. One  this is Sub-tember, guys, by the way, for Twitch. Sub-tember means for the next few weeks, Twitch has a special promotion where subscriptions are half off for new subs for every Twitch channel, including this one. So if you've been watching and you've always wanted to subscribe, but you never really felt like you can give the full $5, it's half off this month. So if you want to subscribe to our Twitch, now's the month to do it. Just giving the heads-up. It's pretty rad, and thank you, Sub-tember. Last but not least, Laura and Travis, you are going to be at an event soon, aren't you?
Travis: Yeah! End of this month, we're going to be at Anime Weekend Atlanta. The last week of September. Hotlanta, Georgia. We're going to be there with other people like Jennifer Hale and people like that. But we're going to be there. Come out, say hi, smack our hands, not our faces.
Laura: Give a high-five.
Marisha: I love Atlanta.
Travis: It's pretty dope. I want to get in that aquarium with those whale sharks. That's what I want to do. We're not going to have time for that. And then, also, in the middle of November, we're going to be going to Australia. Laura and I are going for two weeks. We're going to be in Adelaide, Brisbane. So for all the Aussies-- what?
Laura: I've got to get my passport.
Travis: Oh shit!
Liam: Expedite!
Travis: So barring Laura's passport showing up--
Matt: You can hear the $400 burn away instantly. That's how much it costs to expedite.
Laura: Oh my god. I'm doing that tomorrow! I'm going to write a note in my calendar.
Travis: (sighs) Adelaide, Brisbane. If you're there, you want to see us, come see maybe just me. (laughter)
Sam: Everybody tweet Laura tomorrow at noon, saying--
Laura: No, but seriously! If you want to, feel free.
Travis: Will Friedle will be there, too. He's going to be my convention wife. Me and Friedle.
Laura: I'm writing an email to myself.
Marisha: Australia? Is that when we got caught with having to have those weird travel visas, as well?
Matt: Yeah. Make sure you get your travel visas.
Marisha: Yeah, we didn't know until we got to the airport. And then they're like, "You have to have one." And then we're like, "Oh, okay." Luckily, you can do it online.
Travis: Oh, I totally have that covered.
Matt: All right. Well, cool, guys! Thank you so much. Thank you for dealing with our long announcements. It's been a few weeks. However, I think, with that, it's time to dive into tonight's episode of Critical Role. [dramatic music]
Matt: Welcome back. I'll remember this. Why's everything targeting Scanlan in this battle? Welcome back, everyone. So last we left off, Vox Machina, preparing themselves for a final fray with the recently ascended god, Vecna, the Undying King, discovered that he had brought the city of Thar Amphala about 300 miles northwest, of Vasselheim on the continent of Issylra. Upon gathering allies to assail this region, you discovered that it was shifting, moving. And apparently the corpse of the long dead primordial earth titan had been risen and began marching its way towards Vasselheim with Thar Amphala embedded at the top of its torso, protected by some sort of magical barrier. With an advance army of wyvern riders at your back and J'mon Sa Ord giving you a ride between their wings, you made your way southward. Quickly depositing yourselves within a waterfall, expelling opening towards the hip of this large titan undead beast, you began to fight your way to the interior. Dealing with corrupted earth elemental shards, you began to make your way through the catacombs, the long ruined and abandoned dwarven city of Thomara, where you encountered the tomb of the dwarven king. Where you also managed to raid the tomb, found a magical item, and dealt with some fun traps in the process. Then, continuing to follow where this route led you upward, hopefully towards the underbelly of the city of Thar Amphala, you uncovered a mostly cleaned out vault and did battle with some undead trolls that immediately rushed in and attacked you. You managed to destroy them, and make your way out through a small cavern that had just momentarily collapsed, clearing out of the way. You all began to squeeze through the opening to find the next length of your journey. And that's where we left off. As you guys all crawl through this recently cleared opening, you come into a partially collapsed cavern about 20 or so feet wide in places with elements of the ceiling fallen in. You can see the rocks that are scattered amongst the ground rumbling with each impact of the feet of the titan you're currently riding within. It seems to be going at a steady incline beginning baseline and then about 20 feet ahead, begin to rise upward to about a 30 to 45-degree angle with the next 25, 30 or so feet.
Sam: How do you play Dungeons and Dragons?
Matt: Two weeks, Sam? It's too much for you?
Sam: I've forgotten entirely what we're supposed to do now. Insight check! I got nothing.
Liam: I'm going to do my due diligence and scoot a little ahead of everybody and start looking for traps or anything hinky.
Travis: Wait, Vax. You should consult that little scrawny NPC fellow that was supposed-- oh, wait. Oh, he's dead.
Liam: Did anybody see that guy?
Travis: Nope.
Laura: Yeah, we did. We saw him.
Matt: Well, you saw the corpse after it was there, yeah.
Liam: Nobody asked me about him.
Laura: No, because you did a good job of killing that.
Liam: That clearly undead cannibal dwarf eating flesh, as I saw it, so problem solved. We're on a time table, yeah?
Laura: We should keep moving upwards, I'm assuming?
Sam: Did we get any items recently?
Travis: No, I picked up that hammer that was hitting me in the face.
Laura: Well, yeah. But Percy, the belt?
Sam: Yeah, what does it do?
Taliesin: Stuff, things. I'm using it right now.
Marisha: Do we need to do a switchery-poo of our items?
Laura: I think we maybe should do that, actually.
Sam: We all have potions, right? Did we pass out potions?
Travis: We all have at least the one superior from the brass dragon.
Liam: Are we going to take a little 20-minute breather here?
Sam: This is just for us to remember what we're doing. I don't know. Should we stop? I think we're on a timetable. We should keep moving, right? Does anyone need to heal?
Marisha: We just stopped, right?
Matt: You'd taken a brief rest after the battle with the trolls where you guys began to look about the inside of the vault. And that's where the part of the exit collapsed.
Travis: I didn't roll any hit dice. Should we roll some hit dice?
Marisha: You dug things out?
Laura: But he was doing something? He was reading, or something.
Sam: Yeah, you were trying to read Dwarvish, or something. And it took an hour.
Travis: I clearly do not remember this. That's right, I remember. I don't remember what I read, but I remember.
Sam: It just said, "Do not enter."
Travis: Yep. There were things.
Liam: We're doing the Vox Machina thing and standing around like a bunch of dumb fucks trying to figure out what to do. I'm going to attune the Deathwalker's Ward to necrotic damage.
Matt: All righty. Necrotic it is.
Travis: We also need to be on the lookout for that sword, remember? In the story?
Sam: The sword of Kas?
Travis: Just saying. Keep your eyes peeled, high-perception people.
Laura: All right.
Taliesin: I literally can't see anything.
Laura: Wait, we have light.
Marisha: (whoosh)
Laura: Yeah, see?
Matt: Between her hand, his dagger, and Pike's mace, you have a few light sources that you guys maintain.
Laura: Pike's mace is lit up. We said that last time.
Matt: But do keep in mind that light sources also do make you a bright beacon in dark places.
Laura: Probably your hands are less noticeable than Pike's mace.
Liam: Oh, I don't know.
Taliesin: I think they would be less intimidated by a glowing mace than by glowing hands, at this point.
Matt: Glowing hands is like a small torch firelight. The Mace of Disruption--
Liam: Is like a headlamp.
Laura: So maybe we'll not have the mace on.
Liam: "Yeah, okay. I'll put this away."
Laura: That sounded just like her.
Sam: She's turning more and more Canadian as you go.
Liam: She's kind of Canadian already. Come on.
Matt: So if I could have a marching order, please?
Liam: Yo. Up front, looking for traps.
Laura: Did you want this acid-resistant armor? You'd at least be resistant to acid.
Travis: And Vex is probably with her brother. I'll be right behind the twins. It's the twins and then me. Who wants to be behind?
Taliesin: I'll be behind you.
Matt: Okay. Do you have Trinket out, Vex?
Laura: Yeah, Trinket is out.
Matt: Percy's after Grog.
Marisha: Me.
Matt: Keyleth, and then we have Pike and Scanlan holding up the rear. All righty, there you go. Have that marked down. How far ahead are you tracking?
Liam: 20 feet.
Matt: So 20 feet ahead, you begin to make your way up the incline, and it is loose rock in this tunnel. As you step, there are elements that skid and fall beneath the pressure of your feet, and you have to be careful as you progress up the incline based on how much it continues upward to keep your footing.
Laura: Brother.
Liam: Yeah?
Laura: Make sure you stay within 60 feet of me.
Liam: I turn around and look at her and go  all right.
Laura: You said you're 20 fucking feet in front of me, I'm using my fucking earring to whisper to you.
Liam: You're stage-whispering and that's very easy to hear.
Laura: Stay within fucking 60 feet of me, all right?
Liam: I love you. Perception check. Investigation for traps? Yeah. That is a 25.
Matt: Okay. No traps catch your attention. As you progress forward, you begin to notice the tunnel seems to be pincering a bit the further you go. The sides of the walls begin to close in and eventually, about 30 feet ahead, comes from the 15, 20-foot width that the initial entrance way into this carved tunnel was, pinches to about three feet wide.
Sam: How tall?
Matt: About five and half, six feet tall?
Taliesin: Is this pressure by design, or is this what's been done to the structure by the transformation?
Matt: You'll probably have to get closer to see. Where you are currently, it looks like part of the tunnel was carved outward and then shaken, and elements of it collapsed and loosened the earth that at one point was packed at the sides.
Laura: And the tunnel's rising steadily upwards?
Matt: Yeah. It's coming at an incline.
Travis: How's it look?
Liam: It's dark up there. I can only see about 60 feet up. Does it keep going beyond that?
Matt: The incline isn't increasing. It gets to about a 45-degree incline and then maintains that up until the outside of your visual range.
Liam: Okay. I'm a punching bag for this shit. Why don't you all wait here a minute. Wait.
All: Wait.
Laura: Do you want me to fly up there?
Liam: Well, will you go with me?
Laura: Of course. Can you not use your wings?
Liam: They're gone.
Laura: Well, then hop on.
Liam: This could be the last time we do this. Come on.
Sam: Oh god.
Liam: Well, there's only four games left, Sam.
Laura: You don't know that!
Liam: It's scripted! (laughter)
Marisha: That's going to be a Reddit thread later.
Laura: Do we have Pass Without a Trace on?
Liam: Yeah, I think that probably faded by now.
Matt: Not if you haven't recast it because after the short rest it would've been gone.
Laura: Should I cast that on us?
Liam: Yes.
Laura: No, wait! I shouldn't because I got a proficiency, so we're both stealthy stealth. We're fine. So we're just going to go. I'm not casting it. But here's the thing. Everybody stay right at the bottom. We're going to fly up, but we're not going to fly up more than 60 feet away from them.
Liam: Right. We'll go 60 feet up, see what we can see.
Laura: And then come back down.
Liam: Sure. Or you could stay there and I could go even further up 60 feet--
Laura: All right. As long as everybody's within 60 feet of me. Because we're getting really close and I don't want Vecna to see us. I've got this ring.
Taliesin: That's right. I forgot about the ring.
Liam: All right. Let's do that.
Matt: So as you guys glide up on the broom, stealthily, I want you guys both to roll a stealth check, please.
Travis: Pick from your fucking 300 dice.
Laura: Ooh, that's good.
Travis: Almost poked my eye out. You almost made me Vecna.
Laura: 30.
Liam: 29.
Laura: 30.
Matt: All right. That's impressive. So as you both quietly coast your way past this entrance way, squeezing into this two and a half, three-foot-wide location, you get just within the 60 foot range and look up and Vax, you step off the broom and make your way quietly up to the other side of the range. You get about 30 feet beyond the broom before your vision meets where this tunnel seems to end and it looks like there is a solid, rocky blockage.
Laura: What do you see?
Liam: It's corked up. It's all right. Yeah, it's blocked up with stone. I guess I'd have to get a closer look to see if we could get through.
Laura: Well, get a fucking closer look.
Taliesin: If we have to, we can just have Grog beat it down.
Laura: Yes, but quiet is the key word.
Taliesin: Is it? We can try and time it to a step.
Liam: Hand on the sides to get my way up closer to it. Looking for any traps.
Matt: Go ahead and make an athletics check as you're climbing up to maintain the strength, as the incline is now towards the end getting more and more steep.
Liam: Get ready to catch me.
Laura: I'm going to hover.
Liam: Yes! My athletics is a two, but I rolled a 19, so 21.
Matt: Deftly, you manage to find the proper handholds and pull your strength up as the final bit becomes a little bit of a upper body weight carrying situation, and you come to the edge of the rock and you see it. It does appear to be a rocky cave-in or larger boulder that has fallen or been placed to close. It looks to be one solid rock, yeah. At this point, the entrance is about four foot by two foot. And it's all blocked by one solid piece of rock.
Liam: Yeah. We're not getting through this. Hey. I'm not getting through this, you're not. Maybe Kiki can.
Laura: Do we see any other openings?
Matt: This would be a perception check.
Sam: Matt, my friends just told me to start paying attention to the cadence of the steps to see if they change in any discernible way.
Marisha: That's what we're doing. While they do that, we're timing the steps out.
Matt: Make a perception check.
Laura: 20.
Matt: 20? Okay.
Taliesin: Ugh.
Marisha: Ugh.
Sam: 15.
Marisha: 15.
Taliesin: 12.
Matt: It's not that difficult to discern the pattern of the steps. The entirety of this titan shifts and quakes with each footfall, so it's pretty easy to find the pattern. It rarely changes, and you imagine any slight shift that you feel as they're going about this is because it's stepping on or through terrain that is not flat. But it is a pretty discernible pattern.
Taliesin: We could go have Grog smash it down in tempo with the steps so that the sound will be covered.
Travis: Like Shawshank Redemption and the poop pipe.
Taliesin: I was thinking of the Tainted Love Levi's commercial.
Laura: Do I see any other--
Matt: Not really. It mostly looks like loose rock and the more you glance about with each impacting footfall, you see two or three errant rocks go. You guys watch as more rocks tumble down the incline.
Laura: Maybe we need to do this quickly. This doesn't seem like the most stable sort of tunnel. Hop on the broom, darling.
Taliesin: I like the idea of you punching this at the appropriate moment.
Marisha: It also saves me a 6th-level spell.
Travis: Well, that's what's most important. Are the Knuckles still doing that vibrating hum thing?
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: Can I go into a rage?
Matt: You may.
Travis: And I would like to try and bash the shit out of this--
Taliesin: In tempo.
Laura: In tempo.
Matt: This is a tight tunnel for you. You have to crouch down, round your shoulders as you're doing it.
Travis: I'm going to do the one-inch punch.
Matt: Make an athletics check. With advantage, because you are raging.
Travis: Yeah, because I'm an angry monster. 21.
Matt: Okay. Here's the scenario  Vex and Vax, as you guys are on the broom in the tunnel, you look down and you know in Labyrinth, when the cleaner comes through the tunnel that fills the entirety of the space? You watch as this angry goliath starts up the tunnel towards you, and there does not appear to be much of any space you could squeeze through.
Liam: Is there a bubble at the top, maybe?
Laura: Grog?
Travis: What? (angry panting)
Laura: Can we pass under his legs or something?
Liam: Dive, dive!
Laura: Rage quietly.
Matt: You can both attempt to. Make an acrobatics check to attempt to squeeze between his legs.
Laura: At the same time? Acrobatics. 22.
Liam: 30-something.
Matt: It's not comfortable, but you both (popping) out the back, between his monstrous goliath thighs. From a backward perspective, those of you who are still waiting a little further down the tunnel from Vex: it's a unique sight, as the back end of your goliath friend suddenly gives birth to two half-elves. It's very Ace Ventura 2. However, you eventually climb your way angrily up to the very edge and there is the boulder, there, and you're about to go right towards it, but then stop and remember what your friends had said, and you wait patiently for the pattern of the next footfall. (boom)
Travis: (punch impact)
Matt: Go ahead and roll an attack.
Travis: Can I make it reckless-- oh, I didn't say it.
Laura: But you do extra damage because you're--
Travis: Oh, yeah, siege. Oh, it's fine. 30.
Matt: Yeah, all right, so roll 1d4 damage.
Travis: Okay, 1d4. Four!
Matt: Plus your strength modifier and your rage damage.
Travis: Eight. 27.
Matt: Whoa, wait, did you double it already?
Travis: No.
Matt: Wait, so it's four plus eight, 12.
Travis: And my rage damage is 15. Well, that's with the axe.
Matt: That's with the axe, yeah. No, that's your overall. So your rage damage at this level is four, because you just went up a level. So it's 12 plus four, so it's 16. So you do 32 points of bludgeoning damage with a single punch to this rock. With one hit, the entire boulder shifts and cracks, and you watch as part of it breaks away, and you see a brief glimmer of a dull light from the opposite side, as it rests back into place, heavily damaged.
Taliesin: (singing) Wait for it to go again and bump, bump, bump.
Matt: You wait for the next footfall of the titan (impact). You feel the impact and the shake. Do you want to go for another punch?
Travis: Do I hit it now?
Sam: Yes!
Taliesin: Yes!
Laura: Yes!
Matt: Roll another attack.
Travis: Oh, that's even better. 33.
Matt: Easily enough. Go ahead and roll another d4.
Travis: Two plus eight. Ten plus--
Matt: Four for rage damage.
Travis: 14.
Matt: All right, and so with that, your fist slams into the boulder a second time. It explodes and shatters into hundreds of crumbled pieces of rock and stone goes firing across the distance of this tunnel, now revealing a little bit of flickering firelight. As you're sitting there seething with anger and your muscles and veins bulging with each breath--
Travis: I'm so swole right now.
Matt: Yeah. You can see above you, this entranceway opens up into a five-foot wide, ten-foot tall hallway that goes to the right and left. As you emerge, it goes a little bit to the right and front, and then to the back and behind you that direction.
Travis: Hey guys, it's a Z.
Laura: What do you see?
Travis: Let me find out. So I wiggle up a little more.
Marisha: So you know the first and last letter of the alphabet? Don't worry about it.
Matt: So you squeeze out of the small entrance way and step up into it. You can see now a well-constructed hallway. You can see there are stone slabs that are carved. The patterns and the angular architecture of this hall as it comes up into a trapezoid position. The hall comes in a bit, and the hallway rooftop is a flat, even surface. This is apparently a hall of dwarven make and seems to be a continuation of some sort of structure or pathway of Thomara.
Taliesin: Let the twins take a look. I think it would be safe.
Travis: It's a well-constructed hallway of dwarvish make. (groans)
Laura: We sneak under his legs again to like see what's going on.
Matt: You guys all eventually make your way up into this hallway. Now, it is still a five -foot-wide hallway, so you're still here in single-file progression one way or the other.
Liam: Twins are already at the top looking for problems.
Matt: Right, so you guys would be able to because it's a ten-foot-tall tunnel. You guys would be able to occupy a space above another party member if you were both on the broom.
Laura: Oh, should we be on the broom? No, you should be off the broom because you might check for traps. I'll check for traps along the wall and ceiling. And he's going to check for traps--
Liam: I'll take the lower half. That's called advantage.
Matt: So go ahead and make and investigation check.
Laura: Both of us or just him with advantage?
Matt: Both of you separately because you're investigating different elements of the hallway.
Liam: 18 for me.
Laura: Investigation? Natural fucking 20!
Matt: As you guys glance up and focus on the surrounding location. The hallway behind you goes for about 30 or so feet before it looks like a cave in. It looks like a mass of fully collapsed, broken stone. You can see bits of the hallway slabs that originally held up that part are collapsed inward and broken, left scattered across the ground. The other direction you go continues on and opens into a dark chamber about 60 feet ahead of you.
Laura: We should go toward the cave in, don't you think?
Matt: There are small built-in sconces that are magically, perpetually burning firelight.
Laura: Does this seem like there's any traps that could be set off as we walk towards the--?
Matt: You do not notice anything, as you were investigating specifically for that.
Taliesin: Check the sconces, see if they trigger something.
Laura: I'll look at the sconces.
Liam: I will look at the sconces.
Laura: I'll look at them better.
Matt: I included that as your perception for traps above. You did not notice anything that would be considered a trap.
Laura: You guys, there's no traps. We should head towards this darkened room.
Marisha: Save a life, check a sconce.
Liam: I'm going to creep about 40 feet down the hall and continue that search.
Matt: About 20 feet before this darkened chamber is there before you. As you get to the edge, you can see a little bit the very inside of this chamber. You can see a darkened brazier. It's your mind playing tricks on you. You thought you heard a raven.
Liam: Every day when I'm on the crapper, Matt. Everywhere.
Matt: A cold metallic brazier in the middle of the room. And that's as far as you can see into the chamber, before the edge of your visual range goes dark.
Taliesin: People don't install those unless there's something awful that needs to be done.
Marisha: Do we have any idea how far we've climbed?
Matt: You can make a nature check.
Liam: And do I need to make a extra roll to look for traps around this brazier?
Matt: If you want to enter the chamber, you can. You're too far away.
Marisha: Hey! Natural 20! That's a Gil 20!
Matt: As you take a moment, and think back to how far you've traveled path-wise and inclines and where you entered this titan and to where the city of Thar Amphala is placed upon its torso, you gather you're close to halfway through its torso, if not a little beyond it.
Marisha: If not a little beyond?
Sam: He's big.
Marisha: Okay, all right. Nipple level?
Matt: Sternum.
Marisha: The heartburn region? A little acid reflux?
Liam: We are the acid reflux.
Marisha: He has acid resistance against reflux.
Liam: Jesus Christ. Whoever that is.
Matt: You scoot up to the edge.
Liam: I don't want to go further than roughly 60 feet away from my sister.
Matt: Right. Which will put you right at the entryway to this chamber.
Liam: Yeah. So I will peep in from here.
Laura: I follow up and stand next to him. Did you want to go in?
Liam: I did.
Laura: Feel free.
Matt: So the marching order is the same? We got the twins up the front.
Taliesin: Yeah. I like this marching order.
Liam: Let this shit blow up in my face, so everybody hang back for a second. And I'm going to pitter patter in and look around the sconce, the room.
Laura: I think I was more stealthy than you a moment ago, so are you sure you want to be in front of me?
Liam: I love you anyway. Here I go.
Taliesin: He's better at blowing up than you are, dear.
Travis: Yeah. His heart beats once a century, so let him go.
Liam: Slower than this titan's footfalls.
Matt: All right. So as you enter the chamber, it's a small, about 20-foot radius square-shaped dark iron chamber with rounded corners. So it's about 40 feet wide from side to side, 20 feet from the center where the brazier is and the corners are slightly curved. It doesn't come to a straight, hard corner. There is no exit door currently visible; the chamber comes to an end. The room looks mostly bare, aside from an eight-foot-tall, five-foot-wide mirror coated in dust, framed in intricate gold and brass that sits across the chamber on the opposite side of where you entered.
Liam: Mirror in brass. So it's an iron room, right?
Matt: Iron room with a brass edge around this eight-foot tall, five-foot wide mirror. You can tell it's a mirror from this side. What little bit of light there is behind you, you can see your silhouette waving mirrored in the mirror.
Liam: So doorway, brazier, mirror.
Matt: Mirror. And then the rest of the chamber seems fairly empty.
Laura: And the brazier is complete dark?
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: It's cold.
Taliesin: Oh no.
Laura: This is not good.
Liam: Look at his fake innocent face.
Sam: I think it's just a vanity.
Liam: Going to check for traps from right here to start. All right. That's totally fine. That's a jellyfish. That is a 17.
Matt: You begin to glance around the chamber, best you can, to take in the scenery. You notice small gold piece-sized buttons or pressure knobs set in the rounded corners of the chamber on the mirror side. One's embedded within the upper left and right corners and within the lower left and right corners.
Sam: Pressure knobs?
Matt: They're like little buttons that are gold piece-sized that are embedded in the upper right and left corners and the lower left and right corners.
Travis: Push them!
Liam: Stubby, come up here. I have a real bad history with pushing buttons.
Matt: You also notice very thin light piles of black residue or ash scattered in places across the floor.
Marisha: Called it. This is a fucking incinerator. I knew it! This feels like an incinerator. No? What? He's looking at me-- (nervous laughter)
Liam: (sighs) So we've got buttons.
Marisha: Or lasers.
Travis: Incinerator or lasers.
Marisha: Laser incinerator! Duh!
Travis: That was a great jump for me and my character.
Liam: If something stupid is going to happen here, I don't want it to be on me alone for once. So we've got an unlit brazier, there's mirror over there, and buttons, yeah.
Laura: Maybe the mirror is a door.
Liam: I thought that, as well.
Laura: Should we try to walk through it?
Taliesin: Maybe a second interrogation room and there's another room behind it, maybe?
Liam: Can we get your hub up here, please?
Taliesin: I am up here. I'm right here.
Liam: Jesus!
Laura: Hi, darling. I don't know why he didn't hear you. You used to be so good at that. Is the mirror leaning or is it on the wall?
Matt: It's on the wall.
Marisha: Is it curved? No. The whole room isn't curved. It's a square room.
Matt: It's a square room but the corners curve ever so slightly so there's no direct corner and in those curved corners on the side that the mirror's on, so the far side from you, there's these little buttons in the upper right and left corner and the lower left and right.
Laura: Can I reach down and touch the iron on the ground? The floor? Does it feel warm?
Matt: Mm. It's cold.
Liam: I catch her wrist. Just a second. You two do the thinking, all right? And I take a step into the room.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: What do I do?
Laura: Go see if you can walk through the mirror.
Taliesin: Tap the mirror.
Travis: Light the brazier!
Laura: We've done that before and we all exploded.
Travis: Yeah, but it's Vax.
Marisha: Wait. Before we do that, can I reach some of the ashy stuff?
Matt: If you enter the chamber to, yeah.
Marisha: Hand me some ash. I'll test it.
Liam: I scoop some ash. Lady of the Grey Hunt, here. I scoop up some ash and I pour it into her hands.
Marisha: Okay. I do a nature check. What does this ash feel like it's made out of?
Sam: Human bones.
Marisha: Yeah, that's what I'm wondering. (groans)
Taliesin: Wow.
Laura: No. What is it? (groans)
Travis: Is it for real? You are lying!
Liam: Look at that face! You are not lying!
Marisha: Oh man. That's a one. Thanks, Gil. I blame Gil for his natural 20 in the balance of the universe.
Matt: It's light ash. You're not sure what the basis of what may have burned here. You see more of it gathered near where the brazier is.
Taliesin: Is it in piles that would be about human-amount of ash?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Taliesin: All right. I'll Gil this one. Yeah, natural 20. That'll do.
Sam: Only ones and 20s tonight.
Liam: That's it, yeah. Just quarters. Heads up, heads down.
Matt: More of it seems to be around the base of the brazier, but you do see there are thicker traces at different places throughout the chamber.
Taliesin: It's organic ash?
Matt: You've dealt with different types of ash. The carbon appears to have been organic-based at some point.
Liam: I pull off my belt and say  Hello, Simon. Wake him up.
Matt: Okay. (slithering)
Liam: Hi. Gosh, it's been a while.
Laura: Simon, go through the mirror.
Liam: That's right. Go check out the mirror, Simon, all right? Off you go.
Travis: Are we still in the room?
Laura: No, nobody's in the room. He's the only one in the room.
Matt: (slithering) Scoots over and heads up to the mirror and presses up against it.
Liam: I dart back one step out of the room as it happens.
Matt: The snake trying to push up against the wall but half of its body sliding against the mirror before it eventually scoots off and lands. It tries again, pushing against the mirror and then eventually (sliding).
Taliesin: I hate to say this, but tap the button?
Liam: That's on the list. Simon, buddy. Crawl up the brazier. Wrap around it. Go up to the top.
Matt: The snake slithers around and makes its way. It's a cross-metal cage. There are inch wide metal bars that all curl up like a basket and then there are bars that cross around it to hold the shape. It looks like there are some long-burned, blackened pieces of wood that have been left for a long time. So Simon curls up into the brazier and curls up around the metal, comes around the top of the outer rim of it, rests there.
Liam: There's two buttons low down. Oh man. The nostalgia here. All right, buddy. I take two steps back away from the door. Buddy buds. Will you go push those low buttons in the room?
Matt: Which one?
Liam: There's two, right?
Matt: There's four on the opposite side.
Liam: There's two high up. And I don't think he can reach the high, because he doesn't stick to walls. Get the one over here on the left first.
Laura: What if we all have to push every button at the same time?
Liam: That's true. That could be.
Matt: Simon (slithering) moves over.
Liam: I lean over to Percy, I say  science!
Matt: Hits the button. (click) Right on the entrance of where you are in the chamber, slams closed. Iron metal now closes off that entranceway.
Taliesin: I'm going to touch the door.
Sam: And say goodbye.
Taliesin: Simon, we barely knew him. Is it warm?
Matt: It is beginning to get warm.
Taliesin: It's an oven. I'm looking for some sort some sort of cancel mechanism somewhere on the outside of the door.
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Sam: Is Vax in the room?
Liam: No, I took two steps back from the door.
Laura: No, nobody's in the room.
Taliesin: Let's say that investigation was somewhere around a seven? (laughter)
Matt: It's pretty solid at this point. The walls that lean in towards the ceiling there-- it is a perfect solid iron slab that has closed off at the entrance.
Travis: No problem. I'll get it down.
Laura: No!
Liam: Wait. Simon is technically a magical item, so I don't think he would be harmed by anything going on in there, so why don't we give it five minutes?
Marisha: And maybe it'll open again.
Liam: Yeah.
Travis: Is there anything going on in the tunnel, on the outside of this door, where we are?
Laura: Coming up from behind us?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Travis: Temperature check, anything like that? Natural 20.
Taliesin: We have been gone so long!
Matt: Gone for two weeks and you guys can't find middle math. It's only extremes.
Liam: Yeah, we've had blue balls for two weeks, and it's all coming out now.
Matt: So as you guys glance back in the shadow of the tunnel behind you, nothing seems to be catching your eye. It's still dark. About two minutes in, what was once dark metal is now giving a slight orangish hue. You can feel the heat emanating from it.
Travis: There's no ash on the floor in the hallway that we are in right now, right?
Matt: I'd say, because of your perception check, as you glance around, there does not appear to be any ash.
Travis: I don't want that door to fucking open all of a sudden.
Matt: About five minutes go by as you guys are waiting. Eventually, the iron wall begins to descend. The dull orangish glow of it is still there. As it opens, a wave of heated air emerges from the chamber. You all have to immediately close your eyes. Some of you instinctually begin to step further back into the hallway. On the inside of the room, you can see the black iron interior of the chamber is also that same orangish glow. The mirror is unscathed. You all step back and watch and a few minutes pass as it slowly begins to cool off, the metal slowly darkening. You're too far away to look. You make a perception check to try and glance in?
Laura: Can't you call to him?
Liam: Simon? Come here, buddy.
Matt: There's no response.
Liam: (gasps) He's a magical item! Oh, but he could have turned back into a belt.
Taliesin: What's he going to say if you call to him? Was he going to say something?
Liam: He would come to me, Percy! Jeepers creepers! Perception check? 29!
Matt: You glance past where the button was that it hit. You see a limp belt left on the ground.
Liam: Okay, I'll get that in a minute.
Laura: When you go pick him up and put him back on your fucking waist.
Matt: Technically, since Simon's taken enough damage to revert to the belt form, Simon cannot turn back into a snake for the day.
Laura: How about that unseen servant?
Liam: I'm thinking, having no knowledge of magic, that we either want to somehow push all four of these buttons at once, as my sister said, or light this brazier, or both.
Laura: What about the brazier? Is it cold? Does it look like it's hot?
Sam: The brazier's the source of the furnace, I assume.
Travis: Are there still charred wooden pieces in the middle of it?
Matt: The pieces are still there, but it's black carbon. There's nothing in there that could burn. Whatever's been in there has been heated so much to the point--
Travis: It's not the source of the flame. Not for that much heat.
Marisha: If I was the person who designed this, why would I put a failsafe in here?
Liam: A way to get through that only the creator would know how to use?
Marisha: I feel like there's got to be another entrance because we can see another room, right?
Laura: There's no other room, it's a mirror. Oh, Keyleth, that's our reflection.
Marisha: No, I know that, but a lot of things have reflections.
Liam: Listen, all of you, or I, are going to be dead very soon. Are you sure you want to be that sarcastic right now?
Marisha: I go up to the mirror and check it out. It's cooled off enough, right?
Matt: Well, no. If you guys want to take a few minutes, you can wait until it cools off, if you want to.
Taliesin: Why don't we try pushing all four buttons at once?
Sam: Wait, before we do that, I'm going to enter the room and look around at the walls and the ceiling.
Matt: Okay, I take it you wait until it cools off. It takes about ten minutes or so for it to fully cool off, to the point where it's comfortable.
Sam: I'm looking for markings, indications of instructions, arrows, any hidden words--
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Travis: Look for Dwarvish. I'm aces with that.
Sam: Ooh, a lot. 29.
Taliesin: He's coming up with some bullshit.
Matt: Okay. Because the room is not fully cooled off, it's still warm in there, somewhat. You glance through. The ceiling and the walls all appear to be solid iron, and there's a layer of dust across a lot of it, a bit of ash from whatever previously may have been incinerated in here, long ago. As you look from the opposite side of the room into the reflection of the mirror, you see a very faint orangish glow in the reflection. It looks like, in the upper corner and the lower corner of the opposite side of the mirror as you're glancing off across to the other side. As you look over to the wall, of the room you're in, there's no glow.
Sam: Wait, so the wall that we came in through?
Matt: Let's say you enter the chamber and you move to the corner immediately to your right. You look in the mirror at an angle. You're now seeing the reflection of the corner opposite to you, right? Looking in that reflection, you can see this very faint orange glow in the upper and lower corner, but you glance over to the physical corner across from you, and it's not there.
Laura: What do your gnomish eyes see, Scanlan?
Sam: I think there's magical buttons in here and we need to find them? So I'm going to look in the mirror. I go to the opposite corner and do the same thing.
Matt: As you have this conversation and look back, those two glowing sigils are gone.
Sam: Even in the mirror?
Matt: Even in the mirror. What you saw earlier is now gone.
Travis: But they're revealed by heat.
Marisha: Where were they?
Sam: They were upper and lower corner, yeah.
Marisha: I walk over and I heat them with my heat hands.
Matt: Okay, so you take your hands and you put them up near there. As you put your hands on the wall, nothing seems to happen. As you glance through the reflection where she has her hands, that symbol seems to be appearing again.
Laura: What is the symbol of?
Sam: It's so far. I don't know. Can I see it?
Matt: It looks to be a simple triangular symbol, marked in a circle. Make an arcana check.
Sam: Oh yeah. 14 plus six, that's 20.
Matt: It's the most basic of arcane marks. It's a variation on a spell that basically is a mark that a certain enchanter or somebody places to mark as their own. However, this is meant to be a basic marker, a visual draw. There's no language behind it. It's just an indicator.
Sam: Keyleth, do that same thing to the lower one. Same marking?
Matt: As you head down there, the one above begins to slowly fade. As her hands go there, the symbol appears below.
Sam: Same symbol? Let's do that to the other walls and see if we can find other ones.
Matt: As you guys reverse, opposite sides, you go to the other corners, the ones that were immediately toward the entrance of where you walked in. Sure enough, two more symbols, mirroring where the buttons are on the far side corners.
Sam: So we push those? But there's a hidden button in there.
Travis: When you're a big fire, the walking thing--
Marisha: A fire elemental.
Travis: Sure. Do you take damage from fire? So you should be in here.
Laura: You should go in there, see if you can disengage the trap.
Liam: So you are impervious to being set on fire or burned?
Marisha: Well, when I'm a fire elemental.
Laura: Can you do that?
Marisha: Can I do it right now? Yeah. I just took a short rest, so yes, I can do that.
Travis: We also have an unseen servant.
Sam: So we're going to need four people.
Marisha: So what's the end goal? What am I doing?
Liam: Press all four buttons at once, although we've got at least three sharpshooters--
Sam: Not the buttons that we can see. What are these symbols here? I think they're buttons, as well.
Travis: It might be a depression on the wall or something.
Marisha: But what if the buttons are correlated with the symbols?
Taliesin: Let's try pushing all four buttons.
Travis: The regular buttons or the magic ones?
Liam: Please stand by.
Laura: I want to go look at where the symbol is and see if it's a fucking button.
Marisha: Yeah, if I touch the symbol, there's nothing there, right?
Sam: Was there anything there?
Matt: You put your hand on there. Nothing. The wall doesn't move.
Marisha: It's just a wall.
Travis: No depression, no toggle?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Travis: I've got this, you guys. Oh! Minus two. 17!
Matt: 17. Grog, as you step up and glare down at the place where Keyleth had placed her palm, you get frustrated and (sighs heavily). As you exhale, it looks like a bit of soot and ash that had been slowly drifting in and filling this space flutters away. You can see two lines, parallel to each other, about an inch tall.
Travis: Fifth Element, anyone? Oh look! Breath of Grog reveals all! Look, behold! Two. Lines.
Laura: What did you do?
Travis: I breathed on the wall.
Sam: What do they do? What do these lines do?
Marisha: I do a quick Gust cantrip.
Matt: Across the parallel lines? All right. As the wind blows across it, a lot more of the soot and the ash blows around the area. It creates an open space where it pushes out to the edges and darkens areas of the floor and the vicinity around Keyleth. That edge of that corner, where you blew the Gust cantrip that Grog had unfurled, is now clear, the iron revealed. Nothing beyond the two.
Laura: I fly up on my broom and do it to the symbol up on the corner and go (blowing).
Matt: Okay. So up there. You blow on that one and it looks like--
Marisha: Hang on, I've got a paper ready.
Liam: How many people at home do you think have figured this out already?
Laura: We already figured it out!
Sam: Wait, you guys are blowing on the arcane symbols?
Laura: Yeah, to clear them out!
Travis: If you're looking at the door we came in, Grog blew on the lower right?
Sam: And that's two lines. Boom.
Matt: That would be lower right.
Travis: Two vertical lines.
Matt: Correct.
Laura: I'm in the corner above Grog.
Matt: That would be upper right.
Taliesin: I'm going to do bottom left.
Matt: All right, you blow, and you watch as the dust reveals. It's two more lines.
Laura: Two lines? Shit. I thought it was going to be another--
Taliesin: Bottom left. Getting out a hanky and (blows).
Liam: Did you use your ascot?
Taliesin: Yes, of course. That's what it's there for. The back of it.
Laura: The one clean spot left on it.
Matt: That one has four parallel lines.
Laura: Ooh! I'll go into the corner above Percy. There was a reflection there, too, right?
Sam: Blow! Laura, blow!
Laura: (blows) I looked straight at the camera as I did it. It was really awkward.
Matt: All right, that one has a single line.
Sam: Wait, so we've got one, two, two, four?
Laura: Is there one with three lines, or are there any more areas we saw a reflection?
Travis: What about above the door? It is opposite of the mirror, right? If one's a door, and the other one's a door?
Laura: Okay, I'll blow above the door.
Liam: And I'm going to start blowing around the mirror.
Laura: We all walk around going (raspberries).
Travis: Constitution check to see who passes out first?
Matt: What was that?
Taliesin: Does the mirror have a fancy frame?
Matt: It's not extremely intricate, but it looks like there's a brass or bronze frame around it.
Taliesin: Are any of these symbols mirrored in the frame itself? Is there a mirror of any of these symbols in the frame?
Matt: As you look in the actual frame itself, you don't see anything that matches the symbols.
Laura: What if these are numbers and the order you have to push the buttons?
Sam: Except we have two twos, and no three?
Laura: I know. One, two, four!
Taliesin: No, because you have to hit one, and then you have to hit the two together--
Sam: And then why not three? Okay, all right. Can we do a sweep for more?
Travis: Can I clear off the door area that we walked through?
Matt: So Grog, you go through, (rapid blowing). Blowing around. Okay. Make an investigation check.
Marisha: I take my mantle and start doing a--
Matt: You clear that archway very well, around the door. You do reveal Dwarven runes on the upper right corner, upper left corner, lower right, and lower left corner of the doorframe.
Travis: I only know Dwarven writing. I don't know runes.
Matt: Well, the runes are part of the Dwarven language.
Travis: The runes are part of the Dwarven language, so I know them.
Laura: Pike goes over and she helps you.
Travis: Help me, Pike! Yeah, I would like to decipher what these symbols mean.
Laura: "If you lift me up, I could see the ones above the door!"
Liam: "Yeah, the last time I wanted you to do it on your own, but I think we're pressed for time."
Travis: I hold her up to the upper left corner of the doorway.
Matt: Okay, so turning around, upper left corner. Okay. That one is the Dwarven rune that represents the number three.
Travis: Three. All right. Now, to the upper right-hand corner.
Matt: That is the number one.
Travis: Okay. I put her on the ground and I say, okay, look at the lower right-hand corner.
Matt: So lower right-hand corner would be a two.
Travis: And now the lower left-hand corner.
Matt: A four.
Laura: Oh, yeah! We know! That's the amount of times you have to push the button!
Taliesin: So one-one, two-two-two-two, three, four-four.
Sam: Possibly.
Laura: Wait, I think we reversed it.
Liam: How long does your unseen servant last?
Sam: Not too long.
Liam: How long? An hour? Ten minutes?
Sam: I'll look in my memory. One hour, but I have to be close to it. How big is this room?
Matt: It's a 20-foot radius from the center of the brazier, so it's 40 feet on each side.
Taliesin: Is our physicality of this map correct? If we show you this?
Liam: Well, I have this jar. It's an oil of etherealness. You could potentially be standing in here, but not be in here. Lasts an hour, though. Same time gap as your friend. You could stand in here and not be in here.
Sam: From the doorway to the mirror, is it less than 60 feet?
Matt: Yes.
Sam: Oh, then I can be out of the door. Am I right with what I wrote down there?
Matt: All right, so this is the-- facing from the inside--
Sam: Yeah, from the brazier-- Frasier Crane. Looking at the door that we came in. Right?
Matt: I'm going to have to draw you one. I think you guys got confused on that one.
Laura: I think me and Travis got it right.
Sam: I think, Matt, you're wrong.
Travis: I have the same thing as Laura.
Liam: I'm pretty sure it's up up down down left right left right A B A B.
Laura: I hope we passed the test.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Did we get it right?
Matt: There, that's what you get! Sorry, I'm limited in my reach right now.
Marisha: I love that we all did something similar but all wrote something different. We're like, numbers, somewhere!
Matt: Yep, almost. Almost.
Marisha: Did you help us, or are you just saying "almost?"
Matt: I'm saying, looking back and seeing where the numbers lie and the runes in there, you have the correct configuration.
Laura: (victorious laughter)
Marisha: I think this is right. I think you have this. I think I have the right part of this and you have the right part of this.
Laura: We'll copy it and you can see what the fuck is correct.
Travis: Yes.
Laura: No, this is wrong. I'm just going to draw it. (counting)
Sam: Guys, Shadow of War! It's a great game by-- I don't know, who makes it? Warner Brothers!
Laura: Okay, so now we know the order to push the buttons and the amount of times to push the buttons.
Sam: Yes, so now we've just got to do it.
Travis: Should we check around the mirror frame to see if there's anything to dust off? The mirror frame?
Taliesin: I gave it a little bit of a rub.
Marisha: I'm going to go up and go tap-tap-tap on the mirror.
Matt: Okay. It taps.
Travis: Can I wipe off the edges around the frame and see if there's anything around the frame of the mirror, since I seem to be so good at this?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Travis: Three.
Matt: Three. You smear a bit of ash, but eventually get some semblance of shine through. Nothing catches your eye.
Travis: It's clear. We found everything there is to find.
Marisha: Grog draws boobs on himself in the reflection out of the ash.
Sam: All right, should we leave the room and have Mr. Invisible start tapping buttons? All right, we'll do that.
Laura: We step just outside the door again and let his invisible servant push buttons.
Liam: (singing) Scanlan Man, Scanlan Man. Does whatever a Scanlan can. Makes a guy, pushes buttons, Scanlan Man-- I'm out.
Taliesin: Look out!
Liam: (singing) Here comes the Scanlan Man.
Marisha: (singing) Here comes the Scanlan Man.
Taliesin: (singing) Here comes the Scanlan Man.
Sam: Would a person who cannot fly be able to touch the top buttons?
Matt: Nope.
Sam: Shit.
Travis: Well, there's no saying that it will activate if we do it correctly.
Liam: Also, what about shooting the button or firing an arrow at a button?
Laura: Yeah but the buttons are on this side.
Taliesin: How high up are the buttons?
Matt: The buttons? The top are about ten feet up.
Taliesin: So if he had something that was-- if he had a mop, basically, he could probably tap it.
Laura: The buttons are on the side of the mirror, so we could shoot arrows at them.
Taliesin: But only if we're in there and then we don't need an unseen servant to do it.
Sam: Want to give him a pole or something?
Taliesin: Let's give him a stick.
Sam: Do we have a stick in the bag?
Travis: I have a lance.
Taliesin: Yeah, he has a lance.
Travis: It's almost broken.
Taliesin: My god, it will finally be useful one last time.
Liam: We do have three trammels.
Taliesin: No! We are not disengaging a smoke alarm with a fucking trammel. There is a limit!
Travis: You have a slightly splintered lance.
Laura: Okay. Let's hit buttons. Let's do it! Let's get through this room.
Taliesin: Let's explain to the unseen servant what he's supposed to do.
Sam: Matt, can he hold a lance, or is that violating some-- he's not allowed to hold weapons.
Matt: He can hold them. He can't attack; he cannot be a combatant. It can hold things for you.
Liam: He's like a Kids in the Hall character.
Matt: Kind of, yeah. You're not wrong.
Sam: I conjure an unseen servant, whom I will name Simon Two.
Taliesin: Electric Boogaloo.
Liam: Not cool, man, not cool.
Matt: All right. There's this brief shimmer, and you watch as a bit of ash displaces on the ground where two footfalls (landing noises).
Sam: All right, Simon Two, take this lance. We're going to go tell you what buttons to press over there, good speed-- good speed? (laughter)
Sam: Godspell. You'll be fine. Hope you don't like burning alive. So you tell me what to tell him, because I don't have the paper. Upper left? Upper right? What do we start with?
Marisha: It's this. Tell him to do this.
Laura: The reflection of that.
Sam: Okay, so two upper right. Two pokes. Oh, wait.
Laura: So the upper left corner from where we're looking.
Sam: Yes, we're going to go mirror image of this, so project that across the room.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Oh, that was the mistake.
Matt: Okay, so pressing the upper left twice.
Sam: Yes, mirror image of this, so upper left. Let's try that.
Matt: Heads over, holding the lance. You watch the lance wobble, and it misses a couple times, (clicking) hits the button, and it clicks inward. The lance is pulled back and the button presses back out outward into its position.
Sam: Any door?
Matt: No door.
Laura: We'll know if we push it again then we did it the wrong order.
Matt: Second time, (clicking) pulls off, the button depresses.
Taliesin: All right, keep going.
Sam: So below it, two presses.
Laura: In the corner, bottom corner.
Sam: Just like your name, Simon  two.
Matt: (clicking)
Sam: Okay, opposite corner, up. One press.
Laura: Upper right-hand corner.
Matt: (clicking)
Sam: And then below that, bottom corner. Four presses.
Matt: (clicking) (laughter)
Matt: The fourth one hits. There's a moment of pause, and the mirror shimmers faintly. You watch as, almost like a stone thrown into the middle of a still pond, begins to ripple from the center, and as it ripples, each ripple seems to fade, until eventually the five-foot-wide mirror is now an oval portal that leads to darkness behind it.
Laura: Let's go in!
Marisha: I told you there was a room behind the mirror.
Travis: Yeah, let's go. Hurry! We don't know how long it will stay open for.
Sam: Simon Two is coming with us.
Matt: Okay. You hear the faint footfalls of sound behind, and Trinket takes a moment to try and squeeze through this small entranceway. Trinket had a hard enough time getting through the incline. (moans) Into the necklace. You make your way through the opposite side, and as you all step through, the portal remains open for at least a moment.
Laura: Hey, we did it, guys.
Sam: We beat a door.
Travis: We beat a door.
Marisha: Guys, it took 111 episodes, but we bested a door.
Liam: The last episode of the third campaign will be a door that we do not open.
Matt: So the darkness you step through leads into a ten-foot-wide hallway of similar dwarven stone. Same slightly angled hallways about ten feet tall or so, about five or six foot wide. You get a few steps in and about 20 or 30 seconds after you guys make your way in, the mirror portal behind closes up.
Liam: Can we see?
Marisha: Can you see through it?
Matt: Through the mirror?
Liam: I meant where we are. Are we in pitch black?
Matt: You're in pitch black, but you guys with darkvision can see there is a staircase not too far, maybe ten feet from where you stand into this next hallway.
Travis: Iron stairs? Stone stairs?
Matt: Stone stairs.
Liam: I've got a dagger out.
Matt: All right, lights up briefly and you get a little bit of a vision beyond that, and it's gradual stone steps. They're not too wide; they're made for dwarven gait, so there are many steps that are relatively shallow.
Travis: These are dwarven steps that are relatively shallow.
Sam: We can see it, Grog.
Liam: Pike says, "That's actually right".
Laura: Is there any traps?
Matt: You're welcome to search for traps.
Liam: And I'm going to scoot 40 feet up the stairs and look as I go for traps. One. I'm taking it, but I'm still going and looking for traps.
Matt: You do have reliable talent, don't forget.
Liam: Does that oversee ones? Because I've been counting ones as ones for a long time.
Matt: The reliable talent as a rogue specifically says any roll lower than a ten you take as a ten.
Sam: Any roll?
Matt: Well, not any roll. Any ability check he has to make.
Liam: Okay, well, we wrongly assumed that ones and 20s were king, but no.
Laura: So he rolled way better than me because I rolled a ten.
Liam: That's an 18. My one is an 18 now.
Matt: Yeah, because that's one of the cool things about rogues. You guys make your way up about 45, 50 or so feet up the stairway, you keeping an eye out, no traps, nothing catches your eye as iffy or strange, and the stairs now switch back into another set. It's a small landing and then it continues upward.
Liam: Okay, but I'm only going to go 40 feet in advance. That's like ten fucked rolls of mine from the past 30 games! Anyway, I love it.
Marisha: So it's a big 180, going right up?
Matt: Yeah, it's a switchback. The staircase ascends, then there's a landing, and it continues upward and around.
Laura: Do we hear anything?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Taliesin: I'll join in that perception.
Matt: So you're joining them up the staircase?
Taliesin: I'm behind. You know, the standard--
Matt: All right, so you guys are keeping up.
Marisha: Did you fuck the roll, too? Oh, what the fuck!
Taliesin: I got a 25.
Matt: Seriously, welcome back after two weeks and people just cannot-- wow.
Liam: But do you remember when we were at home and we'd go six weeks without playing and we'd spend 45 minutes trying to remember what we did, how the rules worked, what our names were, who you were.
Taliesin: Vex is right.
Travis: 25, you said?
Taliesin: 25.
Matt: 25. Okay. It's hard to discern what shifting in the distance is not the rumbling from the ever-occasional titan footfalls, but nothing seems to catch your attention. Occasionally, you hear dislodged rocks and stones clacking across the stone floor and the steps, and every now and then you catch a stone or two fall past and eventually come to rest either near or below you. You continue up the switchback stairs and lead into a third switchback that continues upward.
Liam: 40 feet in advance.
Marisha: We are following behind.
Laura: Are you looking for traps as you go, brother?
Liam: I am. That is an 18, anyway.
Marisha: I still have my hands guiding Percy, our blind human.
Matt: Leading the old man forward.
Taliesin: (old man voice) Where's Steven?
Marisha: (laughs) Where's Steven?
Matt: You do not find any other traps. There's no other issues that worry you upon this climb. You do eventually come to the top of the third switchback stairway and it leads you into a slight curved cavern. The stairs stop and it leads into a continuation of the dwarf-like hallway structure that you had below, but it is curving around now, in sections. I would say, as opposed to a gradual curve, the design in the structure here has a very rigid, geometric shape, so the curvature is in sections.
Liam: Yeah, I appreciate it as I go, and I look for traps.
Matt: All right, go for it.
Liam: Love it. That's an 18.
Matt: Okay. Coming around the edge  no traps, no plates. Nothing catches your attention. However, this tunnel comes to an end, and it opens up into a larger crevasse than the one that you previously saw that held a number of city buildings of the remains of Thomara. It looks to be about 100 to 120 feet tall, you assume, from the bits of the stalactites that you can see, barely reaching the edge of your visual range. Very faint bit of light here, bioluminescent fungus in a dull orangish color that dots the edges of this interior chamber.
Liam: And is it like where I killed that motherfucker? They were built into the cliff face, right?
Matt: Yes. This one is larger than the one you were in before, and you can see just beyond your visual range, a number of these buildings, partially crumbled in some places, some still standing obstinately against the ever-shifting interior of the titan's form, the chamber curling upward as the ceiling crawls higher and higher just beyond your visual range, and you can faintly see the images of dozens of thin bridges that weave over themselves across different levels, up into the higher portion.
Liam: I want to confirm an intuition and use my last Divine Sense and feel undead.
Matt: Okay, what's the range on that one?
Liam: 60 feet.
Matt: 60 feet? You do not sense any undead within the 60-foot range.
Marisha: I think we're in the lungs. I think we're in its chest cavity.
Liam: Speaking into the earrings; they're all behind me. I think we're in a more populous place with the undead cannibals, know what I mean? There's a very large cavern in here and a lot of room.
Taliesin: I'd be grateful if anyone got a sample of that bioluminescent fungus.
Marisha: I can get that. I'm interested.
Laura: Do you want me to fly up and get some?
Liam: We're on a schedule here.
Marisha: Well, if it's on the way. We have to go that way.
Laura: We have to go up, right? Does it look like there's openings in the ceiling?
Matt: Well currently you're the only one who's stepped into this entrance to look up, the rest of you are now exiting into the chamber.
Liam: I'll wait, obviously. Nothing's going to explode on my friends, so they catch up with me.
Matt: Okay, so they're all behind you now where this entrance is, and as you look past it, this hallway that you're entering, it looks like there was a doorway here. There was some sort of hinge on the edge that held a door that had since been broken or toppled forward. You can see pieces of the door that once held this entranceway, and a number of the buildings immediately to the right and left. That's where you stand, what do you want to do?
Laura: Does it look like there's any footprints coming in and out of the doorway that we came from?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Travis: Can I look for a doorknob or a keyhole?
Liam: Everything we were told is that this place is full of undead cannibals.
Laura: 23.
Matt: Not in a long time.
Travis: Is there shattered remnants of the door?
Matt: Yeah, you see a couple of shards here and there--
Travis: Any doorknob or a keyhole that's on the ground or anything?
Matt: Make an investigation check. Lot of investigation checks today.
Travis: Two.
Matt: You scramble about and find a couple of pieces that might be, but no, it's just more stone.
Marisha: Can I see any stairs carved in the side, in the walls, trying to head up to this-- is that what you just checked?
Laura: No, that's what I was about to look for, too.
Liam: Is there any movement, because there's bioluminescent shit on the walls in here, so there's a little bit of light, right? Yeah. 26.
Matt: 26. As you glance about-- once again, your vision, because there is very little light in here and the very, very faint bits of fungus in the distance that give you a sense of the shape of this entire chamber. There isn't enough light for you to make out any shape beyond the exterior of your visual range, so you can't really tell.
Liam: A second thing I want to look for is what other exits from this gigantic cavern. Ways through, up. Yeah, you looked, but I didn't look.
Matt: Let me finish what I was saying first.
Travis: Roll! Roll again.
Matt: But based on the size of this chamber and the bits of what small elements of structures that you can see of the architecture within, this definitely appears to be more of the heart of the city of Thomara when it was once at its ancient height. You can see at the very edge of your visual range a cracked central fountain that is empty and dry, and you see, just beyond your range, the exterior of a large temple-like building that rises out of the ability to see any more of its height and structure.
Taliesin: Temple.
Matt: But like I said, you guys are still standing at the entrance to this cavern.
Marisha: What about the temple? Why?
Sam: Want to fly through here? Can we fly?
Liam: I don't think we want to stay here--
Sam: I know, that's why we just fly through.
Liam: Find another exit, yeah, but where?
Travis: I'd like to see the temple, if I can.
Sam: What are you talking about?
Travis: Well look, all right, my gloves--
Laura: Keep your voice down.
Travis: (whispering) My gloves come from the heart of a ruined primordial titan. So if maybe they harvested pieces of my gloves, and it's in a temple, I don't know, you smart people could do something with that.
Liam: Right, what's your plan? You expect us to come up with a plan to explain why your gloves are connected to that temple, and you're going to get what? A Mighty Morphin Power Ranger bonus for doing so?
Travis: Yes.
Marisha: Are your Titanstone Knuckles exalted yet?
Travis: Yep. They're just buzzing.
Liam: Yeah, are they still dildoing on your fingers?
Marisha: Are they buzzing more?
Travis: Are they humming more?
Matt: Doesn't appear to have changed.
Travis: Nope, just humming.
Marisha: Step two steps closer.
Travis: Two steps closer to the temple.
Marisha: Do they appear to be buzzing more?
Travis: Are they appearing buzzing more?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Travis: Ooh! 19.
Matt: Not bad. Nope.
Taliesin: Is the temple on the way? Does it make sense to cross through the city, or does it make sense to fly up?
Liam: We're moving towards Vasselheim now. I'm negative on our chances of dealing with this before Vasselheim, but that's the goal, right?
Taliesin: We've got some time, and I feel like this city is an opportunity to find some more advantages.
Travis: We are also looking for the Sword of Kas. What's if it's in the temple?
Sam: Why would Vecna keep the thing that could kill Vecna near Vecna?
Liam: I'm pulling Percy aside. I hear you, but this is a city that has existed here for a long time. Vecna didn't create this city. Vecna doesn't own these people. This is a fucking mountain that existed and now they're going for a ride. What do these people have to do with Vecna?
Taliesin: It's not a city that just existed.
Liam: No?
Taliesin: This is a giant primordial beast that people inhabited. God only knows what existed in here.
Marisha: Yeah, but as we've already seen from the other tomb, it's already been heavily, heavily plundered.
Liam: And Vecna's just a user. This place was just sitting there. He lifted it up and took it away. These assholes don't have anything to do with--
Travis: Why did he choose this?
Marisha: How far away is the temple? Do we know? Can we football range guess it?
Matt: I'd say, because you guys have darkvision of 60 feet?
Taliesin: If gods really understood how this world worked, this would not be happening right now.
Matt: It's at about the 50, 55 foot areas where the wall begins, then it vanishes beyond that.
Liam: Percy, this shitbird has appeared like three times wherever we were.
Laura: Well, he's not going to be able to do that right now because I've got a fucking ring.
Taliesin: He doesn't necessarily know this place as well as--
Marisha: Hang on. How long have we been in here, versus how far have we been from Vasselheim? Because we are on a time crunch.
Travis: 200 miles away once we entered is how far away we are from Vasselheim. 200 miles. With steps of?
Taliesin: What was the average land speed of a laden undead?
Matt: You've been within the titan for, I'd say, roughly three and a half hours, maybe.
Liam: Yeah, he's 110 miles out from Vasselheim, at this point.
Travis: We have time to check the temple.
Sam: All right, let's swoop in and swoop out.
Marisha: Super fucking fast!
Taliesin: I'm not even saying look in it, let's take a look at what it--
Laura: Did I see any stairs?
Matt: You do not see any staircases within a 60-foot radius of where you're standing.
Taliesin: We might be harder to spot if we stay on the ground for now, anyway.
Marisha: I just want to say, we gave you guys the other temple, in which you found your stupid waistband, but we got really fucked up from it! Everything has a consequence and a price and shit. Nothing is free.
Laura: I'm going to cast Pass Without a fucking Trace. It's my last Pass Without a Trace, but I'm afraid--
Travis: No, don't do it.
Laura: What if we bring out an entire fucking city of undead dwarves upon us?
Marisha: Let me do it. I have Pass Without a Trace and one more 2nd-level spell left. I'll do it. Save yours.
Liam: I'm also going to put something on the table here: we're trying to save Vasselheim, but we're also trying to save the world. We might not be able to do this without recharging before Vasselheim.
Taliesin: I'm aware.
Sam: You want to go to sleep in this undead city?!
Liam: No, but we're trying to save the world, not just a city.
Sam: So sacrificing Vasselheim so that we can feel better about a fight?
Liam: What if we lose the fight Scanlan? Then who fucking cares? Vasselheim is gone. Westruun is gone. Kaylie is gone. Everything's fucking gone if we fuck this up!
Sam: Well, let's stay on the path and see how long it takes.
Marisha: How about this? Hold. Wait! We still don't know how to get up there, right?
Sam: Is that purple eyeliner?
Marisha: Yeah, do you like it? Thank you. It's a little metallic. Thank you, I bought it while I was waiting for--
Travis: Oh my god!
Laura: Oh my god!
Marisha: Okay. I hate to say split the party, but what if we split the party? What if a few of you check out your fucking temple, and then the rest of us try to figure out a way to get up.
Travis: I'm cool. I'll vote for a temple party.
Marisha: Temple party. Who else is on temple party?
Sam: They need somebody who can help them in there.
Liam: I hate the idea, but I'm the stealthiest motherfucker in this room.
Taliesin: And then you three on the carpet, you on the broom.
Travis: I need the carpet.
Marisha: So wait, just the two of you are going to go check out the carpet?
Laura: Vax is going in with you.
Sam: I feel like one person with magic should go with them. I'll go with them.
Taliesin: We're all ear-pieced.
Marisha: Okay, so Grog--
Liam: Everybody but Keyleth.
Sam: No, it's Keyleth, Vex, and Pike are going searching. The boys are going in the temple, and the girls are going searching.
Marisha: Okay, cool, I'm on board.
Taliesin: This is in no way, by the way, an amazing mirror of that one time underneath Kraghammer. They're just going to find another Clarota.
Liam: The boys all die. The girls go to glory.
Laura: I want to kiss Percy before he goes. Don't die in this stupid temple.
Taliesin: I will not die in this stupid temple.
Sam: I'm going, too.
Taliesin: I slap him in the face.
Laura: Right on, Scanlan. Sorry, Percy.
Matt: Who's traveling in what group?
Laura: Girls are going to look for stairs, the boys are going in the stupid temple.
Liam: I yank the druid in for a kiss.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Oh wait, shit. Your fucking ring.
Laura: Fuck! My fucking ring! We can't split the party.
Taliesin: Okay, can't split the party. We all go looking for the stairs. Oh, you asshole, stop it! (laughter)
Laura: He was really excited about it!
Matt: I was waiting on that.
Laura: Oh my god, he was so excited about it.
Sam: All right, into the temple. Come on, let's just fucking go to the fucking temple.
Matt: I was like, you guys literally had this conversation an hour ago, but okay.
Taliesin: Whatever we do, we can't split the party (fast-forward noise). Okay, we're going to split the party.
Travis: Sam saved our asses.
Taliesin: That was Cabin in the Woods shit.
Liam: 40 feet in advance, Vax walks ahead of the group, hating himself. Here we go.
Matt: Go for it. What are you doing, you're checking for traps?
Liam: I'm checking for enemies hiding.
Matt: So as you push forward--
Laura: We're stealthed, we're Pass Without a Traced.
Matt: Okay, then roll some stealth, guys.
Laura: She Pass Without a Traced us.
Matt: Right, then roll some stealth.
Sam: Oh, we're all rolling stealth?
Liam: 34.
Sam: 25.
Taliesin: 26.
Marisha: 26.
Laura: 39.
Travis: Natural one.
Marisha: Are you serious?
Sam: He's so excited about that temple.
Laura: Natural 20 for Pike! Oh wait, she gets disadvantage.
Matt: She has the boots that make it not at disadvantage.
Taliesin: First time ever.
Liam: But that's a lot of good.
Laura: So much good for one shitty--
Matt: You begin to push forward past the cracked fountain, heading ahead of everyone, keeping an eye out for what's ahead of you. The high walls of the temple-like structure begin to reveal themselves, standing ominous over the debris-strewn streets with shattered carts and bone fragments. The bone fragments faintly quaking beneath every footfall of the walking mountain that you currently are walking through. You see long-decomposed dwarvish bodies brutalized beyond reanimation lying scattered across the broken street paths ahead of you, deep grooves marking the splintered bone. A tangled network of partially ruined catwalks begin to reveal themselves above you, carved from the mountain, contains a ghostly image of a multi-level metropolis long fallen. You, make a perception check.
Liam: 29.
Matt: 29. You can see, as soon as you get to where the fountain is, the center of the street ahead of you. Dozens of slow shifting creatures moving throughout the streets and rubble of crumbling structures. You can see now, many of the undead citizens of the catacombs are now wandering, shaken awake by the lumbering titan that now carries them within. You also see a very faint blue pulsing glow emanating from one of the windows of the temple.
Liam: Can we put the goliath on the carpet so he doesn't kick something or be himself?
Laura: We don't know that he rolled shittily.
Liam: I know that, but he's a big, blundering mother fucking asshole when he wants to be--
Travis: On the chain. Literally on the text chain.
Matt: Which, as you're saying this, you hear a (clattering), and you glance over real fast and watch as Grog is walking by and the edge of his-- which weapon do you have attuned right now? You have the Blood Axe? The Blood Axe hits the edge of a large dwarven statue that had fallen off at a corner angle and is currently being held by a small barrel, and as the axe hits it, it shifts (crashing) and rolls and comes to a rest for a second with this clattering, grinding sound. Parts of it chip and break, but most of it remains strong and sturdy upon impact. At which point, you see at the edge of your visual range, about seven of the wandering creatures go (raspy groan) and begin slowly slinking their way in the direction of the noise.
Sam: So a rock just fell?
Travis: A big statue just fell.
Sam: And is in pieces?
Matt: Parts of it are broken. It's still pretty sturdy.
Taliesin: Let's try and serpentine around and see if we can trace back.
Liam: And they're to the right or the left or ahead of us?
Matt: They're ahead of you.
Laura: Do they look like they saw us?
Liam: Go left. Jenga, jenga, jenga. Can we put Grog on the carpet now?
Taliesin: Yep.
Marisha: We're trying to go up, right?
Sam: No, we're trying to go towards the temple.
Laura: Towards that pulsing light.
Liam: We've got a little bit of business, a little bit of activity ahead of us, so we want to curve to the left.
Travis: All right, we move accordingly.
Matt: All right. So you guys move along the left and curve around the side. As you begin to move along the edge, you watch as about eight of these mostly-skeletal dwarvish corpses begin to shamble in the direction of where the noise came from. You can see elements of their long-mummified skin pulled tight against elements of the rib cage and the skull. Bits of chipped teeth, now broken against whatever things it's attempted to chew on its long un-life. As they move past, two of them glance over in the direction of Grog, and then all of them shift over in the direction and begin rushing forward in your path.
Liam: What's the distance?
Matt: At this point, they're probably about 50 or so feet from where you are.
Liam: Oh shit!
Laura: We don't want to make too much noise. I'm going to shoot a couple.
Travis: We could just go straight up.
Laura: There's only eight of them. We can take eight undead.
Liam: Pickle walks forward and takes a knee and waits with her holy symbol of Sarenrae, waiting for them.
Laura: I take two of them by surprise. That's auto-crit.
Liam: Vax does the same, watching his badass sister, and Pike waits to turn whatever's left of them.
Laura: Yeah, they're super-silent arrows.
Liam: So what happens first?
Matt: All right. She's preparing for it, right?
Liam: Yeah. She's waiting until she sees them.
Matt: Oh, well she also has darkvision of 60 feet.
Liam: So she's waiting until they're within range of her holy abilities.
Matt: What's the radius on that one?
Liam: That's a good question, because I'm a rogue paladin. (sighs) Goddamn it.
Matt: That's all right.
Liam: What if I look in the sorceror rules?
Matt: Nope. 30 feet.
Liam: 30 feet. So she's waiting for the twins to do their work and anything that's left over she's going to scatter.
Matt: Okay. All right. So as she holds position--
Laura: So it's auto-crit?
Matt: They know you're there. It's not a surprise. There's as threat, and they're rushing. But you do have advantage on the hits because they don't see you.
Laura: Well great, that's great. 20?
Matt: That definitely hits.
Laura: Okay. Oh, the other one super-duper hits. It's a 19 plus 14.
Liam: 25, 31, natural 20.
Matt: Okay. All right. So go ahead and roll damage on those. Are you shooting two different skeletons or one each?
Liam: I'm after my sister. She talked before I did.
Laura: I'll see how the first arrow hits?
Matt: Okay.
Laura: 14. Oh, I didn't Hunter's Mark. Whatever. 14, 15, 16. Two lightning damage. Do I add anything? Sneak attack!
Taliesin: Been a while.
Laura: How do we D&D? Plus ten sneak attack.
Matt: Okay. So the first skeleton, the arrow hits it and the torso explodes behind with ribs shattering and scattering across the stonework, its body falling and collapsing to the ground.
Laura: I hit another one.
Matt: Yes, you do.
Liam: Oh, and we go first, so it's advantage.
Laura: 14 plus four lightning damage. And that is plus eight.
Travis: 26.
Matt: 26. This one right behind it, its jaw unhinged slightly. Its tongue made of this slick rotting material that dangles through the hole in the bottom of the jaw. Comes around the corner, and you watch as part of its head explodes off one side from the secondary arrow, taking out what remains of the center of its skull, and the body crumples to the ground. Two skeletons down.
Liam: Sneak attack hits the first time we connect, right?
Matt: Yeah. You don't have to roll damage for that one.
Laura: Oh. Sorry, I did sneak attack on the second arrow.
Matt: Well, you can do sneak attack once per round.
Laura: Okay. I did eight damage too much.
Matt: It was still enough.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: You don't have to roll damage for sneak attack.
Liam: So then that one's gone?
Matt: A third skeleton now is ruined. You hit it with the arrow in the middle of the spinal column, and it folds on itself.
Liam: Okay. So paladin action-action and my bonus action. So that's the first of three. The last one's the one that was a critical hit so the second one goes onto the next whole skeleton. It's just an eight.
Matt: Okay. This one the arrow slides into the side of the skull, and it keeps coming forward towards Grog.
Liam: Okay. And then the last critical hit, which is Whisper again, because it bamfed back, is two plus eight is ten. Two and three. It's not that much. It's 15 total.
Matt: Okay. And that one does finish it. So that's three skeletons down. Grog, I want to to individually roll an initiative check for me.
Travis: Natural 20. With Gil's dice.
Matt: So as you guys are watching this happen, the other five rush in to close the gap, but you are at the ready, and you get to strike before they do.
Travis: Nice. Am I hitting them? Yeah, Okay. Reckless, great weapon master. 31 for the first one.
Matt: That hits.
Travis: Okay, cool.
Matt: Your minimum damage will kill them. So as the first one comes up towards you, you swing up. As you slam into it, you watch as its bony body blows up against the side of the nearby stone building and then scrapes to the ground.
Travis: Can I use the other strike on another?
Matt: Yes, you can.
Travis: Reckless great weapon. That'll hit. That's like 30.
Taliesin: If there's anything left on Grog by the end of this, I'll try to swipe them off with my sword.
Travis: 32.
Matt: All righty. So two more detonate on this point. So there's three left. They're closing in on Grog. Does Pike want to take her turn?
Travis: We might want to save that Turnt Undead.
Laura: No, I think we should save.
Liam: I've already said it, but she's whispering to me to hold. She's half of Pike right now. You're half of Pike right now.
Taliesin: I'd like to pop in and see if I could take a couple--
Matt: Make an initiative roll.
Laura: Don't shoot, Percy.
Taliesin: I'm not; I'm going to use my sword.
Liam: Pike holds, breathing hard, looking at them coming on.
Taliesin: 16.
Matt: Yeah, that beats them by one. So yeah, as the three remaining ones start charging in towards Grog--
Taliesin: I'm going to run in, draw the silvered sword, and take some swipes.
Matt: Go for it.
Taliesin: Let's take three swipes right out of here.
Laura: Pike can use her mace on anything left in that area.
Taliesin: That's one natural 20, one natural 19. Do I crit on a 19 with the sword?
Matt: No.
Taliesin: Okay, never mind. And a two. But that might be enough, because I have a really high-- that's a 15 as my lowest to hit. Does a 15 hit?
Matt: 15 does hit. Yes.
Taliesin: So the 15 is-- That's 14 piercing damage to the first one with a silvered sword.
Matt: Okay. You rush up and you carve through the first skeleton, and it breaks on the ground in front of you.
Taliesin: Number two is 13 points of damage to the second one.
Matt: Okay. The second one, you bring the blade down into the skull and cleave it in half. You watch as part of its skull breaks off to the side and the jaw falls to the ground and the rest crumbles in place.
Taliesin: I twirl around and take my third wonderful pirouette attack, which is 20 points of damage.
Matt: Okay, and as the final one lunges forward, in a fervent-- strangely faster than you expect for a skeletal undead, it begins to accelerate towards Grog. And with that, you take the blade and take the head right off at the neck, and it falls and crumples to the ground.
Marisha: So it's like 28 Days Later zombies?
Travis: 28 Days Later, they run.
Marisha: He said that they were fast.
Matt: Well, the last one-- it was flavor.
Marisha: Just wanted to make sure they weren't special.
Matt: Okay. As you finish the fray and hold yourself, you wait and wait. You do not hear or notice any more advancing undead from that direction.
Travis: Okay, how about I don't move and somebody with flying ability go to check out that blue glowy window?
Taliesin: We have to stick together.
Laura: Is the glowy window within 60 feet?
Taliesin: No, it's far.
Travis: When we were at the opening, we were 50 to 60 feet away.
Matt: The temple where you guys were at, at the time was 50 feet away from you, but you would have crossed the other side of the hall. So now it's about 100 feet away from you. At this distance, you can see it's a round, almost cylindrical building, Colosseum-esque. And there's a small square window about every 25 to 30 feet. And it's big. It's large, but you can see that faint glow between multiple windows from this distance.
Travis: So should we fly up to that window?
Taliesin: I think it'd be safer to stay on the ground level and sneak. Because if we're the air, they are going to see us.
Travis: Let's do it.
Marisha: And we still have Pass Without a Trace, so let's go.
Laura: Yes, we do. She cast it.
Matt: All right, now that this brief combat has finished, those who took place in it, which would be you, Vax, Grog, and Percy have to remake your stealth checks.
Laura: You're like, "Gladly!"
Taliesin: Yes.
Laura: What about Pike? Because she just knelt down. She didn't really fight.
Matt: She stepped out of her stealth. She was making herself visible.
Laura: My natural 20 for Pike, wasted!
Taliesin: 23.
Liam: We still have Pass Without Trace?
Marisha: Yes. I didn't do anything.
Travis: 26.
Marisha: Keeping that concentration.
Taliesin: (singing) Concentration. Concentration.
Marisha: (singing) Concentration. Concentration.
Liam: You're the doctor! Keep your patients on the run!
Laura: 30 for Pike. 29 for me.
Matt: All right. You guys begin to slowly make your way along the left wall of this large cavern.
Liam: 37, by the way.
Matt: Good to know. As you slowly move through the shadows, dodging through open doorways and through windows, trying the best you can to stay out from the center thoroughfare of this opening, you see more and more of these undead. Dozens, maybe even a hundred have crossed your path at the perimeter of your visual range and you can see in the catwalks above too, with the faint bit of the orange glow, occasionally shapes breaking across the orange. This entire cavern is swarming.
Laura: (whispering) Do we still have the thing?
Sam: Oh, the filter? The censer?
Laura: Do we have it in the Bag of Holding?
Taliesin: We also have the herbs.
Laura: What if we use it? What if we use it and it just repels them?
Taliesin: When it's time. We don't have a lot of it.
Marisha: Yeah, it's a very small amount.
Liam: Is it ready to go, though?
Taliesin: Let's prepare it, and when it's time--
Liam: Is it ready to go, though?
Marisha: Yeah it's dried. I spent that time. I spent time during the break.
Taliesin: It's just burning the herbs, though. We don't need the censer. Just hold it in your hands.
Liam: Do we have any sense of where we started in this giant cavern? Or are we totally fucking turned around?
Matt: No. I mean you have a decent sense. You are maybe 100 to 150 feet from where you began. Because you've been moving slowly. Staying stealthily, you're moving very carefully and very slowly and judging by the shape of the cavern and where you are currently, you're about halfway through it, or close to halfway.
Taliesin: It's good that we didn't go on the catwalk.
Matt: The temple's on the opposite side of the chamber.
Liam: Oh! All the way on the other side. I thought it was central.
Matt: I'm sorry. When you entered the entrance, the temple was to the front and to the right of you. You guys curved around the left, on the other side of it, keeping a view on it so you could see it from across the way. Are you making your way across to the temple?
Liam: So it's pressed against the opposite wall of this big place?
Sam: Are the undead all around the temple?
Matt: Further in. Nothing directly around the outside of the temple. So you guys curve around the entrance where you came and slowly make your way towards where the temple emerges from the rock wall. About a third or so of its exterior wall is actually built into the side of this cavern, and the large cylindrical-like Colosseum temple structure curves outward. You can see as you get closer to it, there's maybe the three floors to it but edges of the top wall have crumbled inward and you can see areas where it looks like it's sustained some physical damage or eroded over time. You eventually make your way around the outside wall of the temple to one of the first doorways, and it is an archway, maybe six feet tall and about four feet wide. Very simple. This is an old temple.
Liam: Is that light you talked about coming from one specific source, or all over the place? Every window.
Travis: Is there a story?
Matt: It looks to be coming from the base.
Liam: From down below.
Laura: Can we see in one of the windows?
Matt: You can look inside. Make a perception check.
Sam: Are there any bone laying around?
Matt: Plenty.
Sam: I am going to pick up two bones, give them to Simon Two, and tell him to go across the street, 50 feet away from us, and wait there in some building. Hold these bones.
Matt: You watch as two bone shards slowly glide over, then stand there.
Laura: 34.
Matt: Okay. As you pull up to the window and glance down, you immediately look inside the temple, and you see about 30 or so silhouettes of shambling dwarven corpses all standing inside the base floor of this temple. You see the silhouettes and shapes because they are all faintly outlined from the source of this blue light. You see a small, baseball-sized, bluish crystal that is resting, not in the perfect center of the temple but somewhere in the open middle floor area, and it looks like these 30 undead are surrounding it, and standing.
Sam: Smash and grab. You could go in there and get that thing, be out before they even saw you in there.
Taliesin: Also, have your unseen servant make a bunch of noise and have them all--
Marisha: Be a distraction?
Laura: Yeah, but making any kind of noise would draw large crowds.
Taliesin: We can have the unseen servant pick it up.
Marisha: How far away can he be, though?
Sam: He's 50 feet away, right now, and he's waiting to make noise.
Taliesin: What if he were to go in and get it himself?
Sam: He could.
Travis: He is invisible, isn't he?
Sam: He could go and pick it up and come right back with it.
Laura: But first don't tell him to come right out, tell him to like walk a little bit to see if they follow the light.
Liam: But what are our options if that doesn't work?
Sam: If he picks up the crystal and it doesn't work, or it doesn't move?
Liam: I want to do that. If that doesn't work, I can click the boots, and I can be there in a heartbeat and run, but what do we do next?
Sam: We need an escape plan, right? How many can fit on the carpet?
Liam: This goes back to my conversation with you, which is: are we going to find a pocket and rest?
Taliesin: Yes, but not here.
Liam: Agreed, but we're talking about Vasselheim, and is damage to Vasselheim a sacrifice needed to be ready to do what's necessary?
Travis: If he destroys Vasselheim, he does his miracle, his display of power, and he will be even stronger. That is not an option.
Taliesin: If we were to be clever, if we're at the edge of Vasselheim, the Vasselheim forces will be distracting his forces, so we'll have less to deal with, so we want this fight to happen at the edge.
Liam: So we're talking about no rest. I'm not talking about a short rest.
Taliesin: There will not be a long rest, I don't think.
Laura: There might be.
Liam: Not without him spilling into Vasselheim.
Marisha: I've been very conservative with what I've been doing for a reason.
Travis: I don't think a long rest is in the cards.
Taliesin: I've only burned one thing that requires a long rest.
Marisha: I agree with Grog. We can't sacrifice having him gain all of those followers, because then the only option would be murder a lot of his followers, which I'm not really comfortable with.
Travis: And he may be too strong at that point.
Sam: We don't need to discuss this now. We need to get the crystal and get the fuck out of here!
Taliesin: If we can pull this off without burning anything important, then it doesn't matter.
Marisha: I want to go on record and say I think this is stupid. Okay, let's go.
Laura: That crystal looks really appetizing, and I want it.
Travis: How about we get ready to leave? I'll get on the carpet.
Laura: It looks really super magical.
Travis: Who's on the broom with Vex?
Laura: Me.
Travis: No, who is on the broom with you?
Taliesin: I'll be on the broom with her.
Travis: Do you want to get on the carpet with me?
Sam: Yeah, of course.
Marisha: I have to come with you because I have the Pass Without a Trace spell.
Taliesin: We all have to be together. We can't separate.
Travis: And he can fly.
Sam: No, he can't. He's done with his wings.
Liam: Yeah, that's right.
Sam: We have too many people for the carpet and the broom.
Liam: My wings are gone. There's no wings for Vecna unless we rest.
Travis: Well, kick Trinket out of the necklace, and I'll get in there.
Taliesin: I can also climb up the wall, if need be.
Sam: We can leave Trinket.
Liam: It's fine, I still have the boots. Just the wings. It was death or wings. I chose wings.
Travis: All right, so how do we fly? How do we do that?
Sam: I can burn a spell and be a giant eagle or something.
Taliesin: Just for shits and giggles, I'm going to take one last look around to see if there's any infrastructure for getting up. There must be infrastructure for getting up here. There wasn't layers of a city on top of each other.
Sam: We could just run.
Liam: But wait, where are we going though if we get this thing?
Sam: Up away.
Liam: We have no verification of an exit or a hole or anything!
Travis: Yeah, sometimes you just got to leap, okay?
Liam: That's my entire life, but this is the last moment.
Sam: Every organ in a body has an entrance and an exit, right? Wait, no, lungs don't; they just have the one.
Marisha: Wait up, we argued more this game more than anything else. Okay, we know we still have to fly upwards, including on flying up to the blue crystally thing right?
Laura: No, the blue crystal is right here.
Marisha: Well, then what the fuck?
Laura: I don't know!
Liam: We have a plan for getting the crystal, just not how to get the fuck out.
Marisha: We fucking fly!
Travis: Who burns a spell to become an animal?
Marisha: I can burn a spell.
Travis: You do that.
Marisha: We're probably going to take another short rest, right?
Travis: Probably.
Marisha: Okay.
Sam: I can recall Simon 2. I can send him across the room, make a bunch of noise, draw a bunch of people over there. You run, grab the crystal, and then we hustle out of there.
Travis: What if only half the room leaves, though?
Laura: No, you go get Simon 2 to go get the crystal.
Sam: And there's going to be a floating crystal that marches across?
Travis: They don't give a shit. Do it. I'm on the carpet. We're ready to go.
Marisha: You're on me? And you're on carpet, and you're on broom?
Travis: Percy and Vex are on the broom.
Matt: Gnomes on the carpet with Grog. You and Percy on the broom. You're transforming into what creature?
Marisha: Giant eagle.
Matt: Giant eagle.
Marisha: Not yet, though.
Laura: And then we all, within 60 feet of each other, fly up.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: Okay, who's doing what?
Laura: Simon 2.
Sam: Simon 2 is going to go get the thing. Let's say they all start watching the thing come towards us. Grog, are you here? Are you with us?
Travis: Yeah, I have to be.
Sam: Can you throw something across the room to make a noise?
Travis: Yep. I can absolutely do that.
Laura: I'll prime an arrow.
Travis: I have a hooded lantern that has fuel in it. It will even burn when it lands. It's been sitting in there for four years.
Sam: This is a terrible plan.
Taliesin: This is why we hoarded it in the first place.
Sam: Guys, I'm just going to say this one more time before we do this: he's way faster than Simon 2. Simon 2 could create a distraction. He could (snatching noise).
Liam: Scanlan, only with the boots.
Travis: If they chase the jewel, fuck the jewel, and we'll leave.
Taliesin: If they chase the jewel, we can grab it and run, anyway.
Sam: All right, Simon 2. Come back with your bones!
Matt: The bones shift over towards you ever-so-slowly.
Liam: (singing) Don't worry, be happy now.
Sam: All right. Simon 2, go to the middle of the room. Throw the bones away, far, then grab the crystal. You don't have pockets. Run back to us! Away, yeah. Should he cover it with a blanket or something? Do you have a hood?
Matt: The bones begin to drift.
Taliesin: Okay, I'm not saying no.
Laura: A handkerchief to put over the light.
Sam: So it blocks the light? All right, so go put this handkerchief on the thing, pick it up, and bring it back to us. Go, Simon 2. You're our only hope.
Matt: Is Simon holding bones or a blanket?
Sam: He's holding a blanket.
Taliesin: He's holding a hanky.
Laura: He's holding a hanky.
Travis: Put the bones down gently.
Sam: Give me the bones. I put the bones down. Here's a handkerchief. You'll put it over the crystal, pick up the crystal, and bring it back to us.
Matt: Simon begins to slowly walk, the handkerchief floating by.
Taliesin: This is like those little handkerchief ghosts you would make in kindergarten.
Matt: As you glance inside and watch as it happens, you can see all the undead that are in there are standing, unmoving, swaying a little bit in place. Simon's about 30 feet out from them. About 20 feet out. They don't notice his presence. You notice that all the undead are facing the crystal, by the way.
Laura: Why didn't you tell us that before?
Marisha: Why didn't you tell us that before?
Marisha: (laughing) That's crucial information.
Sam: Right before he picks it up, hock a rock as far as you can.
Travis: Not the lantern?
Taliesin: Not the rock, the lantern. Light the lantern and throw it.
Marisha: By the way, they're all staring right at you. They're 100 percent aware of what's going on.
Matt: They're not staring at you. They're staring at the crystal.
Laura: They will be staring at us. What if we destroy the crystal? I wonder if all the undead would die. Let's keep going.
Matt: The handkerchief makes its way forward. Simon walks between the undead, and they don't even notice.
Sam: That's a good guy, that Simon 2.
Marisha: What happens?
Matt: The handkerchief moves over onto the crystal, and all the undead look over to the crystal, and the crystal lifts, and they all begin to (groans).
Travis: I take the hooded lantern and I (laughs) I throw the fucking piss out of it.
Matt: Make an attack roll. Roll and add your strength modifier.
Travis: Oh, that's good! 19.
Matt: You're adding your strength modifier to that? Yeah. You're aiming at the opposite end?
Travis: If the entrance is here, I'm throwing it in the opposite direction of where we are.
Matt: With your strength? Easy enough. You lob it. It arcs over (flame noises) and explodes. The oil spreads across the ground. Flames ignite, and the bright light that emanates from it and the flames burst, and all the undead turn over (grunting) and begin to retract away. Two of them are following Simon. Only two of the undead are following Simon, currently. The others are distracted by the detonation of flame. They look confused.
Liam: How close are the pursuers?
Matt: They're making their way slowly. No, they're much faster than Simon.
Liam: I'm throwing.
Laura: I'm going to get down and shoot.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Just the ones following Simon!
Matt: Both of you guys roll an attack.
Travis: Are they far away from the other ones that aren't leaving yet?
Taliesin: It doesn't matter; they're not paying attention.
Laura: 25. No, 33.
Liam: 29.
Matt: Roll damage.
Taliesin: They drop out of nowhere. They faint. It's going to be good.
Marisha: So we hope.
Taliesin: I thought you were made of sterner stuff, Travis. Come on. Now is not the time to get squeamish.
Laura: 24.
Taliesin: We made a solemn oath.
Sam: They were innocent.
Taliesin: We agreed, weeks ago.
Liam: I rolled a 77 for mine.
Sam: 77?!
Matt: These two skeletons almost atomize. As they're walking, they're both gaining on Simon, and as they both start reaching towards where the dull bluish glow, mostly muted by the handkerchief, is floating in the air, they (growl) towards it. You watch as both their heads and torsos scatter across the ground, like a heavy wave of force blasted them across the stonework. The scraping sound hits as the detonation hits. The flames are dying down, and... no, no other undead see it. Slowly, the stone floats past, out of the doorway, and makes its way back to you.
Taliesin: Drop it in the Bag of Holding.
Matt: At this point, Simon's getting real close to the end of his hour-long casting time.
Sam: You've served us well.
Travis: Bag of Holding. It doesn't hurt my hand, or anything, does it?
Matt: No.
Travis: Cool! We've got that.
Matt: Whatever it is.
Laura: I guess we have it.
Marisha: Nothing happened to them when we put it in the Bag of Holding? They were like, (groaning) and kept going? All the undead?
Matt: All the undead inside that were distracted by the explosion of the lantern are riled up now, and they're starting to wander around, and some of them are starting to make their way towards the entrance to the temple. Some are making their way toward the staircase to head upward.
Marisha: Are we flying?
Travis: Yes, we fly up.
Matt: All right. You go into eagle form, grab Vax, and all of you guys make your way up into the cavern entrance.
Laura: Bubble. Tight bubble.
Matt: Currently, I believe the eagle form has darkvision. Right now, you have no light source.
Liam: I do. I can say things to her. I can see.
Matt: Right, so you guys are able to maneuver. So as you guys head up into the center part of the cavern, above the catwalks, you can see as you push through, about a third of them are still standing. A lot of them have collapsed in the center, and there's edges of bridges that come to a halt where they've collapsed and tumbled down into the cavern below. You can see straggling undead wandering the catwalks and these pathways along the edges of the cavern. As you pass forward through them-- I imagine you guys are cruising through as fast as you can?
Taliesin: Trying to avoid them.
Laura: We'll try to avoid the clusters.
Matt: A few of them seem to glance up and see you as you pass and reach, but they have nowhere to go. As you begin to cruise through the center of this cavern, following it to the opposite side, it widens further, and now as you look down, faintly, you can see bits of the orange bioluminescent fungus that are growing within this city below. You can see elements of these beautiful statues that are partially crumbled. You can see small homes that litter the center of this chamber. You can see some of the catwalks that meet in the center of this actually meet in a suspended platform that contains another dome-like structure that is partially caved in. With another shake and impact of the titan's footfall, you watch as one of its suspension pillars cracks, and the entire center finally gives way and falls and slams down, collapsing into the center of the chamber, it being there for the final moment of its tensile strength. As it slams down, you watch as it crushes about 40 or so various skeletons below, and from that blast, you can see something on the interior of it was apparently explosive or flammable, and it explodes, giving a brief flash of light into the center of this cavern. Where you had the brief outside of your visual range, you now look around and see the entirety of these dozens of catwalks and the city below you. Hundreds and hundreds of roving skeletons and mostly decomposed, mummified dwarven corpses that all glance towards this explosion. Some have been blasted away from it by the impact of the detonation. Others are making their way towards what the strange sound was, drawn towards it, but you're keeping this central safe space between, where none of them can grasp or assail you.
Laura: Were there other buildings like that, ready to fall from the ceiling?
Matt: Currently, what you see is just the one.
Liam: I'm looking for gaps or holes or anything in the ceiling of this cavern or anywhere to get out. MATT; You see entrances to homes that are built into the sides.
Sam: What about a tunnel or anything?
Matt: Make a perception check. Anyone who has darkvision can make a perception check.
Marisha: I have keen sight. Does that count?
Matt: You have advantage on your perception.
Marisha: Oh, shitty and shittier.
Liam: 27.
Travis: 18.
Laura: 18.
Sam: I didn't do one.
Marisha: 28.
Sam: I'm weeping over Simon 2.
Matt: Oh. Your keen eagle vision-- wait, you said you rolled shitty and shittier and still got 28?
Marisha: I have a plus 13, plus advantage.
Matt: Right. All right, cool. So glancing through your eagle vision, you can see the top of the chamber almost seems to come to a conical shape, and as you look up to the top of it, it emerges into a completely vertical chamber that rises up and out of the central opening of the city of Thomara.
Sam: Let's go.
Marisha: I take the lead, I guess. (caws)
Laura: (shushes) Caw quietly.
Liam: Vax is trying to appreciate his last ride.
Travis: Debbie Downer.
Liam: No way! I'm not going to stop. Fuck you all. Every game until the end, motherfuckers!
Matt: As the group of you make your way up into this vertical cavern, we're going to take a break. I need to take a break, myself.
Travis: Remember, we have the--
Travis: Sponsored announcement.
Matt: That's right. We have the Shadow of War video coming up at this break to give you a glance at this game coming up that we're all part of. If you haven't seen it, or if you have seen it, check it out, anyway. It's pretty awesome. Also, for this week's giveaway, Wyrmwood, we've got a little video for you here to show you what's up and what you can do and try to win it at the break, so pay attention, stick around, and we'll see you guys here in a few minutes.
Liam: This is what's up!
Travis: Yeah! [break]
Matt: Hello, everyone, and welcome back. All right, so last we left off, you guys were all traveling upward through various means of flight, through a peak in the central cavern chamber in the center of Thomara, the long-dead dwarven city. As you begin to climb upward through this 15-foot-wide or so upward hallway, this cylindrical cavern, you continue upward for about 50 or so feet since passing through the ceiling of this chamber, and then it opens up into a domed room. Immediately, as you fly up, you see a ceiling come up, and you have to coast off to the side. You catch yourself, hovering there as the rest of you guys make your way in there. This domed, mushroom-shaped chamber with a very thin, circular floor around the outside with the hole that you entered at the bottom. Whoever would stand on the edge there would have the opportunity to either leap into or toss something down into this hole that would then drop them right into the center of the city.
Taliesin: Weird question  if I were holding the blue gem and had dropped it down this hole, what would be the likelihood it would have ended vaguely where it ended up?
Matt: Not at all. It was a ways off.
Taliesin: Just checking.
Laura: Are there any undead around us right now?
Matt: Currently? Glancing around, you do not see any undead.
Marisha: You said things or people? Is this a body-sized hole?
Matt: No, it's about 15 feet wide. The full chamber is maybe 50 or so feet across. About a 20-foot walkway, circular, before the hole in the center.
Liam: Did you say the hole is a natural gap in the cave, or does it look made?
Matt: If you glance down and look about the interior of this chamber, it is not natural. It is all carved.
Laura: Can we look at the gem for a second, since there's no undead around?
Matt: If you want to. Grog has it.
Travis: Do you want me to pull it out?
Laura: Yeah. Can you do an arcana check on it?
Sam: Sure. I can look at it.
Laura: How big is it? Is it baseball-sized?
Matt: It's about that big.
Travis: No undead, right? No creatures, nobody that's going to (whoop) to the shiny blue light?
Laura: We can't see anything around us?
Matt: Not at the moment, no.
Sam: I remove the handkerchief. I look at it. I inspect it like a jeweler inspecting a jewel. 18 arcana check.
Matt: Okay. It's definitely magical. The blue light from it grows stronger, then weaker. Stronger, then weaker. It has this rhythmic flash to it, like a heart or something that has a pulse to it.
Marisha: How is it lining up towards the steps of the giant?
Matt: Not at all. It's much quicker.
Marisha: Much quicker.
Matt: It's cold to the touch.
Taliesin: Does it do anything to the Titanstone Knuckles?
Liam: Is it faster than my heartbeat?
Matt: It's slower.
Liam: Slower.
Travis: That's slow.
Marisha: So it's very slow, but not as slow as the rate he's walking.
Travis: Is it a cut jewel, or is it rough?
Matt: It's rough. No jeweler's hand has touched it. There are some edges that have flat surfaces; it looks like there have been things that have chipped off the stone.
Taliesin: Does it have the vibe of something petrified?
Matt: No, it has almost a quartz-like look to it. Elements of it appear to be cloudier or imperfect, and some areas appear to be clearer, and light shines through a little brighter.
Liam: It's like a hunk at the natural history museum of minerals.
Matt: Yeah, but there is an enchantment.
Sam: What about Pikey-pants? Can she detect if it's evil or good or something? Does she do that?
Laura: You should do that.
Liam: I'm going to do that.
Matt: Okay. You don't get a sense of any evil from the stone.
Sam: You said no sense of evil?
Matt: No evil coming from the stone.
Laura: Okay, I'm going to gaze into it super hard.
Matt: You look really hard into the stone as you hold it to your face, and your eyes almost cross as you glance into the very core source of this pulsating arcane energy. It's bright.
Laura: So bright, y'all.
Matt: It hurts a little bit, and you wince after a while.
Laura: I saw so many things.
Liam: She looked at the eclipse, too.
Travis: We don't have Identify or anything like that, do we?
Marisha: No.
Sam: No.
Laura: You know who had that?
Sam: No, who?
Laura: Our good friend, Tary. He was wonderful.
Sam: Who is it? Oh, the fancy fellow? He's probably dead somewhere.
Travis: I think we should try and smash it.
Sam: Don't you think that about everyone and everything?
Marisha: I'm not against this idea.
Travis: What else are we going to do to it before we face El Vecna?
Taliesin: My only other thought of how it could be useful, at this point, with what we know about it--
Sam: Is "El Vecna" Spanish for Vecna?
Travis: Sí.
Taliesin: It seemed like the undead were crowding towards it, which means that if we do get attacked by a group of undead, we might be able to shiny-object them, unless, of course, it's dangerous in their hands.
Travis: Or we spike it down the hole, and it causes a hydrogen bomb, and we shatter this titan in half.
Taliesin: That literally made the dungeon master laugh, so I don't know if that's necessarily--
Travis: It's blue, right? That is the color of hydrogen.
Taliesin: That's the color of Dr. Manhattan. I don't necessarily know if it's the same thing.
Travis: It is known.
Sam: Why don't we hang onto it for now? In a moment of peril, we can throw it or smash it.
Taliesin: Not crazy, trying to crack it.
Liam: What if it stops this thing where it stands? We're all thinking that this thing could be its heart.
Sam: Its heart?
Travis: It's palm-sized, right?
Taliesin: It could be a chunk of heart.
Laura: Is it the same color as his Knuckles?
Travis: No, these are stone-gray. This is blue crystal.
Matt: There's nothing about it that gives you the sense, based on what you've seen both outside and within the titan, that it is of similar essence to the titan, from what you understand.
Travis: It could be a soul or something.
Sam: Soul glow?
Travis: Does Pike have anything that detects a soul?
Liam: It's not evil. It's not good. It could be the thing that's keeping these undead moving.
Travis: Well, then I don't know what else to do. I think we keep moving.
Liam: I like the spiking idea.
Laura: I'm okay squishing it with the hammer.
Liam: I think that you should let me squish it, because if that blows up--
Laura: I think it's funny that we spent so much time getting it, and then we're going to destroy it.
Liam: We spent ten minutes getting this thing.
Travis: We'll think about smashing it when we take our rest. Maybe a cause will reveal itself.
Taliesin: Hold onto it for now. It could come in handy.
Marisha: It's like that dress you bought four years ago you still haven't worn. It might find a purpose.
Sam: All right, focus!
Laura: Let's get out of this dome.
Travis: Is there any writing or engraving or runes on the edge of the circle that's been engineered?
Matt: On the edge of the circle? No. It's smooth stone, intently designed to be a drop or opening of some kind.
Taliesin: Are there exits?
Matt: Make an investigation check. You don't see any doorways or passageways.
Marisha: Wait, there's not a hole that we can go up?
Matt: There's a hole that you came through to come into this chamber. Imagine a dome. You're in the chamber.
Taliesin: I literally rolled a one. I'm aware that there's a hole.
Matt: You get vertigo as you stand in the chamber.
Laura: Is this investigation or perception?
Matt: You look about, and you don't see any exit. Investigation to see if there's any hidden or not-immediately-noticeable exits or entryways.
Laura: 23.
Matt: 23. As you do a pass around, looking closely along the wall, you see two small domed doors that have metal rods jammed through, almost like a small barricade that's been placed down on one side of a doorway. However, they are closed from this side.
Laura: So you could open them up?
Matt: You could.
Laura: Are they trapped? I'll look to see if they're trapped.
Liam: On it.
Travis: Also fair to assume that whatever's on the other side of that door--
Liam: 27.
Matt: 27?
Laura: I rolled an 18.
Matt: You're both looking at the same one?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: Neither of you notice any traps.
Laura: All right, then I'm going to try to jimmy open that lock.
Travis: Whoa.
Laura: I already said it.
Matt: Make a strength check.
Liam: Not locked.
Laura: Two! Wait. Yeah, that's straight-up strength, not a saving throw? Two!
Sam: Two?
Laura: I'm really fucking weak. You'd think I'd be stronger pulling the bowstring, but no.
Travis: Use your legs. Really, use your legs.
Laura: Okay. I put my legs up on the wall and (grunts).
Matt: It is not budging.
Liam: Can I use my finger skills to see if it's locked? Just my finger skills. I made a perception check to see if it's trapped. Wouldn't I know if it's locked?
Matt: The lock is the barricading mechanism on it. There is no handle.
Liam: I'm going to try to sidestep this lock with my lock-picking skills.
Travis: It's a barricade.
Marisha: It's a barricade.
Liam: There's nothing to do?
Marisha: It's like steel rebar in front of the door.
Travis: Is there any decorating or writing or scratching around the door frame or wall around the door? Anything other than a portal to go through?
Matt: Not from what you can see, no. The room's pretty simple. The construction of it may be older than most of the things that you've seen in the city below and previous chambers. It seems to be built almost for function rather than ceremony.
Laura: It's a trash chute.
Marisha: That's what I was going to say. Is it a water chute? Drainage? Is this a drain pipe?
Laura: We could fill the city with water. Drown all the zombies.
Matt: One thing you do notice, which is interesting as you're glancing around at the side, looking at the ground at the bottom of it, there's a very faint groove in the ground that leads toward the central hole at the base of each of these doorways.
Marisha: Does there appear to be any other type of chutes coming into this room?
Matt: No, just the two doors on the opposite sides.
Travis: How far apart are the doors?
Matt: Opposite sides of the chamber, yeah.
Taliesin: So there's a bar. The door is barred, then?
Matt: Correct.
Taliesin: So break it. Let's get out of the way and pop the bar. See if we can pop the bar right off the door.
Travis: Do we want to have Keyleth there in case 900 undead zombies start pouring through, and she can Wall of Stone the door?
Marisha: I'll be with you. Yeah. I'm right behind you, man.
Travis: I will try and remove one of the doors. I don't know how to delineate between them.
Taliesin: The left one.
Travis: Sure. Yeah. It's a circle. That one. 25.
Matt: 25. It immediately comes off to the side, and when you lift it, you realize that it's bolted to the wall to the side, and it curves upward and holds it in place. This is meant to stay in place.
Laura: Wow. Really? It was meant to move? I think I loosened it for you, Grog.
Travis: I didn't get that sense at all.
Matt: As you lift it up, the door is now unbarred.
Travis: Shall I?
Laura: Yeah, open the door!
Travis: Are the hinges on this side so it looks like it opens towards me?
Matt: It looks like it opens towards you, yes.
Travis: I'll pull open the door.
Marisha: I'm at the ready for whatever.
Matt: Okay. We'll say as you entered and landed, the door on the left. Okay, so as you pull that one open, immediately preparing yourself, a couple of rocks tumble out, and it reveals a packed-tight mass of earth and stone.
Laura: Shit! Let's try the other one.
Travis: Should I punch the rubble?
Laura: No, let's try the other door first.
Travis: I make my way around.
Taliesin: We set ourselves up.
Travis: 20 on the dot.
Matt: 20. (metal creaking) It lifts over without an issue. Pull the door open. You lift it open, and a few rocks tumble past, but a slick rockslide incline continues upward, dry, no water. Nothing.
Travis: A rockslide continues onward. Slick, dry.
Laura: How big is the tunnel?
Matt: It's about four feet wide or so.
Laura: So we can fit in?
Matt: Yeah, you can fit in.
Taliesin: We have some Immovable Rods.
Matt: When I say slide, I mean smooth stone, like an actual slide. You get the sense that there was some sort of aqueduct-type scenario.
Laura: We brace ourselves on the wall to make sure we don't slide down.
Taliesin: Whoever's in the back should have the Immovable Rods, so if there's a sudden rush of water, we can create a grate for ourselves.
Matt: You envision that at one point, long ago, this would have been a beautiful waterfall in the center of Thomara's chamber that has now dried.
Travis: Dope. That's awesome. I'm getting creepy as fuck now. I've got the Immovable Rod; I'll be the caboose.
Marisha: I've got the other one, so I'll be second.
Matt: So Grog is the caboose.
Marisha: Keyleth in front of Grog.
Matt: Keyleth in front of Grog? All right. Who's in front of them?
Sam: Me.
Matt: Scanlan.
Laura: Pike.
Matt: Then Pike. All righty.
Taliesin: Myself and the twins, I suppose.
Laura: Yeah. I want to be in the front.
Travis: I'll go ahead and take the Immovable Rod out and have it in my hand.
Marisha: Samesies.
Matt: So you've got both of those. Oh, I totally forgot there was a winner for this. I'm sorry. I should do that, huh? RyanBoo, you're the winner. Danoba will contact you and get you your cherry deck box soon. Now that's taken care of. You make your way up the slide, and it's relatively gradual; it's not too heavy of a scenario. You make your way upward, upward, and about 30 or so feet up, the walls of it separate out and appear to break into two smaller chambers, like this was a breaking point where a person could enter from either side to check on the flow or do maintenance on whatever the ducting was. The slide continues upward. Vax and Vex, you get to that portion and lift yourselves up, looking right to left. It ends on one side, and it looks like there's some dry-rotted wooden crates, and to the left, a staircase.
Marisha: So it looks like a landing?
Matt: It's a brief landing for somebody who needed to come in and do repairs, maintenance, or checking on the flow of water.
Laura: Keep going up the slide or take the stairs?
Liam: Quick glance in the crates?
Marisha: No, if you're going to take a quick glance, then we have to bust them open like a proper RPG.
Travis: They're dry-rotted. They'll break easy.
Matt: They will. What do you do?
Liam: Check them out. I eat some edamame.
Matt: So you lift the crates. There are only two of them, and they're relatively small: two feet by two feet. The first one, you open up and look inside, and there are rusted tools. Long iron bars; some appear wrench-like. It looks like whatever mechanism was used as the early aqueduct system for this, this box contained materials, though you're uncertain as to what their application was into this system.
Taliesin: I'll take a glance at these things to memorize their general shape.
Travis: After you're done with them, I'll actually take them.
Matt: You go and grab a few. There's five rods of varying widths. Some appear to be ratchet elements, where they fit around different metal caps. There's one that looks like a wide crowbar that's used to hold or wedge elements separately. Very basic; nothing too intricate.
Taliesin: This is some basic shit that you're picking up right now.
Liam: That was the first crate. What's the next crate? Is it whoopee cushions?
Matt: No, the next crate you open up and it looks mostly empty, but it looks like there are a couple of rows of small glass vials, half of which appear to be broken or shattered, but there are three remaining, with a faint bluish liquid on the inside.
Laura: Does that sound familiar to us at all?
Liam: Healing potions are blue.
Matt: These don't resemble healing potions, actually.
Taliesin: Do these resemble underwater breathing?
Matt: They do. You've seen these before.
Liam: For toilet diving.
Taliesin: Emergency, yeah. Let's take those.
Travis: Okay. I got them.
Liam: I give one of them to Percy for being so sharp. I give one to my sister. You don't need it. I keep one. No, I don't. I'm barely alive. I give one to Scanlan.
Sam: I give it to Grog.
Travis: I've got one. I've got two, actually.
Sam: All right, then I'll keep one.
Taliesin: Just in case.
Travis: I've got two vials of underwater breathing.
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: Why is there no water running?
Travis: Any other boxes to smash?
Matt: No.
Marisha: I'd imagine because he's vertical now instead of horizontal.
Travis: And undead.
Sam: Let's keep going up the stairs.
Matt: All right. Heading up the stairs in the same order?
Liam: 30 to 40 feet in advance.
Matt: All righty. 30 to 40 feet in advance? Okay. You make your way up the staircase. Roll stealth.
Travis: Immovable Rod's out.
Liam: 28 for stealth.
Matt: Okay. Are you stealthing, as well? Are you going along with him, or are you letting him go ahead?
Liam: She's coming.
Laura: Natural 20.
Matt: All right, so the two of you very quietly make your way ahead, the rest of you keeping within, I assume, the range of the ring. The staircase doesn't go too far; it goes maybe 30 or so feet, and then it opens into a hallway. You're stepping up through the floor, and there's about ten feet behind and to the sides of you. There's a slight element of a cave-in to the left of you, where part of the stone seems to have collapsed, and a bit of the earth has filtered in. It's a smooth stone floor that's tiled in places. The walls continue on, a somewhat trapezoid-like angle. There are other portions of the wall that have caved in on certain elements, and there are two large pillars that mark the center of this hallway, either used as support beams or decorative, but they go from ceiling to floor. You glance over the side, and you see a distant staircase on the far end of this hallway, maybe 80 to 90 feet from where you are, if not further, with larger stairs. You've seen some of the dwarven-based ones. These seem to be a little more grandiose as they lift up higher and higher. Part of that hallway is completely collapsed; it's a wall of fallen earth. But there's a hole carved out of it. There's a tunnel that has been pushed through. You hear this very faint buzzing sound. Very faint. This (low humming). A very faint vibration. You also see a figure stepping from a side wall crevasse, an opening of a similar shape to the circular opening in the wall.
Liam: I hide.
Laura: We were stealthed.
Matt: You guys were stealthed. You re-hide, while stealthed.
Liam: That's what I do.
Matt: You hear some muttering across the way in the shadow. There's a faint source of light that looks like a glowing orb that's floating in the air above and giving this faint greenish-white light; a bauble that's giving a light source to whatever this cloaked figure is. You hear the muttering, and two more walk down the staircase to join them. You recognize, from the faint bit of light, a glimmer of metal around the neck of one of them that is the symbol, the hole with the metallic fork. You see Remnants of Vecna.
Sam: Remnants?
Matt: You don't see any faces. You see a glimmer or shine on the metal from the light cast from the bauble.
Marisha: What?
Taliesin: What?
Taliesin: This can't be happening right now.
Liam: We don't recognize faces? We don't see faces?
Matt: You see hooded figures that are walking in. There are three of them.
Marisha: Oh, so they're cultists.
Matt: Okay. So which ones are you aiming at? There's three of them.
Laura: I'm aiming at the first one I saw.
Matt: Okay, the first one you saw just stepped out of the center of the hall there, and then the two others walked down the hallway. You're aiming at the one that came out of the side of the wall?
Laura: Has he seen the two coming down the stairway yet?
Matt: There's been discussion over the shoulder. They seem to be aware of each other's presence, but they haven't come together to engage as three in the same area yet.
Liam: I will follow my sister's lead. If she attacks one, I send one to another one and two to the third.
Laura: I'll attack the first so he can take the second.
Liam: One. Two, three.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: All righty.
Laura: These are auto-crits, though, because we are surprising them.
Matt: This is true.
Laura: Can I Hunter's Mark him?
Matt: Yes, you can Hunter's Mark him.
Laura: Oh, so we don't have to roll for attack? It's an auto-crit.
Matt: Well, no, you still have to roll to see if you aim. You have advantage on the attack.
Laura: 27.
Liam: 27 on my first.
Matt: Okay, both hit.
Laura: Second attack. Oh my god, 20. 20 on the second attack.
Matt: Okay, that hits.
Laura: I got a one on both. Thank god they were both at advantage.
Liam: 27. 19, 25.
Matt: Okay, all three hit.
Laura: And they're all critical?
Matt: No, the first one crits.
Liam: Oh, really? Okay. The first is sneak attack.
Matt: They're not all crit. Once you hit the person they are no longer surprised.
Laura: Okay, so the first one is a crit. Solid! That's okay.
Marisha: Yeah, I feel so bad for you.
Liam: You are the most powerful person at this table.
Laura: 14, plus six lightning damage. Oh wait, you know what? Should I single out the lightning damage or say what all the damage is?
Matt: Well, it's an auto-crit, so lightning damage is doubled, as well.
Laura: So it's 12 lightning damage.
Matt: Right, plus whatever your sneak attack damage is.
Laura: Okay.
Taliesin: Yeah, that's happening.
Travis: You already did 40 point of damage without doubling.
Laura: Don't do that.
Sam: Travis, shut up! These two and their gigantic damage rolls.
Taliesin: Huge, mammoth.
Sam: Huge, bulbous.
Taliesin: Turgid.
Laura: I had already rolled that, but it was a six again, so 40, plus 12 lightning damage. On the first.
Matt: 52 points of damage.
Liam: I got 48 on my first, but that's it. 48, done.
Laura: I didn't do Hunter's Mark damage on that first guy.
Matt: This is on the other guy; the second guy.
Laura: Add ten because of Hunter's Mark on the first one.
Marisha: Little bit of that reach around.
Sam: The dice smell a little bit.
Liam: 48. 20, ten.
Matt: So 48 on your critical.
Liam: That's the critical. That's the dice damage. I rolled really low.
Matt: 20, ten. Okay, then. All righty. Are you shooting the same guy, Laura?
Laura: Yes, I was all on one, unless he went down. Would I notice?
Matt: No, he did not go down.
Laura: Okay, then the second one. 21 on the second one.
Matt: That does it.
Travis: How much damage? Total.
Matt: Total on that round from you would have been 110 with the first hit between the two of you on the first guy and the second hit. So the one that was off to the side, who is leaning forward, hunched over, and looking over his shoulder. The first arrow goes into the throat and he reaches for it, and as he does, the dagger (impact) into the face, into the socket where there is no eye, which then looks up with a groan. Finger goes out as soon as the second arrow takes the other eye out, and then falls back down to the ground, dead. Pointing your direction like (gasping). As soon as the two other daggers go into the other two, they both see the one crumple to the ground, the two left there, the guy who is standing at the stairs--
Liam: May I also dump some poison?
Matt: Sure, into which one?
Liam: Into the first one. I did one into my first target and two into the second; the poison would have gone into the second person. It's a DC of 15.
Matt: All righty. DC of 15? Yeah, that succeeds. 16.
Liam: So nothing, right?
Matt: Nothing, yeah.
Liam: Balls!
Matt: As soon as the one crumples to the ground and the two other daggers into the other two that are there, they (grunt). They see the one fall. The one in the center of the chamber glances over his shoulder and says, "It seems I'm the lucky one. Odell, run back and tell that Viskorad found sneaky prey." The one immediately to the left begins to run up the stairs.
Laura: Can I shoot him again before he runs away?
Matt: Nope because you took your turn. This is their reaction.
Sam: Oh shit. You need help, Matt?
Liam: Initiative!
Matt: We're about to roll initiative, motherfuckers.
Laura: Sorry, guys. We did it.
Marisha: Viskon? We've heard the name Viskon before.
Sam: We've also heard the name Odell.
Liam: Yeah, Odell.
Marisha: Odell comma tell Viskon we have visitors. Wait, when did we hear Odell before?
Liam: I just know we've heard it.
Sam: There's been three Jamieson's in our campaign, too. Matt isn't an infinite fount of names.
Matt: Everyone else is still down the stairs right there.
Laura: I wonder if we should have let them talk for a second. Oh, well.
Liam: That's not our way.
Matt: Apparently not, as recent events have shown. So now, I need everyone to roll initiative.
Travis: Don't fuck me, Gil.
Laura: No, it's okay. I've got advantage.
Marisha: Don't let them leave. I agree with that.
Taliesin: Leave one of them alive, but don't let them leave.
Liam: Not good for Pike.
Marisha: Did everyone roll shittily?
Travis: No.
Matt: 25 to 20?
Laura: 23.
Travis: 21.
Liam: Get that long range. Get that runner.
Matt: 20 to 15?
Sam: 18.
Marisha: 15.
Matt: All righty.
Marisha: What's up, bro?
Liam: I'm not fast.
Taliesin: 13.
Liam: 13.
Travis: That's weird for you.
Taliesin: It's almost as low as I can go.
Matt: 13 for Pike? No, that's Vax. What's Pike?
Liam: Pike clocked in at four.
Matt: Pike is clocking in as Pike.
Liam: Yeah. Where's the remix of this song?
Taliesin: I know. (beatboxes)
Matt: All righty, so beginning of the round. Vex, you're up first.
Laura: Okay, I'm going to cast Grasping Vine around here, so he can lash up and try to catch that wizard, the cloaked guy that's running away.
Matt: What's he have to roll for that?
Laura: He has to roll a dexterity save above 15.
Marisha: Get it! Get it, son!
Matt: That's an eight. He is running up the stairs.
Laura: So it snatches his ankle.
Matt: And then drags him.
Laura: Backwards. Then I'm going to shoot him twice.
Matt: All right. Go for it.
Taliesin: Not that one. That one looks like he knows too much.
Laura: What is that? 32.
Matt: 32, that hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
Laura: 14, plus four lightning damage. I don't get sneak attack on this guy, though?
Matt: No.
Laura: Okay. 14, plus four lightning damage, and then I'm going to hit him again. That is also a 32. No, that's-- well, it's very high. 27? 28
Matt: 28. All right, that hits. Roll damage. Grog, you're up next. You're in the back of the marching order.
Travis: We're not up at the top, are we?
Matt: No. So you've got at least 25, 30 feet before you can get to the top there.
Laura: 12, plus six lightning damage.
Matt: Nice. All right, 36 points of damage in one round. The arrows (impact) as he is pulled through the rock and rubble by the Grasping Vine that is currently wrapped around him.
Laura: I am going to use my movement to stand behind this little pillar right here.
Matt: Okay, go for it. Grog, you're up.
Travis: As I hear the sweet melodical Miami Vice tunes of warfare being played, can I double dash up past my mates and into the fray?
Matt: Sure, so at 30 feet, it'll get you right at the edge of the stairs. Still have 20 more feet you can go.
Travis: Yeah, straight towards them.
Matt: All right, so that's there.
Travis: Then can I use dash to go the rest of the way?
Matt: To close the gap there? Sure.
Travis: Now, I only have my bonus action left, so can I go into a rage?
Matt: You may, yeah. All righty, so at that point you go into a rage.
Travis: That's my turn.
Matt: All righty, so now it is his turn.
Marisha: You have that guy? But this guy was the runner, I thought.
Taliesin: Yeah, but he's vined.
Marisha: Okay. He's currently grasped.
Matt: Okay, as soon as you rush up into his face, you hear the individual, the hood pulled back at this point. You see shaved entirely bald, older, late fifties to early sixties, missing one eye, but in that socket you can see a faint spark of arcane energy. Shouting out amongst the space, "Glory and reward is mine! Wraiths, go forth and devour, while I bring oblivion to them." As you rush up, is going to cast Wall of Force right in the space between there.
Marisha: Between him and Grog?
Laura: (singing) The space between.
Sam: (singing) Your wicked lies.
Matt: It pushes you back five feet, and now there is a Wall of Force that is blocking that side of the hallway from where he is.
Marisha: Him and the other guy? Or just between him? How big is it?
Matt: Sorry, the entirety of this chamber is the Wall of Force.
Marisha: Fucking fuckface.
Travis: What does Wall of Force do? Can I walk through that shit?
Marisha: Yeah, it just might hurt.
Travis: Will it?
Matt: As soon as the wall appears there, you see a slight short barrier that forces you back about five feet. You catch your back foot, and now as the barrier finishes shimmering, it's invisible. Looks like there's nothing there. He's grinning from there. He glances over to the right into the hole in the wall where his friend was earlier.
Travis: Which was that way, right?
Matt: As he glances over, he goes, "Odell, bring me the sphere." You hear the humming noise, the faint humming vibrational noise, now louder. That ends his turn. Actually, he is going to take a step back up onto the stairs there. Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: I'm up? What can I do?
Matt: You're 20 feet down from the staircase.
Sam: My speed is 25.
Matt: That'll get you right up to about there, with five-foot steps.
Marisha: Don't let them leave!
Sam: Oh god, this looks like a crazy thing.
Travis: (counting) 60 is how far away he is.
Sam: Wow. There's a Wall of Force. Do I see a Wall of Force?
Matt: You don't. You actually rush up, and it looks like it's an open hallway right now.
Sam: Okay. I see Grog in attack mode, right? I see these two bad guys. I will send a Lightning Bolt at somebody.
Matt: Which one?
Sam: Looks like I can't see this guy because there is a pillar in between, so the other guy.
Matt: That's true, so it'll be that guy. All right. You'll have to move off to the side, or else you're going to hit Grog with the Lightning Bolt. It's going to be hard. He's up a few steps, though. You could probably aim it above and hit him without Grog. I'll let you do that. As you get to the top, you release your bolt of lightning. (crackling noise) It arcs forward, and as it gets right above Grog, it hits something solid and splinters. No effect.
Liam: So this Wall of Force visually is floor to ceiling?
Matt: You don't know; you don't see it. He saw a faint shimmer because something pushed him out of this space, but right now you have no visual perspective. That's going to end Scanlan's turn, I believe. All right. The other guy, who is currently held by the vine that falls limp off of his body--
Laura: It falls limp off of his body?
Matt: Well, it doesn't wrap around or keep him held. Every turn, it can pull something towards it. He's going to glance over towards the side, listening to what the other, Viskorad, said. Okay. At which point, that humming gets louder and louder.
Taliesin: He had the map. If he built the map, there's a way out.
Matt: You watch as a two-foot-wide black sphere of void-like nothingness comes carving through the stone wall immediately to the left of you, Grog, leaving a completely disintegrated form roughly the shape of its sphere. It's coasting in towards and into your space.
Travis: It's a Sphere of Annihilation.
Liam: Yes, it is.
Taliesin: Oh shit, son!
Laura: Oh god!
Sam: Is someone controlling it?
Matt: So Grog, I need you to go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw.
Laura: Oh my god, roll so well! Do you get advantage?
Travis: I do. I have Danger Sense. It fucks you up. Yeah, it hurts real bad.
Sam: I see this happening, right?
Travis: 16.
Matt: 16, okay. You manage to duck out of the way as it enters the space, and you can feel this weird energy. Your beard is almost being pulled toward it, and the loud vibrating (vibration) hum before you. It's like staring into an absolute nothingness.
Travis: Take my life, but not my beard.
Marisha: Who looks like he's controlling it? Odell?
Matt: The guy who is being pulled by her is concentrating and moving it over, at that point.
Laura: Oh, the guy in red? The guy in red is controlling it!
Matt: All right. That's going to end his turn. Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: (yells)
Matt: I've got to rest for a second. Controlling enemies hurt. It's okay.
Sam: We can get dudes behind you to hold you up.
Matt: We'll see how I can do it. Keyleth, your turn.
Marisha: Oh my god. So much has changed from what I thought I was going to do.
Matt: You're about 25 feet down the staircase.
Marisha: Yeah. So I come up from the staircase.
Matt: Okay. That gets you up to the edge there, where the staircase stops.
Travis: Does the Sphere of Annihilation get an attack of opportunity if I run away?
Taliesin: Probably not.
Sam: Is it a thing? Is it a weapon?
Matt: It's a black sphere of void. One of the guys is looking focused, concentrating on it, and it moved under his willpower in the direction of Grog.
Travis: It's real bad.
Marisha: Okay. I'm going to come up. I'm trying to think of what I have in range, and I'm terrified. And I'm going to stick with my original instinct and do Wall of Stone and try and wall these guys in so they can't run. I think they can still carve through it with their big black death orb now.
Travis: They can, but at least they'll be here.
Taliesin: They'll have to move the orb to do that.
Marisha: Okay. I can do ten ten-foot by ten-foot panels, so I want to be a semicircle block off, bring up a whole wall of stone behind them.
Matt: Okay. Hold on a second.
Travis: Who can get to the other side? You have Dimension Door. But that's it, right? That's the only person that has that kind of a thing.
Matt: As you attempt to concentrate and create a Wall of Stone, you are unable to pick a point or an area beyond the barrier.
Travis: The Wall of Force? No!
Laura: Say it again?
Travis: And you need to focus, or is it a random?
Matt: It doesn't fizzle the spell. You have no area to release it on. The barrier, while invisible, is preventing targeting a specific area to create.
Taliesin: We need to dispel this shit.
Marisha: I do have Dispel Magic.
Matt: You've used your action to attempt it. You didn't lose the spell slot, but you spent your action attempting it.
Travis: Hey, man. That was a nice try.
Marisha: Can't cast through it.
Laura: Good to know. But the orb went through it?
Matt: No, the orb is on the other side.
Marisha: Even though it's a nature thing, going up underneath there, I can't get around it? No?
Matt: You're targeting on the other side of the wall. It has to be in visual range for you to create it to happen.
Marisha: (singing) I'll see you on the other side of the wall. (laughter)
Matt: All right. That's Keyleth's turn. No, sorry. At the end of Keyleth's turn, you hear this (breathy noise) sound as these two shadowy figures emerge from the nearby walls.
Liam: Ghosts! Shadows!
Travis: No. What? Ghosts or wraiths?
Marisha: Wraiths.
Liam: There's ten different kinds of things like that.
Marisha: Hey, was wraiths what fucked me and you up when we were evil Vax and Keyleth?
Taliesin: Oh shit, and look what they're doing!
Matt: This one hovers over and lands behind Keyleth. And it's going to attempt, as it seems to shift through the pillar--
Marisha: I look over my shoulder and go  Oh no!
Matt: This one here stays within the pillar, and it reaches out, as it's incorporeal, and strikes at you. That is 24 against you, Vex.
Laura: That hits.
Matt: All right. You suffer 21 points of necrotic damage, and I need you to succeed on a constitution saving throw.
Liam: Fuck! Come on.
Travis: My fucking god!
Sam: It's a 20? (screaming)
Matt: All right. Well, you suffer the 21 points of necrotic damage, and your maximum hit points are reduced by 21.
Laura: Forever?
Matt: Until you finish a long rest. The other one's striking at you, Keyleth. That is a 16.
Marisha: Misses!
Matt: That's right, because your AC is 17 with the ring.
Marisha: That's right! I leveled up, motherfuckers!
Matt: All right. Cool. Technically, leveling up didn't affect your AC; however, calculating the magic item did.
Marisha: But I feated, so I'm good!
Matt: I know. So as it swings toward you, its claw streaks out and has no effect. And then they both vanish. You want to take an attack of opportunity? You can if you'd like to.
Marisha: War Caster?
Matt: War Caster. You can attempt to cast a spell on it as a reaction, if you'd like. This one's going to back away into the wall, as well. Vex, you also get an attack of opportunity if you'd like, with a melee weapon.
Marisha: Does it have to be a bonus action?
Matt: No, it can be an action. That's part of the War Caster feat.
Laura: I have a dagger, but I don't even have it drawn.
Matt: Then yeah, you're fine.
Liam: They're both out of visual range, right?
Matt: They both are now backing up.
Liam: One's in a pillar, and one went through a wall. Are they moaning and shit, in the wall?
Matt: You can't hear them.
Liam: I can't hear them. Can't see them, can't hear them. All right. Thanks.
Matt: No worries.
Laura: I have resistance to necrotic damage, by the way.
Matt: You do! Then you take ten points of necrotic damage, and your hit points are only reduced by ten.
Laura: Okay.
Marisha: Sorry, I'm trying to figure out what would be a good idea right now.
Taliesin: I have no ideas for anything.
Marisha: I have never done this before, but I have it learned. I will Ice Knife it in its face. Ice Knife! Level one, you create a shard of ice, fling it at-- oh, it's a flingy-thingy. But it's 1d10 piercing damage, and then it explodes?
Matt: Okay. It's right next to you. She has the feat where she can cast the spell as a reaction when something comes at her. Just know that whatever you're hitting is right next to you. So if it explodes, does any radial damage, it might come back and hit you.
Marisha: No, hit or miss, the shard then explodes, the target and each creature within five feet of the point where the ice explodes. Oh. I'm fine. I'm doing it anyway.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and roll to hit.
Travis: And Scanlan's in five feet of her?
Laura: No, he's behind her.
Taliesin: Oh, for fuck sake.
Marisha: What's wrong with us?
Laura: Wasted all of our 20s on goods.
Matt: Tonight is ridiculous.
Marisha: One.
Matt: All right, so as you release the Ice Knife, it slams into the wall. No effect. However, it does still explode, right?
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: So it does what damage?
Marisha: 2d6.
Matt: 2d6 damage. So go ahead and roll 2d6. To both you and the creature?
Taliesin: Yeah, all creatures within range.
Marisha: Technically, reroll ones. Three, four, five, six, seven. Yeah, each creature. Hit or miss, the shard then explodes.
Matt: All right, so you take seven points of ice damage, and it hits the wraith. However, the cold damage doesn't seem to have as much of an effect as you would expect.
Laura: It's a fucking wraith!
Matt: That ends their turn. Percival, you're up.
Taliesin: I hear a whole bunch of commotion, so I'm going to pop my head up out of the hole and see what the fuck is going on.
Matt: All right. You glance up and get just beyond where Keyleth is, pushing past. You have five more feet you can move if you want.
Taliesin: Well, I'm coming up the hole. I take a look. Oh, sweet god. I'm going to take a shot at the guy I see up on the table there.
Matt: Okay, go for it.
Taliesin: That's better.
Matt: Which guy?
Taliesin: Yeah, the gray. And that's 28?
Matt: Okay. (gunshot) You fire a shot and watch as it detonates against some sort of invisible wall that you didn't see was there before, scattering helplessly against the space in the air.
Marisha: I hate this force field shit.
Travis: It explodes near my head, and I'm like Stop shooting into this thing!
Taliesin: I'm going to drop back down the hall.
Matt: All right, you get right back down to right there. That ends your turn, Percy? Vax, you're up.
Liam: Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to dance through to here, where I can see Grog and these guys, and I can see all my friends here, and I'm going to hold my action to attack anyone who comes right up to one of my friends within striking range.
Matt: Okay, good to know. Perfect. Ending Vax's turn, Pike's up.
Laura: Pike comes running up the steps.
Matt: She can get right up to here, and that's as much as she can move. She can still cast a spell if she wants to. She's going to cast Beacon of Hope for all of the allies within range, which is 30 feet.
Matt: All right, so that is everybody but Grog.
Laura: Sorry, Grog.
Travis: That's my fault.
Laura: That gives everybody advantage on wisdom saving throws and death saving throws, and any time you're healed, you regain the maximum number of hit points.
Sam: Even if we move out of the radius?
Matt: It affects everybody at that moment, and then you carry it with you.
Laura: Wisdom and death saving throws.
Liam: You got glitter-bombed with holy goodness.
Marisha: Wisdom and death plus what?
Laura: And full hit points when you get healed.
Taliesin: You don't roll; you get the max.
Marisha: Beautiful.
Matt: Okay. So ending Pike's turn brings us to the top. Vex, your turn.
Laura: Oh, great. Well, I've seen all the things explode. Fucking hell. I'm going to pull out my Vecna symbol, that necklace that we still had, and put it around my neck, because that fucking sphere is out and I don't know if it matters.
Matt: Okay, so you quickly throw it around your neck.
Laura: Do I still have control of the vine?
Matt: Currently, yeah.
Laura: Okay. And it's on the other side of the force?
Matt: This is true.
Laura: So I'm going to use it and I'm going to try to grab a hold of the guy-- the guy in gray is holding the force wall, right? But it probably is a concentration. The guy in red is holding the sphere.
Matt: Correct.
Laura: The guy in red is holding the sphere. I'm going to try to knock him down and see if I can break his hold on the sphere, maybe? Is that stupid?
Matt: He does not make his save. He isn't moved. It wraps around him and pulls him tight against the area where it is again, but it's barely shifted him, so he gets moved a few inches, but doesn't seem to affect him at all.
Laura: That's a bonus action. I still get an action.
Matt: Yep, and movement.
Laura: And movement. Oh god. I'm going to spread out. I'm going to come over here, maybe? Or here. Oh jeez. I don't know. I can't hit anybody! I'm going to wait. I'm going to hold my action until I see something getting through that fucking force wall.
Taliesin: Until there's something to hit.
Laura: So that I can attack him.
Matt: Sounds good. All right, Vex, that's the end of your turn. Grog, you're up.
Travis: I'm going to try and run through the Wall of Force. It's only five feet of my movement, and we'll see what happens.
Matt: All right, you slam face-first into a stone wall. Immediately, the anger fills through you, the familiar smell and taste of iron-like blood as you seem to have busted some element of your nose in the impact.
Travis: Probably some eyelids? Do I go anywhere? Not even an inch?
Matt: No.
Travis: What if I channel all the rage from my life, and I draw on the undead? Okay, cool. I'm going to turn around and run the other way.
Marisha: You didn't get through?
Travis: No, it didn't even give, apparently. (counting) 50, right there.
Matt: Okay. That ends your turn, Grog?
Travis: Yeah, that ends my turn.
Matt: This guy turns around and begins to make his way up the stairs and move double dash, and disappears up the stairs.
Marisha: (screams in frustration)
Travis: We can't do anything. Nobody knows Disintegrate or anything?
Marisha: Whose turn is it?
Matt: That finishes that guy's turn. It is now Scanlan's turn.
Sam: I'm going to take a few steps forward. I will inspire Grog, I guess.
Travis: Or yourself.
Sam: I'm okay.
Travis: Really? Okay.
Sam: I'll sing to him. (singing) Don't mess with that big black ball, it can really fuck you up. I really hate that big black ball, all it better do is miss you, make it miss you.
Matt: Oh my god, that was not my intent in creating this encounter. Take your d12 inspiration die.
Travis: Thank you.
Sam: And I guess I'll Dimension Door, try to go through the Wall of Force. We've tried this before, Matt. Who knows how this shit works?
Travis: And the previous ruling was it worked.
Sam: Yeah, but that could have been a gentle nod.
Matt: The wording is important on this.
Liam: I think the cultist shits his pants and his brain explodes. I think that's in the book.
Matt: I've had to look this up very carefully. With elements like this wall, it's a targeting thing. You cannot target something that is in full cover, total cover, which being behind a wall is. Teleportation, however, you're the target and Dimension Door and Teleport is unaffected by that.
Sam: Matt fucking hates this.
Marisha: Get the runner!
Sam: I don't know where the runner went.
Marisha: He went that way.
Sam: I don't see him, right?
Matt: You saw him run away, you just don't know where he is at the moment.
Sam: Can I gauge roughly how far he went down that hall? Do I see down the hall?
Matt: Not from where you were over there.
Sam: So I'm going next to the red guy.
Liam: Also, if you get out of range of Vex, Vecna knows all.
Laura: Oh yeah. Stay within 60 feet.
Matt: All right, so you Dimension Door there. That's your action.
Sam: That's my everything.
Marisha: We've got to take out these guys' eyeballs.
Matt: That's the end of your turn. At which point, Odell, who's standing there currently, is physically sweating, concentrating on this sphere right now. Looks over and sees you appear and goes, "Viskorad, the little one made it through!"
Sam: Who are you calling little?
Matt: At which point, you glance over your shoulder and you can see that the darting, cloaked one stops and spins and faces towards you.
Sam: That's not good for me, guys.
Marisha: It's not good for you, but it's good for us. Fuck them up!
Travis: Oh god.
Matt: That's as far as they can get. However, it completely disintegrates the central pillar. It is obliterated, like it lays with a top part and a bottom part, but wherever the sphere passes through, about a good six inches around it is turned to dust and is gone.
Laura: Oh my god, what if we fail these rolls?
Matt: He's then going to go back around--
Taliesin: No, he's grappled.
Liam: No, he's grappled.
Matt: No, it doesn't grapple. It just moves things toward it.
Marisha: You're confusing Entanglement with Grasping Vine. Two totally different things.
Matt: He's backing up, and he's looking over at the sphere, concentrating on it. You can see the beads of sweat pouring down his face, and he's glancing over nervously at you, but smiling at the idea that his friend is returning. That's going to end his turn. Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: Okay. Seeing Grog slam into that. Ugh, fuck. This is a pretty beefy spell, yeah? Force Wall? Should I do fifth or sixth level to dispel this? Okay. Fifth or sixth level? Sixth level. I'm going to Dispel Magic this wall.
Matt: Okay. As you focus and concentrate, you release the essence of the Dispel Magic, the burst of arcane energy casts forth, and falls harmlessly against the exterior.
Laura: It's a higher level.
Liam: It's a higher level.
Marisha: Higher than sixth level? The spell.
Matt: Didn't appear to have an effect on the wall.
Travis: Come on, maybe it needed to be something else.
Liam: No. He did what Scanlan does with Counterspell. He beefed it up.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: You can move.
Marisha: It's higher than seventh level? Did you have to roll?
Matt: No effect on it.
Taliesin: Okay, it's going to be okay. Everything's okay.
Liam: So about that long rest...
Marisha: I don't know now, you guys.
Laura: We're fucked.
Marisha: I move forward. I guess. I don't want to move that far forward. No, I don't move that far forward! (laughter)
Marisha: I don't want to die!
Matt: That finishes your turn, Keyleth?
Liam: (singing) I want you to be alive.
Liam: (singing) I want you to be alive.
Marisha: (singing) I want you to be alive.
Laura: Oh no, here they come.
Taliesin: Oh no, here they come.
Matt: They take minor damage being in the physical wall, but that's fine with them.
Liam: Boom, I attack! Sneak attack on the one near Keyleth.
Matt: Emerge. All right, so the one near Keyleth. Go for it.
Laura: What was I holding for? I was holding until I could attack something, or until I could get through the wall? I think it was through the wall.
Matt: The wall.
Liam: All right, 27 on that guy.
Matt: That hits.
Liam: Okay. So that is three, plus three is six, so ten. (counting)
Taliesin: If we can hit them, they're probably squishy.
Matt: You took out one of three between just two of your surprise attacks.
Liam: 34 for the first hit, and I have the second paladin attack, so if it's not dead, I will attack again.
Matt: Go for it.
Liam: That is eight for the second.
Matt: As it emerges from the wall, its blackened shadow form giving off small tendrils of dark black ether and abyssal energy, it reaches out to strike at Keyleth, and you immediately release two daggers in its direction. Both hit its form. It gives this pained sucking sound as you watch its beady, burning red eyes seem to blink in the pain, and it angrily lashes out at Keyleth, its form somewhat more disparate and unable to maintain a corporeal form.
Liam: When is Pike? Is it her turn? No? Okay.
Matt: No, she cast Beacon of Hope. So attacking against Pike. That is 21. What's her AC?
Laura: 23!
Matt: 23. It tries to strike at her, and she manages to take the shield and bash it away. The light from her mace arcing around causes it to flinch, and it actually strikes a little too wide. The one that's arcing towards you, Keyleth, that is fucking 16 again! Yeah, because it's plus six to hit. Okay. You dodge out of the way a second time. It's then going to move back into the wall over here. He's going to move back into the wall, as well. Both of you get reactions.
Laura: Pike definitely takes it. With her Mace of Disruption, she gets an extra 2d6 radiant damage.
Matt: All right, so roll an attack on that one.
Laura: That's a 21 to hit.
Matt: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
Travis: I am wickedly out of my element. I'm running from an 8-ball.
Taliesin: We've got to get everyone away from that thing.
Laura: 27 for Pike.
Matt: 27 points of damage?
Laura: Is it a fiend or an undead? So it has to have a wisdom save of 15.
Matt: If it has 25 hit points or fewer after taking the damage, which it does not. That one has not taken a whole bunch of damage. However, it did take a relatively decent hit, and you watch as she swings the mace out. As it pulls back, where the mace impacts, it seems to almost evaporate part of the shadowed form, and it shrieks as it disappears into the wall.
Liam: For clarification, that is the one I hit, as well, right?
Matt: No, the one that you hit is where she was.
Liam: Oh, Pike hit the other one.
Matt: Correct. Keyleth, are you doing anything as a reaction?
Marisha: Yeah, I'm going to pull out my staff and do a Burning Hands on him. Dexterity saving throw.
Matt: Natural 20, so it takes half damage.
Marisha: Half damage.
Laura: Ooh, that's good. You did the six and the four.
Taliesin: And then there was a third one.
Marisha: And then there's a third one that is a six? Was that right? Six and six is 12, so 16.
Matt: 16 points of fire damage reduced by half which is eight, and even that impact seems to be lessened by the wraith-like being seemingly absorbing some of the heat from the impact.
Laura: Radiant damage is the bomb!
Taliesin: Radiant damage is what we need in here.
Matt: All righty, that ends their turn. Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: I'm going to stay in my little cubby hole. I've got some good visual on a couple of these guys down here. I'm going to yell at everybody to get the fuck away from the ball. I'm going to hold my attack until something happens that's going to give me something to shoot at.
Matt: Okay, so as soon as an enemy reveals itself that you can shoot. Okay, that ends Percy's turn. Vax, you're up.
Liam: Fucking hell. I'm going to do the same thing except I'm going to move to here and wait for something to attack one of my friends.
Taliesin: That's awfully close to the ball.
Liam: I know it is. That's what I do. I'm waiting until one of them attacks one of my friends. One of the undead. I can't do anything about that. That's what I'm doing. That's my turn.
Matt: All right, Pike's turn.
Liam: Stupid, I know. That's what Vax does.
Laura: I can only do this as a bonus action so that she can have that up, right? Okay, she's going to cast Spiritual Weapon. Should she do it at a second level? Okay, she's going to cast Spiritual Weapon up near the wall as a giant sword that looks like it's on fire.
Matt: Whereabouts? On the wall here?
Laura: No, near the wall, yeah. Up close to the wall so that she can attack as soon as that thing is down. And then she's going to hold her physical action until there's something that she can attack.
Matt: Okay, she's holding her physical attack?
Laura: Yeah, her mace.
Matt: Okay, that ends Pikes turn. Vex, you're up.
Laura: Oh, that's me!
Matt: Yeah, that's you, actually.
Liam: You're Vex.
Laura: I'm Vex. I'm going to dart away from this ball as fast as I can, and I'm going to come up here.
Sam: Hey, you broke through!
Laura: I broke through the wall. I can't reach. I'm too fucking-- It's fine; I got it.
Sam: Make Matt stand up, Laura.
Matt: Please do. I appreciate it.
Laura: And I'm going to hold my fucking attack until something comes out that I can attack.
Matt: Okay. All righty.
Marisha: I can't believe I couldn't fucking dispel that wall.
Matt: Grog, you're up.
Travis: Yeah, I am, aren't I? Okay. Cool.
Laura: Wait, I have bonus action still.
Matt: You do.
Laura: Okay, I'm going to use that Grasping Vine that I still have up, and I'm going to re-grab onto that stupid guy's fucking neck and yank him towards the wall he's right in front of.
Matt: That's a 15. What's your DC on that?
Laura: 15.
Matt: He succeeds, unfortunately. It slaps out towards him and this time-- I forget the adage, but never mind. He dodges it. (laughter)
Liam: It took 425 hours, but we did it. We broke his brain.
Matt: Blame it on the painkillers. The vine whooshes out and tries to wrap around him. He dodges out of the way, and it slaps harmlessly against the stone and withdraws back into the small crack of stone where it's based. That ends your turn. All right, Grog.
Travis: I'm going to put my faith in Scanlan that some sort of impossible miracle happens. (counting) 30. Right up against the wall. Can I look to the left down that hallway? Can I see down there at all? Is it blocking the hallway off from vision? Is that a moveable space?
Matt: Looking off, it looks like the orb was being used to carve a path.
Travis: It hadn't finished doing it?
Matt: No. It was maybe 25 or so feet down and was hitting solid rock.
Laura: My spell DC may be higher. I don't know if I have increased that in a while.
Liam: It's eight, plus proficiency bonus, plus her spell bonus.
Laura: So my spell DC is 17.
Matt: You need to keep up on that, girl.
Marisha: That was how I lost to Grog in our battle.
Laura: I wanted it around his neck, just to make him annoyed.
Matt: It hits him against the wall. He's still glancing over his shoulder.
Taliesin: He's lost visual range of the ball?
Matt: No, he can still look over the rubble there.
Travis: Not enough to make a concentration check?
Matt: If that's what it does.
Travis: I'm there. I can't get into that hole anymore, can I?
Matt: Not with the way the Wall of Force is placed, no.
Travis: Fair enough. I will hold my action until someone comes within melee distance.
Matt: Okay, ending Grog's turn. At the top of the staircase--
Laura: Oh no! He's coming back for Scanlan!
Matt: This guy here, we'll say he got about that far from the stairs and continues that way.
Marisha: Sanctuary!
Taliesin: Like he's parting the Red Sea.
Taliesin: You shall not pass!
Marisha: You shall not pass!
Laura: Oh my god, we're going against Gandalf right now, you guys.
Taliesin: That's not Gandalf. That's a cosplayer.
Liam: Do you know many hobbits I have under my cloak?
Taliesin: Five hobbits in a cloak. That's all it is. It's not a wizard.
Matt: He glances down at the staircase where you are, and as he begins to smile, the flash in the eye begins to glow briefly, a pale comparison to Vecna, but there is an essence of energy lent to him from his worship of the newly risen deity. He begins to speak in a language you don't understand. And as he speaks one alien word-- how many hit points do you have?
Sam: A lot. 167.
Matt: Fuck, okay. I miscalculated. No effect.
Sam: Power Word?
Matt: Power Word  Stun. He assumed the smaller stature of the gnome was not as hearty.
Travis: He's upset that he miscalculated. The DM wants blood!
Liam: That's what he gets for profiling.
Matt: He's going to continue moving upward, 30 feet back up into the staircase as he keeps focusing on you. That's going to end his turn. You're up, Scanlan.
Sam: Hold on. I need to look up the range of a fucking spell. How far is he from me?
Matt: It's hard to tell at this point. You'd say somewhere between 50, 60, 70 feet.
Liam: I bet your spell is 120 feet, Sam.
Sam: I'm looking. That one's not.
Liam: Is it Thaumaturgy? Because that's right where your eyes are.
Sam: You said how far? Oh shit.
Matt: Between 50 and 70 feet from you.
Laura: You can move.
Liam: You can move.
Sam: Yeah, I'm going to move 25 feet towards him.
Matt: Okay, so that puts you up here.
Sam: And with my darkvision, do I get a sense for how far he is from me now?
Matt: Yeah, you'd say he's about 40 feet from you.
Sam: Fuck no, it's not. Shit, I need 30.
Laura: You can move five more feet. You've got more movement.
Sam: No. That's my movement. I have tiny little nubs.
Travis: Tiny little nubs?
Sam: Yeah.
Liam: What about long-range shit, man?
Sam: That's okay. Yeah, I've got longer-range shit, but it's not as bad news.
Marisha: Keep them from running away.
Travis: Damn it, Matt. Why'd you have to back up?
Matt: Because that tactically made sense.
Liam: Bigby's Hand him? Grab him?
Sam: I'm thinking. I'm trying to decide between two things.
Travis: Yeah, do it. Take your time, baby. Take your time. Taliesin, give him a backrub. Come on, let's focus up here. There you go. Support. Feel the love.
Marisha: This is all on you, man. This is all on you.
Travis: Do your thing. Listen, Shadow of War comes out October 10th. A lot of us are in it.
Sam: It's going to have a lot of wisdom. All right. I will Bigby's Hand. I assume he's got a lot of wisdom, so I will Bigby's Hand him. At level seven. And I will punch the shit out of him.
Laura: Punch him back toward us. Bigby's Hand on the opposite side of him and punch him back toward us.
Marisha: That's a good call.
Matt: All right, so that is 8d8 force damage if you hit. Roll a melee spell attack.
Laura: Inspire yourself!
Taliesin: Inspire yourself!
Sam: I didn't. I forgot. I rolled an 18.
Matt: 18 hits. He's a caster; he doesn't have a lot of armor.
Marisha: Kill him!
Matt: All right, so roll 8d8 force damage.
Taliesin: I have three.
Sam: And I've got one.
Liam: That's just some dude from Sea Org in a bathrobe. Punch him!
Taliesin: Wow, that was a deep cut.
Sam: Wait. Shit. What did I just roll? 16 plus four. That's 20. And then this is another-- 40.
Matt: 40 points of force damage.
Sam: 40 points of force damage.
Matt: All right, that's a 20 DC concentration check.
Sam: Yeah.
Travis: Come on.
Matt: 16. No.
All: Wall down!
Laura: Did we notice? Did we notice that the wall went down?
Matt: No, you don't see it.
Sam: I don't know. Right?
Matt: But Grog would feel it. Grog is sitting there waiting for something, as Bigby's Hand full-on sucker punches him in the body, and he slams against the steps and has to shake his head as he glances at the giant fist and down at you.
Sam: As a bonus action, can I do anything?
Matt: If you want to do a bonus action, you can't do Bigby's Hand again.
Sam: No, but can I throw something to see if it goes through the wall?
Matt: Sure. I'll let you do that. Roll an attack roll, just to aim it.
Sam: Sure. 17, plus I don't know.
Matt: What are you throwing?
Sam: Scanlan found these two really crappy daggers in the desk in the casino.
Matt: He pulls one of these jeweled daggers that he wore and throws it behind, and Grog, you watch as this dagger passes through.
Taliesin: I see that, and I take three shots at this fucker up here immediately. How far away is he?
Matt: Which guy? The who Bigby's Hand just punched? Okay, he is about 120 feet.
Taliesin: I'm going to use Bad News, then, because that is within range for my fucking sniper rifle. He's going to take that.
Laura: I'm going to shoot at the dude in red in front of me.
Taliesin: I can't use a bonus action, and I have to reload once, so I can only take two shots with my action. I can't take three. So two shots with Bad News. Here we go. That's a 25 and 27 to hit.
Matt: Both hit.
Taliesin: First shot is 22 points of damage. Second shot is not as good. 14 points of damage.
Matt: So as you fire those two shots, the echoing noise of Bad News's explosions echoes through the hallway and stairway above. Vex.
Laura: I'm going to sharpshooter him, the guy right in front of me.
Taliesin: There's a lot of noises going on in this place. I think it'll be okay.
Marisha: Oh, it's fine. There are tunnels collapsing and shit. It's fine. I'm not concerned about the noise at the moment.
Laura: 22 to hit?
Matt: 22 does hit.
Laura: 21 damage on the first. And then 19 on the second. That's also Sharpshooter.
Matt: Nice.
Laura: No, that's 19 to hit.
Matt: Gotcha. That hits.
Laura: 27 on the second.
Matt: All right, nice. The guy who's controlling the sphere, after the first arrow strikes him right in the chest, he looks and starts to run up the stairway, and as it does, you take aim with your second arrow and release it, and it hits the base of the skull. You watch him go down one of the stairs.
Taliesin: So the sphere is still there?
Matt: The sphere is still there.
Laura: But he doesn't have control over it anymore. This guy in red is down, so all that's left is the guy and the wraiths?
Taliesin: Was there a third guy?
Laura: We killed him. That was the first guy we killed.
Matt: That finishes Scanlan's turn, right?
Laura: Yeah, that was your turn.
Sam: Yeah, I'm done.
Matt: Keyleth's turn.
Marisha: Okay. I run up as far as I can, 30 feet. Do I see this motherfucker?
Matt: Yeah, you see him. You have a 60-foot range of darkvision?
Marisha: Or I see the glimmering of Bigby's Hand?
Matt: Yeah, I'd say you could probably see him okay. A little bit. It's very dark, but barely.
Marisha: Fireball! (laughter)
Taliesin: That's an answer.
Matt: As you rush up, from the edge of the staff, a bead of red light engulfs the hallway above in flames. You see a split second of him and Bigby's Hand's outlines before fire engulfs the space. Go ahead and roll damage on that. That's a natural 20 on his save, so he gets half damage.
Marisha: What the fuckballs?
Matt: I didn't even roll with advantage on that one.
Sam: You said Fireball on this guy? Bigby's Hand takes damage.
Marisha: Does he? Magical?
Sam: Yeah, he has hit points.
Taliesin: He could roll a save, though.
Sam: He could!
Matt: Let's check. Yep, it has no bonus, so you roll a d20 and see what you get.
Sam: 11.
Marisha: 29 points of damage.
Sam: It's fine. Bigby's Hand has 167 hit points.
Matt: Yeah, it has your hit points.
Laura: That's amazing!
Sam: Yeah, it's me.
Matt: That ends Keyleth's turn. He's still alive. This one's going to move through the hallway here.
Marisha: He's still going after my ass?
Matt: This one's going after Pike.
Liam: I get to attack. I've been holding.
Laura: Pike gets to attack. Pike has been holding her action to attack as soon as she could, too.
Matt: So Pike gets her attack, and so do you.
Laura: So 20 to hit on Pike.
Matt: 20 to hit? That hits.
Laura: Where is my other d8? Here it is. (counting)
Liam: When you hold, does bonus action carry over?
Matt: Nope, just the action.
Laura: So it's 22.
Matt: 22. All right. And what's the saving throw?
Laura: Saving throw is 15.
Matt: 15. Four, no. As it comes out of the wall reaching for Pike, she swings wide with the mace. As it slams into it, there's a flash of divine energy. Her eyes seem to pulse with a matching burst of radiant power, and as it hits, the creature squeals and squeaks as the light from the mace actually dashes it from this existence or any other. That is scattered into nothing from the shadows.
Liam: I rolled an 18 and a one.
Matt: 18 hits. One misses.
Liam: Okay, so sneak attack. One.
Sam: One misses?
Laura: I know, right?
Liam: 39 for the second attack.
Matt: 39 for the second attack. All righty. And with that, as this one reaches out towards Keyleth, your dagger strikes the back of its body, and as it impacts, you watch as its shadowed form turns into nothing but a splash of dark, half-existing ether, which then fades as your dagger clatters to the ground motionless.
Liam: Back to the belt.
Matt: All right. Percival, you're up.
Laura: Kill him!
Taliesin: Reload. Going to take another shot.
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: Going to take a shot. Yeah, let's take another shot. Probably got a low AC. Let's make this a sharpshooter, just for fun. Yeah. That's a sharpshooter shot, so that's a 24 to hit?
Matt: 24 hits.
Taliesin: All right. So let's do (counting) 26 points of damage.
Matt: 26 points of damage. (gunshot) The echo of the impact as you watch part of the lower jaw and throat of the cultist in the robe gets blown apart. He stumbles back onto the steps that he had barely started to get up off to and you watch and you hear the horrible coughing sound as his last moments of life are robbed of it as it tries to get back up and then stumbles right back and bleeds out against the steps.
Taliesin: We can still interrogate him. He doesn't have to be alive for that. Any other problems?
Liam: How's the ball doing?
Matt: It's hovering there in the center of the hall.
Laura: We can't do anything about that floating ball. Cover it with a handkerchief.
Marisha: You beat me to it, man.
Taliesin: Let's rifle through these guys' stuff. Which one do we want to interrogate?
Marisha: Keyleth goes up to the red robe.
Taliesin: Let's throw gray robe into the annihilation ball. Let's get rid of him.
Travis: Vax. Why don't you go down the hallway and see if anyone else is coming? Keep watch.
Laura: But stay within 60 feet. Everybody gather up around me again.
Liam: Sis, come up to where Scanlan is so I can go a little further ahead.
Matt: Everyone is barely still within 60 feet.
Taliesin: Everyone gather up. We're going to get our stuff.
Laura: Avoid the ball.
Marisha: Vax, can I borrow a dagger?
Liam: Yeah. I give her Whisper.
Marisha: I take it and I stab it in his other eye. Red robe guy.
Matt: Okay. (splat) Other eye is destroyed.
Sam: I'm going to use Bigby's Hand to grab the sphere.
Matt: Do you? Okay. Bigby's Hand reaches over and grabs towards the sphere, and as Bigby's form attempts to grasp the chaotic point of destructive energy, Bigby's Hand suffers 26 points of force damage and is forced to pull back.
Sam: That's not so bad.
Matt: But cannot grasp it. Cannot move it. (electrical shock)
Laura: I'm going to rifle through the robes of red robe.
Taliesin: I'm going to get Odell.
Matt: That's the one she's rifling through.
Taliesin: Oh, okay. There was a third guy, right, that they killed early on?
Matt: Oh, the first guy. Yeah. Okay, gotcha.
Taliesin: Assume we're going through everybody and taking their shit.
Liam: I'm standing as far from Vex as I can, but I can't go much farther because obviously-- yeah.
Matt: Okay. Interestingly enough, based on the current scenario and what preparation has been, no money on them. They have no worldly possessions that are what you consider of use. They each carry a gnarled wooden wand that they've been using as a focus for their spellcasting. Beyond that, they have nothing on them except for the one that you shot has, you notice the left hand is withered and gray, the skin is pulled taut against the bone. But beyond that, there is no other possessions on them, beyond the symbol of Vecna they wear around their throat.
Marisha: How many of those symbols do we still have, and how many robes do we still have?
Laura: Well, we can grab their robes, I don't know how many of those we have, but I think we also have a necklace.
Liam: Also, we can have Pickle talk to one of these arseholes.
Taliesin: I think that's a good idea.
Marisha: The guy that I'm standing over, red robe, I'm going to rip his necklace off.
Matt: Okay. You tear it off.
Laura: I'm going to take his robes.
Taliesin: Oh yeah, we're taking all this shit.
Matt: So you take every set of robes. And these robes are different from the robes that you had seen in Thar Amphala before. These appear to be a little more ornate. They seem to have a little higher station, which is why it's interesting that beyond the robes and some basic undergarments and the wand, they have nothing on them. They are a sheer conduit of their own power.
Taliesin: Were they drilling? I want to take a little bit of an inspection. Were they drilling with this thing? Is that why they had it?
Matt: Looking around the pathway, you can see that a lot of the staircase probably was more caved in, but has been cleared out by the movement of this orb. It's being used as a form of excavation tool as they push deeper into the catacombs here.
Marisha: So they were holding on to that orb the whole time.
Laura: Yeah, the guy in the red was controlling it.
Marisha: Yeah. He didn't cast it, though. We didn't see him cast that.
Laura: It came out of the wall.
Matt: Yeah, it came out of that little gap on the side there.
Sam: I'm going to go over to the sphere and say to it: I command thee to respect my authority and obey me as your new master.
Matt: Are you trying to exert your will on the sphere?
Sam: I'm intimidating the sphere.
Matt: Make an intelligence arcana check.
Sam: Intelligence arcana check?
Matt: Just an arcana check.
Sam: Oh! 19.
Matt: 19? And you're standing right next to the sphere to push your will into it?
Sam: Yeah, I came closer to it.
Matt: Okay. As you stand there, you focus on the orb, and you can feel your will push past the event horizon of the sphere. However, the force is too strong inside, and as you pull out of it instinctually, it moves towards you. (screaming)
Taliesin: Why did you have to tamper with the fundamental forces of nature?
Matt: Yeah. Ten feet. Which is right where you are, so I need you to make a dexterity saving throw.
Liam: Matthew McConaughey is going to reach out of it for you.
Sam: That's not good. 11.
Matt: 11?
Sam: Bigby, save me!
Matt: The orb pulls back and slams into the edge of his gnomish face and chest, and you watch as his flesh is pulled towards and disintegrated at the exterior of the sphere.
Laura: Can we reach down and grab him away from it?
Marisha: Yeah, Grasping Vine!
Matt: You take 30 points of force damage, and it's currently now right in your square, right up against you.
Laura: I use my Grasping Vine and I yank him away from it.
Marisha: Yeah, move away!
Matt: Okay. So you all push him out of the way and the vine pulls him.
Travis: Two-Face!
Matt: Yeah, you look a little rough.
Laura: Scanlan, you're hideous now.
Sam: Don't look at me! I'm fine.
Travis: Some other voice starts coming out of him.
Sam: I think I can take this thing.
Liam: "So did you want me to talk to one of these guys?"
Matt: You got the sense that there is a way to exert your will over it the way these guys did, but in that moment, your will faltered, and you didn't quite understand the nature of the sphere.
Sam: I just need to try again harder.
Marisha: Wait!
Laura: You got to roll higher than a 19. Can you give yourself inspiration?
Sam: This is an ability check, right?
Matt: This is an ability check, yes.
Taliesin: Wait, was that a wisdom saving throw?
Matt: No. It was an arcana check.
Travis: It might be high, dude. You might have to roll a 30.
Taliesin: Let's leave it. Tend to the sick and leave the well alone.
Travis: Indiana? Let it go.
Laura: Or Dominate that shit.
Sam: I'll try one more time.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: All right. Let's all back up.
Laura: I get ready with the vine to yank him away in case it starts moving toward him.
Matt: Okay. And everyone else backs up a little.
Marisha: Keyleth stares with a vague familiarity.
Sam: I'm going to inspire myself.
Matt: Okay. So make your roll first, as you begin to focus and exert your will towards it. You add it on to it.
Sam: Pretty good.
Laura: Now inspire!
Sam: And inspire?
Matt: Up to you.
Sam: Okay. Plus my what? Arcana?!
Matt: Yes.
Sam: Ooh, that's a lot. 30.
Matt: Okay. As you this time begin to push your will towards the sphere, you push past the event horizon, your consciousness connects with some--
Sam: (garbled) Listen to me, damn it! Respect my authority!
Matt: Some ancient space of the void within this blackened circle. As it connects-- What's your intelligence modifier?
Sam: Plus three.
Matt: Okay. What are you trying to will it to do?
Sam: I'm trying to will it to-- Shit, it's just a big black ball. Slam straight into the ceiling!
Matt: It moves up ten feet and then it hits, devours the stone above it to create this small tunnel right directly above.
Laura: Oh my god! You did it.
Sam: We can use it!
Taliesin: Finally.
Sam: Have you guys seen The Explorers?
Taliesin: I'm in The Explorers, motherfucker. I'm in The Explorers.
Sam: You are?! That's one of my favorite movies of all time! Can I get your autograph?
Taliesin: No.
Liam: Were you kidding? Are you really in The Explorers?
Taliesin: Yes! I'm really in The Explorers.
Liam: Stop the game!
Taliesin: I'm one of River's little brothers. I'm Ludwig.
Sam: Oh, wow!
Marisha: Yeah, he knew River through that.
Laura: What if we use the orb and go straight up? We don't even keep tunneling, we juat go straight up to the city.
Sam: It only listens to me.
Laura: Yeah. Do you need us to heal you or anything?
Sam: No, this is a cool thing.
Travis: Yeah, but it only makes a hole its size. It's two feet across.
Taliesin: I think he's not ready to pop a wheelie on this thing yet.
Travis: Plus, remember the guy was concentrating super hard, so it's the only thing Scanlan will probably be able to do.
Marisha: But if he cores out a tunnel for us, we can carry Scanlan like on a palanquin? Like We Are The Champions?
Sam: Guys, I think we can make it. No, we can't! We'll never make it! Yes, we can!
Liam: All I'm thinking is I could come up and do Lay on Hands and heals, but I'm like, you made your bed, lie in it.
Taliesin: Yeah, no. I'm okay with this.
Laura: What do you think? Do you want to go up?
Sam: We're still investigating these guys and stuff.
Marisha: Fuck these guys! We got all their shit. Let's go!
Sam: I'm going to call this ball Simon 3.
Travis: Do we know how far the sphere can move in a single movement?
Matt: You watched him push it, and it went about 15 feet.
Travis: The sphere can only move 15 feet.
Sam: It will slow us down.
Matt: It's a very slow-moving ball of destruction.
Taliesin: Bring the sphere back down so that we can throw their bodies into the sphere so that they don't turn into undead fuckwads.
Liam: Wait a second, though! God, I don't know what this will do. I have a spell called Zone of Truth.
Laura: So it forces them to speak the truth? Does it work on undead?
Liam: A creature that enters the spell's area for the first time. If it fails.
Laura: So you could cast it, and then Pike could cast Speak with Dead, and it would come up into the Zone of Truth.
Liam: That's right.
Travis: No, they have to tell the truth when you do Speak with Dead.
Liam: No, they don't.
Matt: They don't have to.
Marisha: They can lie.
Taliesin: Here's a weird question  what saving throw do they have to make to speak the truth?
Liam: An affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. So it could avoid the questions.
Laura: But they have to answer the questions.
Liam: But they have to answer the questions because of the other spell.
Laura: Right?
Sam: Double mumbo-jumbo?
Matt: It can't tell a lie, as you're discussing this. Technically, a creature would be unable to lie in the area.
Liam: Unable to lie, and with Pike's spell--
Laura: They have to answer the question.
Liam: They have to answer the question.
Matt: Let me double-check for you.
Taliesin: And what's the save?
Liam: Charisma saving throw against my spell save DC, which is not huge.
Marisha: What is it?
Liam: 16.
Matt: I mean, it does have to answer.
Liam: I like it.
Taliesin: Are we going to try this crazy shit?
Laura: Let's do it!
Marisha: Might as well. Okay, hang on, though! What are we going to get from this guy?
Laura: Find out how close we are to Vasselheim.
Taliesin: Yeah, what's the plan? What are they trying to do?
Liam: What has Vecna got cooking?
Taliesin: What's Vecna planning? How many of them are there?
Marisha: I'm going to go pee, you guys.
Liam: He might not know everything. How long does it take for Keyleth to pee?
Laura: No, but how close we are to Vasselheim? What's the plan of attack in Vasselheim? How big is his army? We get five questions, I think, with Speak with Dead.
Taliesin: Five?
Sam: How close are we? What's his plan? Where is he?
Laura: Where is Vecna within the city?
Sam: Who's with him?
Laura: Who's the death knight?
Taliesin: He might not know that. But what are they excavating for? What are they looking for?
Travis: I think I know that.
Taliesin: I think I know, too, but I want to hear him say it. It'd make me feel better.
Laura: Let's do it! Cast your Zone, yo!
Taliesin: Get in the zone.
Laura: (singing) Autozone!
Matt: (chuckling) Autozone of Truth?
Liam: Shit. So can anyone drag him down on his roll to save, or boost me?
Taliesin: No. Not me.
Laura: I don't think so.
Liam: Does anyone have a cantrip? Okay. All right. Let's do it.
Matt: All right. So which one?
Liam: Well, first Zone of Truth, then Pike.
Matt: Okay. So you create the Zone of Truth, you create the area, the radial space where the divine energy kicks in and the compulsion to not lie remains within. And then Pike--
Laura: Casts Speak with Dead.
Matt: On which corpse? There are three corpses.
Liam: Red robe seemed more fancy.
Sam: Who seemed more senior?
Liam: Red robe did.
Matt: There are three, technically.
Sam: There was the guy they killed right when they burst on the scene.
Taliesin: We'll take the fanciest cloak.
Matt: Okay. It's relative, but the guy who was controlling the sphere seemed to be at least different.
Laura: He had a different color. Yeah, red robe.
Matt: All right. So as Pike takes the time to focus and recite the incantation, she grabs her holy symbol and focuses and speaks aloud the words in Celestial of the blessing of Sarenrae. And as she completes the ritual, she suddenly screams out in pain and grabs at her head and falls to her knees. No effect. And she suffers--
Laura: Oh no! What did he do to Pike?
Travis: Oh shit.
Matt: On 6d6, I rolled four sixes and a five. That's 31 points of psychic damage to Pike.
Liam: She tried to cast Speak with Dead Dumbfuck.
Matt: She's shaking and grabbing her face and rubbing her eyes, and it takes her a moment to come back to you and she looks around, and you can see a faint bit of blood slightly dripping out of the corner of her eyes. She's like, "All I heard was laughter."
Sam: Laughter?
Laura: And you said it was minus 36 damage?
Matt: 31.
Liam: Vecna is in these motherfuckers' brains.
Marisha: Everyone looks upset.
Laura: Pike got psychic damage from that dude.
Marisha: How much? A lot?
Laura: 31 points of psychic damage.
Marisha: Oh, that's a lot, yeah.
Taliesin: Burn the bodies. Fuck it.
Marisha: Throw them down the well.
Taliesin: Throw them into the sphere.
Marisha: Oh yeah!
Sam: Sphere! Do your worst.
Matt: One by one, you grab and take the corpses and thrust them towards the sphere, as they immediately crumple, fold and get pulled in, turned to nothingness, disappearing into the black void. There are elements of the way the sphere acts and manipulates things that remind you of the siphons, though differently. It's more violent in some ways, and it is its own contained magical entity. With each body, it vanishes in the sphere, and you all sit there for a moment taking a breath and deciding the next order of business in traversing the insides of this titan. And that's where we'll end tonight's game, because it's 11:30.
Marisha: I feel like I always come back from the bathroom right as we're ending games.
Sam: First of all, it's so great to be back!
Taliesin: It's so nice to be back.
Sam: Matt, thank god you're totally 100 percent healed and all better again.
Matt: It's great. Sorry. But yeah, missed you guys. We'll be back next week, pick up from here, see as the final charge gets closer and closer. What will you guys do next time? In the meantime, rest well, don't forget, if you can, to give to the Red Cross to help support the victims of recent hurricane battering in the US.
Laura: Look for Shadow of War.
Matt: Shadow of War coming out on October 10th.
Marisha: Our comic on Wednesday.
Matt: Yep, look for that. And we'll see you guys soon. Have a wonderful week, we love you, and: Is it Thursday yet? Good night. [music]
